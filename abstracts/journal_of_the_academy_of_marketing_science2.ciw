AB This issue marks the beginning of the 40th volume of the Journal of the
   Academy of Marketing Science. The thicker-than-usual issue is designated
   as the 40th Anniversary Issue of the Journal. To commemorate the
   Journal's anniversary, the collection of cutting-edge and innovative
   research articles in this issue addresses all of the broad topics in
   marketing (i.e., marketing strategy, consumer behavior, modeling, public
   policy, and methods/methodology) to exemplify the breadth of the
   Journal's scope. In this spirit, our introduction to the 40th
   Anniversary Issue briefly provides (1) an overview of JAMS and some
   tidbits about the Journal, (2) a section on the impact of JAMS, (3) a
   description of the 11 articles in the issue, and (4) some concluding
   thoughts. Overall, JAMS has had remarkable impact in the field of
   marketing for four decades, escalating in the last two decades to become
   a top tier journal for the marketing professorate. By some accounts,
   some 500 of the roughly 1,500 JAMS articles published to date have made
   a remarkably high impact in the field of marketing (and social
   sciences). The incredible slate of authors contributing to the
   Anniversary Issue is a testament to the Journal's standing in the field.

AB The Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science was started 40 years
   ago, at a time when "marketing in society" issues were capturing much
   attention from marketing scholars. Since that time both the field and
   this journal have grown and matured, but the marketing in society area
   has become somewhat removed from the dominant perspectives of marketing
   scholarship. This paper provides an historical perspective on these
   developments and offers an examination of the fundamental role of
   societal interests in our field. Six basic topics are explored: (1) the
   hundred years of history of marketing thought development, as reflected
   in the "4 Eras" of marketing thought; (2) the ebbs and flows of
   attention to marketing in society topics during these 4 Eras; (3) two
   illustrations of difficulties brought about by this area's move to
   sideline status in the field; (4) our concept of the "aggregate
   marketing system" as a basis for appreciating the centrality of this
   research area for the field of marketing; (5) the nature of marketing in
   society research today; and (6) a discussion of several research
   challenges and opportunities for the future.

AB Scholarship at the intersection of transaction cost economics (TCE) and
   marketing has enjoyed an impressive record of growth over the past three
   decades, and the future promises more of the same. Following Erin
   Anderson's perceptive uses of TCE in her 1982 dissertation, the field of
   marketing has made many constructive uses of and contributions to TCE,
   where the latter include broadening the reach of TCE, posing important
   challenges, and identifying opportunities still to be addressed. Given
   this history, we advance the proposition that the relation between TCE
   and marketing has been and should be a two-way street. In considering
   the scope for future research, we give special attention to issues of
   asymmetric costs, the dynamics of governance, and disequilibrium
   contracting. We also discuss the four precepts of pragmatic methodology,
   with special emphasis on prediction and empirical testing. The Appendix
   provides added perspective on the evolving "science of organization" of
   which TCE is a part.

AB The large penetration of store brands has been accelerated by a
   substantial increase of their availability across various categories.
   Although store brands have generated tremendous interest in the
   literature, little work has been done on umbrella branding strategies
   for store brands. We extend the previous work of Erdem (1998) and Erdem
   et al. (2004) by studying the learning spillover effects of umbrella
   brands across categories for both national and store brands. We apply
   the Multivariate Multinomial Probit Model of cross-category learning
   across five product categories to study differences across store versus
   national umbrella brands in three countries (i.e., the United States,
   the United Kingdom, and Spain). Our results indicate that cross-category
   learning effects exist between different product categories in consumer
   packaged goods for both store brands and national umbrella brands,
   although some of the categories in which correlated learning happens
   differ between the two. The degree of cross-category learning also
   varies across categories.

AB In this paper, we investigate whether information on the history of
   purchase intentions is useful in predicting actual purchase behavior.
   The research is motivated by two factors. The first factor is the
   empirical finding in the literature that measuring intentions just prior
   to purchase provides better predictions of actual purchase as compared
   to when these intentions are measured earlier. The second factor is the
   role of the timing of the formation of intentions prior to purchase.
   While one stream of literature based on preference fluency predicts that
   early formation of intentions is more likely to lead to actual purchase,
   the other stream based on the memory-based "recency" effect predicts
   that formation of intentions just prior to purchase is more likely to
   lead to actual purchase. Together, these two factors motivate the
   potential need to account for the entire history of intentions prior to
   purchase. A canonical example of a market where intention histories are
   tracked is the movie industry, where "first choice" movie watching
   intentions are tracked up to (and in some cases beyond) the time of
   release. Accommodating the history of intentions in an econometric model
   that predicts actual box office performance is challenging due to the
   differing numbers of observations for the movies, the large numbers of
   observations for certain movies, as well as the role of various
   time-invariant and time-varying covariates influencing intentions. We
   propose a two-part model where the first part involves a hierarchical
   growth model that summarizes the trajectories of intentions via "growth
   factors." These growth factors also reflect the role of the various
   covariates. The second part is a regression of the box office
   performance on the growth factors and other covariates. The models are
   simultaneously estimated within a Bayesian framework. Consistent with
   the previous literature, we find that including information on
   intentions improves our ability to predict behavior, with the recent
   intentions being the most informative. Importantly, when the history of
   intentions is accounted for, our results indicate that the data support
   the "recency" literature-intentions grow over time leading up to
   purchase, and this growth has a positive impact on opening box office
   performance. While a linear growth model performs best for most movies,
   there exists a subset of movies for which the quadratic growth model
   better captures the "spike" in intentions just prior to purchase.
   Further, accounting for information on the history of intentions
   dramatically improves model fit and forecasting performance relative to
   when only the intentions at one point in time (e.g., the ones just prior
   to purchase) are accounted for.

AB Marketplace behavior refers to aspects of the purchase behavior of
   individuals and firms that leads to marketplace demand. It is
   characterized by the presence of many variables, most of which have
   nothing to do with a specific venture or specific consumer. This paper
   discusses three challenges of analysis commonly found in quantitative
   models of marketplace data: heterogeneous consumers, goal-directed
   behaviors, and the selective attention to some but not all variables in
   extended models of behavior. Bayesian solutions to these challenges are
   discussed.

AB In light of the increasing interest in hedonic aspects of consumer
   behavior, it is clear that consumer taste plays a critical role in
   judgment and decision making, particularly for hedonic products and
   services. At the present time, however, our understanding of consumer
   aesthetic taste and its specific role for consumer behavior is limited.
   In this article, we review the literature from a variety of fields such
   as sociology, psychology, philosophy, and consumer behavior in order to
   develop a conceptual definition of consumer aesthetic taste. We then
   explore various issues related to taste and develop a conceptual
   framework for the relevance of expertise vs. taste in consumer
   decision-making. Finally, we present an agenda for future research on
   this important topic.

AB Self-control is a critical aspect of consumer behavior that has
   wide-ranging implications for individual and societal welfare. The
   present research builds upon previous work regarding consumer spending
   self-control by examining the financial, decision making, social, and
   psychological consequences of low consumer spending self-control.
   Further, the relationship between consumer spending self-control and
   general self-control is explored, contributing to a greater
   understanding of how more general traits translate into spending-related
   outcomes. This research includes investigations of allocations to
   retirement accounts, responses to credit limits, resource depletion
   effects from repeated decision making, and the potential for broader
   negative social and psychological consequences from low consumer
   spending self-control.

AB The domain and theories of marketing have been expanding since the
   origins of the discipline. Since the 1970s marketing science has been
   organized around the exchange paradigm. Marketing concepts apply to all
   forms of exchange, whether it is goods, services, personages, places or
   ideas, and whether it is between individuals, for-profit and nonprofit
   firms, governments and NGOs. Marketing theories evolved from a firm
   oriented view to encompass the exchanging dyad. More recently the
   paradigm expanded to a network level of explanation, and relational
   theories have come to the fore. But even as the field struggles to grasp
   its new fields of explanation, there is a Kuhnian shift happening at its
   boundaries. The shift significantly bends the marketing worldview as
   well as the theoretical tools and methodologies we use to study it. In
   this paper we develop a three-tiered explanation of the emerging field
   of marketing-its subphenomena (consumer experiences and sensory
   systems), its phenomena (marketing networks), and its superphenomena
   (sustainability and development).

AB Social coupons are fast emerging as a popular marketing tool for
   businesses, an attractive shopping tool for consumers using them and a
   profitable business model for the social coupon service providers. But
   does the popularity of social coupons extend into providing short-and
   long-term profitability and new customers for the businesses? Through an
   analytical model, this paper answers the following questions: (1) Are
   social coupons profitable for businesses? (2) Can businesses influence
   social coupon profitability? (3) How can businesses recover the
   shortfall in profits from the coupon launch? (4) How long will it take
   for businesses to recover the shortfall in profits from the coupon
   launch? Using data from three different businesses, we find that social
   coupons in their current form are not ideally suited to ensure customer
   acquisition and yield profits for the businesses. Additionally, we
   discuss possible areas where social coupons might work. Several research
   questions for future testing are offered to explore this new area of

AB Is a customer orientation universally effective for salespeople? Or does
   its effectiveness depend on the selling situation? While previous
   research has largely neglected this question, this study investigates
   contextual influences on the link between customer-oriented behaviors
   and customer loyalty. To do so, it takes a role theory perspective on
   salesperson customer orientation by distinguishing functional customer
   orientation and relational customer orientation. It then investigates
   which type of customer orientation is more effective with regard to
   establishing and maintaining customer loyalty, given the specific
   situation. Here, the authors analyze the moderating impact of a
   customer's communication style (task orientation and interaction
   orientation) and specific characteristics of a supplier's products
   (product individuality, importance, complexity, and brand strength).
   Multilevel analysis of triadic data from a cross-industry survey of 56
   sales managers, 195 sales representatives, and 538 customers provides
   empirical support for positive, non significant, and even adverse
   effects of salespeople's customer-oriented behaviors on customer
   loyalty, depending on contextual variables.

AB This study proposes a conceptual model for customer experience quality
   and its impact on customer relationship outcomes. Customer experience is
   conceptualized as the customer's subjective response to the holistic
   direct and indirect encounter with the firm, and customer experience
   quality as its perceived excellence or superiority. Using the repertory
   grid technique in 40 interviews in B2B and B2C contexts, the authors
   find that customer experience quality is judged with respect to its
   contribution to value-in-use, and hence propose that value-in-use
   mediates between experience quality and relationship outcomes.
   Experience quality includes evaluations not just of the firm's products
   and services but also of peer-to-peer and complementary supplier
   encounters. In assessing experience quality in B2B contexts, customers
   place a greater emphasis on firm practices that focus on understanding
   and delivering value-in-use than is generally the case in B2C contexts.
   Implications for practitioners' customer insight processes and future
   research directions are suggested.

AB A truism in the marketing literature, and among many marketing
   practitioners, is that requiring consumers to wait negatively impacts
   quality evaluations, purchase intentions and a range of other important
   outcomes. However, it is also true that consumer waiting or queuing has
   historically been considered from an operations perspective. The present
   research takes a different approach and examines waits in the context of
   their ability to function as a signal of quality. Four experiments
   demonstrate a required wait can indeed signal quality to consumers and
   increase, rather than decrease, both purchase intentions and actual
   experienced satisfaction. Three moderators of this effect are examined:
   preexisting knowledge, consumption motivations, and the extent to which
   quality is difficult to objectively determine. The results suggest in
   situations where quality is important, unknown or ambiguous, managers
   may increase consumer satisfaction by making consumers wait.

AB This study provides an answer to the question whether and under which
   conditions publicity is more or less effective than advertising.
   Advertising refers to paid communication that identifies the message
   sponsor, whereas publicity is communication that secures editorial space
   in media for promotion purposes and does not have an identifiable
   sponsor. The primary advantage of advertising over publicity is the
   sponsor's control over message content; its disadvantages are audience
   skepticism and lack of credibility. We investigate this trade-off
   between credibility effects and effects of recipients' processing and
   evaluation of message content. Results of a meta-analytic structural
   equation model show that the positive credibility effect of publicity is
   on average about three times as strong as the information evaluation
   effect, supporting the overall superiority of publicity over
   advertising. This effect, however, is moderated by prior knowledge and
   only holds for products about which recipients lack prior knowledge. The
   effects change for known products when advertising becomes superior. The
   effectiveness of publicity depends on further moderating variables. In
   particular, academic studies tend to underestimate the true effects of
   publicity over advertising due to experimental manipulations. Campaigns
   that combine publicity and advertising weaken the effects of publicity,
   whereas advertorials (i.e., advertisements disguised as editorial
   material) are more effective, since they combine the advantages of both
   publicity and advertising. The results have theoretical and practical
   implications.

   compensation to show that customer satisfaction is a significant
   determinant of CEO bonuses. Findings demonstrate that the success of
   CEOs in managing customer satisfaction has a direct, personal, and
   economic impact in the form of their annual bonus awards. Our study
   contributes to research on the use of customer satisfaction information,
   marketing accountability, and marketing's board level relevance. Our
   research also extends marketing theory by pointing to a previously
   unexamined role for marketing performance metrics.

   influence the entry-level placement of marketing doctoral candidates at
   U.S. universities and colleges. Contributing to the emerging research on
   human brands, we identify marketing doctoral candidates' intrinsic and
   extrinsic brand cues that influence their number of AMA interviews,
   campus visit offers, and starting base salary. The strongest brand cue
   is the research productivity of candidates' doctoral degree-granting
   departments. A related cue that also predicts initial salary is the
   candidates' advisors' research record. Further, when beginning the job
   search, doctoral students who have a top research publication, who have
   a dissertation proposal defended with data, and who have attended the
   AMA-Sheth Foundation Doctoral Consortium receive a substantial entry
   salary premium. Based on branding frameworks and theories of academic
   rewards, this study adds to the emerging knowledge on both the concept
   of human brands as well as the growing literature on issues relating to
   marketing academia.

AB Evidence within the marketing literature has shown that marketing
   capabilities are important drivers of firm performance. However, very
   little is known about how firms improve their marketing capabilities via
   the embedding of new market knowledge. Organizational learning theory
   provides us with a theoretical lens through which we can examine how
   existing customer-focused marketing capabilities may be improved and new
   customer-focused marketing capabilities may be created via marketing
   exploitation and exploration capabilities. In addition, this study
   investigates whether ambidexterity in marketing exploration and
   exploitation exists and finds that firms cannot do both at high levels
   without risking a negative impact on customer-focused marketing
   capabilities. This study also presents findings demonstrating how
   improving the two customer-focused marketing capabilities in our study,
   brand management and customer relationship management, impacts objective
   financial performance.

   shareholder value. This study develops a macro or top down approach
   using longitudinal firm level data from publicly available financial

   sales has higher pricing multiples than other components of earnings in
   firm specific time-series data. We also test hypotheses of five
   marketing-related drivers of sales capitalization rate (the rate at
   which sales increases are converted into increased shareholder value).
   From the research effort, we develop three managerially useful tools.
   First, we suggest enterprises develop alpha or sales margin strategies
   and beta or margin capitalization strategies, and we show that one can
   map these strategies into a planning matrix. Second, using financial
   statements of publicly traded firms, we develop an alternative method of
   estimating customer equity. Third, we show how a company may use our
   macro approach and compare its performance with its industry competitors
   to develop insights into competitive dynamics.

   this study examines the factors that affect the implementation of market
   orientation in the subsidiaries of global companies, using data gathered
   from multiple informants and multiple sources in 79 subsidiaries located
   in 45 countries. Findings indicate that the market orientation of
   subsidiaries is positively related to the legal institutions, local
   competition in the host country market, and the market orientation of
   headquarters. The findings also indicate that the headquarters' market
   orientation has more pronounced effects on the implementation of market
   orientation for subsidiaries that strongly identify with headquarters.
   Moreover, the study demonstrates that cultural distance between home and
   host countries of the subsidiary strengthens the positive effects of
   competitive intensity on market orientation implementation. As such,
   this research addresses an important concern among researchers and
   managers that is related to how to increase the market orientation and,
   thereby, the performance of their subsidiaries located in foreign
   countries.

AB Integrating two disparate functions in organizations-marketing and
   information services (IS)-has become a critical business concern due to
   the increasing use of information technology (IT) to find and open new
   markets, deliver improved services to customers, and streamline internal
   marketing processes. This study appears to be the first to empirically
   examine the dynamics of bringing these distinct groups of specialists
   together. We investigate potential antecedents, consequences, and
   contingencies of IS-marketing integration, drawing on theories of
   complementarity and competence. Through a survey of IS and marketing
   executives, we learn that integration is facilitated by trust between
   the two functions and the interaction between IT strategic intent and
   customer orientation; it is impeded by a gap in top management knowledge
   of IT versus marketing. We also find that integration fosters the
   much-coveted capabilities of developing and introducing innovations
   (innovativeness) as well as responding flexibly, swiftly, and adroitly
   to opportunities (strategic responsiveness). Additionally, we determine
   integration is bounded by market dynamism. In sum, integration between
   marketing and IS can be enhanced via managerial efforts, and the
   relationship is profoundly beneficial to businesses.

AB This study proposes and tests an integrative model that incorporates the
   mental resources framework (MOA: motivation, opportunity, and ability)
   alongside traditional innovation adoption predictors for assessing the
   adoption of dual-functionality innovations (DFI), a special case of
   multifunctional innovations (MFI). The multifunctional nature of an
   increasing number of new products demands the use of mental resources in
   evaluating new offers, as the comprehension of MFIs is more demanding
   (i.e., requires more mental resources) than single-functionality (SF)
   products. The proposed model also recognizes the role of MFI
   categorization as a critical link in the process, because an MFI, and
   within the context of our study a DFI, helps consumers achieve multiple
   goals if they realize its dual functionality. Our model demonstrates
   that mental resources play a significant role in consumers' adoption
   decisions and should be included in studies of MFI adoption. Further,
   our integrative model offers a significant improvement over rival
   alternatives that use only traditional innovation adoption predictors.
   Thus, the model offers a new approach for estimating MFI adoption with a
   superior predictive power and facilitates the development of appropriate
   marketing strategies for such products.

AB The past few decades have witnessed a significant increase in the number
   of cross-border strategic alliances among firms. We focus on the role of
   alliance expertise (alliance experience and diversity of partners) and
   alliance governance (horizontal vs. vertical alliances and joint venture
   vs. other alliances) in global innovation generation. We also examine
   the effect of these variables on the financial performance of the focal
   firm. The conceptual model is tested using an empirical analysis of
   cross-border alliances formed by U.S. pharmaceutical companies from 1985
   to 2008. We find that while prior alliance experience has a positive
   association with global innovation generation, diversity of partners has
   a negative relationship. In addition, whether the alliance is horizontal
   or vertical has no bearing on the innovation generation, but joint
   ventures are associated with more global innovation generation than
   other types of alliances. Finally, as global innovation generation
   increases, financial performance increases up to a point but thereafter
   exhibits a negative relationship.

AB The market for digital content (e.g., music or movies) has been affected
   by large numbers of Internet users downloading content for free from
   illegitimate sources. The music industry has been exposed most severely
   to these developments and has reacted with several different online
   business models but with only limited success thus far. These business
   models include attempts to attract consumers by offering free downloads
   while relying on advertising as a revenue source. Using a latent-class
   choice-based conjoint analysis, we analyze the attractiveness of these
   business models from the consumer's perspective. Our findings indicate
   that advertising-based models have the potential to attract consumers
   who would otherwise refrain from commercial downloading, that they
   cannot threaten the dominance of download models like iTunes, and that
   current market prices for subscription services are unattractive to most
   consumers.

   markets, this paper outlines a business network view of the firm-market
   relationship, which differs fundamentally from the view assumed by
   neo-classical economic theory. We define business networks as sets of
   connected business relationships. Thus business relationships and
   connections between relationships are the critical elements in the
   business network view. It is assumed, as suggested by the Uppsala
   internationalization process model, that an interplay between knowledge
   and commitment development is the mechanism that drives the relationship
   and network development process. Against this background the paper
   discusses how strategic change is analyzed in literature on alliances
   and networks. In conclusion the paper presents a set of propositions
   about strategy-making in business network settings.

   responsibilities of the firm. Despite their tight integration in

   have largely progressed within their respective disciplinary boundaries

   firms increasingly undertake their marketing and entrepreneurial
   activities across diverse settings, academe has provided little insight
   into how changes in the institutional environment may substantially
   alter the processes and outcomes of these undertakings. Herein, we
   integrate research on marketing activities, the entrepreneurship
   process, and institutional theory in an effort to address this gap. We
   first discuss market orientation as enhancing a firm's opportunity
   recognition and innovation, whereas marketing mix decisions enhance
   opportunity exploitation. We then examine how entrepreneurship leads to
   innovation directed toward market orientation and marketing mix
   activities. Based on this foundation, we examine differences in
   marketing and entrepreneurship activities across institutional contexts.

   cash-flow return on assets (CFROA) performance. Since product market
   strategy is heavily reliant on the input of marketers, and

AB Institutional theory implies that normative societal expectations create
   pressures for organizations to respond acceptably to important
   institutional constituents. Although the role of the institutional
   environment on marketing has been studied, the organizational mechanisms
   by which firms respond to societal pressures remain under-investigated.
   We suggest that an important determining factor involves organizational
   identity, which drives firm response to societal norms and facilitates
   its quest for legitimacy. Accordingly, this study contributes to
   organizational theory in marketing by casting identity as the focal
   mechanism in the firm's response to the institutional environment.
   Marketing ethics and CSR issues frame this research given natural
   synergies with institutional and organizational identity theories and
   evidence that increasingly, firms must respond to societal expectations
   involving ethics in their marketing practices. Using game theoretical
   models and economic experiments, we find that the influence of the
   institutional environment emerges through firm identity, affecting
   resource allocation to ethical product augmentation.

AB This study identifies the potential contribution that institutional
   theory can make to understanding the success of marketing practices.
   Based on institutional theory, we argue that the effectiveness of
   marketing practices decreases when firms are motivated to adopt such
   practices under the influence of institutional pressures originating in
   firms' environments. However, alignment between a practice and a firm's
   marketing strategy may buffer against these negative effects. We apply
   these insights to the case of customer relationship management (CRM).
   CRM is considered an important way to enhance customer loyalty and firm
   performance, but it has also been criticized for being expensive and for
   not living up to expectations. Empirical data from 107 organizations
   confirm that, in general, adopting CRM for mimetic motives is likely to
   result in fewer customer insights as a result of using this practice.
   Our study suggests that institutional theory has much to offer to the
   investigation of the effectiveness of marketing practices.

AB Literature on empowerment as an internal marketing practice primarily
   documents positive effects on employees' job performance, though
   increasing evidence suggests conflicting viewpoints. This study adopts
   an agency theoretical perspective to propose a workload mechanism,
   according to which the delegation of power from supervisors (principals)
   to service employees (agents) (i.e., servicing empowerment) is costly to
   employees and increases their perceived workload, which hampers their
   performance to serve customers. Using a laboratory experiment and a
   survey, this research reveals that the perceived workload and extant
   motivational mechanisms have conflicting effects on employees' service
   performance. The former exerts a significant negative impact on tasks
   that involve conflicting principal-agent interests (e.g., handling
   customer complaints) but not on tasks with aligned principal-agent
   interests (e.g., organizational citizenship behaviors). Two control
   systems, performance appraisal (accurate and infrequent feedback) and
   principal-agent service goal congruence, mitigate the dysfunctional
   effect of perceived workload on employees' service performance.

AB Despite the call for increased theoretical diversity in franchising
   research, the incorporation of organizational theory into this
   literature has been minimal. In response, we examine how aspects of
   organizational identity are represented in franchisee recruitment Web
   sites. We develop the concept of franchise branding to understand how
   franchisors position franchise opportunities to attract potential
   franchisees. We find that firms in the Franchise 500 use more language
   associated with market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and
   charismatic rhetoric when compared to a sample of lower-performing
   franchises. We also examine the impact of franchisor size and age to
   examine how liabilities of size and newness impact language use. We find
   that larger firms tend to use more rhetoric but detect no significant
   differences based on age. We conclude by discussing future possibilities
   for incorporating additional theoretical perspectives into the
   franchising literature.

AB This paper investigates the dynamic impact of multiple sequential
   emotional displays by employees on customers' negative emotions. Using
   video-based stimuli to manipulate emotional displays by employees, this
   study shows the sequential occurrences of negative and positive
   emotional contagions in service failure and recovery encounters. The
   results suggest that higher levels of employees' negative emotional
   displays lead to a greater increase in customers' negative emotions
   through the process of negative emotional contagion during service
   failure. More importantly, we find that positive emotional displays by
   employees can decrease customers' negative emotions through the process
   of positive emotional contagion during service recovery, i.e., higher
   levels of employee positive emotional displays lead to a greater
   decrease in customers' negative emotions. In addition, no matter whether
   customers experience higher or lower levels of employee positive
   emotional displays during service recovery, their final negative
   emotions cannot fully return to their emotional levels prior to service
   failure. However, for customers experiencing higher levels of employee
   positive emotional displays, their final negative emotions can be
   greatly mitigated and are closer to their initial emotional levels, as
   compared to customers experiencing lower levels of employee positive
   emotional displays. The results further indicate that susceptibility to
   emotional contagion increases the effect of employees' negative
   (positive) emotional displays on customers' negative emotions during
   service failure (recovery). The findings of this study suggest that
   service firms should provide effective training to their frontline
   service employees so that they can display proper positive emotions
   during service encounters.

AB In this study, cognitive evaluation theory illustrates how the
   controlling aspects of reward redemption policy (stringent versus
   flexible) interact with the type of offered reward (social versus
   economic) to influence relational program effectiveness. We look at
   effectiveness by defining and measuring relational worth, the
   non-financial value of consumers to organizations. The hypotheses are
   empirically tested with a sample of season ticket holders of a
   professional sports team (n = 373) and then replicated in a second study
   with experimental data using scenarios in a hotel reward program
   context. Results indicate that perceived social rewards lead to
   affective commitment, while perceived economic rewards lead to
   continuance commitment. Involvement is a significant determinant in how
   reward type and policy influence commitment types; specifically,
   low-involvement consumers are more influenced by reward program signals
   than high-involvement consumers. Affective commitment produces the most
   relationally valuable consumer to an organization in terms of relational
   worth. Controlling policies have an undermining effect on all commitment
   types, regardless of reward type.

   indicate that concrete features, such as the face value of an offer or
   its mode of presentation (as a dollar figure or as a percentage

   for incentives with long ones. In the latter case, abstract features,

AB In this paper we explain how practice, prior knowledge and task
   difficulty interact to affect demand for hedonic experiences. As
   predicted by the human capital model, we propose that the key
   determinant of demand for hedonic experiences is the increase in
   performance efficiency that can be gained through practice. In addition,
   we argue that the nature of the effect of practice is distinctly
   different in hedonic consumption, compared to utilitarian consumption.
   Specifically, for hedonic experiences, practice allows consumers to
   extract greater value within a given period of time, rather than reduce
   the amount of time spent on a (utilitarian) task. Finally, we argue that
   if changes in performance efficiency across repeated hedonic experiences
   adhere to the power law of practice, then both prior knowledge and task
   difficulty will be important moderators of the main effect of practice
   on demand. These predictions are tested in two experiments that use an
   online panel to examine consumer demand for videogames.

AB A substantial literature stream indicates there are benefits to having a
   favorable brand personality, such as enhanced brand attitudes and
   purchase intentions and higher levels of consumer trust and loyalty.
   Contemporary advertisements and promotional activities by a host of
   firms demonstrate a managerial belief in the value of establishing a
   brand personality that mirrors that of branding scholars. Yet extant
   research has yet to fully evaluate the perceived appeal of brand
   personality to consumers. This issue is important to managers because it
   is precisely this level of appeal that influences target consumers'
   purchase decisions and helps to sustain the endurance of a brand's
   perceived personality between promotional cycles. This article
   conceptualizes, develops, and validates measures for assessing a
   consumer's perception of brand personality appeal (BPA). Three
   dimensions of BPA (favorability, originality, clarity) emerge and are
   empirically demonstrated to directly and positively impact consumer
   purchase intentions.

AB It has been 25 years since the publication of a comprehensive review of
   the full spectrum of sales-performance drivers. This study takes stock
   of the contemporary field and synthesizes empirical evidence from the
   period 1982-2008. The authors revise the classification scheme for sales
   performance determinants devised by Walker et al. (1977) and estimate
   both the predictive validity of its sub-categories and the impact of a
   range of moderators on determinant-sales performance relationships.
   Based on multivariate causal model analysis, the results make two major
   observations: (1) Five sub-categories demonstrate significant
   relationships with sales performance: selling-related knowledge (beta =
   .28), degree of adaptiveness (beta = .27), role ambiguity (beta = -.25),
   cognitive aptitude (beta = .23) and work engagement (beta = .23). (2)
   These sub-categories are moderated by measurement method, research
   context, and sales-type variables. The authors identify managerial
   implications of the results and offer suggestions for further research,
   including the conjecture that as the world is moving toward a
   knowledge-intensive economy, salespeople could be functioning as
   knowledge-brokers. The results seem to back this supposition and
   indicate how it might inspire future research in the field of personal
   selling.

   investigate how to protect relational assets in a marketing channel when
   an upstream horizontal business combination between key suppliers
   arises. In this study, we ascertain downstream channel members'
   perceptions of a supplier's horizontal business combination both prior
   to and after such a combination. Our findings indicate that a normative
   contract breach resulting from a horizontal business combination
   influences downstream channel members by reducing their performance,
   decreasing their satisfaction, and increasing their likelihood of
   exiting the channel. Consequently, both the relational assets of the
   upstream supplier and their downstream customers are harmed.
   Importantly, these influences can be partially offset through the
   moderating effect of channel identification.

AB Many multinational corporations have implemented cross-national
   satisfaction measurement programs for tracking and benchmarking the
   satisfaction of their customers across their various markets. These
   companies measure satisfaction with the goal of maximizing customer
   loyalty and the financial benefits associated with loyalty. However,
   existing research comparing consumer satisfaction across nations is
   limited, with the few existing studies examining only a small number of
   countries or predictors of satisfaction, or a small group of consumers
   within a particular economic sector. To expand our knowledge of the
   determinants of cross-national variation in customer satisfaction, we
   study three sets of factors: cultural, socioeconomic and
   political-economic. We utilize a unique sample of cross-industry
   satisfaction data from 19 nations, including nearly 257,000 interviews
   of consumers. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that consumers in
   traditional societies have higher levels of satisfaction than those in
   secular-rational societies. Likewise, consumers in self-expressive
   societies have higher levels of customer satisfaction than those in
   societies with survival values. We also find that literacy rate, trade
   freedom, and business freedom have a positive effect on customer
   satisfaction while per capita gross domestic product has a negative
   effect on customer satisfaction. We discuss the implications of these
   findings for policy-makers, multinational corporations, and researchers.

AB Today's business customers expect sellers not only to respond
   effectively to their expressed needs but also to understand their
   business sufficiently well to proactively address their latent and
   future needs. Yet, research shows that many firms underestimate,
   misunderstand, or overlook these customer expectations. To draw clarity
   to this discrepancy, this study explores the notion of proactive
   customer orientation and examines the degree to which this capability
   offers an opportunity for competitive advantage. While research in
   recent years has explored the role of proactive customer orientation in
   new product performance, empirical investigation in this stream of
   market orientation literature is significantly underdeveloped. We assess
   the impact of the proactive customer orientation construct on value
   creation by taking a novel approach that examines the proactive customer
   orientation -> value -> satisfaction -> loyalty chain using data from
   800 business customers in India, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom,
   and the United States. We find that, relative to other firm
   capabilities, proactive customer orientation is the most consistent
   driver of customer value across our multinational data set. Results also
   show robust effects for the interaction of proactive and responsive
   customer orientation to create superior value. Several moderating
   conditions further frame the impact of this capability: intense levels
   of customer value change, a global relationship scope, and a
   transnational relationship structure. Overall, findings significantly
   advance the understanding of the proactive dimension within market
   orientation and provide marketers with insights for voice of the
   customer processes.

   CRM has been investigated only in the context of existing products.
   CRM's potential to aid in future new product development (NPD) has been
   neglected. We develop a conceptual framework in which multiple facets of
   CRM are linked to new product and company performance. We test this
   model based on a cross-functional sample consisting of 115 R&D and 122
   Marketing managers from firms spanning multiple industries. The results
   provide evidence that CRM has a positive effect on new product
   performance and further, that this effect is moderated by CRM reward
   systems but not CRM technology. We also show that new product
   performance mediates the relationship between CRM and company
   performance. These findings have important implications for research and

AB The effect of a firm's strategic focus on acquiring new customers and/or
   retaining existing customers (customer acquisition and retention
   orientations) on innovation performance is evaluated. With dyadic
   primary data collected from 225 strategic business units, the authors
   demonstrate that a firm's focus on customer acquisition enhances its
   radical innovation performance but hinders its incremental innovation; a
   firm's strategic orientation toward customer retention has the opposite
   effects. These effects are mediated by both customer knowledge
   development and the firm's resource configuration decisions. In
   addition, the authors provide insight into the impact of managerial
   decision trade-offs when implementing customer engagement strategies.
   The results suggest that the effect of customer acquisition and
   retention orientations on customer knowledge and investment decisions,
   and ultimately on innovation performance, is amplified when a firm
   consistently implements a specific engagement strategy. Implementing a
   dual strategy by attempting to focus on both acquiring and retaining
   customers undermines resource configuration decisions, with diverse
   effects on both radical and incremental innovation.

AB According to service-dominant logic (S-D logic), all providers are
   service providers, and service is the fundamental basis of exchange.
   Value is co-created with customers and assessed on the basis of
   value-in-context. However, the extensive literature on S-D logic could
   benefit from paying explicit attention to the fact that both service
   exchange and value co-creation are influenced by social forces. The aim
   of this study is to expand understanding of service exchange and value
   co-creation by complementing these central aspects of S-D logic with key
   concepts from social construction theories (social structures, social
   systems, roles, positions, interactions, and reproduction of social
   structures). The study develops and describes a new framework for
   understanding how the concepts of service exchange and value co-creation
   are affected by recognizing that they are embedded in social systems.
   The study contends that value should be understood as
   value-in-social-context and that value is a social construction. Value
   co-creation is shaped by social forces, is reproduced in social
   structures, and can be asymmetric for the actors involved. Service
   exchanges are dynamic, and actors learn and change their roles within
   dynamic service systems.

AB The concept of sustainability is increasingly being addressed
   theoretically by scholars and practically by managers and policymakers.
   With this growing focus on sustainability efforts, marketing is in a
   unique position to elevate its focus from managing relationships with
   customers to strategically managing a broader set of marketplace issues.
   Overall, an organization achieves market-based sustainability to the
   extent that it strategically aligns itself with the market-oriented
   product needs and wants of customers and the interests of multiple
   stakeholders concerned about social responsibility issues involving
   economic, environmental, and social dimensions. To set the stage for
   marketing's inquiry into sustainability efforts, I briefly review the
   concept of sustainability, compare it with corporate social
   responsibility, bring in stakeholders, argue for the notion of "market
   orientation plus," and consider the possibility that the notion of what
   sustainability encompasses is converging in the marketing literature.

AB We consider the implications of the three pillars of sustainability
   (environment, economy and social justice) on consumption in a wealthy
   country. Building a theoretical model that includes consumers, business,
   government, the environment, and economic and political relations
   between nations, we explore how sustainability should affect the
   consumption behavior of consumers, charitable aid to poorer countries,
   and responsible environmental practices by businesses. Our model enables
   us to provide normative implications for consumers, society and
   business. Importantly, we assume that all stakeholders will optimize
   their self-interest, and that altruism will only partly explain behavior
   consistent with sustainability. Among the more non-obvious findings are
   that (1) the poorer the poor countries are, the less the rich countries
   should consume, (2) the more sensitive the global political climate is
   to economic inequity between the rich and poor nations, the less the
   rich countries should consume, and (3) if aid to poor countries is
   effective enough, then the more materialistic the society is, the more
   charitable aid it should give. We also confirm a number of more
   intuitive findings, such as that business should use more green
   technology as the taxes on pollution and/or efficiency of green
   technology increase, and the more resource-intensive consumption is, the
   less consumers should consume. Taken as a whole, the findings imply that
   societal consumption patterns should be sensitive to aspects of
   environmental impact and social justice, even if altruistic motivations
   are absent.

AB Recent changes in the business environment have prompted marketing
   scholars to pay particular attention to sustainability as a topic of
   inquiry. Despite the progress made in the study of sustainability, there
   is a paucity of research on the topic in premier marketing journals. To
   address this issue, we focus on marketing-related journals and assess
   the intellectual structure of sustainability research in detail. Drawing
   on social network theory, we perform an extensive co-citation analysis
   using multidimensional scaling to examine 76,342 citations made in 1,320
   sustainability-focused articles from 36 journals over 51 years
   (1958-2008). This study specifies that the topics of citizenship
   behavior, stakeholder theory, corporate performance, and the triple
   bottom line are integral sustainability research areas. In addition, the
   results indicate five required topics for examining sustainability in
   the marketing context: external-internal focus, social-environmental
   emphasis, legal-ethical-discretionary intent, marketing assets, and
   financial performance. Supported by the capabilities-based resource
   perspective, the sustainability-focused typology and framework advanced
   provide directed structure for future research.

AB Utilizing Resource-Advantage Theory as the underlying theoretical
   foundation and drawing on literature from a variety of disciplines, we
   develop a market-oriented sustainability framework. By incorporating
   sustainability into market orientation, the goal of strategic alignment
   of sustainability with marketing strategies is achieved to create a
   competitive advantage. Three constructs identified in the model are DNA,
   stakeholder involvement, and performance management. These three
   constructs are the drivers of sustainability. DNA is used as an extended
   metaphor to clarify and illustrate the workings of an organization and
   how sustainability may be implemented. This construct includes core
   ideology, dynamic capabilities, and societal engagement. The firm's DNA
   is communicated to both internal and external stakeholders, and
   stakeholders' concerns should be an influence on strategic marketing
   planning. Performance management is the third major construct in the
   model and includes corporate social performance and corporate financial
   performance metrics. Within the model explication, we offer propositions
   to support market-oriented sustainability research and provide
   directions for sustainability theory, research, and practice.

   voluntary adoption by companies of the world's most widespread framework
   of CSR reporting-the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The GRI case is
   impressive because it achieved its status in mere 10 years. The inquiry
   focuses on the role of the firm's institutional environment and identity
   communicators as drivers of the adoption of the GRI principles as a
   reputation management tool. The authors use a duration model to test
   hypotheses with data on 600 top global companies. The findings indicate
   that competitive and media pressures together with a company's CSR media
   visibility and CSR publicity efforts are important determinants of GRI
   adoption. Also, as the GRI framework becomes more institutionalized,
   companies pick up more information from prior adopters.

AB Sustainable marketing may be viewed as marketing that is within, and
   supportive of, sustainable economic development. Peattie (The Marketing
   Review 2(2):129-146, 2001) maintains that sustainable economic
   development poses major challenges for marketing. These challenges
   concern futurity, equity, and needs/wants. This article focuses on the
   equity and needs/wants challenges of sustainable development and argues
   that public policies and programs (of wealthy nations, poor countries,
   or bodies such as the United Nations) can improve economic equity by
   promoting the economic growth of poor countries. Furthermore, it argues
   that a major reason why past efforts to promote the economic growth of
   poor countries have so often failed is that such (allegedly) pro-growth
   policies have been guided by an impoverished theory of economic growth.
   Specifically, this article (1) discusses the implications of sustainable
   development for marketing, (2) shows seven ways that sustainable
   marketing and resource-advantage (R-A) theory intersect, (3) argues that
   the cause of sustainable marketing is furthered by promoting economic
   growth, (4) identifies the two major, radically different, theories of
   economic growth: neoclassical, static-equilibrium growth theory and
   dynamic competition growth theory, (5) shows how the two theories make
   four radically different, testable predictions, and (6) reviews the
   empirical evidence concerning the four predictions. The article
   concludes that the equity and needs/wants challenges of sustainable
   development and the cause of sustainable development more generally can
   be addressed by poor nations pursuing economic growth, which in turn
   implies that public policy should focus not on increasing investment,
   but on institutions that favor economic freedom and dynamic competition.

   will define its success for decades to come. Current sustainability
   strategies have three major deficiencies: they do not directly focus on
   the customer, they do not recognize the looming threats from rising
   global over-consumption, and they do not take a holistic approach. We
   present a framework for a customer-centric approach to sustainability.
   This approach recasts the sustainability metric to emphasize the
   outcomes of business actions measured holistically in term of
   environmental, personal and economic well-being of the consumer. We
   introduce the concept of mindful consumption (MC) as the guiding
   principle in this approach. MC is premised on a consumer mindset of
   caring for self, for community, and for nature, that translates
   behaviorally into tempering the self-defeating excesses associated with
   acquisitive, repetitive and aspirational consumption. We also make the
   business case for fostering mindful consumption, and illustrate how the
   marketing function can be harnessed to successfully implement the
   customer-centric approach to sustainability.

   investigated under four data conditions: data form, brand type,
   financial performance metric, and lag structure. Using pooled data from
   125 firms (848 firm-year observations) over the period 1991-2007, 108
   path analyses were conducted to compute five path model output metrics.
   Data on these metrics were then compared for each of the data conditions
   by means of analysis of variance. Although significant relationships
   were generally observed among framework variables, study results
   differed considerably across three of the four data conditions. The
   principal take-away from the study is that the impact of marketing
   activities on firm-level financial performance is likely to be in large
   part a function of the specific research purpose and methodology
   employed. As such, the take-away has implications when interpreting
   value-relevance findings, when constructing theories involving
   market-based assets, and when designing studies to investigate
   relationships between marketing and financial performance.

   significantly greater for Japanese than for U.S. service retailers. On

AB This paper examines the relationship between extension difficulty,
   defined as the perceived difficulty of manufacturing the extension
   product, and attitudes toward brand extensions. Although extant
   literature has hitherto modeled this relationship as a simple monotonic
   relationship, a study by Bottomley and Holden (Journal of Marketing
   Research, 38(4):494-500, 2001) has questioned its empirical
   generalizability. We suggest that the relationship between extension
   difficulty and extension attitudes may be far more complex than a simple
   linear relationship. Based on theoretical evidence drawn from the
   concept of evaluation difficulty, we suggest that the relationship
   between extension difficulty and extension attitudes is best modeled as
   a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship. Further, we explore the
   specific role of perceived transferability as a moderator of this
   curvilinear relationship. Empirical tests conducted using two studies
   provide support for both the theoretical mechanism and the proposed
   hypotheses. Entry into "easy" or "extremely difficult" extension
   categories carries its own penalties while entry into "moderately
   difficult" categories appears to garner high consumer attitudes for
   brand extensions.

AB To develop appropriate theories of business relationship management we
   need to understand what types of relations exist and the differing types
   of problems they pose for the firms involved. We report the results of
   research to develop an empirically based taxonomy of buyer-seller
   business relations from data that include both buyer and seller firm
   perspectives. Cluster analysis is used to identify five types of
   relations based on measures of relationship atmosphere that share
   similarities and some important differences with previous typologies. A
   comparison of typologies shows that some obscure and confound
   relationship types by forcing them into predefined groups, that the same
   type of relationship atmosphere is compatible with more than one pattern
   of behavior and that the estimated correlations among relationship
   variables are sensitive to the mix of relations included in the sample.
   Future research that can build on this work, the challenges that this
   kind of research presents and the methodologies to help address them are
   then discussed.

AB This article develops and tests a comprehensive model of customer
   revenge that contributes to the literature in three manners. First, we
   identify the key role played by the customer's perception of a firm's
   greed-that is, an inferred negative motive about a firm's opportunistic
   intent-that dangerously energizes customer revenge. Perceived greed is
   found as the most influential cognition that leads to a customer desire
   for revenge, even after accounting for well studied cognitions (i.e.,
   fairness and blame) in the service literature. Second, we make a
   critical distinction between direct and indirect acts of revenge because
   these sets of behaviors have different repercussions-in "face-to-face"
   vs. "behind a firm's back"aEuro"that call for different interventions.
   Third, our extended model specifies the role of customer perceived power
   in predicting these types of behaviors. We find that power is
   instrumental-both as main and moderation effects-only in the case of
   direct acts of revenge (i.e., aggression and vindictive complaining).
   Power does not influence indirect revenge, however. Our model is tested
   with two field studies: (1) a study examining online public complaining,
   and (2) a multi-stage study performed after a service failure.

AB In today's retail markets, products display opaque pricing, i.e., a
   single number that provides no information about the allocation of the
   retail proceeds among agents who bring the product to market. We study
   transparent pricing, which is an alternative strategy in which
   allocation information is revealed. We differentiate transparent pricing
   from related marketing practices such as social marketing, cause-related
   marketing, and pay-what-you-want. Using controlled experiments in
   multiple product categories with diverse sampling frames, we find that
   transparent prices systematically alter consumer utility functions and
   stated choice behavior. Our results support explanations drawn from both
   neoclassical and behavioral economic theory, including inequity
   aversion, procedural justice, and altruism. Classical theory predicts
   that price transparency should have little effect on consumer behavior.
   However, results from behavioral economics suggest that consumers may
   relax "self-interest" in the face of transparent prices, leading to
   counter-intuitive preferences. For example, in one set of studies we
   observe a significant proportion of consumers selecting the more
   expensive of two replicates of the same product. In another study, a
   subset of motorists willingly pays higher gasoline taxes for the same
   gallon of gas, increasing the overall price per gallon. We explain this
   behavior via parameterized utility functions that contain both
   self-interested and other-interested components moderated by
   characteristics of the decision-maker and characteristics of the choice
   context.

AB Although firms spend more than $26 billion annually on sales contests,
   no empirical research has investigated the effects of contests on
   individual customers. While some short-term firm effects of contests
   have been documented, the impact on long-term customer value has
   remained a matter of speculation. This research investigates the
   long-term customer impact of sales contests, by applying the customer
   value framework. We add to previous research that has used customer
   value of marketing programs by employing the acquired, retained, and
   add-on framework to segment customers based on their purchase history.
   We develop hypotheses drawing on theories in the buyer behavior,
   customer loyalty, and sales management domains. By disaggregating the
   overall customer value into initial and subsequent components, we
   demonstrate a greater long-term value per customer in the retained
   customer cohort and lower short-term and long-term value per customer
   among the two other cohorts (acquired and add-on customers). There is no
   adverse impact on other drivers of customer value such as customer churn
   and purchase frequency. While our study focuses on individual customer
   effects, we note the significantly higher volume of customers during the
   contest leads to a positive aggregate-level assessment. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of our findings for managers and
   researchers.

AB Regardless of the apparent need for product eliminations, many managers
   hesitate to act as they fear deleterious effects on customer
   satisfaction and loyalty. Other managers do carry out product
   eliminations, but often fail to consider the consequences for customers
   and business relationships. Given the relevance and problems of product
   eliminations, research on this topic in general and on the consequences
   for customers and business relationships in particular is surprisingly
   scarce. Therefore, this empirical study explores how and to what extent
   the elimination of a product negatively affects customers and business
   relationships. Results indicate that eliminating a product may result in
   severe economic and psychological costs to customers, thereby seriously
   decreasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. This paper also shows that
   these costs are not exogenous in nature. Instead, depending on the
   characteristics of the eliminated product these costs are found to be
   more or less strongly driven by a company's behavior when implementing
   the elimination at the customer interface.

AB The authors fill a gap in the salesperson performance literature by
   exploring the process that salespeople follow in coordinating the
   activities of ad hoc team members during high-opportunity customer
   engagements in the business market. In a two-phase study, the authors
   conduct depth interviews with salespeople and survey sales managers from
   a Fortune-100 company to identify the processes involved in the
   coordination of expertise. In Phase I, analysis of qualitative data
   reveals that higher-performing salespeople are more likely to (1)
   consider relational as well as technical skills when matching team
   members to customer requirements, (2) attract their preferred experts to
   the team, including a member to perform the project manager role, and
   (3) define the appropriate time in the sales cycle to initiate contact
   with the customer and deploy the team to the customer organization.
   Adopting a social network perspective in Phase II, the reputation of a
   salesperson's internal working relationships and, to a lesser extent,
   the diversity and strength of their relationship ties are central in
   explaining effective coordination of expertise. In turn, coordination of
   expertise is linked to salesperson performance.

   coping responses to anger and frustration after service failure (a).
   Moreover, we examine the mitigating effect of informational support
   (i.e., explanations) on these emotions (b). With respect to (a), it is
   argued that the coincidence of anger (frustration) and high levels of
   helplessness enhances vindictive nWOM (support-seeking nWOM), whereas
   the coincidence of anger (frustration) and low levels of helplessness
   enhances vindictive complaining (problem-solving complaining). With
   respect to (b), it is argued that a retrospective explanation mitigates
   anger, whereas a prospective explanation mitigates helplessness. Using
   partial least squares modeling, these assumptions are tested and
   supported in an experiment and in a field survey with hotel guests.
   Finally, we delineate implications for theory and practice.

   and consumers. In this article, a multidimensional process view of pride
   is offered by reporting the findings of a qualitative interpretive study
   on soccer fans' possessions. Four types of pride are put into light,
   i.e., introspective, vicarious, contagious, and conspicuous. Their
   antecedents and consequences are developed. A series of theoretical and
   managerial implications are finally suggested. Making consumers proud of
   the brand/company may lead to stronger commitment and loyalty, increased
   consumption (new products, upgrades and merchandise), positive WOM, and

AB In this paper, we examine the impact of various configurations of

   of members of a health club loyalty program. Regulatory fit is
   conceptualized as both the match between types of program rewards and
   how they are communicated, as well as the congruence between reward
   types and regulatory focus as a stable, individual disposition. In two
   experimental designs, non-point reward programs offering a short-term
   cash bonus were used. The results of Study 1 suggest that regulatory fit
   has a positive impact on perceived value, exercise intentions and
   exercise intensity, but not on visit frequency. Analysis of repeated
   behavioral measures further reveals that regulatory fit has a stronger
   impact on exercise intensity over time relative to nonfit. Study 2 also
   confirms the predictive power of regulatory fit over nonfit when
   conceptualized as the match between reward type and trait regulatory
   focus.

AB Consumer researchers have yet to examine how consumers frame and deal

   for service providers seeking to effectively recover instances of
   service failure, and avoid the costs associated with increasing
   instances of consumer anger. Using a modified grounded theory approach,
   we develop a model of consumer conflict management drawing on 39
   informant accounts of service failures. The emergent model proposes that
   consumers' conflict style is related to whether conflict is framed in
   task or personal terms. Task-framed conflicts resulted in more
   productive conflict styles than those framed in personal terms. Self vs.
   other orientation moderated the relationship between conflict frame and
   conflict style. These findings help us better understand the nature of
   consumer conflict and identify the importance of carefully targeting
   service recovery efforts to reduce instances of anger.

AB Increasingly, consumers use the internet as a vehicle for pre-purchase
   information gathering. While technical specifications and potentially
   biased selling points can be gleaned from corporate web sites, online
   brand communities are becoming essential conduits for the
   customer-to-customer (C2C) sharing of product information and
   experiences. This study develops and tests a model of online C2C
   communications in developing desirable online brand community outcomes.
   Two studies were used to test the model. In Study 1, a netnography
   technique was employed and conversations between brand community members
   were coded and combined with survey data to test the research model. In
   Study 2 an experiment was conducted to further test the sequence of
   events in our base model. Our findings show that online brand
   communities are effective tools for influencing sales, regardless of
   whether these communities reside on company-owned or independently-owned
   websites. In addition, we demonstrate interesting asymmetrical effects,
   whereby the positive information shared by community members has a
   stronger moderating influence on purchase behavior than negative
   information. Further, we find that online brand communities are
   effective customer retention tools for retaining both experienced and
   novice customers. These findings highlight the need for all firms to
   carefully consider their online community strategies.

AB Although a potentially significant issue to managers and academics

   actual customer claims (Study 1), in depth customer interviews (Study 2)
   and three experimental studies (Studies 3, 4, 5), explored opportunistic
   customer claiming behavior during service recovery and yielded robust
   findings across methods, contexts and samples. Potential determinants of
   opportunistic claiming in a service recovery context were identified by
   drawing on the justice, self-concept maintenance and neutralization
   theories. The findings support the hypothesis that when experiencing
   lower distributive, procedural and interactional justice, respondents
   were more likely to be opportunistic in their claiming. Furthermore,
   consumers were more likely to be opportunistic when dealing with large
   compared to small firms, and when they were in one-time transactions
   compared to when they had an established relationship with the firm.
   Finally, increased claiming in general, and opportunistic claiming in
   particular, did not lead to increased satisfaction with the service
   recovery.

AB Considerable extant research demonstrates the benefits of trust in
   buyer-seller relationships. More recent research points out downsides of
   the vulnerability inherent with trust. Recognizing this dilemma of
   trust, partners may offset the vulnerability of trust with verification
   strategies-efforts to produce information relevant to the exchange
   relationship. This research examines the use of three types of
   verification strategies-monitoring, assurances, and corroboration-which
   may be employed to safeguard against the vulnerability of trust. When
   control mechanisms like trust and information are combined, they may
   complement one another and enhance performance or function as
   substitutes, be redundant or compete, and consequently detract from
   performance. Emerging theory on combined modes of governance provides
   insights. We draw on this theory and develop hypotheses proposing that
   combinations of trust and verification may enhance or detract exchange
   performance-depending on the specific verification strategy. The
   hypotheses are tested on a sample of 230 buyer-supplier relationships.
   Results of the research provide some support for the proposed
   relationships and yield implications for the management of cooperative
   exchange relationships.

AB Although interest regarding gender role portrayals in advertising has
   persisted for many years, the degree of gender stereotyping in
   advertising, possible changes of gender stereotyping over the years, and
   the nature of the relationship between gender stereotyping in
   advertising and role changing developments in society have not yet been
   studied in previous research. To address these issues, this study
   provides a meta-analysis of the research on gender roles in TV and radio
   advertising based on 64 primary studies. The results show that
   stereotyping is prevalent in advertising. Stereotyping occurs mainly
   related to gender's occupational status, meaning gender equality in
   advertising is least likely in an area that is the primary concern of
   gender-related politics. Stereotyping in advertising has indeed
   decreased over the years, although this decrease is almost exclusively
   due to developments in high masculinity countries. The results of a
   correlation analysis and a simultaneous equation model show that gender
   stereotyping in advertising depends on gender-related developments and
   value changes in society rather than the other way around. These results
   provide for the first time empirical support for the mirror argument
   over the mold argument in the long-standing debate about advertising's
   consequences for society. The findings further provide implications for
   researchers, public policy makers, and marketing practitioners.

AB Control and governance theories recognize that exchange partners are
   subject to two general forms of control, the unilateral authority of one
   firm and bilateral expectations extending from their social bond. In
   this way, a supplier both exerts unilateral, authority-based controls
   and is subject to socially-based, bilateral controls as it attempts to
   manage its brand successfully through reseller channels. Such control is
   being challenged by suppliers' growing relative dependence on
   increasingly dominant resellers in many industries. Yet the impact of
   supplier relative dependence on the efficacy of control-based governance
   in the supplier's channel is not well understood. To address this gap,
   we specify and test a control model moderated by relative dependence
   involving the conceptualization and measurement of governance at the
   level of specific control processes: incenting, monitoring, and
   enforcing. Our empirical findings show relative dependence undercuts the
   effectiveness of certain unilateral and bilateral control processes
   while enhancing the effectiveness of others, largely supporting our dual
   suppositions that each control process operates through a specialized
   behavioral mechanism and that these underlying mechanisms are
   differentially impacted by relative dependence. We offer implications of
   these findings for managers and identify our contributions to channel
   theory and research.

   examined the effects of brand name characteristics (association set size
   and word frequency) on memory in the presence of brand information, this
   paper also assesses brand name effects in contexts without brand related
   information and extends it to brand consideration and choice. Two
   different processes are found to be operating as consumers retrieve
   brands and make a choice. Recall seems to benefit from a distinctiveness
   based route, which also guides consideration and choice. In contrast,
   implicit memory is influenced by familiarity, with corresponding
   consideration and choice effects. The implications are that firms'
   choice of brand names and media needs to consider the combination of
   brand name characteristics that will lead to desired outcomes vis-a-vis
   distinctiveness or familiarity based processes.

AB The "concreteness" principle and the "prominence" hypothesis are used as
   a theoretical basis for hypothesizing the effects of two important
   information display factors, attribute concreteness and attribute
   prominence, on consumer selective information processing. The results of
   two studies indicate that attribute concreteness together with attribute
   correlation leads to the selective processing of attributes, while
   attribute prominence and attribute correlation results in the selective
   processing of alternatives. Moreover, selective processing mediates the
   impact of these display factors on choice, while reducing the amount of
   information search. Further, the amount of information search and
   experienced cognitive effort mediate the effects of selective processing
   on consumer affect during the search process. The research is important
   from a theoretical standpoint, because it fills an important knowledge
   gap in the literature on how information environment influences affect
   selective processing and choice. It is important from a marketing
   strategy perspective because it examines how a merchant can influence
   consumer choice by merely changing the manner in which attribute
   information is displayed or alternatives are initially organized (i.e.,
   pre-sorted).

AB The constructs of perceived control and convenience have been identified
   in previous qualitative studies of self-service technology (SST) use as
   important factors; yet empirically their effects are relatively unknown.
   Based on the theory of planned behavior, this study explores how control
   and convenience perceptions influence customers' utilitarian (speed of
   transaction) and hedonic (exploration) motivations for using an SST. In
   addition, we explore how trust in a service provider influences
   customers' future SST intentions. Two studies were undertaken to assess
   both users and nonusers' evaluations of an SST. The results revealed
   that perceived control and convenience do impact the intentions of
   customers to use an SST in the future; however, their impact was
   mediated through the constructs of speed of transaction, exploration,
   and trust. Increased control and convenience perceptions influenced
   exploration, trust and speed evaluations, which in turn were associated
   with stronger perceived value, higher SST satisfaction judgments, and
   increased SST usage intentions. Managerial implications stemming from
   the empirical findings are discussed along with directions for future
   research.

   employees and may contain information useful to employees in meeting
   customer needs. Results from a study involving a high-tech firm indicate
   that when employees believe ads are effective and value congruent, their
   customer focus increases. Pride completely mediates the effects of value
   congruence and effectiveness on customer focus. Organizational
   identification of employees generally results in a more favorable
   reaction to ads. A second study involving a regional health facility
   replicates and extends these findings to include employee portrayal
   accuracy when employees are featured in ads. Employee portrayal accuracy
   affects promise accuracy, effectiveness and value-congruence. In

AB While Wall Street closely watches financial analysts' earnings
   forecasts, Main Street often scrutinizes product quality relative to
   competition. Do firms with superior product competitiveness enjoy
   greater likelihood of beating analyst earnings target? And if so, is
   there contingency in this impact? We show that positive changes in
   product competitiveness contribute to the firm's likelihood of beating
   analyst earnings target, while negative changes in product
   competitiveness account for missed earnings target. In addition, this
   impact of product competitiveness on the likelihood of beating analyst
   earnings target is more positive in the situations of high firm future
   growth opportunity and low financial environment uncertainty. These
   findings innovatively use analyst forecast metrics to reinforce the
   relationship between product quality, competitive advantage, and
   financial performance. Our study also cultivates a contingency theory of
   the marketing-finance interface and allows marketing and finance
   executives to find common ground in strategic discourse. Overall, this

AB Given the large investments required for high-quality complaint handling
   design, managers need practical guidance in understanding its actual
   importance for their particular company. However, while prior research
   emphasizes the general relevance of complaint handling design, it fails
   to provide a more differentiated perspective on this interesting issue.
   This study, which is based on an integrative multi-level framework and a
   dyadic dataset, addresses this important gap in research. Results
   indicate that the impact of a company's complaint handling design varies
   significantly depending on the characteristics of the complaining
   customers with which the firm has to deal. Further, this paper shows
   that, contingent on these characteristics, a company's complaint
   handling design can shape complainants' fairness perceptions either
   considerably or only slightly. Overall, findings suggest that companies
   should apply an adaptive approach to complaint handling to avoid
   misallocation of attention, energy, and resources.

   simultaneous influence of service quality and customer experience on
   satisfaction is examined by means of nonlinear structural equation

   (availability, efficiency, fulfillment, and privacy) lose their
   capability to delight customers as the customer relationship matures. In
   contrast, hedonic quality attributes (design, enjoyment, and image) only
   exhibit an increasing effect on satisfaction for more experienced

AB Relationship maintenance (customer retention and exclusivity) and
   development (increased service usage and cross-buying) are top
   priorities in Customer Relationship Management. This paper examines how
   service companies can effectively influence customer patronage behaviors
   by leveraging overall customer satisfaction, trust and relationship
   commitment. Using a longitudinal design over a two-year period, we merge
   survey metrics with actual patronage behaviors taken from a bank's
   database. We show that relationship commitment just enhances retention
   and exclusivity while trust directly influences service usage and
   cross-buying. As a consequence, trust appears to be highly critical for
   service relationship development and company profits. Furthermore, trust
   and relationship commitment mediate the entire impact of satisfaction
   which appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition for
   relationship maintenance and development. Satisfaction, and more
   generally service evaluations, must be efficiently converted into trust
   and relationship commitment before providing business results. Finally,
   we establish the temporal antecedence and the predictive power of trust
   and relationship commitment. Relationship commitment in year t predicts
   the number of service providers in year t + 1 (exclusivity vs.
   polygamy), while trust in year t predicts the number of bank products
   (cross-buying) as well as the service usage level in year t + 1. We then
   discuss managerial implications for customer relationship maintenance
   and development.

   the differential impact of CRM in diverse industry environments. The
   study analyzes data from in-depth field interviews and a large-scale,

AB Previous research in the product failure literature shows that such
   failures have important implications for evaluations of the target
   product, and even for evaluations of closely related products. The
   current studies identify distrust as an additional byproduct of negative
   expectancy disconfirmation and show that such perceptions are capable of
   producing even broader carryover effects-pertaining to unrelated
   products/companies. The effects of distrust are identified through tests
   of mediation and moderation, and are shown to be distinct from other
   processes known to relate to product failure. The results also show an
   asymmetry in the effects of positive and negative disconfirmation,
   consistent with the predicted negativity bias in judgments of
   generalized trust versus generalized distrust. Finally, generalized
   distrust continued to exert a negative influence despite the opportunity
   to directly examine the second product, and these effects were actually
   augmented to some extent. The results have implications for the
   expectancy disconfirmation and product failure literatures, as well as
   the defensive bias model of distrust.

AB Personal selling is thought to be a very effective marketing vehicle.
   The notion of adaptive selling suggests that it should work better than
   any other means of communication because salespeople are able to develop
   a unique message for each customer. This research proposes a model of
   key antecedents and consequences of adaptive selling. In particular, we
   distinguish, measure, and model the attitudinal and behavioral aspects
   of adaptive selling, something that is encouraged but not thoroughly
   examined in the literature. Hypotheses are tested using data from 210
   salesperson-customer dyads. The results indicate that a salesperson's
   perception of the firm's customer orientation has an effect on adaptive
   selling behavior through the salesperson's adaptive selling confidence,
   role ambiguity, intrinsic motivation and customer-qualification skills.
   Adaptive selling behavior increases salesperson's outcome performance,
   customers' evaluations of satisfaction with the product and with the
   salesperson, which enhance customers' anticipation of future
   interactions with the salesperson. The implications for management and
   theory are discussed.

AB Consumer sales promotions are usually the result of the decisions of two
   marketing channel parties, the manufacturer and the retailer. In making
   these decisions, each party normally follows its own interest: i.e.
   maximizes its own profit. Unfortunately, this results in a suboptimal
   outcome for the channel as a whole. Independent profit maximization by
   channel parties leads to a lack of channel coordination with the
   implication of leaving money on the table. This may well contribute to
   the notoriously low profitability of sales promotions. This paper first
   shows analytically why the suboptimality occurs, and then presents an
   empirical demonstration, using a unique dataset from an Efficient
   Consumer Response (ECR) project; ECR is a movement in which parties work
   together to optimize the distribution channel). In this dataset, actual
   profit is only a small fraction of potential profit, implying that there
   is a large degree of suboptimality. It is important that (1) channel
   parties are aware of this suboptimality; and (2) that they have tools to
   deal with it. Solutions to the channel coordination problem should
   ensure that the goals of the individual channel parties are aligned with
   the goals of the channel as a whole. The paper proposes one particular
   agreement for this purpose, called proportional discount sharing.
   Application to the ECR data shows a win-win result for both the
   manufacturer and the retailer. Recognition of the channel coordination
   problem by the manufacturer and the retailer is the necessary starting
   point for agreeing on a way of solving it in a win-win fashion.

   It also proposes a definition for marketing strategy, the focal

   of foundational premises of marketing strategy. The domain of strategic
   marketing is viewed as encompassing the study of organizational,
   inter-organizational and environmental phenomena concerned with (1) the
   behavior of organizations in the marketplace in their interactions with
   consumers, customers, competitors and other external constituencies, in
   the context of creation, communication and delivery of products that
   offer value to customers in exchanges with organizations, and (2) the
   general management responsibilities associated with the boundary
   spanning role of the marketing function in organizations. At the
   broadest level, marketing strategy can be defined as an organization's
   integrated pattern of decisions that specify its crucial choices
   concerning products, markets, marketing activities and marketing
   resources in the creation, communication and/or delivery of products
   that offer value to customers in exchanges with the organization and
   thereby enables the organization to achieve specific objectives. Chief
   among the issues that are fundamental to strategic marketing as a field

   is influenced by demand side factors and supply side factors.

AB Drawing from transaction cost economics (TCE), the knowledge-based view
   (KBV), and real options theory (ROT), we propose that the general
   alliance experience of alliance partner firms moderates the impact of
   market uncertainty and alliance-specific uncertainty on the benefits and
   costs of the two marketing alliance governance modes, i.e., non-equity
   alliances and joint ventures. Based on our systematic study of 18,616
   marketing alliances occurring in 48 industries across 164 countries
   between 1992 and 2008, we find general alliance experience significantly
   moderates firms' marketing alliance governance mode choices. Our
   framework reconciles some contradictory empirical results in the
   interfirm relationship governance structure literature by emphasizing
   the moderating role of partner firms' general alliance experience.
   Specifically, when alliances can be characterized has having a large
   cultural distance between the partners or having a market with a broad
   geographic scope, it seems that TCE predictions regarding the marketing
   alliance governance mode choice hold for inexperienced firms while KBV
   and ROT predictions hold for experienced firms. In addition, by
   incorporating key aspects of all three theories, our proposed framework
   has the potential to provide deeper insights into the role of alliance
   experience and uncertainty in firms' marketing alliance governance mode
   choices.

   adoption. We introduce a new perspective using a multilevel framework of

   that coworkers' and superiors' SFA adoption has a positive effect on

AB Academics as well as managers have long been interested in the role of
   satisfaction with complaint handling (SATCOM) in shaping customers'
   attitudes and repurchasing decisions. This interest has generated a
   widespread belief that SATCOM is driven by the perception that the
   complaint handling process is just. To test how SATCOM is modulated by
   distributive, interactional, or procedural justice, we performed a
   meta-analysis of 60 independent studies of the antecedents and
   consequences of SATCOM. Results indicate that SATCOM is affected most by
   distributive justice, then by interactional justice, and only weakly by
   procedural justice. We also find that SATCOM mediates the effects of
   justice dimensions on word-of-mouth. However, contrary to common belief,
   SATCOM does not mediate the effects of justice dimensions on overall
   satisfaction and return intent. We draw on our results to suggest
   several avenues for further research.

AB Salesperson learning has the potential to contribute to the competitive
   advantage of the firm by increasing its capacity for organizational
   learning. The relationship between employee and organizational learning
   is often taken-for-granted, yet the relationship between the two is
   complicated. The transfer of individual learning to the organizational
   level can not always be assumed. The authors examine this relationship,
   focusing on the facilitating role of organizational climate for learning
   and information dissemination efficiency in translating salesperson
   learning to organizational learning. The model, tested using a sample of
   422 respondents from 113 retail stores in a national chain, is partly
   supported. Individual learning was found to be postitively associated
   with organizational learning and organizational climate for learning had
   a positive moderating effect on this relationship. The hypothesized
   moderating effect of information dissemination efficiency was
   insignificant. Implications for theory and management are discussed.

AB This article addresses a growing dilemma surrounding the strategic value
   of perceived brand foreignness (PBF) among consumers in emerging
   economies. Building on recent research evidence from the brand origin
   literature, we introduce the concept of confidence in brand origin
   identification (CBO) and theorize its moderating impact on the value of
   PBF in explaining and predicting brand evaluation. Using a multi-level
   modeling technique, this study provides evidence showing that CBO
   moderates the effect of PBF on consumer evaluations of brand value.
   Moreover, the moderating influence of CBO is found to be more profound
   for local than for foreign brands. Managerial implications for building
   both global and local brands in emerging markets are discussed.

AB Companies today face the challenge not only of designing innovative
   customer-focused service strategies to compete and grow but also of
   translating such strategies into results through successful execution.
   Experience and research demonstrate the difficulty of such an execution,
   but little research in marketing has focused on strategy implementation,
   particularly at the employee level. Prior research has suggested that
   frontline employee participation is critical to successful innovation
   implementation, especially in service contexts. We develop a theoretical
   model to investigate the complex role of motivation in engaging employee
   participation in service innovation implementation and test it with
   field data from a real-world context. The study contributes to
   motivation research in marketing by adapting and extending a
   hierarchical conceptualization from psychology that incorporates three
   levels of motivation: global, contextual, and situational. We also
   investigate the antecedents managers can control to increase employee
   motivation to participate in implementation efforts and subsequently to
   improve participation behaviors that are critical to the successful
   implementation of a customer service innovation.

AB Despite placing items in virtual shopping carts, online shoppers
   frequently abandon them -an issue that perplexes online retailers and
   has yet to be explained by scholars. Here, we identify key drivers to
   online cart abandonment and suggest cognitive and behavioral reasons for
   this non-buyer behavior. We show that the factors influencing consumer
   online search, consideration, and evaluation play a larger role in cart
   abandonment than factors at the purchase decision stage. In particular,
   many customers use online carts for entertainment or as a shopping
   research and organizational tool, which may induce them to buy at a
   later session or via another channel. Our framework extends theories of
   online buyer and non-buyer behavior while revealing new inhibitors to
   buying in the Internet era. The findings offer scholars a broad
   explanation of consumer motivations for cart abandonment. For retailers,
   the authors provide suggestions to improve purchase conversion rates and
   multi-channel management.

AB Strategy identifies two primary sets of processes through which the firm
   creates value for its customers by moving goods and information through
   marketing channels: demand-focused and supply-focused processes.
   Historically, firms have invested resources to develop a core
   differential advantage in one or other of these areas-but rarely in
   both-often resulting in mismatches between demand (what customers want)
   and supply (what is available in the marketplace). This paper suggests
   that successfully managing the supply chain to create customer value
   requires extensive integration between demand-focused processes and
   supply-focused processes that is based on a foundation of value creation
   through intraorganizational knowledge management. Integrating demand and
   supply processes helps firms prioritize and ensure fulfillment based
   upon the shared generation, dissemination, interpretation and
   application of real-time customer demand as well as ongoing supply
   capacity constraints. We draw upon literature in marketing, logistics,
   supply chain management and strategy to introduce a conceptual framework
   of demand and supply integration (DSI). We also offer insights for
   managerial practice and an agenda for future research in the relatively
   under-researched, but strategically important, area of demand and supply
   integration.

   Drawing on the resource-advantage theory of competition, we develop and
   test a model that proposes market-oriented IT competence as a mediator
   of the effects of a firm's IT infrastructure on market information flow
   which, in turn, yields comparative advantages in supply chain
   relationships. Market-oriented IT competence is conceptualized as a
   firm's ability to deploy an IT infrastructure in support of the
   organization-wide collection, dissemination and use of market
   information to respond to market needs. We test the effects of
   market-oriented IT competence using data collected from managers in the

   competence is a critical link between IT infrastructure and comparative

AB This research examines whether suppliers' capabilities impact OEM
   customers' dependence on the supplier and thereby generate customer
   loyalty. Using a sample of purchasing managers focusing on a single key
   component supplier, we examine three supplier capabilities, two
   dependence dimensions, and three aspects of customer loyalty. Core
   offering capability increases the customer firm's benefit-based
   dependence. Operations capability has a more comprehensive effect,
   enhancing both benefit-based and cost-based dependence. Benefit-based
   dependence leads to relational loyalty and, through its effect on
   relational loyalty, to insensitivity to competitive offerings and future
   purchase expansion. Cost-based dependence motivates insensitivity to
   competitive offerings, but does not affect relational loyalty or
   purchase expansion. The supplier's communication capability is
   associated with relational loyalty, but this effect does not flow
   through the customer firm's dependence. The divergent pattern of
   antecedents and effects of benefit-based dependence and cost-based
   dependence may explain the inconsistent and insignificant research
   findings in previous research on dependence. Our results suggest that
   adopting a bi-dimensional model of dependence more fully captures the
   theoretical domain of dependence, thereby permitting researchers to
   better examine its role in supply chain, channel, and marketing
   relationships.

AB Given that the impact of retail shelf facings and price on a product's
   market share is of substantial interest to marketing managers in the
   retail supply chain, we examine whether these relationships may be
   interdependent with the firm's supply chain activities. We offer
   predictions regarding the interdependence of the marketing and supply
   chain variables using monthly in-store observations from 62 different
   retail stores from five different chains, taken over a 24-month period.
   The in-store observations included price and number of facings, which is
   combined with data obtained from the manufacturer on case pack quantity
   and market share data from the ACNielsen HomeScan consumer scanner
   panel. Results indicate that shelf facings impact the effects of price
   and case pack quantity on market share. In addition, we explore the
   strength of relationships across retailers employing everyday low price
   versus HiLo pricing strategies. Generally, our findings suggest that
   retailers and suppliers must work to integrate marketing activities and
   supply chain processes both within and across firms to most effectively
   serve the consumer at the retail shelf and increase market share.

AB Transaction cost analysis (TCA) has inspired many empirical studies in
   marketing channels and business-to-business marketing. However, the vast
   majority of these studies have been conducted within the context of a
   single nation, making it hard to determine whether the empirical
   relationships derived from the framework are universal. Highlighting the
   influence of the national context in which the economic exchange
   relationship is embedded, we elaborate on the manner by which one form
   of transaction costs, namely, coordination costs, can be both a direct
   and an indirect function of two key governance challenges: safeguarding
   and adaptation. Taking a middle-range approach, we propose that the
   process by which coordination costs are evoked is a combination of
   context-excluded and context-embedded links. The hypothesized
   relationships are tested with data collected in parallel national
   surveys of industrial distributors in two large national economies with
   different cultures: the United States and Japan. The results support our
   predictions of both context-excluded and context-embedded links with the
   exception of the effect of environmental volatility.

AB As a result of weakening brand image/loyalty, little differentiation,
   and intense price competition, manufacturers are now increasingly
   pressed to ensure retailers' shelf space and/or salesperson attention.
   This research contributes to the literature by empirically examining an
   underrepresented body of literature in the B2B context-retailer loyalty.
   Specifically, this study fills a gap by investigating retailer
   evaluations of the technical and relational dimensions of a
   manufacturer's order fulfillment service quality as predictors of
   retailer satisfaction, affective versus calculative commitment, and
   ultimately loyalty behavior. Results suggest that both technical and
   relational order fulfillment service quality influence satisfaction,
   which in turn positively affects both affective and calculative
   commitment. By separating the affective and calculative dimensions,
   loyalty behavior is associated directly only with affective commitment.
   Further examination reveals that relational order fulfillment service
   quality has a direct impact on affective commitment. When the sample was
   split based on "share of wallet," results suggest that satisfaction
   impacts both affective and calculative commitment, regardless of "share
   of wallet." For "high share" retailers, the positive relationship of
   calculative to affective commitment creates an indirect route (through
   affective commitment) by which calculative commitment affects behavioral

AB After studying the effects of Louisiana's post-hurricane "thank you"
   campaigns, the researchers find expressions of gratitude significantly
   improve perceptions of Louisiana in the midst of its recovery. Through a
   national survey conducted November 2006, they find that those who saw or
   heard a thank you advertisement have more positive attitudes toward the
   state and its people, a greater willingness to pay a premium for its
   products, services and travel to the state, and spread positive
   word-of-mouth, thus justifying the use of public funds to support the
   campaign. The authors investigate the role of participation on the
   effectiveness of expressions of gratitude and identify the mediating
   role of affective commitment in driving the positive results attributed
   to expressions of gratitude.

   demonstrate the differential impact of team environmental stewardship on
   customer satisfaction ratings and sales. Furthermore, the results reveal
   lagged individual-level effects of autonomy and supervisory support on
   environmental stewardship, as well as lagged group-level effects of past

   differentially moderate antecedent-stewardship relationships. Whereas
   within-team consensus strengthens the impact of past satisfaction

AB This paper demonstrates the relevance of consumers' susceptibility to
   interpersonal influence (CSII) in an investment context. In Study 1, a
   survey of individual investors, investment-related knowledge,
   psycho-social risks, and social needs emerge as antecedents that explain
   investors' susceptibility to informational and normative influence. In
   turn, susceptibility to normative influences increases transaction
   frequency, whereas susceptibility to informational influences decreases
   transaction frequency. The experiments in Studies 2 and 3 indicate the
   impact of interpersonal influences on consumers' investment decisions in
   a voluntary (free choice) and involuntary (confrontation) setting and
   check whether CSII moderates the impact of interpersonal influences.
   Consumers' investment choices are consistently influenced by the
   information and opinions of others, whereas CSII only strengthens the
   impact of interpersonal influence in a voluntary informational setting.

AB Since sponsoring is an increasingly important marketing communication
   medium, it is important for managers to know whether their sponsorships
   are giving a good financial return relative to other communication
   alternatives. Although several "rules of thumb" are commonly used in the
   industry for converting sponsorship exposure time into television
   advertising equivalent values, this research is the first to empirically
   test them by means of two experiments employing realistic stimuli and
   representative samples. Across 6 stimuli brands, study 1 finds that an
   average of 127 s of sponsor logo exposure achieves the same effects as a
   30 s TV ad, but variance around this figure is high and depends on a
   variety of factors such as communication goal, sponsor fit, type of
   exposure, and whether the sponsor is a known brand. Study 2 finds that
   combining sponsoring with television advertising does increase the
   effects of sponsoring, although effects vary widely depending on the
   context, but even in the best case the increase is not supportive of the
   high levels of advertising suggested by many industry experts. Overall,
   the findings will allow managers to more confidently assess the
   financial value of their sponsorship investments.

AB The past several decades have witnessed the rapid globalization of
   consumption markets and widespread diffusion of information and
   communication technologies. However, the use of technology by consumers
   is not a foregone conclusion. We investigate the role of global
   self-identity on the orientation toward technology readiness and usage.
   Relying on a social-identity model of motivation as our theoretical
   framework, we propose a model which incorporates global self-identity
   (i.e., cosmopolitanism/parochialism and global/local identification) and
   self-regulation (i.e., promotion and prevention focus) in predicting
   technology readiness and usage in a self-service technology context. The
   proposed model is tested in two different cultures, the U.S. and China,
   and is contrasted with two theoretically-competing models as well.
   Results provide support for the hypothesized model, and a number of
   limitations, implications, and directions for future research are
   discussed.

AB This research examines the roles of strategic 'fit' versus execution
   proficiency in creating superior performance for new products.
   Specifically, we compare main effects versus moderation effects models
   of execution proficiency within a resource-based view (RBV) framework.
   Four new product success dimensions are outcomes. Marketing 'fit' and
   technological 'fit' are viewed as resource fit advantages and are
   antecedents in the model; marketing versus technical execution
   proficiencies relate to the project's execution. The results show that
   the proficiencies-as-moderators model is the better fitting one;
   marketing but not technical proficiency is the key moderator. The
   results regarding resource fit advantage show that (1) both marketing
   fit and technological fit were positively related directly to
   profitability and to new product advantage; (2) marketing fit had direct
   positive effects on customer need met; and (3) neither marketing fit nor
   technological fit predicted speed. Concerning execution proficiencies:
   (1) technical execution proficiencies led to higher profitability and
   customer needs met, as well as speed; and (2) marketing execution
   proficiency was the only construct that led directly to increased
   success on all four dimensions examined in this research. Overall,
   support was found for the general premise that both marketing and
   technological resource fit advantages and marketing and technical
   execution proficiencies are significant predictors of new product
   success factors, with marketing proficiencies having additional
   moderating effects on the relationship of resource fit to performance.

   that at higher levels of social interaction, the positive relationship
   between task conflict and innovation is stronger, and so is the negative
   relationship between relationship conflict and innovation. Furthermore,
   at higher levels of trust, the positive relationship between task
   conflict and innovation weakens. This study adds to the emerging

AB Despite the high practical relevance, prior research does not provide a
   clear picture whether the effectiveness of new product preannouncements
   is contingent upon order of entry and whether the message content of
   preannouncements for pioneering products should be different from those
   for followers. Drawing on diffusion research, the authors examine how
   preannouncements that focus on risk reduction and the product's relative
   advantage influence the relationship between preannouncement intensity
   and new product success, taking into account order of entry. A
   cross-industry study investigating 151 new product launches shows that
   for pioneers, a message focus aimed at reducing perceived product risk
   positively influences preannouncement effectiveness. Furthermore, a
   relative advantage focus negatively affects preannouncement
   effectiveness and thus is rather counterproductive for pioneers. With
   regard to early followers, results indicate a positive influence of a
   risk reduction focus on preannouncement effectiveness. A relative
   advantage focus, however, is only effective if the product category is
   already established when the early follower product is launched.
   Finally, for late followers, only preannouncements which strongly
   emphasize the relative product advantage lead to a positive effect of
   preannouncements on new product success.

AB The meanings of brand and branding have been evolving over the past
   several decades. This evolution is converging on a new conceptual logic,
   which views brand in terms of collaborative, value co-creation
   activities of firms and all of their stakeholders and brand value in
   terms of the stakeholders' collectively perceived value-in-use. The
   authors argue that this new logic parallels and reflects the related,
   evolving service-dominant (S-D) logic in marketing. They provide an
   historical account of the branding literature, organize it into eras,
   and connect it to the evolution in marketing as captured by S-D logic.
   The analysis provides further support for the S-D logic of marketing and
   suggests a related research agenda for furthering the understanding of
   brand and branding. It also suggests that marketing managers might
   benefit from investing resources in building strong brand relationships
   with all of their stakeholders and a service-dominant firm philosophy
   built around brand value co-creation.

   examines the impact of loyalty programs, which target existing

   heavier, more frequent customers of a store enroll in the loyalty

AB This research examines how consumers update their brand personality
   impressions and brand attitudes after interacting with one of the
   brand's employees. Drawing on stereotyping theory, the author develops a
   framework that proposes that the impact of an employee's behavior
   depends on how the employee is categorized. When the employee is
   considered primarily as an exemplar of the brand's workforce, his or her
   behavior is generalized more strongly to the brand. When, however, the
   employee is judged as a relatively unique individual (i.e., when the
   employee is subtyped), the behavior is not transferred to the brand to
   the full extent. The results of three studies provide converging
   evidence and show that the degree to which consumers subtype an employee
   is determined by the amount of information they possess about the
   employee, the extent to which they depend on the employee, and their
   motivation to form an accurate impression. The findings have direct
   implications for marketers interested in understanding how employees
   affect the brands they represent.

   (Srivastava et al. Journal of Marketing 62:2-18, 1998; Journal of
   Marketing 63:168-179, 1999). Using a resource based view of the firm,
   the present study proposes that (1) market-based assets and capabilities
   of a firm impacts (2) performance in three market-facing business
   processes (new product development, supply-chain and customer
   management), which in turn, influence (3) the firm's financial
   performance. It develops related hypotheses and tests the framework
   empirically. The study also examines for the first time the
   interrelationship among the three business processes and their impact on
   the market value of firms. Further, the study examines the moderating
   influence of two organizational variables-size and age of the firm.
   Overall, the major contribution of the study is that it offers a process
   linkage between capabilities, process performance and financial
   performance. The results of this research will provide strategic

AB Issues in evaluating marketing performance and devising appropriate

   practice in recent years. We propose an empirical model that enables a
   multinational enterprise (MNE) to assess the marketing performance of
   its subsidiaries, taking into explicit consideration the fact that
   tactical actions by subsidiaries contribute to the creation of assets
   that can be harnessed for marketing outcomes. Thus, our model captures
   the asset creation abilities of marketing expenditures and also takes in
   to account the environmental differences of the context in which each
   MNE subsidiary operates. We evaluate comparative, overall, and
   process-level (creation of market assets and market yield) marketing
   performance in the context of multi-country operations. This
   simultaneous examination of marketing process and marketing outcome
   performance enables a global corporation to gain strategic, operational,
   and diagnostic insights into the performance of its subsidiaries. Our
   approach is empirically illustrated with an evaluation of the marketing
   performance of subsidiaries of a large global corporation.

AB Existing studies of market orientation have hypothesized that the
   strength of the market orientation/performance relationship depends on
   environmental variables such as market turbulence, technological
   turbulence, and competitive intensity. To date most empirical studies
   have failed to confirm these hypotheses; however, these studies (1)
   assumed that performance is a linear function of the achieved level of
   market orientation and (2) tested whether environmental uncertainty
   moderates this relationship. A complementary explanation for the impact
   of environmental variables on a firm's market orientation arises from
   studies of organizational behavior that link the need for coordination
   and control to environmental uncertainty and organizational strategy.
   Building on this perspective, the authors argue that (1) environmental
   uncertainty influences the desired level of market orientation and (2)
   the gap between the desired and achieved levels of market orientation
   influence business unit performance. The authors test these hypotheses
   with data collected from multiple respondents in 308 US firms. The data
   analysis confirms that the desired level of market orientation is a
   function of market turbulence, competitive intensity, technological
   turbulence, and innovation strategy. In addition, the desired level of
   market orientation positively influences the achieved level. Finally,
   when the achieved level of market orientation is less than the desired
   level, business unit performance is a negative function of the gap
   between the desired and achieved levels of market orientation.

AB We explore superstitious beliefs as a basis of product performance
   expectations and their impact on initial purchase likelihood and
   subsequent satisfaction. In doing so, we demonstrate instances when
   superstition-driven expectations cause consumers to make purchase
   decisions that run counter to economic rationality. In the first set of
   studies we find that Taiwanese consumers are relatively more likely to
   purchase a product with positive superstitious associations based on its
   "lucky" color, and are more likely to purchase and are willing to pay
   more money for a product with a smaller but "lucky" number of units
   contained in the package (e.g., eight tennis balls compared to ten). In
   contrast, consumers who do not hold such superstitious beliefs adhere to
   the more rational choice paradigm. Next, we show that the differences in
   purchase likelihood are driven by superstition-based performance
   expectations. We further generalize these findings to product
   satisfaction, and find support for expectation disconfirmation
   sensitivity as a moderator of the effect.

   influence their evaluation of corporate social responsibility (CSR)
   efforts. The study reveals the mediating role of consumer trust in CSR
   evaluation frameworks; managers should monitor consumer trust, which
   seems to be an important subprocess regulating the effect of consumer
   attributions on patronage and recommendation intentions. Further,
   managers may allay the negative effects of profit-motivated giving by
   doing well on service quality perceptions. On the other hand,
   appropriately motivated giving continues to positively affect trust
   regardless of the performance of the firm on service quality provision.

AB Prior research has demonstrated that consumers who take an opportunity
   and are satisfied (satisfied takers) are likely to avail of a future
   opportunity when it is presented again but those who forsake an
   opportunity and experience regret (regretful forsakers) are less likely
   to do so, exhibiting inaction inertia. In this research we demonstrate
   when and why regret for inaction may result in the intent to avail of a
   future opportunity and compare this intent with that of satisfied
   consumers. Specifically, we demonstrate in two studies that (1) when
   consumers forgo an opportunity and experience regret, they are motivated
   to avail of a similar opportunity when it is presented in the future,
   and (2) this intent by regretful forsakers may be more intense than that
   experienced by satisfied customers due to the elicitation of mental
   imagery regarding the anticipated consumption episode.

AB This meta-analysis combines 369 correlations on the effects of humor in
   advertising and thus quantifies, updates, and expands previous
   literature reviews on the effects of humor in advertising. In line with
   previous reviews, the meta-analytic correlations demonstrate that humor
   in advertising significantly enhances A(AD), attention, and positive
   affect. Contrary to the assumptions of previous reviews, there is no
   evidence that humor impacts positive or negative cognitions, and liking
   of the advertiser. The meta-analytic findings clarify some ambiguous
   prior conclusions: humor significantly reduces source credibility,
   enhances positive affect, A(BR) and purchase intention. The decline from
   lower order to higher order communication effects is particularly
   strong, with the effect size of the impact of humor on A(AD) being twice
   as large as the effect size for A(BR). This impact of humor in
   advertising has been rather stable over the past decades. A moderator
   analysis reveals, however, that the findings of academic humor research
   are somewhat biased. As for the underlying theory, the positive and
   linear relationship between the funniness of the ad and brand attitudes
   supports an affective mechanism underlying the impact of humor in
   advertising.

AB The marketing discipline's knowledge about the drivers of service
   customers' repeat purchase behavior is highly fragmented. This research
   attempts to overcome that fragmented state of knowledge by making major
   advances toward a theory of repeat purchase drivers for consumer
   services. Drawing on means-end theory, the authors develop a
   hierarchical classification scheme that organizes repeat purchase
   drivers into an integrative and comprehensive framework. They then
   identify drivers on the basis of 188 face-to-face laddering interviews
   in two countries (USA and Germany) and assess the drivers' importance
   and interrelations through a national probability sample survey of 618
   service customers. In addition to presenting an exhaustive and coherent
   set of hierarchical repeat-purchase drivers, the authors provide
   theoretical explanations for how and why drivers relate to one another
   and to repeat purchase behavior. This research also tests the boundary
   conditions of the proposed framework by accounting for different service
   types. In addition to its theoretical contribution, the framework
   provides companies with specific information about how to manage
   long-term customer relationships successfully.

AB In this paper we assess the reading preference for marketing journals by
   deriving a journal utility scale based on click responses to table of
   contents postings to the ELMAR virtual community. Use of ELMAR data
   provides a unique window into journal importance, allowing us to look at
   table of contents reading behavior rather than citing behavior or
   attitudinal constructs as has been the case in previous studies. At the
   time of the study, there were more than 5,100 ELMAR subscribers, easily
   making this the largest journal ranking study ever undertaken. The
   external validity of our sample is high since ELMAR subscribers include
   a high percentage of the population of those interested in scholarly
   research in marketing. Our results are based on actual choice behavior
   of subscribers as they simply decide what tables of contents to read.
   The list of journals included in the study contains 165 different titles
   posted during the study period, which spanned a year. During that period
   there were multiple issues posted of these 165 journals, resulting in a
   replicated field study with high reliability. In fact, our journal
   reading utility measurement yielded a model with an R-2 value of .95. We
   use this model to suggest ways that researchers might come to a richer
   understanding of the journal consumption process.

   whether the current "theory of marketing" still fits in a world of rapid
   change. The author examines how Drucker challenged the theory of
   business at financial services firm Edward Jones, helping to identify
   new market opportunities. For example, he urged the company to move into
   metropolitan areas, which now account for 60 percent of the firm's
   business. The article then considers how the field of marketing needs to
   reexamine its own mental models. Finally, the article considers how
   Drucker's seminal insights on marketing, particularly his emphasis on an
   interdisciplinary approach, might point the way to new approaches.

AB This paper uses an institutional perspective to analyze Peter Drucker's
   contributions to management, marketing and marketing strategy. Drucker
   recognizes the importance of institutions in society. Further, his work
   reflects a variety of institutional views from sociology, economics and
   marketing. Drucker uses a form of comparative institutional analysis for
   evaluating both management and strategy issues. At the heart of each
   institutional comparison is the customer and the value created for the
   customer by the organization. Institutional comparisons help managers
   understand how the organization can create customers by adjusting its
   customer value proposition. Drucker influences marketers by focusing on
   how the organization's values are used to develop the organization's
   customer value proposition. Further, it is shown that the organization's
   values and its customer value propositions are manifested in its
   transaction rules, termed marketing institutions. Based on Drucker's
   work, a framework for comparing marketing institutions is introduced:
   the value leadership framework.

AB In 1954, Drucker boldly declared that organizations have only two basic
   functions, marketing and innovation. While true for any organization,
   this insight is particularly pertinent for technology-based businesses.
   The complicated environment surrounding high-tech companies creates a
   great need for sophisticated marketing. Yet these companies continue to
   have under-developed competencies in marketing and in understanding
   customer needs. This essay explores Drucker's insights with respect to
   two particularly salient issues for high-tech companies: developing and
   implementing a market orientation and break-through innovations. We
   review Drucker's insights and synthesize them with the scholarly
   research on these issues. Finally, we discuss three emerging areas in
   high-tech marketing where academics and managers could build on
   Drucker's insights to guide future research and practice: market
   driving, customer co-creation, and corporate social responsibility.
   These illustrative examples highlight that even today, Drucker's
   writings continue to offer remarkable guidance to scholars and managers
   who are willing to take the time to reflect, understand, and incorporate
   his insights in the unique context of high-tech industries.

AB Many Studies have proposed the use of the relationship metaphor to
   enhance the understanding of the relationship between consumers and
   brands. However, few studies have empirically tested consumer-brand
   relationship models. In this paper, the authors argue that the success
   of developing empirical models of consumer-brand relationships depends
   on the adequacy of the metaphoric transfer. The authors compare two
   models of consumer-brand relationships-the brand relationship quality
   (BRQ) model and the relationship investment (RI) model on the basis of
   empirical fit and model interpretation. They modify both models to
   better accommodate less involving relationships and test them in two
   studies. The findings suggest that the modified RI model offers a
   straightforward interpretation of consumer-brand relationships that vary
   in intensity. The results from the BRQ model are less clear, though
   further refinements of the model demonstrates the increased potential of
   the BRQ model compared with traditional attitude models to explain
   relationships between consumers and brands.

AB Researchers have typically studied the relationship between technology
   alliances and market value from a direct tie or dyadic perspective. Yet
   any given technology alliance is typically embedded in a network of
   indirect ties created by the alliance partners' relationships with other
   firms. We argue that whether an indirect tie enhances or detracts from
   the market value a firm creates in a technology alliance depends upon
   factors related to inter-firm competencies at both an alliance- and
   partner-level of analysis. Empirical analysis of abnormal stock returns
   reveals support for the hypothesized contingent relationship between
   indirect ties and value creation within technology alliances.
   Theoretically, the paper clarifies opposing perspectives in the
   literature regarding the performance implications of indirect ties and
   identifies market value as a hitherto unrecognized effect associated
   with this type of tie. Managerially, the findings improve marketers'
   ability to leverage the complex interactions that occur between
   technology alliances in a value-creating manner.

AB The aim of this study is to identify the organizational and
   communication antecedents, and evaluate the consequences on relative
   product and service characteristics, of the use of service-sourced
   information by product designers during new product development. An
   empirical study of 121 product design managers demonstrates that a
   firm's market orientation is improved by a healthy working relationship
   between product designers and service employees. Such a relationship
   motivates designers to use service-sourced information disseminated to
   them, enhancing both product and service characteristics of the new
   offering. The authors discuss how communication channels and information
   content affect the information use of product designers. Product
   designers value written information most. Information use does not
   relate to the frequency of receiving verbal or electronic information.
   Information about product ergonomics positively influences product
   designers' perceptions of the information, whereas information on
   product aesthetics negatively influences their perceptions.

   influence of incidental affect on preference for the status quo. The
   first and second experiments, each using different affect induction
   methods, demonstrated that positive affect increased and negative affect
   reduced the choice of the status quo alternative. The third experiment
   replicated the effect of incidental affect on a separate dimension of
   status quo bias, the preference of omission. The last experiment
   investigated whether preference for the status quo was affected by four
   specific emotions that differed along valence and certainty appraisal
   dimensions. Compared with affective states associated with uncertainty,
   affective states associated with certainty led to a greater magnitude of
   status quo bias. The certainty appraisals mediated the effect of
   specific emotions on preference for the status quo, regardless of the
   emotion valence. The findings extend our knowledge by showing that
   incidental affect can influence consumer choice through emotion-related
   appraisals.

AB Database marketers often use a scoring model to predict the likely value
   of contacting customers based on their purchase histories and
   demographics. However, when purchase history has been a partial result
   of the firm's own contacting efforts, these contacts should also be
   accounted for in the scoring model. The current work extends the
   existing literature to account for the firm's contacts by focusing on
   each customer's most recent purchase. Contacts prior to that purchase
   are designated "prior contacts" and those after that purchase "recent
   contacts." A new latent variables formulation of the customer's
   propensity to respond is used to predict the likelihood and time of
   response as well as the relationship to the independent variables. The
   methodology also addresses the statistical problems of "selection bias"
   and "endogeneity," which have been largely ignored in most customer
   scoring models. An application to the database of a charitable
   organization confirms that, in this case: (1) the effect of the firm's
   customer contact efforts is associated with a stronger propensity to
   respond than is the case for the included demographics; (2) the firm's
   "recent contact" efforts are associated with larger returns in
   customers' propensity to respond than the "prior contact" efforts; and
   (3) the "recent contact" efforts are associated with an at-first
   increasing but then diminishing propensity to respond up to a point
   beyond which actual decreasing returns are observed with further
   contacts. Clearly, too much contacting can alienate would-be donors. The
   proposed model is general enough to calibrate such impacts in other
   database marketing applications where the relative effects might be
   different.

AB This article investigates the role of contextual cues in the evaluation
   of a service failure. Empirical data demonstrates that although
   discrimination is a factor in the evaluation of a service failure for
   black (vs. white) customers, contextual cues also play a role in the
   evaluation of the encounter. When a black customer experiences a service
   failure, the failure will be evaluated more severely when no other black
   customers are present. In addition, the context of the event
   differentially affects the negative emotions generated by the service
   failure and results in racially driven differences in the amount of
   remuneration perceived as necessary to successfully recover from the
   failure. The implication is that when serving customers, the race of
   both the customer and other customers can provide service providers with
   information relative to the appropriate service recovery effort to
   implement.

AB We conduct two studies to examine if, when, and why communication
   strategies using social comparisons can effectively restore emotional
   equilibrium after a service failure, and thus aid recovery efforts. In
   our first study, we find that after a service failure, Re compensation,
   downward social comparisons reduce anger and improve post-purchase
   behavioral intentions (including exiting, complaining to management,
   engaging in negative word-of-mouth, and complaining to a third party).
   However, when two recovery tools, compensation and downward social
   comparisons are used together they do not have an additive effect.
   Additionally, we show that anger mediates the social comparison effect.
   In a second study, we further explore the social comparison effect and
   the financial compensation effect using complete and incomplete downward
   social comparisons and multiple levels of financial compensation. Our
   findings indicate that complete downward social comparisons are
   particularly effective at improving all four types of post-purchase
   behavioral intentions when financial compensation is non-existent or
   relatively low. Finally, we discuss implications for theory and
   practice.

AB Although word-of-mouth (WOM) activity has been studied as an outcome
   variable of other constructs such as satisfaction, less attention has
   been given to the antecedents and moderators of WOM when considering WOM
   as a central construct. Hence, we propose a model of WOM antecedents and
   moderators using a meta-analytic review. The results show that all
   antecedents have significant effects on WOM activity, with customer
   commitment showing the strongest effect. The following hypotheses are
   also supported: (1) WOM valence is a significant moderator, (2)
   cross-sectional studies show a stronger influence of satisfaction and
   loyalty on WOM activity than longitudinal studies, and (3) studies of
   WOM behavior show a weaker link between loyalty and WOM activity than
   studies of WOM intentions. In addition, we show that satisfaction has a
   stronger relationship with positive WOM than loyalty, whereas
   (dis)loyalty has a stronger relationship with negative WOM than does
   (dis)satisfaction. We discuss this finding based on the different
   natures of positive and negative WOM.

AB The competitive market environment has evolved from a physical market
   environment (PME) to an Internet-enabled market environment (IME)
   encompassing the physical and electronic marketplaces. At the same time,
   an increasing number of information products are available in both
   analog and digital forms. For information products in digital form, the
   IME also serves as a distribution channel. Such developments raise
   questions concerning the extent to which extant perspectives on
   first-mover advantage developed in the context of the PME hold in the
   IME, generally, and for information products specifically. We address
   this issue by developing a conceptual framework that focuses on selected
   sources of first-mover advantage delineated in the extant literature and
   advance propositions concerning sources that will have a greater or
   lower effect in the IME relative to the PME. A central message for
   first-movers in the IME that emerges from our conceptual analysis is to
   focus on achieving superior positions in resources that would enable
   them to get close to the customers fast, create switching costs, and
   retain them though ongoing investments in multi-faceted innovations. A
   second message that emerges for first-movers in the IME is they must
   take note of and make strategic adjustments for the potentially
   diminished significance of some traditional sources of first-mover
   advantage. These sources include spatial preemption, preemptive
   investment in capacity, and consumers' choice behavior under conditions
   of uncertainty about product quality. We discuss the implications for
   further conceptual and empirical work in this area of increasing
   significance.

   The first is an exposure-order effect that can influence attribute-based

   can result in theory-driven processing. The model was tested and
   supported across two experiments, which demonstrate that the effects of

   on attribute-type and the time between attribute encoding and preference
   construction. In contrast to previous research, conditions are

AB This research applies an institutional arrangement perspective to

   upstream suppliers to develop a new product to understand how new
   product value is created and shared. The model is empirically tested by
   collecting primary data from 188 manufacturers across different
   industries. The research demonstrates that customer participation
   affects new product value creation by improving the effectiveness of the
   new product development process by enhancing information sharing and
   customer-supplier coordination and by increasing the level of customer
   and supplier specific investments in the product development effort. In
   addition, increasing the formalization of the customer participation
   process enhances both customer and supplier relationship-specific
   investments in the new product development process. The impact of
   customer participation on the customer's share of the new product value
   pie is more complex then is first apparent. Based on the dependence and
   equity perspectives the results suggest that exchange partners' power
   (relative dependence) positively influences a partner's ability to
   capture new product value, but this power is offset by a desire of
   exchange partners to ensure the distribution of value is "fair" and
   reflects each party's contribution to the value creation.

AB Price plays two distinct roles in consumers' evaluations of product
   alternatives: as a measure of sacrifice and as an informational cue.
   This article merges two streams of empirical research into the effects
   of price on consumers' product evaluations by combining stated
   preferences, obtained from conjoint measurement, with data on
   self-reported measures in the form of beliefs or attitudes. It thus
   offers new, substantive insights into the dual role of price.
   Specifically, it differentiates between the informational and sacrifice
   effects of price using a choice-based conjoint approach and
   differentiates further among different subcomponents of these two main
   effects by combining choice-based measures with self-reported measures
   that pertain to potential sources of the dual role of price (price
   response drivers) and underlying consumer characteristics. Thus, this
   article presents a general procedure to quantify the impact of the dual
   role of price on choice shares for product alternatives within a market
   simulation. This procedure enables managers to simulate the choice share
   effects of changes in price response drivers, as well as modifications
   in segmentation and targeting strategies that involve changes in the
   levels of the price response drivers and thus the levels of the
   informational and sacrifice components of the price response of demand.

   The results show that a spousal sense of fairness serves as a mechanism
   for contemporary couples to harmonize conflict over time in family
   decisions. Specifically, spouses' perceived fairness mediates the
   relationship between spousal prior influence and spousal decision
   behavior in subsequent decisions. Spouses also consider their partner's

AB Cross-mode surveys are on the rise. The current study compares levels of
   response styles across three modes of data collection: paper-and-pencil
   questionnaires, telephone interviews, and online questionnaires. The
   authors make the comparison in terms of acquiescence, disacquiescence,
   and extreme and midpoint response styles. To do this, they propose a new
   method, namely, the representative indicators response style means and
   covariance structure (RIRSMACS) method. This method contributes to the
   literature in important ways. First, it offers a simultaneous
   operationalization of multiple response styles. The model accounts for
   dependencies among response style indicators due to their reliance on
   common item sets. Second, it accounts for random error in the response
   style measures. As a consequence, random error in response style
   measures is not passed on to corrected measures. The method can detect
   and correct cross-mode response style differences in cases where
   measurement invariance testing and multitrait multimethod designs are
   inadequate. The authors demonstrate and discuss the practical and
   theoretical advantages of the RIRSMACS approach over traditional
   methods.

   examine how mixed bundling affects consumers' inferences about the
   options and choices among the options. We demonstrate that as long as
   the seller's motives for bundling options are not perceived to be
   negative by consumers, options offered both individually and in bundles
   are perceived to be more important and are more likely to be chosen than
   options offered only individually.

AB While there is a rich body of research on market orientation's effect on
   business performance, much little attention has been given to its effect
   on innovation consequences. This is the first meta-analytic effort to
   study the independent effects of market orientation components (customer
   orientation, competitor orientation, interfunctional coordination) on
   innovation consequences. Also, it is the first meta-analysis to study
   the impact of contextual characteristics on the way market orientation
   affects innovation consequences. The study finds that market orientation
   components positively affect innovation consequences but that competitor
   orientation's effect depends on a minimum level of customer orientation.
   The study also suggests that the relationship between market orientation
   and innovation consequences is stronger in highly competitive
   environments but weaker in technology turbulent ones. Finally, findings
   suggest that the relationship is stronger in large firms, service
   companies, and in countries characterized by high individualism and high
   power distance national cultures.

AB Relationship marketing research and practice operate according to the
   paradigm that firms should invest in relationship marketing to build
   better relationships, which will generate improved financial
   performance. However, findings that relationship marketing efforts vary
   in their effectiveness across customers and may even be detrimental to
   performance challenge this belief. This article, therefore, offers a
   theoretical model that addresses three key issues: 1) what factors
   determine a customer's need for relational governance (relationship
   orientation); 2) what mediating mechanism captures the negative effects
   of relationship marketing on performance (exchange inefficiency); and 3)
   how does a customer's relationship orientation determine the
   effectiveness of relationship marketing, thus allowing for effective
   segmentation. The authors demonstrate in an empirical study that the
   trust in the salesperson and exchange inefficiency both mediate the
   effect of relationship marketing on seller financial outcomes. In
   addition, customers' relationship orientation moderates the impact of
   relationship marketing on both trust and exchange inefficiency.

AB We develop a conceptual model for studying the antecedents and
   consequences of achieved and optimal levels of manufacturer-distributor
   (M-D) cooperation. We hypothesized that levels of market turbulence,
   competitive intensity, and the manufacturing firm's strategic type
   (i.e., prospector, analyzer, or defender) affected the optimal level of
   M-D cooperation. We also hypothesized that the level of under- and
   overachieving the optimal levels of cooperation negatively affects firm
   performance. The conceptual model is tested using empirical data
   collected from 295 manufacturing firms in the U.S. and validated using
   data collected from 104 distributors in the U.S. We also collect data
   from 255 Japanese manufacturing firms and 98 Japanese distributors. The
   empirical results support the model's hypotheses with only one
   unexpected finding: in the Japanese sample, overachieving the optimal
   level of cooperation has a greater negative effect on performance than
   underachieving. We conclude by discussing theoretical and managerial
   implications.

AB After a service failure and a poor recovery, what leads loyal customers
   to try to punish a firm even if there is no material gain for doing so?
   We propose and test a justice-based model that incorporates perceived
   betrayal as the means to understand customer retaliation and the "love
   becomes hate" effect. The results suggest that betrayal is a key
   motivational force that leads customers to restore fairness by all means
   possible, including retaliation. In contrast to the majority of findings
   in the service literature, we propose and find that relationship quality
   has unfavorable effects on a customer's response to a service recovery.
   As a relationship gains in strength, a violation of the fairness norm
   was found to have a stronger effect on the sense of betrayal experienced
   by customers. The model was tested on a national sample of airline
   passengers who complained to a consumer agency after an unsuccessful
   recovery.

   salespeople's and sales managers' brand adoption. Second, ECD serves as
   a cross-level moderator of new brand adoption transmission. We find the

AB According to Vargo and Lusch (Journal of Marketing, 68:1 - 17, 2004a,

   logic for marketing. For them, service is an interactive process of
   "doing something for someone" that is valued. More radically, goods also
   render service and have value-in-use. In this context service becomes
   the unifying purpose of any business relationship. This marketing
   world-view involves broadening and reframing what by convention counts
   as service and stands in opposition to 200 years of mainstream economic
   logic in explaining productive capacity. In our view they have succeeded
   in applying their scholarly thinking to old themes with synergistic
   results. Their thesis challenges marketing orthodoxy, and will in our
   view support much future innovation in both theoretical and practical
   terms.

AB Service systems are value-co-creation configurations of people,
   technology, value propositions connecting internal and external service
   systems, and shared information (e.g., language, laws, measures, and
   methods). Service science is the study of service systems, aiming to
   create a basis for systematic service innovation. Service science
   combines organization and human understanding with business and
   technological understanding to categorize and explain the many types of
   service systems that exist as well as how service systems interact and
   evolve to co-create value. The goal is to apply scientific understanding
   to advance our ability to design, improve, and scale service systems. To
   make progress, we think service dominant logic provides just the right
   perspective, vocabulary, and assumptions on which to build a theory of
   service systems, their configurations, and their modes of interaction.
   Simply put, service-dominant logic may be the philosophical foundation
   of service science, and the service system may be its basic theoretical
   construct.

AB The service-dominant logic (S-D logic) provides a novel and valuable
   theoretical perspective that necessitates a rethinking and reevaluation
   of the conventional literature on innovation. This literature is built
   upon a goods-dominant logic and has resulted in a restricted and
   out-moded perspective that overlooks many major discontinuous
   innovations. In this article, we show how many innovations can be better
   understood by deploying a S-D logic perspective. We present six S-D
   logic categories of discontinuous innovation positing that they can help
   scholars and managers analyze, design and implement breakthrough
   advances in resource use. We argue that discontinuous innovation can
   arise by changing any of the customers' roles of users, buyers and
   payers on the first dimension. On the second dimension, the firm changes
   its value creation by embedding operant resources into objects, by
   changing the integrators of resources, and by reconfiguring value
   constellations. Finally, we offer some managerial and research
   implications of this expanded and strategic view of discontinuous
   innovation.

AB Marketing's evolution toward a new dominant logic requires the focus of
   marketing to be on the intangible, dynamic, operant resources that are
   at the heart of competitive advantage and performance. First, building
   on resource-advantage theory's notion of basic resources and
   higher-order resources, this article proposes a hierarchy of basic,
   composite, and interconnected operant resources. Second, reviewing
   research on business strategy and marketing strategy, several resources
   that correspond to the proposed hierarchy are identified and discussed.
   Third, the notion of developing masterful operant resources is
   introduced. Fourth, based on the proposed hierarchy and the notion of
   masterful operant resources, some exemplars of potential research
   avenues for marketing strategy are provided. Finally, the article
   concludes with the discussion of implications for marketing
   practitioners, researchers, and educators. In sum, this article extends

AB Central to service-dominant (S-D) logic is the proposition that the
   customer becomes a co-creator of value. This emphasizes the development
   of customer-supplier relationships through interaction and dialog.
   However, research to date suggests relatively little is known about how
   customers engage in the co-creation of value. In this article, the
   authors: explore the nature of value co-creation in the context of S-D
   logic; develop a conceptual framework for understanding and managing
   value co-creation; and utilize field-based research to illustrate
   practical application of the framework. This process-based framework
   provides a structure for customer involvement that takes account of key
   foundational propositions of S-D logic and places the customer
   explicitly at the same level of importance as the company as co-creators
   of value. Synthesis of diverse concepts from research on services,
   customer value and relationship marketing into a new process-based
   framework for co-creation provide new insights into managing the process
   of value co-creation.

AB Purpose This article presents a model of consumer engagement in
   co-production.
   Method A theoretical paper which develops a five-stage dynamic model of
   consumer involvement in co-production.
   Results and Conclusions The article discusses the basic linkages between
   co-production and customization and presents co-production as a dynamic
   process which is composed of five distinct stages. It also specifies
   five distinct phases of the production activity chain where consumers
   can become involved in co-production. The model offers researchers an
   analytical framework conducive for more advanced studies of the
   phenomenon from both descriptive and analytical points of view. Managers
   can use it to segment consumers according to their tendencies to engage
   in co-production and suggests bases for developing corresponding offers
   of co-production possibilities which focus on diverse consumer benefits.

AB One important aspect in the service-dominant logic in marketing is the
   role of customers as co-creators of value. This role typically involves
   producing products for own consumption, i.e. what Toffler referred to as
   "prosumption." This study explores the motivational mechanisms
   underlying people's prosumption propensity. A theoretical framework that
   incorporates ideas from value research and attitude theory, specifically
   the "theory of trying" (Bagozzi and Warshaw in Journal of Consumer
   Research 17:127 - 140, 1990), is developed and tested in the empirical
   context of food prosumption. The results based on a survey of 380
   households show that global values influence domain-specific values in
   food prosumption, and domain-specific values then affect attitudes,
   self-efficacy, and on-going behavior before ultimately shaping
   intentions to engage in prosumption in the future.

AB The benefits of customer co-creation of value in the service context are
   well recognized. However, little is known about service failures in a
   co-creation context and the consequent roles of both firms and customers
   in the advent of service recovery. In conceptualizing a new construct,
   "customer participation in service recovery," this study proposes a
   theoretical framework that delineates the consequences of the construct
   and empirically tests the proposed framework using role-playing
   experiments. The results indicate that, when customers participate in
   the service recovery process in self-service technology contexts, they
   are more likely to report higher levels of role clarity, perceived value
   of future co-creation, satisfaction with the service recovery, and
   intention to co-create value in the future. Theoretical and managerial
   implications of the findings are discussed.

   ability to improve different tasks substantially during innovation
   activities. The results show three different roles of customers in

AB This article is a tribute to the late Richard Normann, whose call for a
   "service logic" (Normann, Reframing Business: When the Map Changes the
   Landscape, Wiley, Chichester, p. 99, 2001) both parallels and enriches
   service-dominant (S-D) logic (Vargo and Lusch, J. Mark, 68:1 - 17,
   2004a). Like Vargo and Lusch, Normann shifted the focus of the offering
   from an output to a process of value creation and perceived the firm as
   an organizer of this process, with the customer as a co-producer, rather
   than a receiver of value. He also argued that offerings are "frozen
   knowledge," similar to Vargo and Lusch's contention that the basis of
   exchange is applied operant resources (service) and suggested that the
   'dematerialization' of resources increases their 'liquidity', which
   allows increased "density" for value creation. Thus, he suggested that
   firms need to "reframe business" - rethink the logic of value
   creation-to reveal opportunities in reconfiguring the value
   constellations of which they are part. This tribute explores these and
   other similarities and differences between Normann's work and the
   evolving S-D logic.

AB Most research in the field of customer relationship management has
   focused on keeping existing customers. However, some companies also
   systematically address lost customers and try to revive these
   relationships. This facet of customer relationship management has been
   largely neglected by academic research. Our study provides a theoretical
   discussion and an empirical analysis of factors driving the success of
   relationship revival activities. Drawing on equity theory, we find that
   the customer's perceived interactional, procedural, and distributive
   justice with respect to revival activities positively affect his or her
   revival-specific satisfaction which in turn, has a strong impact on
   revival performance. Furthermore, revival performance depends on
   customer characteristics (variety seeking, involvement, age), and the
   overall customer satisfaction with the relationship.

AB Formalization is a core structural characteristic of the firm and an

   paper explores formalization in financial institutions' product line
   pruning decisions. The authors develop a set of hypotheses that are
   empirically tested in a stratified random sample of UK financial
   institutions. The results demonstrate that the level of formalization in
   the elimination decision-making process depends on specific
   organizational and environmental conditions, including overall company
   strategy, product line length, market orientation, top management
   attitude toward line pruning, austerity of the regulatory context, and
   rate of technological change. The results also show that formalization
   enhances the procedural rationality of elimination decisions, and leads
   to customer-sensitive implementation strategies. This paper is the first
   attempt to link service elimination decision-making with structural
   characteristics of organizational decision-making. The results yield
   important managerial implications and point at useful directions for
   future research.

AB Self-service technologies (SSTs), such as in-store kiosks, are
   increasingly prevalent and becoming a critical component of marketing.
   Researchers and practitioners alike have recognized the need to
   understand the effectiveness of these computer-based innovations for
   self-services-in particular, how to strengthen customers' perceived
   control over and evaluations of SSTs. Drawing on the resource-matching
   theory and the technology-based services and self-services literature,
   the authors hypothesize the interactive effects of two SST design
   features-namely, comparative information and interactivity-on customers'
   perceived control and interface evaluations. The authors then propose
   that the interaction pattern is further moderated by two individual
   traits: prior experience and technology readiness. The hypotheses are
   tested in two separate computer-based experiments with representative
   samples of the general U.S. population in a shopping environment. The
   findings support the hypotheses, enhancing knowledge in this emerging
   domain and providing important implications for managers and
   researchers.

AB Despite the logical association between market orientation (MO) and the

   supply chain management (SCM), and the potential mediating role of SCO
   and SCM in the MO-firm business performance (PERF) relationship, there
   have been few, if any, attempts to investigate MO in a supply chain
   context. Thus, this study tests the relationships between MO, SCO, SCM,
   and PERF. Results indicate MO has a strong, positive impact on SCO and
   SCM. Interestingly, SCO was found to have the largest direct influence
   on PERF, followed by MO, followed by SCM. Managers should realize that
   SCO is critical to fulfilling customer requirements, i.e., a firm's
   efforts to work with supply chain partners will not pay off if the firm
   is not supply chain-oriented. Although overshadowed by SCO, MO is still
   a foundation for managing the supply chain and has a positive impact on
   PERF. Equally important, the fact that the contribution of SCM to firm
   performance is overshadowed by MO and SCO does not mean SCM is
   irrelevant in corporate strategy. Managerial and future research
   implications of these findings are discussed.

AB This paper investigates how consumer norms regarding the use of
   marketplace comparisons can influence the effectiveness of positioning
   strategies. Using an experimental method and student samples, we provide
   evidence across a set of three studies that comparing a focal brand to
   an offering from the same product category (i.e., a within-category
   comparison) represents an expected marketplace tactic, while comparing a
   brand to a rival from a different category (i.e., a between-category
   comparison) constitutes a deviation from the norm. Studies one and two
   utilize an experimental design that manipulates comparison type to
   demonstrate the effect of norm violations on positioning outcomes.
   Consistent with the proposed theoretical framework, within-category
   comparisons were perceived as a more appropriate tactic and were thus
   more effective in positioning the focal brand than were between-category
   comparisons. Study three employs a two-factor experimental design to
   demonstrate the moderating effects of attribute claims. Specifically,
   the results from this study indicate that the general effect of
   comparison type established by studies one and two are contingent upon
   the size of the superiority being claimed in the comparison.

AB The dynamic effects of survival determinants in e-commerce are tested
   using longitudinal data on 460 e-tailers. This is achieved through the
   incorporation of both time-varying covariates and coefficients in a
   discrete hazard rate model. The model includes elements of competitive
   strategy, industry structure, firm and product characteristics, and the
   macro environment. The study demonstrates the changing effect over time
   of factors affecting survival. For example, order of entry advantages
   are observed, but they are short-lived. This finding shows that
   e-tailers cannot rely on early entry as a strategic move in the long
   run. E-tailers with more media presence seem to survive longer. Being
   publicly traded and selling products with digital characteristics
   present advantages for e-tailers only in the beginning years, but they
   are not sustainable over long time periods. Survival chances decrease
   with higher competitive density, market growth rate, and equity market
   level at the time of entry. Conversely, economic growth tends to
   increase survival chances. The study also finds an inverted-U
   relationship between the hazard of exit and firm age. The conclusion
   section discusses the implications of the time-varying nature of
   survival determinants.

   moderating role of information sensitivity and congruency on the

   Both hypothesized two-way interactions were confirmed, suggesting that a
   strong business policy is effective in reducing concern when low

   highly sensitive data. Furthermore, concern increased dramatically when
   sensitive data were collected that were incongruent with the business

AB Game-theoretic analyses of distribution channels have generated six
   widely held beliefs (we call them Channel Hypotheses) whose universal
   soundness has not been examined. To assess the validity of these
   Hypotheses, we develop a general, linear-demand model in which
   distributors face heterogeneity in demand, heterogeneity in costs, and
   any degree of intensity of inter-distributor competition. For ease of
   comparison, we nest the bilateral-monopoly model and the
   identical-distributors model within our general model. Our analysis
   reveals that the Channel Hypotheses do not generalize beyond the
   specific game-theoretic models from which they were derived. This lack
   of generality is critical, because these beliefs have led to intuitively
   appealing (but inadvertently misleading) strategic advice for managers
   and modeling advice for game theorists. From our general, linear-demand
   model, we derive six Channel Propositions that correct these accumulated
   errors of conceptualization and that generate a richer, more broadly
   applicable set of managerial and modeling implications. We also present
   a Channel-Modeling Proposition that we believe will help modelers avoid
   the errors of conceptualization described in this paper.

AB Although purchase intention scales are widely used, relatively little is
   known about bias and variability in the estimated purchase proportions.
   Psychometric techniques have been developed to correct for such
   problems, and analytical approaches have shown that most predictive
   errors can be explained as probabilistic variability. However, there is
   a lack of systematic empirical work in the area. We address this problem
   using two meta-analyses of published work. Our results show that
   purchase intention scales are empirically unbiased. Furthermore, the
   variability is much less than previously assumed. This finding improves
   the confidence researchers can have in the use of such scales.
   Interestingly, purchase probability scales performed even better than
   purchase intention scales. The greater precision of probability scales
   suggests that they may be more useful both as direct measures of likely
   behavior and as dependent variables in consumer behavior research.

AB This paper proposes that customers often respond to brand extension
   concepts by visualizing the product. We call this process spontaneous
   visualization and suggest that it precedes concept evaluations. In two
   studies, we show that spontaneous visualization is enhanced by the fit
   between the parent brand and the extension category and by the ease with
   which the product category can be imagined. The appeal of the visualized
   image in turn determines whether visualization enhances or decreases
   concept evaluations. In addition, we find a stronger link between
   product evaluations and delayed choice when evaluations are based on
   visualization; evaluations based on visualization hence appear to be
   more "valid" in the sense of predicting subsequent behavior.
   Implications of these findings and ideas for future research are
   discussed.

   product influences consumers' perceptions of the firm's other products.
   In three experiments (with 152 participants in Study 1, 86 in Study 2,
   and 91 in Study 3), participants received information about the quality
   of a firm's product and then inferred the quality of another product
   from the firm. When participants believed that the initial product was
   relatively more difficult to manufacture than the second product, they
   inferred that the second product would be high in quality. However, when
   participants believed that the initial product was relatively easy to
   manufacture, they inferred that the second product would be low in
   quality. These effects occurred when perceived difficulty of manufacture
   was manipulated (Study 2) and occurred regardless of whether both
   products had dissimilar product benefits (Study 1) or whether brand
   names were present (Study 3).

AB Marketers in firms that routinely produce hightech innovations want
   rapid adoption of their products. Many believe the consumer segment that
   is targeted initially should consist of people who adopt innovative
   technology relatively early and are influential sources of information
   that others use as references for their own behavior. A set of adopters
   who might meet these requirements, but have not been the focus of prior
   scholarly research, are gadget lovers. This article provides insights
   into this segment, proposes a scale to measure its key characteristics,
   and reports the results of a group interview and four additional studies
   that support the validity of the scale (n(1)=1,655, n(2)=789,
   n(3)=1,366, and n(4)=188). The gadget lover scale explains
   adoption-related behaviors beyond the variance accounted for by
   technological innovativeness and key demographic variables.

   TCEs are highly desirable and valued for their own sake, customers value
   marketing activities they perceive as instrumental to them. This study
   demonstrates that a TCE in the context of a marketer-facilitated
   consumption activity can strengthen a person's ties to a brand

AB This manuscript develops a new measure of how managers perceive
   relationship marketing and provides an initial test of its utility. The
   analysis reveals that relationship marketing is a second-order factor
   consisting of four dimensions: an ongoing bonding process, mutual value
   creation, a cooperative atmosphere, and information technology use. This
   second-order, four-factor model is useful in understanding the
   association between managers' perceptions of what constitutes
   relationship marketing and their perceptions of its institutionalization
   (i.e., adoption as a standard practice). The survey data that are used
   to develop the relationship marketing scale were obtained from two
   independent samples of marketers, purchasers, and engineers. Because
   these professions are involved in inter-organizational exchange
   relationships, they are the most likely respondents within firms to be
   knowledgeable about relationship marketing. The scale development sample
   of 33 engineers, 36 marketers and 18 purchasing agents is derived from
   multiple industries, while the utility test sample of 61 engineers, 22
   marketers and 33 purchasing agents is taken from firm members in the
   automotive and earth moving equipment industries.

   complex nexus of strategically critical interfirm relationships. Due to
   the diversity of environments and networks involved, these linkages are
   increasingly vulnerable to catastrophic disruptions, also referred to as
   "crises." The authors offer an advanced conceptualization of crises and
   explicate the interplay of crises and interfirm relationships. On the
   basis of literature and qualitative data from 27 interviews with
   executives in 13 firms, the authors develop a process model of crisis
   that consists of five phases: (1) awareness and acknowledgment, (2)
   sensemaking, (3) response design, (4) response implementation, and (5)
   reconciliation in the aftermath. In discussing the model, the authors
   emphasize the influence of crisis on interfirm relationships and

   associated payoffs, employing computer-generated sales agents that
   represent different companies and industries. The agents were selected
   randomly across 1,000 rounds, and interacted with exchange partners
   according to the moral philosophies noted. In some cases, various
   corporate cultures were added to determine their impact on the evolution
   and final mix of philosophical orientations of agents within firms.
   Simulation results indicate the importance of ethical behavior on the

   psychological climate perceptions (e.g., the organization's customer
   orientation, sales innovativeness, and sales supportiveness) to explain
   how sales force controls affect sales-related outcomes. Based on a
   survey of 293 salespeople and using path analysis, the authors find that
   the inclusion of these psychological climate perceptions allows for
   explanatory improvement in linking sales controls to salesperson job
   satisfaction and performance. These results complement previous studies
   in that formal controls were found to affect outcomes directly. However,
   they also provide important insight into the indirect effects of sales
   controls-through salespeople's perceptions of managerial commitment to
   making the salespeople effective (i.e., the sales-related psychological
   climate).

   different aggregate- and disaggregate-level approaches. The authors
   compare how customer equity is measured and maximized under various
   approaches. We find that, in the disaggregate-level approach, customer
   lifetime value is maximized by implementing customer-level strategies
   such as optimal resource allocation, purchase sequence analysis and
   balancing acquisition and retention spending. At the aggregate-level,
   improving the drivers of customer equity maximizes customer equity. A
   comparison of different aggregate approaches shows that, while an
   emphasis on retention is a common feature across approaches, conceptual
   differences in terms of accounting for existing customers and prospects,
   acquisition, and the projection period exist across the different
   approaches. The authors propose a hybrid approach, which addresses the
   issues and challenges in existing approaches and helps firms to measure

AB Prior empirical research suggests that consumers perceive pioneers as
   more prototypical (i.e., representative) of their product categories
   than me-too followers. This prototypicality advantage is believed to
   contribute to an enduring marketplace advantage for the pioneer. We
   extend research into pioneering prototypicality advantages by
   considering the ramifications of simultaneous product design (i.e.,
   product attribute) evolutions. We hypothesize that the simultaneous
   evolution of product designs of both the pioneer and me-too will
   diminish the pioneer's prototypicality advantage over the me-too, even
   though the me-too does not initiate the change. To test our hypotheses,
   we create an experimental environment consisting of four cells, each
   corresponding to a different marketplace scenario: a no-change
   condition; a simultaneous-evolution condition; a pioneer-updates-first
   condition; and a leapfrogging (i.e., me-too updates first) condition.
   The results suggest that simultaneous design evolutions can diminish the
   pioneer's prototypicality advantage. As a result, me-too entry may be a
   more attractive strategy in the long-run than currently believed in
   product categories characterized by substantial design evolution.

AB Price-Matching Guarantees (PMGs) are a mechanism by which retailers can
   reassure consumers of the competitive price of products they offer.
   While current research in marketing has studied consumers' pre-purchase
   perceptions of the retailer as a result of offering price-matching
   guarantees, research on the post-purchase impact of PMGs has been
   relatively limited. While price-matching guarantees are typically
   assumed to result in positive consumer perceptions of the retailer, no
   study to date has examined the potentially negative post-purchase impact
   of PMGs. This paper examines the potential negative effect of policy
   restrictions which may prevent the disbursement of a price-matching
   refund, on consumer perceptions. Two experiments (Experiment 1 n=120,
   Experiment 2 n=50) are utilized to dissect the impact of policy
   restrictions on consumers' perceptions of service quality, price, and
   loyalty. The paper concludes with a discussion of the managerial
   implications of the findings on price-matching guarantee policies.

AB Advertising creativity is conceptualized as a function of three

   meaningfulness involve infocentric aspects, while connectedness
   incorporates the perspective of the audience. The relationship among
   these dimensions and ad effectiveness, and the linkage of ad creativity
   level to persuasion is then posited. Two experiments were conducted
   among 201 undergraduates. The first tested novelty and meaningfulness;
   while the second tested connectedness and meaningfulness. The results
   affirm the proposed conceptual framework. Relative to non-novel and
   meaningful ads, novel and meaningful ads generated higher ad recall,
   more favorable ad attitudes, and more upbeat feelings. Novel and
   non-meaningful ads elicited higher recall, more favorable attitudes
   toward non-claim elements (Aad-nc), and negative feelings, and less
   favorable ad attutides toward claim elements (Aad-c) than non-novel and

   under meaningful ads, lower Aad-c under non-meaningful ads, and higher
   levels of Aad-nc and warm feelings under both meaningful and

AB It has often been argued that word-of-mouth (WOM) can contribute
   significantly to a firm's success in a variety of ways. Here, we analyze
   the functional linkage between customer satisfaction, WOM, and new
   customer acquisition. Using data from two empirical studies we
   conceptualize and test the direct, non-linear, and moderated
   relationship between satisfaction and WOM. We further explore the
   circumstances under which WOM leads to new customer acquisition using a
   logistic regression model. We do so for two groups (new customers and
   long-term customers) from the customer base of a large energy provider
   (n=688), and for a random sample of B2B customers (n=416) in the same
   market. Results indicate that the satisfaction-WOM link is non-linear
   and is moderated by several customer involvement dimensions. Based on
   our results, we demonstrate how the satisfaction-WOM-new customer
   acquisition link can enrich return on quality and satisfaction models.
   Further, we draw conclusions about how companies can make use of both
   the satisfaction-WOM and the WOM-new customer acquisition link for
   better allocating their marketing resources.

AB Researchers and service providers have realized that a disproportionate
   share of a firm's sales and profits come from a relatively small number
   of loyal customers that repeatedly purchase the firm's services. In many
   service settings, such as health care, repeated interactions between the
   service provider and the client are necessary for service delivery.
   While service quality is certainly important, it is also important that
   customers' perceptions of perceived risk are taken into account and that
   customers perceive a degree of control over the services provided. We
   develop a conceptual model of linkages between the physical environment
   of the service, perceived control over the service and service quality
   and, demonstrate through two empirical studies, how these factors affect
   perceived risk and post-purchase behavioral intentions. Both studies
   were conducted in health care settings. In the first study, we collected
   data using a mail survey of 192 patients after their treatment from a
   regional hospital. In the second study, survey data were collected from
   101 patients of a specialized clinic providing alternative therapies
   within a major hospital. Our results provide confirmation that the
   favorable physical environment of the service setting enhances perceived
   control and perceptions of service quality. Moreover, perceived control
   and perceived quality of the service provider reduces post-purchase
   perceived risk. Finally, post-purchase perceived risk reduces behavioral
   intentions, while perceived quality of the service provider enhances
   behavioral intentions.

   examines the efforts put forth by the two parties involved (the firm
   buying and the firm supplying the new technology). We use 112 matched
   data collected from the suppliers and buyers of the customer
   relationship management (CRM) system in business-to-business markets. We
   find that the perceived turbulence of business environments stimulates
   adaptive efforts from both the supplying and buying firms, which may

AB Because of increasing ethical problems in business, organizations have
   tried to control these problems by institutionalizing ethics, such as by
   creating new ethics positions and formulating codes of ethics. In this
   study, the authors develop a scale for measuring the
   institutionalization of ethics in organizations and assess it for
   dimensionality, reliability and validity. Two separate studies are
   conducted, both using samples drawn from an American Marketing
   Association practitioner population. In Study 1, using a sample of 126
   marketing practitioners, we performed exploratory factor analysis on 44
   institutionalization items resulting in two separate dimensions of the
   institutionalization of ethics construct: implicit and explicit
   institutionalization. Using a national sample of 306 marketing
   practitioners in Study 2, we performed confirmatory factor analysis on
   these two dimensions and investigated the effects of these dimensions on
   perceived importance of ethics, job satisfaction, esprit de corps and
   organizational commitment. Implicit institutionalization had a
   significant direct affect on all four of these constructs. On the other
   hand, explicit institutionalization significantly influenced only the
   perceived importance of ethics.

AB Although marketing researchers have recognized the importance of early
   life experiences in shaping patterns of consumer behavior in later life,
   they have inadequate theoretical and methodological bases for
   investigating consumption-related issues over the life course. As a
   result, relatively little is known about the changes consumers
   experience over time, how they respond to these changes, and how early
   life experiences affect their consumer behavior. The life course
   approach, developed as an interdisciplinary program for studying various
   aspects of behavior, offers a framework for filling gaps in previous
   efforts to study consumer behavior over time. The purpose of this
   article is to advocate the life course approach for studying various
   types of market behavior. First, the author presents a general
   conceptual life course framework that serves as a blueprint for
   discussing theoretical perspectives and organizing, integrating, and
   reporting consumer research relevant to the life course paradigm.
   Second, methods of data analysis compatible with life course research
   are discussed. Finally, select areas of interest to marketing
   researchers (materialism and compulsive consumption) illustrate how the
   life course approach might contribute to previous efforts to study these
   consumer behaviors in an innovative way.

AB Business strategy is fundamentally concerned with the actions required
   to create superior customer value in the firm's target markets with the
   ultimate goal of achieving superior performance. Marketing theory
   suggests that two critical marketing activities required to achieve this
   end are: (1) the adoption of appropriate strategic behaviors (i.e.,
   customer-oriented, competitor-oriented, technology-oriented) and (2)
   targeting of the appropriate market segments (i.e., innovators, early
   adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards). This study builds on
   prior research which demonstrates that the strategic behavior-firm
   performance relationship is contingent on the firm's strategy by
   examining this relationship in high tech markets and by considering the
   incremental contribution of appropriate target market selection.
   Responses from 160 senior marketing managers in high-tech firms reveal
   strong support for our framework. Thus, this study provides useful
   guidance to executives and managers in high-tech firms regarding the
   steps that they should take to increase their probability of success.

AB The Miles-Snow (M-S) strategic typology has continued to receive
   attention in the academic business press, even though it has been
   criticized for not making explicit the relationships between strategic
   type and ultimate profit performance. Using the market orientation and
   Resource-Based View literature, we develop hypotheses regarding
   relationships between M-S strategic type and four firm capabilities
   (technology, information technology, market-linking, and marketing
   capabilities), relationship between the four capabilities and
   performance, and the moderating role of M-S strategic type. An empirical
   test involves multiple data collections from 216 firms. The study
   results suggest that there are significant relationships between
   capabilities and performance if one does not account for the moderating
   role of strategic type. When strategic type is used as a moderating
   variable, we find that only certain capabilities had significant effects
   on profitability. For example, technology and information technology
   capabilities increase financial performance for prospector
   organizations, while a different set of capabilities (market-linking and
   marketing) are positively related to financial performance for defender
   organizations. We discuss how our findings are consistent with the
   expectations of the Resource-Based View of the firm. We conclude with a
   discussion of theoretical and managerial implications.

AB The field of product innovation has expanded rapidly and clear insights
   regarding the relationship between product innovativeness and new
   product performance have become more elusive and difficult to discern
   through qualitative reviews of the literature. To offer much needed
   clarity, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of 95 correlations on
   product innovativeness and new product performance that were recorded
   from 32 studies on the topic. The findings reveal that although the
   average correlation of 0.24 for innovativeness with performance is small
   to moderate in size, the relationship is more substantial when various
   measurement and contextual elements are considered. For example,
   innovativeness measures that include a meaningfulness dimension yield
   stronger estimates of relationship strength. The findings also reveal
   that innovativeness today may not represent the same competitive
   advantage as in previous years unless the focus is on products rather
   than services, and specifically, new-to-the-market rather than
   new-to-the-firm products. Thus, innovativeness can be particularly
   relevant to new product success but only under certain conditions.

   moderating role of product familiarity in consumer preferences of
   products with enhanced or unique features in two experimental studies.
   Study 1 (208 participants) operationalizes product familiarity at the
   product category level and Study 2 (168 participants) measures it at the
   individual level as one's prior experience with the product. The
   findings of two experiments show that when consumers are unfamiliar with
   a product category, they prefer a product with enhanced features to one
   with unique features. In contrast, when consumers are experienced, they
   perceive a product with unique features more favorably than an enhanced
   one. Furthermore, this effect is due to consumer perceived
   differentiation of and performance uncertainty about new products with
   enhanced or unique features.

AB Empirical studies provide an inconsistent picture of the relationship
   between an innovative personality predisposition (i.e., innate consumer
   innovativeness [ICI]) and innovative behavior (i.e., new product
   adoption behavior). Such inconsistencies suggest intervening variables
   that may mediate the relationship have not been considered. Using data
   from a panel of consumers (n=296 in a cross-sectional phase, n=147 in a
   matched, two-phase longitudinal analysis), we find that ICI does not
   directly influence adoption behavior but does so indirectly through two
   of three components of vicarious innovativeness (modeling and engagement
   in word of mouth but not exposure to advertising). Furthermore, despite
   the evidence that consumers' decision processes differ for service
   versus product adoption, extant studies largely ignore the role of ICI
   in new service adoption. Our findings suggest that vicarious
   innovativeness plays a similar intervening role in service contexts.
   Finally, divergent operationalizations of adoption behavior (ownership,
   relative time of adoption) appear to perform equally well.

AB Low-price guarantees (LPG) signal the market position of a seller's
   offer price and promise to compensate consumers in case that information
   is erroneous. In this research, we demonstrate that when retailers
   default on the information provided by an LPG, consumer perceptions of
   the retailer suffer, but the extent of the damage depends on the
   conditions associated with the default. On the basis of attribution
   theory, we posit that consumers may attribute default to the retailer's
   opportunism but emphasize this attribution differently in various
   default conditions. Furthermore, we show that the restoration of
   consumer perceptions after a refund depends on consumers' focus in terms
   of the signal itself. If they consider the protective, compensatory
   function of a low price signal, their post-refund outcomes are more
   favorable; when they focus on the informational function, these outcomes
   are less favorable. We discuss the theoretical and practical
   implications of these findings.

   investigated the effects of cultural adaptation, including the role of
   acculturation and ethnic-identification, on children's role in family
   purchase decisions. By conceiving of CPI as a family context-dependent
   phenomenon, we hypothesized that parent-child cultural
   dissonance/consonance within the family influences CPI through a
   cross-level process. The hypotheses were tested on data collected from
   99 Hong Kong Chinese immigrant family triads, i.e., father, mother, and
   a teenage child. The results showed that: (1) acculturation positively
   and ethnic-identification negatively influenced CPI for most products,
   (2) the interaction between acculturation and ethnic-identification had
   a positive influence on CPI, and (3) generational dissonance/consonance
   had significant moderating effects on CPI through a cross-level route.

AB Although corporate reputation has attracted significant attention among

   perceptions of the most important stakeholder group, customers, and
   often overlook its relationship to important customer-outcome variables.
   In this article, we identify dimensions of customer-based corporate
   reputation and develop scales to measure these dimensions (Study 1).
   Based on comprehensive validation procedures across three service firm
   types, we found support for a five-dimensional scale with the following
   dimensions: Customer Orientation, Good Employer, Reliable and
   Financially Strong Company, Product and Service Quality, and Social and
   Environmental Responsibility. In Study 2, using a second sample, we
   validate our scale and examine its relationship with important
   customer-outcome variables-customer satisfaction, loyalty, trust, and
   word of mouth. Most of the reputation dimensions were strongly

AB As customers have demanded greater convenience in service exchanges,
   researchers have responded by incorporating the convenience construct
   into their conceptual models and empirical studies, but a comprehensive,
   formally validated measure of convenience remains lacking. This study
   conceptualizes service convenience as a second-order, five-dimensional
   construct that reflects consumers' perceived time and effort in
   purchasing or using a service. Service convenience dimensions are
   salient at different stages of the purchase decision process. Given this
   conceptualization, the study presents the development and validation of
   the SERVCON scale, a comprehensive instrument for measuring service
   convenience. The five dimensions are independent within a nomological
   network that illustrates distinct antecedent and consequent effects, and
   the results reinforce the multidimensional representation, offering
   insight into the distinctive relationships between each service
   convenience dimension and its antecedents, such as competitive
   intensity, and consequences, such as repurchase behavior. The findings
   help researchers and managers understand a fully conceptualized
   convenience construct and facilitate the measurement of convenience in
   future empirical studies.

AB Previous research on the arts, entertainment, and other cultural objects
   has found, at most, a weak link between expert judgments of aesthetic
   excellence and audience appeal to nonexpert consumers. However, this
   tendency for audience appeal only weakly to reflect expert judgments of
   excellence raises the question of how this fragile relationship might be
   mediated by audience judgments of excellence. As the first study to
   examine the potential intervening role of audience judgments, the
   present article investigates the links between expert judgments,
   audience judgments, and audience appeal in an illustrative case based on
   200 recordings of the song "My Funny Valentine. " The results support a
   scenario in which audience appeal is weakly related to expert judgments
   through the hitherto neglected intervening role of audience judgments so
   as to suggest refinements in our approaches to marketing entertainment,
   the arts, or other cultural offerings, as well as various consumer
   services, durables, or nondurables.

   hypothesizes that certain SCCS innovations can be viewed as firm
   resources that enhance channel capabilities, which in turn affect a
   firm's market performance. The empirical research is based on 184
   responses from a survey with U.S. supply chain and logistics managers
   using structural equation modeling as the analytic method. The results
   suggest that the effect of applied technological SCCS innovations on
   channel capabilities is mediated by interfirm systems integration. In
   contrast, administrative SCCS innovations enhance information exchange
   and coordination activities directly Furthermore, the influence of
   applied technological innovations for SCCS is not strong enough to
   affect either responsiveness of the partnership or firm performance,
   whereas administrative innovations for SCCS affect both.

   This article examines how the price frame (the relative position of a

   a negative price frame than in a positive price frame. The results of
   two experiments provide support for these predictions.

   performance. Whereas prior literature has examined environmental
   turbulence as a contextual condition shaping the market orientation-firm
   performance relationship, this study takes an internal approach by
   focusing on existing stocks of resources within the firm while
   controlling for environmental conditions. A conceptual model is
   developed that explains how market orientation can be transformed into
   dynamic capability when complemented by transformational
   (reconfigurational) constructs, such as innovativeness. The empirical
   results support the authors' theory that the effect of market
   orientation on firm performance is strengthened when market orientation
   is bundled together with internal complementary resources, such as

   varying stages of the product life cycle and at different levels of

   which has characterized most past research on recreational shopping. Two
   survey studies investigate recreational shopper identity in a clothing
   shopping context. In Study 1, the Recreational Shopper Identity (RSI)
   Scale is validated with a sample of 561 adult consumers, demonstrating
   that recreational shopping is experienced as a true leisure activity In
   Study 2, involving 354 adult consumers, the RSI Scale is used to
   identify three groups of shoppers who differ in the degree to which they
   incorporate recreational shopping into their self-concepts. Recreational
   shopping enthusiasts are found to engage more extensively in a range of
   retail shopping behaviors, to spend more money shopping (i.e., they are
   not just browsers), and are more "multi-channel" than other shoppers,
   reporting higher levels of Internet, catalog, and TV home shopping as
   well as traditional "brick-and-mortar" shopping.

AB Authenticity in the consumption context is an important topic within the

   of meanings within the MG brand subculture of consumption. An
   ethnographic approach guided data collection, which included participant
   observation, photo and document reviews, informal conversations, and
   formal, in-depth interviews with 58 MG owners. The data show that MG
   owners gain a sense of authenticity in the consumption context via the
   object and its ownership, consumer experiences, and identify
   construction and confirmation. As an object, an MG is authentic if it
   broaches an ideal standard and preserves the brand heritage. An MG
   experience is authentic when an owner interacts with the car through
   driving and self-work activities. Finally, an MG owner authenticafes his
   or her identify through role performance and communal commitment.
   Implications are discussed in light of brand management.

AB The consumer satisfaction literature has not, for the most part,
   integrated individual values into the product evaluation process. Yet a
   comprehensive understanding of consumer satisfaction can best be
   attained by including both consumer and product factors. To demonstrate
   the usefulness of including individual values, this research focuses on
   one consumer value, namely, materialism. The authors empirically explore
   how this individual value is linked to consumers' evaluations of
   products they have purchased. Using surveys, the authors collected
   datafrom a sample of college students (n = 211) and a sample of adults
   (n = 270). Across these two studies, using divergent samples and
   products, they find consistent evidence that materialism is negatively
   related to product satisfaction in product categories with high
   potential for status signaling, but unrelated to product satisfaction in
   product categories with lower potential for status signaling. The
   consumption goals that produce these product evaluations are empirically
   addressed.

   the potential to reduce search and assembly costs. Through exploratory

AB By integrating research from attitude challenge matching and consumer
   alignment and judgment revision, the authors explore how firms can
   position brands to insulate them from negative publicity and how
   consumers evaluate brands in reaction to such publicity. They introduce
   an important moderator of brand evaluation revision, prior brand
   attitude certainty, and propose that when negative publicity matches or
   "aligns" with the basis of a brand attitude, certainty in that attitude
   interacts with the attitude, determining the affect of the negative
   publicity on brand evaluations. The results of two experiments suggest
   that prior brand attitudes held with high certainty tend to "insulate"
   brands, even when negative publicity matches or aligns with the bases of
   brand attitudes, whereas brand attitudes held with low certainty may
   exacerbate the effects of negative event publicity. The results also
   show that multiplex positioning (positioning a brand with both
   performance and values-based attributes) may insulate brands more
   eftectively from negative publicity.

AB Although much of the existing research on employee sabotage and deviance
   focuses on the manufacturing sector studies have also found evidence of
   deliberate employee misbehavior in a variety of service settings. In
   this study, the authors conceptualize and test a model of service
   sabotage dynamics that incorporates both the antecedents and the
   consequences of such behaviors. In doing so, the study contributes
   contemporary empirical evidence of factors associated with the
   deliberate sabotage of service by frontline customer-contact personnel.
   Using a survey-based approach, the authors collected data from 259
   respondents from a sample of 1,000 respondents. The findings largely
   support the hypothesized antecedents of service sabotage and show that a
   range of individual characteristics, management control efforts, and
   perceived labor market conditions are linked with service sabotage.
   Furthermore, the analysis suggests that service sabotage behaviors are
   associated with individual and group rewards, effects for customers, and
   other performance measures.

   sequentially to different markets and customer segments. Conventional
   knowledge holds that the roles of various product success drivers do not
   differ significantly across these sequential channels of distribution.
   The authors examine sequential distribution channels within the motion
   picture industry and develop a model that proposes that such differences
   exist between a primary (short- and long-term theatrical box office) and
   a sequential (video rental) channel. The authors test their model with a
   sample of 331 motion pictures released in theaters and on video during
   1999-2001 using partial least squares. Results reveal differences in the
   impact of success factors across channels. For example, cultural
   familiarity enhances box office success but relates negatively to video
   rental success, and distribution intensity and date of release enhance
   box office outcomes but have no impact on rental revenues.

AB The increasing implementation of self-managing teams (SMTs) in service
   delivery suggests the importance of developing confidence beliefs about
   a team's collective competence. This research examined causality in the
   linkage between employee confidence beliefs and performance for
   boundary-spanning SMTs delivering financial services. The authors
   distinguish between task-specific (i.e., team efficacy) and generalized
   (i.e., group potency) employee confidence, as well as between
   customer-based (i.e., customer-perceived service quality) and financial
   (i.e., service revenues) performance. They analyzed employee and
   customer survey data as well as financial performance data from 51 SMTs
   at two points in time using lagged analyses. The findings reveal
   divergent results for team efficacy and group potency, suggesting that
   team efficacy has reciprocal, causal relationships with service revenues
   and customer-perceived service quality. In contrast, group potency has
   no causal relationship with service revenues. Finally,
   customer-perceived service quality predicts group potency, whereas no
   evidence for the reverse effect is provided.

AB Extant research has largely ignored the phenomenon of
   interorganizational teams, which consist of members from both supplier
   and customer companies. This study examines the degree to which team
   interorganizationality influences team performance in a
   business-to-business context. On the basis of resource-dependence theory
   and boundary theory, the author argues that team interorganizationality
   positively influences team effectiveness, particularly when uncertainty
   is high. The hypotheses testing is based on multiple informant data
   collected from members and leaders of 225 teams in various industries.
   The results show the positive influence of team interorganizationality
   on team effectiveness. In addition, uncertainty-related moderator
   variables (company-related, market-related, and technological
   uncertainty) strengthen the link between team interorganizationality and
   team effectiveness.

AB Extensive research has documented how firms' learning orientation and
   memory are related to organizational performance. The objective of this
   study is to examine the moderating role of turbulence on the
   relationships between firms' learning orientation and memory and their
   organizational performance and innovativeness. The study also provides
   insight into the differential relationships of firms' learning
   orientation and memory to their performance and innovativeness. Using
   survey data collected from 200 supply management professionals, the
   results suggest that the extent to which learning and memory are
   associated with organizational performance is contingent on the level of
   environmental turbulence. Specifically, under low environmental
   turbulence, learning orientation and organizational memory appear to be
   related to performance and innovativeness; however, under high
   environmental turbulence, only learning orientation is a useful
   predictor.

AB This study proposes an integrated framework explaining loyalty responses

   rooted in the traditional (attribute satisfaction)-(overall
   satisfaction)-(loyalty) chain but explicitly incorporates facility
   versus interactive service quality, trust, specific asset investment
   (SAI), and product-market expertise. The authors focus on disentangling
   the direct versus indirect effects of model constructs on attitudinal
   versus behavioral loyalty responses. The results support the traditional
   chain but also show loyalty can be increased by building a trustworthy
   image and creating exchange-specific assets. The authors found that
   overall satisfaction is the precursor both to loyalty and to building
   SAL Finally, consumers have different costs in reducing adverse
   selection problems with information, and thus the negative effect of
   product-market expertise on behavioral loyalty needs to be controlled if
   the direct versus indirect effects of model constructs on loyalty are to
   be disentangled.

   the context of new product development (NPD). The authors surveyed NPD
   managers from 323 firms, representing a wide range of product
   classifications, about their firms' levels of cohesiveness and NPD
   efforts. Using structural equation modeling, the authors demonstrated
   that organizational cohesiveness has a moderating influence on both an
   organization's use of its existing knowledge to develop innovative new
   products and the resulting performance of those products, which
   emphasizes how influential organizational "mind-set" can be. By
   considering cohesiveness an influence in new product innovativeness and
   new product performance, the authors incorporated a cultural variable
   that has received little attention in the NPD and more general marketing
   literature. This research reveals that much is left to learn about
   cohesiveness and that understanding it can advance knowledge use,

   compares three potential signals of trust in an Internet retail firm:
   (1) a third-party certification (i.e., a "trustmark"), (2) an
   objective-source rating (i.e., a review from Consumer Reports magazine),
   and (3) an implication of investment in advertising (i.e., a television
   advertisement to air during the Super Bowl). The trustmark had the
   greatest effect on perceived trustworthiness, influencing respondents'
   beliefs about security and privacy, general beliefs about firm
   trustworthiness, and willingness to provide personal information. The
   relationship between Internet experience and trust was in the form of an
   inverted U.

AB Interfirm collaborations have inspired a rich literature in marketing
   and strategy during the past two decades. Building on this extant work,
   the authors developed a new construct, alliance orientation, and
   explored its influence on firms' alliance network performance and market
   performance. The authors drew on data collected from 182 U.S. firms with
   extensive experience informing, developing, and managing strategic
   alliances in marketing, new product development, distribution,
   technology, and manufacturing projects. Using structural equations
   modeling, the authors demonstrate that alliance orientation
   significantly affects alliance network performance, which in turn
   enhances market performance. The findings also suggest that market
   turbulence exerts a significant moderating influence on the relationship
   between alliance orientation and alliance network performance, whereas
   the moderating role of technological turbulence on that relationship
   does not appear to be significant. The study provides evidence that
   firms' alliance orientations positively affect their performance in
   strengthening their alliance network relationships and in managing
   conflicts with their alliance partners.

AB Preannouncements are strategic marketing communications directed at

   marketing communication process aimed at influencing market participants
   in the firm's favor. The authors develop and test a model of
   preannouncement behavior that affects the success of a new product
   launch through market anticipation, competitive equity, and new product
   development resources. The findings indicate that preannouncement
   behavior engenders new product success through its positive effect on
   market anticipation-a favorable industry-wide bias in advance of new
   product introduction-and emphasizes the use of preannouncements as
   business-to-business marketing communications aimed at influencing

   understand international marketing phenomena. In this article, the
   authors conduct two empirical studies. Using consumer data from the
   United States, South Korea, and India (three diverse cultural and
   economic environments), they explore six hypotheses. In Stage 1, the
   results suggest that across all three countries, consumer ethnocentrism
   provokes negative attitudes toward both foreign advertisements and
   foreign products. The authors identify a set of consumer variables
   (i.e., consumers' global mind-set) that may mediate consumers'
   unfavorable attitudes toward foreign advertisements and products derived
   by consumer ethnocentrism. In Stage 2, the authors find that consumer
   ethnocentrism dampens consumers' online consumption activities on a
   foreign Web site. Finally, the authors find that marketers' e-mail
   communications to foreign consumers mediate consumer ethnocentrism in
   online environments.

   themselves by concentrating on their task to free up their thinking in

   space and should be the coping strategy of choice for those salespeople

   least-desired age), while the Likert scale possesses the largest trait
   variance for average cognitive age. The ratio scale was found to have
   the lowest trait variance of the three scaling formats evaluated.
   External construct validation studies revealed a remarkable similarity
   between Japanese females and males, and contrasts between Japanese and
   American seniors revealed reasonably good generalizability between
   countries. Average cognitive age appears to be universal within two
   culturally disjoint countries (the United States and Japan), yet the
   efficacy of individual measurement scales varies between them.

AB Many scholars across various academic disciplines are investigating the
   following questions: What do individuals know or believe about an
   organization? How does a focal organization (and/or other interested
   entity) develop, use, and/or change this information? and How do
   individuals respond to what they know or believe about an organization?
   Cross-disciplinary research that centers on these questions is desirable
   and could be enhanced if researchers identify and develop consistent
   terminology for framing these questions. The authors work toward that
   end by identifying four central "viewpoints" of an organization and
   proposing labels to represent each of these viewpoints: identity,
   intended image, construed image, and reputation.

AB Increasingly, the management of corporations' identities is being
   conducted in the context of empowered, socially engaged, culturally
   adept social actors who present organizations with a range of
   conflicting societal and economic expectations. These social actors,
   referred to as societal constituents, claim moral legitimacy to
   influence the decisions and actions of corporations they feel have
   affected their personal and community,space. Firms' environments come to
   be regarded as complex webs of social groups whereby the cultural
   meanings embedded in their corporate brands come to be morphed across
   the range of social groups. As such, the management of corporate brands
   becomes a task of symbolic facilitation and managing contradictions.

AB The open source (OS) movement allows us to re-vision corporate branding
   from a corporate to a coproducer perspective. Corporations own their
   brands and unilaterally determine their positioning and evolution. Power
   and control are centralized and hierarchical: producers produce brands,
   which customers then consume. With OS, power and control are radically
   decentralized and heterarchical: producers and consumers coalesce into
   "prosumers." The authors introduce marketers to the OS phenomenon and
   develop a typology of brand aspects that can be "open" or "closed":
   physical, textual, meaning, and experience. The authors elaborate new
   dimensions for brands and revisit the, functions that brands perform and
   link these to the evolutionary trajectory of branding, arguing that OS
   represents a final phase in the evolution of corporate brands from
   closed to open brands. The article concludes with a research agenda.

AB The authors studied social alliances, a type of corporate societal
   marketing initiative. Their research finds that social alliances are an
   important means whereby employees identify more closely with their
   organizations while gaining a greater sense of being whole, integrated
   persons. Furthermore, this integration allows both organizations and
   their members to align their commercial identities with their moral and
   social identities. As organizational members struggled to resolve
   conflicts within their own identities, they were aided by social
   alliances, which in turn led them to identify more with their
   organizations. Unlike previous research, the findings suggest that the
   kind of connections referred to by the informants went well beyond the
   cold, rational associations described in previous research to emotional
   attachments that appear to be critical to organizational identification.
   The results also suggest that participation in social alliances may
   result in multiple forms of identification: intra- and interorganization
   identification.

AB Should the same corporate brand imagery appeal to both internal and
   external stakeholders? The authors explored similarities and differences
   in how the dimensions of corporate character affect the satisfaction and
   perceived differentiation of customers and employees of two successful
   retail organizations. Using multigroup structural equation modeling of
   survey data (N = 1,252), the authors found significant differences on
   two dimensions: enterprise and competence. Enterprise (e.g.,
   imaginative, innovative) was positively associated with customer
   satisfaction, had no significant impact on employee satisfaction, and
   was negatively associated with employee perceived differentiation.
   Competence (reliable, leading) was positively associated with employee
   perceived differentiation but had no impact on customer perceived
   differentiation. The influence of chic (stylish, prestigious) was
   similar for both customer and employee satisfaction and differentiation.
   This analysis shows how certain dimensions of corporate character can be
   usefully promoted to both customers and employees, while other
   dimensions would benefit from a stakeholder-specific approach.

AB Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is often used as a key criterion
   in gauging corporate reputation. This research examined the influence of
   consumers' attributions on corporate outcomes in response to CSR.
   Researchers and managers have considered consumers' beliefs about CSR
   initiatives to be simplistic, serving either economic ends or reflecting
   sincere social concerns. The results of two studies established that
   consumers' attributions were more complex than traditionally viewed,
   mirroring many of the motives ascribed to companies by managers and
   researchers. Rather than viewing corporate efforts along a self- or
   other-centered continuum, consumers differentiated four types of
   motives: self-centered motives that are strategic and egoistic and
   other-centered motives that are values driven and stakeholder driven.
   Consumers responded most positively to CSR efforts they judged as values
   driven mid strategic while responding negatively to efforts perceived as
   stakeholder driven or egoistic. Attributions were shown to affect
   purchase intent as well as mediate the structure of an offer.

   the real world is not only less pervasive than has been previously

   which was rather low, stakeholders did react positively to the focal

AB There has been growing interest in both management and marketing
   regarding how individuals become identified with organizations and how
   organizations attempt to manage these identifications. The authors
   present a framework built on explicit and implicit points of convergence
   in research conducted in both these disciplines. In their review of the
   management and marketing literatures, the authors suggest three
   fundamental mechanisms, or "bases," for managing organizational
   identification: relational, behavioral, and symbolic. Furthermore, the
   authors argue that how an individual is affiliated with an organization
   will impact the relative influence of these identification management
   bases. The authors conclude by suggesting how management and marketing
   scholars can create a theoretical space for future interdisciplinary
   work. Such a change would involve moving away from "employees" versus
   "customers" as a prime division between the fields and moving toward a
   more fine-grained approach that emphasizes the unique characteristics of
   individual-organizational relationships.

AB Negative publicity has the potential to create negative corporate
   associations. However, consumers' identification with a company might
   moderate the extent of this effect. This article examines the impact of
   consumer-company identification on reactions to variable levels of
   negative publicity about a company. Exposing consumers who had strong
   identification with a company to moderately negative publicity was found
   to result in less negative corporate associations than for consumers who
   had relatively weak identification. In contrast, consumers' levels of
   identification did not affect reactions to extremely negative
   information, resulting in equally negative corporate associations for
   those with strong versus weak consumer-company identification. Thus,
   strong identification mitigates the effects of moderately negative
   publicity but does not attenuate the effects of extremely negative
   publicity. Consumers' perceptions of and thoughts regarding negative
   information about a company partially mediated the effect of
   identification on attitudes and behavioral intentions.

AB Brand portfolio management addresses, among other issues, the
   interrelated questions of what brands to add, retain, or delete. A small
   number of brands in a firm's brand portfolio can often have a
   disproportionately large positive or negative impact on its image and
   reputation and the responses of stakeholders. Brand deletions can be
   critical from the standpoint of a firm being able to free tip resources
   to redeploy toward enhancing the competitive standing and financial
   performance of brands in its portfolio with the greatest potential to
   positively affect its image and reputation. Against this backdrop, the
   authors focus on the organizational and environmental drivers of brand
   deletion propensity; the predisposition of a firm to delete a particular
   brand from its brand portfolio. The authors propose a conceptual model
   delineating the drivers of brand deletion propensity and suggest
   directions for future research, including the related concept of brand
   deletion intensity.

   Specifically, the authors discuss the importance of the corporate
   branding decision in the M&A process and present a typology of
   alternative redeployment strategies as well as an exploratory study
   examining reactions to different postmerger branding strategies. The
   authors find evidence that the brand equity, related to corporate brands

   a method of historical analysis and construct definition based on
   information in the Oxford English Dictionary. The method's use is
   demonstrated in an analysis of the original meanings that underlie the
   term's usage both as a single word and in compounds such as brand
   competition, brand personality, brand reputation, and so forth. Literal
   (denotative) definitions and metaphoric (connotative) associations are
   examined to explain the use of brand to refer to a physical entity
   and/or a mental representation. The method is also theoretically
   grounded in the disciplines of philology (the history of words),
   poetics, rhetoric, and the philosophy of science. The
   historical-analysis method is applied to the meanings of brand, starting
   with its original usage about 1, 500 years ago and culminating with the
   definitions used by authors in this special issue.

   price dispersion on the Web. These results are contrary to predictions
   from standard economic theory, which suggest that readily available
   price information will result in increased price competition and lower
   price dispersion. Two studies consistently demonstrate that as the mean.
   price of an item increases, price dispersion also increases. These
   results provide evidence that, contrary to general economic
   expectations, the Internet has not commoditized products. Retailers and

   distinguishes between,salesperson in-role behavior performance and
   outcome performance to model in-role behavior performance as a mediator
   between OCB and outcome performance. Second, the work supports sales
   manager control as an antecedent to OCB. A second model introduces
   perceived organizational support (POS) as an additional antecedent to
   salesperson OCB, and more important, as a consequence of sales manager
   control. This construct has not been included in prior salesperson OCB
   studies. Results show sales manager control has a stronger impact on OCB
   through POS, than directly, and POS has a strong impact on salesperson
   OCB.

AB Firms are creating a digitized selling capability by developing Web
   sites designed to provide information and conduct transactions with
   customers, replacing many routine sales force activities. The authors
   use the motivation-ability framework to shape a conceptual model that
   examines the effects of the digitization of selling activity on two
   salesperson outcomes: salesperson effectiveness and salesperson job
   insecurity,,. Using data from salespeople in 168 firms, they assess the
   moderating effects of environmental-level motivational factors and
   firm-level ability factors on the impact of digitization of selling
   activity on salesperson effectiveness and job insecurity. The results
   reveal that digitization has the paradoxical affect of improving
   salesperson effectiveness and heightening job insecurity concerns, and
   also that managers can improve the technology-enabled multichannel
   capabilities of the firm by giving priority attention to human capital
   improvement, sales force control systems, and communication of the
   digitization strategy.

AB Several scholars have noted the importance of relationship marketing and
   the critical role that salesperson knowledge plays in the formation of
   buyer-seller relationships. However; research on salesperson learning
   motivations has been relatively scarce compared with research on
   firm-level learning orientations. One promising stream of research in
   this area is salesperson goal orientation. Drawing from previous work in
   control theory, the authors extend previous research in this area by
   proposing relationships between personality influencers, goal
   orientations, customer/selling orientation, and overall work
   satisfaction. Their hypotheses are tested using data obtained from a
   sample of 190 real estate agents. The results provide support for their
   hypothesized model. Specifically, learning orientation is shown to
   positively influence customer orientation, while performance orientation
   is shown to positively influence selling orientation.

AB Most of the previous research on price changes has focused on price
   decreases. This article investigates the effects of price increases at
   an individual level. The authors argue that customers' reactions to
   price increases (i.e., repurchase intentions) are strongly driven by two
   factors: the magnitude of the price increase and the perceived fairness
   of the motive for the price increase. In this context, the authors
   examine the role of customer satisfaction in influencing the impact of
   these two variables on repurchase intentions after a price increase.
   Their findings reveal that as satisfaction increases, the negative
   impact of the magnitude of a price increase is weakened. Furthermore,
   the results suggest that satisfaction moderates the impact of perceived
   motive fairness. The authors also find that the level of satisfaction
   can influence the valence of the perceived motives in response to a
   price increase.

AB Two important areas are underexplored in the relationship between
   marketing resources and performance. First, the subject has been
   primarily investigated in the context Of Western countries, and
   inadequate attention has been given to emerging economies. Second,
   despite the recent growth in globalization, the moderating role of
   globalization on the link between marketing resources and performance
   has not been investigated. Addressing these important gaps, this article
   focuses on an emerging economy (China) and explores the moderating
   effect of globalization on this link. Specifically, the authors develop
   several hypotheses highlighting the moderating role of globalization
   activities (global product sourcing, global market seeking, and global
   partnership) on the link between marketing resources (market
   orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and innovative capability) and
   firm performance. The findings of the moderating role of globalization
   provide several important implications for marketing theory development
   and managerial practice.

AB The authors derive an expression for the price elasticity of demand in
   the presence of reference price effects that includes a component
   resulting from the presence of gains and losses in consumer evaluations.
   The effect of reference price is most noticeable immediately after a
   price change, before consumers have had time to adjust their reference
   price. As a result, immediate-term price elasticity is higher than
   long-term elasticity, which describes the response of demand long after
   a price change, when reference price effects are negligible.
   Furthermore, because of the differential effect of gains and losses,
   immediate-term price elasticity for price increases and price decreases
   is not equal. The authors provide a quantitative definition for the
   terms immediate term and long term, using the average interpurchase time
   and the discrete "memory" parameter. Practical consequences of the
   distinction between immediate- and long-term elasticities for the
   estimation and use of elasticity values are discussed.

AB Teenagers may engage in consumption behaviors that their parents may not
   approve of as one way of asserting independence. Such behaviors may lead
   teens to attempt to deceive their parents about purchases. This research
   examined teens' tendency toward such deception. The authors
   conceptualize deception as being related to the family communication
   environment and the shopping context in which it takes place. Some
   family communication environments may stifle open discussion of products
   and put-chases, thereby encouraging teen deception. Moreover certain
   patterns of family communication may socialize teens to focus on
   standards exogenous to the family that, in turn, lead to a greater
   propensity to deceive. Susceptibility to normative peer influence, the
   extent of television viewing, and teen materialism may partially mediate
   the effects of the family communication environment. Except for
   television viewing, the authors' predictions are generally supported by
   the data collected from a sample of high school students.

   sponsorships with the National Football League (NFL), Major League
   Baseball (MLB), the National Hockey League (NHL), the National
   Basketball Association (NBA), and the Professional Golfers Association
   (PGA) on the stock prices of sponsoring firms. The primary finding of
   the study is that, in the main, announcements were accompanied by
   increases in shareholder wealth. The 53 sponsors analyzed experienced
   mean increases in stock valuations of about $257 million. A multiple
   regression analysis of firm-specific stockprice changes and selected
   corporate and sponsorship attributes indicates that official product
   sponsorships with the NBA, NHL, and PGA and those with smaller market
   shares were associated with the largest gains in share prices. Although
   corporate cash flow (a proxy for agency conflicts) is statistically
   unrelated to shareholder approval., sponsorships by high-technology
   companies were associated with stronger stockprice reactions than
   otherwise. Finally, product congruence with the sponsored sport was
   positively related to changes in stock prices.

AB Marketing managers face increasing pressure to justify any strategic
   action with financial metrics that facilitate comparative evaluations
   with alternative options. Using event study method, the authors focus
   attention on the impact of high-profile quality achievement awards on
   the stock prices of the award-winning firms. Two types of awards are
   investigated: the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) and J.
   D. Power and Associates Awards (JDPAA). Previous event studies found no
   major impact of MBNQA announcements on the stock price of MBNQA winners;
   in contrast, this study's results show that these awards generate
   significant shareholder value for MBNQA winners. With respect to the
   JDPAA, the authors' analyses did not find any such impact in the
   Automotive, Travel, and Finance categories. Multiple regression analyses
   suggest that firms with higher amounts of intangible assets are more
   likely to create shareholder value. Implications of the results for
   different decision horizon perspectives are derived.

   profitability (i.e., return on equity, return on assets, and return on

   firms from similar industries in the Fortune 1000 list. This suggests
   that for firms seeking enhancements in reportable measures of financial

   personnel, does not provide superior financial performance in comparison
   with other non-diversity elite firms. Shareholder wealth gains to these
   firms, however, are real and significant.

   with firm performance. It is the first empirical research to
   operationalize the EM construct. The new scale, albeit a first attempt,
   demonstrates encouraging psychometric properties. According to the
   resource-based view of the firm, a resource such as EM should directly
   influence firms' capabilities (e.g., new product development success)
   but not competitive advantage (e.g., change in market share). A
   nationwide study of top-level marketing managers supports this
   perspective. In addition, although market turbulence also affects new
   product development success, it does not have an impact on EM. This
   suggests that EM formation is driven by internal rather than external
   forces.

AB Ads of stocks and mutual funds typically tout their past performance,
   despite a disclosure that past performance does not guarantee future
   returns. Are consumers motivated to buy or sell based on past
   performance of assets? More generally, do consumers (wrongly) use
   sequential information about past performance of assets to make
   suboptimal decisions? Use of this heuristic leads to two well-known
   biases: the hot hand and the gambler's fallacy. This study proposes a
   theory of hype that integrates these two biases; that a positive run
   could inflate prices, while a negative run could depress them, although
   the pattern could reverse on extended runs. Tests on two experiments and
   one event study of stock purchases strongly suggest that consumers dump
   "losers" and buy "winners." The latter phenomenon could lead to hyped-up
   prices on the stock market for winning stocks. The authors discuss the
   managerial, public policy, and research implications of the results.

   driven by seven customer-level marketing tactics and shows how actual

   leading to optimal levels of profitability, customer equity, and
   shareholder value. In addition, the authors discuss a successful
   implementation of this strategy for several business-to-business and

AB Firms with export operations have internal environments that are often
   geared toward serving the home market. As a result, export marketing and
   other business functions compete for resources, which thus increases the
   likelihood of conflict between them. Using survey responses from more
   than 700 exporting firms, the authors test a model of the antecedents
   and consequences of two important interaction variables: exporting's
   interfunctional connectedness and conflict. The model explains 52
   percent and 49 percent of variance in exporting connectedness and
   conflict, respectively. The authors identify the key drivers of
   successful interactions as follows: management commitment,
   organizational training and reward systems, relative functional
   identification, centralization, and export employee job satisfaction and
   commitment. The authors also demonstrate that connectedness is most
   critical for export success when export markets are in a state of
   turbulence, whereas conflict is most detrimental when the firm's export
   environment is stable.

   conceptualization of customer orientation that distinguishes between
   attitudes and behaviors. Second, it explores direct and indirect effects
   of customer-oriented attitudes on customer satisfaction. Third, the
   authors propose and examine a positive moderating effect of empathy,
   reliability, and expertise on the link between customer-oriented
   attitude and customeroriented behavior and a negative moderating effect
   of salespeople's restriction in job autonomy. The analysis is based on
   dyadic data that involve judgments provided by salespeople and their
   customers across multiple manufacturing and services industries in a
   business-to-business context. Results support the authors'
   two-dimensional conceptualization of customer orientation. The authors
   also find that customer-oriented attitudes have a direct effect on
   customer satisfaction. The four proposed moderating effects are also in
   evidence.

AB Built upon a cybernetic information-processing framework, this article
   advances and empirically tests a conceptual model proposing the
   relationships between sales controls (outcome, activity, capability),
   salespeople's attributional ascriptions (effort, strategy, ability),
   attributional dimensions (internal/external, stable/unstable), and
   psychological consequences (job satisfaction, performance expectation).
   The study challenges the assumption in the sales literature that
   attributional dimensions cleanly map onto attributional ascriptions.
   Findings support that sales control systems affect salespeople's
   attribution processes in ways suggesting that the processes are more
   malleable than heretofore theorized in the marketing literature.
   Furthermore, the study demonstrates that control systems differentially
   affect attribution processes across two cultures: the United States and
   China. The article concludes with a discussion of research and
   managerial implications.

AB It is widely recognized that a better understanding of interactivity and
   its implications is essential for facilitating research focused on the
   emerging electronic marketplace. However deficiencies persist in our
   understanding of this important concept. Building on research in various
   fields of study (e.g., information systems, marketing, and
   computer-mediated communication), this article presents a
   conceptualization of interactivity from a marketplace perspective that
   is missing or inadequately articulated in the literature. Specifically,
   interactivity is conceptualized as a characteristic of computer-mediated
   communication in the marketplace that increases with the
   bidirectionality, timeliness, mutual controllability, and responsiveness
   of communication as perceived by consumers and firms. The article
   concludes with a research agenda focusing on issues relating to
   measurement, conceptual refinement, and management of interactivity in
   the electronic marketplace.

   relationships between consumer product knowledge and its antecedents,
   including advertising, personal search, interpersonal sources, and brand
   experience. Their findings, based on survey data collected in Budapest
   in 1992 and 1998, indicate that the market information variables explain
   more variance in consumer knowledge later rather than earlier in the
   transition. Advertising is an important predictor of consumer knowledge
   later but not earlier in the transition, personal search is important at
   both times, and interpersonal sources are not important in either time
   period; brand experience is negatively related to knowledge earlier in
   the transition and positively related later in the transition. This
   study allows one to begin to understand the boundary conditions
   associated with studies conducted in developed economies. Managerial
   implications for firms investing in transitional economies are
   presented.

   cognitive responses from individuals in the form of answers to

   completed by a panel of two to four independent judges. This article is
   the first to empirically investigate cognitive intent congruence aspects
   underlining the data generated through cognitive response coding. The
   results show that there are definite gaps in the congruence of cognitive
   intent between the cognitive coding results that respondents, serving as
   cognitive response coders of their own thoughts, can provide and those
   cognitive response patterns provided by independent raters. The current
   study's results raise a "yellow" caution flag regarding external
   independent raters' ability to produce valid cognitive intent coding
   patterns that cannot be ignored by future researchers. The authors offer
   interpretation, implications, limitations, and directions for future

AB Extending scholarship on industry clusters, this article reconsiders the
   relationship between development and marketing opportunities in
   base-of-the-pyramid market (BOPM) nations. Recent literature on industry
   clusters suggests a set of theoretical themes regarding cluster
   efficiencies, governance, adaptability, and performance. These themes
   are scrutinized using an extended case employing longitudinal,
   ethnographic data collected from an indigenous leather-working cluster
   in West Africa. The authors' findings provide guidance in identifying
   local clusters with global market potential in BOPMs. They lead us to a
   dynamic market-driven transformational model of BOPM clusters.
   Consequently, the authors recommend several keys for leveraging
   investments in boundary-spanning firms in BOPM clusters. Finally, the
   article demonstrates the value of microlevel, longitudinal analyses in
   assessing cluster performance in BOPMs.

   facilitates the transfer of knowledge and affect from a parent brand to

   brands and two hypothetical product extensions for each brand,
   demonstrate that the availability of well-formed, goal-derived
   categories associated with a parent brand establishes an organizing
   framework for consumers' assessments of similarity that facilitates the
   transfer of consumer knowledge and attitude from the parent brand to a
   brand extension in another product category. This facilitating effect of
   similarity does not occur in the absence of goal-derived categories. The
   results also reveal how marketing communication can be used to
   facilitate the transfer process by framing similarity in terms of common
   goals. Implications are discussed for the organization of consumer
   knowledge and affect across product categories and for understanding
   prior research findings on brand extension.

AB Marketing concepts such as corporate identity, image, and branding are
   important strategies for nonprofit organizations. In particular, brand
   personality has been advocated by practitioners but has not been
   empirically investigated in the nonprofit context. According to social
   exchange theory and trust, the authors argue that nonprofit
   stake-holders perceive nonprofit organizations at an abstract level
   because of the organizations' intangibility and social ideals. This
   study develops and refines a parsimonious measure of brand personality
   specifically for the nonprofit context. The authors conduct a series of
   six multimethod studies of nonprofit stakeholders to validate the role
   of brand personality in nonprofit organizations. The results yield four
   dimensions of brand personality for nonprofits: integrity, nurturance,
   sophistication, and ruggedness. Thus, current and potential donors
   ascribe personality traits to nonprofit organizations and differentiate
   between nonprofits on the basis of the organizations' personality.
   Finally, nonprofit brand personality may influence potential donors'
   likelihood to contribute.

   The authors use a new approach that combines elements of these two

   3,423 different articles) from 109 syllabi obtained from a broad
   sampling of AACSB-International-accredited schools with marketing

   Journal of Consumer Research, Journal of Marketing Research, Marketing
   Science, and Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science) account for
   66.5 percent of citations in the syllabi. Rankings of journals other
   than the top five vary markedly from previous journal quality studies.
   Few articles are cited in common across programs, and the authors find
   considerable variation even within individual seminar types. The
   findings provide a new basis for assessing the quality of journals and
   provide new insights about the content of doctoral programs.

   attribute the outcome of an event to the disposition of the actor
   regardless of the actor's situational constraints. In most retail
   service settings, there are at least two actors: a person providing

   likely to be blamed? In Study 1, both allocentric and idiocentric
   observers spontaneously attribute outcomes to the disposition of the
   service provider. In Study 2, idiocentric observers do not revise their
   initial attributions; they always blame the service provider In
   contrast, allocentric observers take the service provider's situational
   constraints into account except when they believe that they will become
   outcome dependent on the service provider who has behavioral control.

   develops an interdisciplinary measure of the CIM construct by drawing on
   the literature and primary data, such as exploratory research, a survey,

   consistent behavior through the diffusion of a company's mission,
   values, and goals; (2) the expression and pursuit of brand and image
   consistency in the organization's symbols and forms of communication;
   and (3) the implementation, support, and maintenance of visual systems.

AB As customer-organization relationships deepen, consumers increase their
   expertise in the firm's product line and industry and develop increased
   switching costs. This study investigates the effects of customer
   investment expertise and perceived switching costs on the relationships
   between technical and functional service quality and customer loyalty..
   Technical service quality, is hypothesized to be a more important
   determinant of customer loyalty than functional service quality as
   expertise increases. Both technical and functional service quality are
   hypothesized to have a reduced relationship with customer loyalty as
   perceived switching costs increase. Three-way interactions between the
   main effects of service quality, customer expertise, and perceived
   switching costs yield additional insight into the change in relative
   importance of technical and functional service quality, in customers
   decision to be loyal. Six of eight hypotheses receive support.
   Implications are discussed for customer relationship management over the
   relationship life cycle.

AB One of the assumed benefits of extending a strong brand into a new
   product category is the ability to capture a price premium relative to
   comparable products associated with lower equity brands. The authors
   argue that brand extension price premiums accrue in part due to the
   ability of a known brand to reduce the perceived risk customers
   experience in making purchase decisions. Accordingly, price premiums can
   be expected to vary depending on the risk associated with a purchase
   decision. The authors manipulated perceived fit between a brand and
   extension products and three dimensions of extension product category
   risk. They found that brand-extension price premiums are positively
   related to the perceived fit between the brand and the extension
   category. However this relationship varies considerably depending on the
   levels of financial and social risk associated with the extension
   product category. Implications of these findings for theory, practice,
   and future research are discussed.

AB This work draws on consumer and psychology research to explain
   sociocognitive aspects of product-market dynamics at a higher level of
   specificity than prior research. The authors extend the field's
   understanding of market-shaping shared knowledge through a
   theory-informed discussion of how shared product knowledge comes to
   exist and how it changes as product markets develop. They define shared
   knowledge as the aspects of product representations that are common
   across the minds of market actors, making it possible for them to
   understand one another. The authors also discuss ways to track shared
   knowledge content that is expressed in market narratives. As the
   characteristics of shared knowledge are explained and linked to stages
   of product-market development, the authors develop, a set of
   researchable propositions to guide future research. The theoretical
   arguments and propositions in this article complement extant marketing
   strategy research by integrating individual-level consumer theory with
   market evolution models.

AB Academics and managers are confronted with reconciling the social and
   economic aspects of business-to-business exchanges. In a service
   context, the authors investigate the relative importance of contractual
   and relational governance on exchange performance and the influence of
   the boundary spanner on the implementation of these governance
   mechanisms and on exchange performance. They test a model of the
   governance of commercial banking exchanges using interview data with
   both parties to the exchange (the account manager as the bank's boundary
   spanner and the business client). Relational governance is the
   predominant governance mechanism associated with exchange performance.
   Contractual governance is also positively associated to exchange
   performance, but to a much lesser extent. The closeness of the account
   manager to the client company in terms of information gathering is also
   positively associated to exchange performance. However this is mediated
   through both contractual and relational governance mechanisms with
   relational governance being the stronger mechanism.

   The model posits that an importer's satisfaction with and commitment to
   its relationship with a foreign export supplier will have a positive
   impact on the importer's benevolence toward that supplier, that an
   importer's benevolence positively influences relationship performance,
   and that the benevolence-performance link is moderated by relationship
   duration. The authors tested the model with a sample of U.S. importers
   who buy from foreign exporters. The results indicate that the importers'
   commitment to the relationship signficantly influenced its benevolence;
   however importers satisfaction with the relationship did not
   significantly affect their benevolence. Importers' altruistic
   benevolence had a positive impact on performance in mature relationships
   but not in new relationships. Importers' mutualistic benevolence had a
   significant influence on performance regardless of relationship
   duration.

AB Innovation generation has increasingly been recognized as an outcome of
   interaction between a firm and various outside entities. According to
   this view, supplier involvement and alliances are routes to innovation
   generation. Despite this realization, there is a dearth of research,
   both conceptual and empirical, focusing on innovation generation in
   buyer-seller relationships in supply chains. In an attempt to fill this
   void, this article develops a conceptual model of innovation generation
   in buyer-seller relationships in upstream supply chains. The authors
   propose that innovation generation in supply chain relationships, both
   incremental and radical, is a consequence of interactions between buyers
   and sellers. They also delineate factors internal and external to the
   relationship that moderate the link between interaction and innovation
   generation. Finally, the authors discuss managerial implications of
   their research and offer guidelines for future empirical research.

   In particular a strong marketing planning capability may not only reduce
   the incidence of postplan improvisation but also contain inherent
   process rigidity. Since both of these can also increase performance,
   results illustrate a performance paradox in marketing planning.

   investigates the effects of experiencing pride, where two benefits were
   found. First, pride increases salespersons' performance-related
   motivations. Specifically, it promotes the use of adaptive selling
   strategies, greater effort, and self-efficacy. Second, pride positively
   affects organizational citizenship behaviors. Study 2 takes an
   emotion-process point of view and compares excessive pride (hubris) with
   positive pride. The results show that salespeople are capable of
   self-regulating the expression of these emotions differently toward
   colleagues and customers via anticipated feelings of fear shame, and
   regret. Salespeople, in other words, are affected by their emotions, but
   they also are capable of controlling them to their advantage.

   one-on-one interactions, (2) frequent encounters with the same
   physician, (3) intimate exchanges, (4) substantial variability across
   encounters, and (5) require patient cooperation to achieve successful
   health outcomes. These aspects may increase patient reliance on
   interpersonal elements of the encounter to drive satisfaction (Gronroos
   1982). These interpersonal elements may also encourage compliance with
   medical advice. This study develops and tests a model demonstrating how
   interpersonal elements, as well as communication and participation,
   contribute to positive outcomes using multiple samples. Results support
   interactions among these variables contributing to patient satisfaction
   and compliance. Results also support the role of interpersonal
   interactions in repatronization and recommendation, although these
   relationships vary depending on sample characteristics.

AB Research on risk is built on a complex array of diverse and sometimes
   inconsistent definitions, constructs, models, and outcomes. This study
   examines various literatures to formulate an integrated framework for
   the conceptualization of perceived-risk processing. The framework
   specifies three phases (framing, assessment, and evaluation) and their
   accompanying outcomes of risk attention, perceived risk, and risk-taking
   propensity. Explicit linkages are specified between situational and
   individual characteristics. Perceived-risk evaluation is identified as
   conceptually distinct from assessment of perceived risk, and the
   construct of risk-taking propensity is separated from those of risk
   affinity and perceived risk. The framework further presents points of
   intersection between the literatures on perceived risk and the
   literatures on consumer decision-making, information search, and
   satisfaction. Finally, it serves as an anchor for framing future
   research to promote conceptual and methodological consistency, and to
   guide progress in directions that are consistent with some leading edge
   paradigms outside of marketing.

AB This article investigates the influence of French and American national
   culture on consumer perceptions of product related value. Employing
   means-end theory, hypotheses are developed to predict how French versus
   American national culture influences the content and structure of
   consumer value hierarchies. Hypotheses are tested using data from
   in-depth laddering interviews with a matched sample of French and
   American consumers. The findings support the contention that differences
   exist in the meaning and relative importance of consumer value hierarchy
   dimensions across the two national cultures. Furthermore, the analysis
   suggests that consumption consequences are especially culturally
   sensitive.

AB An organization's customer response capability, its competence in

   critical for sustained success. In this article, the authors examine how
   customer knowledge-process influences customer response capability. They
   highlight two dimensions of customer response capability, customer
   response expertise and customer response speed. It is observed that
   apart from its direct positive association with customer response
   expertise and speed, the customer knowledge process also diminishes the
   positive association between risk propensity and these dimensions of
   customer response capability. The influence of customer response
   expertise and speed on performance is also examined. The hypotheses are
   tested using survey data collected from a sample of retailing firms and
   the findings triangulated using qualitative data collected through depth
   interviews with managers. The results highlight the importance of
   customer knowledge in enhancing customer response capability.

AB Although research into the determinants of service provider switching
   has grown in recent years, the focus has been predominantly on
   transactional, not relational, variables. In this research, the authors
   address the role of consumer commitment on consumers' intentions to
   switch. Drawing from the organizational behavior literature, they build
   on previous service switching research by developing a switching model
   that includes a three-component conceptualization of customer
   commitment. Structural equation modeling is used to test the model based
   on data from a survey of 356 auto repair service customers. The authors'
   results support the notion that customer commitment affects intentions
   to switch service providers and that the psychological states underlying
   that commitment may differ. As such, future marketing research should
   consider these different forms of commitment in understanding customer
   retention. The implications of this model for theory and practice are
   discussed.

   attached to brands. The authors report findings based on secondary
   economic and cultural data at the macro level and the results of a
   global brand-image survey conducted in the top 20 international
   automobile markets at the individual level. The findings suggest that
   while consumers' attitudes toward corporate image and country image
   exert main effects on their brand purchase behavior, the effects of
   certain product-image appeals are moderated by sociodemographics and
   national cultural characteristics. The empirical results are broadly
   supportive of the proposed hypotheses and provide a consumer-based
   extension of Roth's work on global brand image.

AB Most research in customer asset management has focused on specific
   aspects of the value of the customer to the company. The purpose of this
   article is to propose an integrated framework, called CUSAMS (customer
   asset management of services), that enables service organizations (1) to
   make a comprehensive assessment of the value of their customer assets
   and (2) to understand the influence of marketing instruments on them.
   The foundation of the CUSAMS framework is a careful specification of key
   customer behaviors that reflect the length, depth, and breadth of the
   customer-service organization relationship: duration, usage, and
   cross-buying. This framework is the starting point for a set of
   propositions regarding how marketing instruments influence customer
   behavior within the relationship, thereby influencing the value of the
   customer asset. The framework and propositions provide the impetus for a
   research agenda that identifies critical issues in customer asset
   management.

AB Although researchers and managers pay increasing attention to customer
   value, satisfaction, loyalty, and switching costs, not much is known
   about their interrelationships. Prior research has examined the
   relationships within subsets of these constructs, mainly in the
   business-to-consumer (B2C) environment. The authors extend prior
   research by developing a conceptual framework linking all of these
   constructs in a business-to-business (B2B) service setting. On the basis
   of the cognition-affect-behavior model, the authors hypothesize that
   customer satisfaction mediates the relationship between customer value
   and customer loyalty, and that customer satisfaction and loyalty have
   significant reciprocal effects on each other. Furthermore, the potential
   interaction effect of satisfaction and switching costs, and the
   quadratic effect of satisfaction, on loyalty are explored. The authors
   test the hypotheses on data obtained from a courier service provider in
   a B2B context. The results support most of the hypotheses and, in
   particular, confirm the mediating role of customer satisfaction.

AB We do things for people we like, our friends. However in firm-to-firm
   exchange relationships, boundary spanners are economic agents
   representing their firms contractually to achieve specific goals. Thus,
   questions arise as to whether close interpersonal relationships exist in
   business settings, how they are defined, and whether they influence the
   nature and functioning of interfirm exchange. A qualitative study with
   advertising agency account managers finds that analyzing interpersonal
   relationships across groups from both sides defines firm-to-firm
   relationships. Participants define these relationships based on the
   extent to which the agency is involved in the client's business across
   categories including vendor partner, and surrogate manager.
   Interpersonal relationships exist across categories including strictly
   business, business friends, and highly personal. The relationships are
   distinguished based on the knowledge base developed about the brand
   manager Overwhelmingly, the participants claim that developing close,
   interpersonal relationships is beneficial to both their professional and
   personal lives.

AB Sales contests, a widely used form of sales force special incentives,
   receive considerable attention in the trade and academic press. While
   understanding salespersons' preferences for various contest designs is a
   critical first step for understanding how sales contests motivate
   salespeople to pursue contest goals, a knowledge gap exists in
   understanding design preferences. With expectancy theory serving as a
   theoretical basis, the authors develop hypotheses about preferences for
   sales contest components. Following tests of hypotheses using survey and
   conjoint data provided by field sales forces from three companies,
   exploratory analyses of how individual, supervisory, and sales setting
   characteristics may affect preferences suggest potential boundary
   conditions for initial findings. The results lead to an improved
   awareness of the determinants of contest design preferences as well as
   insights and implications for sales managers seeking to design effective

AB Although it has frequently been argued that the job satisfaction of a

   systematic research exploring this link is scarce. The present study
   investigates this relationship for salespeople in a business-to-business
   context. The theoretical justification for a positive impact of
   salespeople's job satisfaction on customer satisfaction is based on the
   concept of emotional contagion. The analysis is based on a dyadic data
   set that involves judgments provided by salespeople and their customers
   collected across multiple manufacturing and services industries. Results
   indicate the presence of a positive relationship between salespeople's
   job satisfaction and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the
   relationship between salespeople's job satisfaction and customer
   satisfaction is found to be particularly strong in the case of high
   frequency of customer interaction, high intensity of customer
   integration into the value-creating process, and high product/service
   innovativeness.

   tests potential drivers of cheating. Potential material gain and repeat
   purchase intent were tested across three studies, whereas satisfaction,
   ease of invoking the guarantee, morality, shame, self-monitoring, and
   Machiavellianism were each tested in a subset of the three studies. The
   results for potential material gain and repeat purchase intent were
   consistent across all three studies: potential material gain had no
   effect on consumer cheating, but repeat purchase intent reduced that
   tendency. Other findings suggest that high levels of satisfaction,
   morality, and self-monitoring reduce cheating, whereas high levels of
   Machiavellianism increase cheating. Furthermore, two three-way
   interaction effects were encountered. Specifically, Machiavellianism
   interacted with gain and ease of invocation, and with gain and repeat
   purchase intent. In both cases, individuals with high Machiavellianism
   took advantage of certain situational constellations.

   them through an empirical analysis of data on the book and compact disc
   categories in Italy during 2002. Their results, based on an analysis of
   13,720 price quotes, show that when posted prices are considered,
   traditional retailers have the highest prices, followed by multichannel
   retailers, and pure-play e-tailers, in that order However when shipping
   costs are included, multichannel retailers have the highest prices,
   followed by pure-play e-tailers and traditional retailers, in that order
   With regard to price dispersion, pure-play e-tailers have the highest
   range of prices, but the lowest standard deviation. Multichannel
   retailers have the highest standard deviation in prices with or without
   shipping costs. These findings suggest that online markets offer
   opportunities for retailers to differentiate within and across the

   specificity on selling behaviors (selling effort, adaptive selling, and
   sales planning) and hence sales and behavior performance. The model
   suggests that goal-setting factors may have opposing effects on
   different sales behaviors. The empirical findings suggest that goal
   difficulty positively influences selling effort while negatively
   influencing adaptive selling behaviors. The results show that goal
   difficulty and goal specificity both have opposite effects on the two
   dimensions of working smart: adaptive selling and sales planning. The
   findings support the need for sales managers to account for the cultural
   context of the salesperson when determining optimal goal-setting
   strategies. With data collected from salespeople in the United States

AB While there is a significant amount of research on determinants of
   selling effectiveness for individual salespeople, there is a surprising
   lack of study of factors that affect selling effectiveness in
   team-selling situations. The authors focus on the context of key account
   management (KAM) and develop a conceptual model of factors that affect
   KAM effectiveness. They test hypotheses with data from 385 firms using
   structural equation modeling and find that firms should seek to build
   esprit de corps among those involved in KAM, should proactively initiate
   activities with key accounts and do these activities more intensively,
   should ensure that key account managers have access to key resources
   within the marketing and sales organization, and should involve top
   managers of the firm.

AB How do consumers perceive new product variants that are positioned on
   atypical attributes? The authors investigate the joint effects of three
   factors: brand familiarity, retail shelf display, and consumer goal
   orientation. The study focuses on snack foods positioned on the atypical
   attribute of low fat. There are three main findings. First, although
   high (vs. low) brand familiarity causes relatively unfavorable
   perceptions on the positioning attribute, it also creates sufficiently
   favorable perceptions on another determinant attribute, product taste,
   resulting in a net positive effect for brand equity on purchase
   likelihood. Second, goal-based versus taxonomic shelf display (i.e.,
   placement with health foods vs. regular snack foods) results in
   relatively negative perceptions on the positioning attribute, yet more
   favorable buying intentions. Finally, more (vs. less) health-oriented
   consumers rate such product variants less favorably on fat content but
   more favorably on product taste; the former segment is also more likely
   to buy such product variants.

AB This research focuses on the diffusion patterns of the adjacent
   generations of technology and its relation to the time that elapses
   between them (intergeneration time). The authors analyze 45 new
   technologies in 15 industries and find that the adoption curves
   systematically vary across generations from 2 years for dynamic
   random-access memory (DRAM) chips to more than 30 years for steelmaking.
   The longer the intergeneration time, the slower the adoption of the
   subsequent technology. Even though once the adoption begins imitation is
   greater for subsequent technologies, the slow initial innovation rate,
   driven by resistance to upgrading, retards adoption. The authors also
   demonstrate that predictions based on intergeneration time plus average
   patterns are more accurate than data-based predictions early in life
   cycles when such predictions are most crucial. Improved early
   predictions can provide advantages in terms of both making go versus
   no-go decisions and planning marketing and production.

AB Few, if any, past studies have attempted to develop a model to capture
   and explain industry context variability and hypothesize its effects on
   consumer-firm relationships. Generally, industry effects are ignored,
   described, or explained post hoc. Using the notion of consumers'
   dispositions toward a market, a framework is proposed for understanding
   the influence of industry context on consumer satisfaction, trust,
   value, and loyalty in relational exchanges. The empirical results of a
   survey in two service industries show that industry contexts matter and
   yield significant direct and moderating effects on consumer firm
   relationships. The study underscores the promise of a dispositional
   approach for providing insights for the theory and practice of
   relationship marketing, resolving outstanding questions, and proposing
   fruitful areas for further examination.

   flexibility. It begins with a review of the historical perspectives of
   strategic flexibility. To support the conceptualization, the authors
   offer a theoretical schema that considers market-focused strategic
   flexibility as conceptually rooted in capabilities theory,
   resource-based views of the firm, and options. With the
   conceptualization in place, the authors propose an integrative model
   that explicates the mediating role of market-focused strategic
   flexibility in marketing strategy frameworks. Propositions are developed
   relating market-driven and driving orientations to market-focused
   strategic flexibility with consideration for how turbulent macro
   environments modify the relationship. In addition, the authors offer
   propositions regarding outcomes of market-focused strategic flexibility
   under conditions of macro environmental turbulence.

   these findings and shows how anger and service encounter dissatisfaction
   differentially affect customer behavior It provides empirical support
   for the contention that anger mediates the relationship between service

   perform that are associated with linking a service organization to its

   nonprofessional service providers of a major retail bank and a sample of
   90 higher-level, professional service providers from the business credit
   division of an international financial services corporation. The results
   demonstrate that (1) indirect paths through job satisfaction and
   organizational commitment entirely account for the negative effects of
   the role stressors on COBSBs, (2) the indirect negative effects of the
   role stressors are stronger on external representation and internal
   influence behaviors, and (3) role conflict also has a significant
   positive direct relationship with internal influence behaviors.

   Applying a framework that captures the intensity of e-business adoption

   order-based explanations. More recently, schema-based explanations have
   also been suggested. The authors propose a mediated-effects model of the
   pioneering advantage and test the model in two separate longitudinal
   studies. Both experiments support the proposed model. The authors find
   that experience order and pioneer status have additive effects on brand
   preference such that perceptions of first-in-market and
   first-experienced brands are more favorable, suggesting that both
   explanations are operative. The authors also provide evidence that the
   effects of pioneer status on brand preference are mediated by attitude
   toward the brand and company credibility, while the effects of
   experience order on brand preference are mediated by attitude toward the
   brand and attribute recall. These data support the notion that the
   effect of pioneer status on brand preference is the result of both
   brand-level and company-level associations.

AB The authors investigate how reward schemes of a loyalty program
   influence perceived value of the program and how value perception of the
   loyalty program affects customer loyalty. The results show that
   involvement moderates the effects of loyalty programs on customer
   loyalty. In high-involvement situations, direct rewards are preferable
   to indirect rewards. In low-involvement situations, immediate rewards
   are more effective in building a program's value than delayed rewards.
   Under high-involvement conditions, value perception of the loyalty
   program influences brand loyalty both directly and indirectly through
   program loyalty Under low-involvement conditions, there is no direct
   effect of value perception on brand loyalty.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the link between
   launch strategy decisions and new product performance. Much of that
   research focuses on investigating successful launch strategies for
   innovative, high-technology products. With the rapid growth of
   information technology as one high-technology sector, in certain
   industries, network effects occur, which change the competitive game.
   The existing literature offers little decision making guidance to
   managers on how to successfully introduce a product that exhibits
   network effects. The authors discuss the influence of network effects on
   the dynamics of market competition and on consumers' consumption
   behaviors. They argue that, because of these changes, the priority of
   particular performance objectives and the impact of specific launch
   strategies differ for products that exhibit network effects from what
   current wisdom and empirical results prescribe. These ideas are
   formalized in a conceptual framework and a series of research
   propositions.

   personality was employed to identify the antecedents and three
   validating criteria of a newly developed trait labeled job
   resourcefulness (JR). JR is defined as an enduring disposition to garner
   scarce resources and overcome obstacles in pursuit of job-related goals.
   Across three service contexts, JR was shown to predict customer
   orientation. self-rated performance, and supervisor-rated performance.
   The results also revealed that the hierarchical model accounted for more
   variance in performance ratings than one version of the 5-Factor Model
   of personality. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for
   selecting high-performing service employees.

   suggest that top management commitment to service quality, as manifested
   by frontline employees' appraisal of training, empowerment, and rewards,
   has a significant effect on their perceptions of service recovery
   performance. The influence of management commitment to service quality
   on service recovery performance is mediated by frontline employees'

   judgments. The author's findings indicate that consumers might fail to
   form satisfaction evaluations in an online manner in typical
   repeat-consumption situations. Instead of consciously reevaluating
   familiar products or services, consumers may choose to engage in
   judgment updating/formation processes only when faced with a
   postpurchase satisfaction inquiry. Surprise performances or inconsistent
   service delivery, however, greatly reduce the consumer's reliance on
   prior judgments. Under these conditions, consumers are motivated to
   spontaneously update their summary evaluations stored in memory. The
   implications of the memory-based nature of satisfaction judgments to
   service and retail managers are briefly discussed.

   additional and/or different relationships. The findings of their
   reinquiry include the following: (1)family structure is positively
   related to the happiness dimension of materialism; (2) the predicted
   direct effect of family structure on compulsive buying was not
   supported, suggesting that divorce m ay not affect compulsive buying
   until early adulthood; and (3) the mediating roles of family stressors
   and family resources, and the moderating role of socioeconomic status
   may require additional investigation. Directions for future research in
   this nascent area of inquiry are offered.

AB The management of customer switching costs has been hampered by the lack
   of a comprehensive typology for conceptualizing, categorizing, and
   measuring consumers' perceptions of these costs. This research develops
   a switching cost typology that identifies three types of switching
   costs: (1) procedural switching costs, primarily involving the loss of
   time and effort; (2) financial switching costs, involving the loss of
   financially quantifiable resources; and (3) relational switching costs,
   involving psychological or emotional discomfort due to the loss of
   identity and the breaking of bonds. The research then examines the
   antecedents and consequences of switching costs. The results suggest
   that consumers' perceptions of product complexity and provider
   heterogeneity, their breadth of product use, and their alternative
   provider and switching experience drive the switching costs they
   perceive. Furthermore, all three switching cost types significantly
   influence consumers' intentions to stay with their current service
   provider, explaining more variance than does satisfaction.

   expectations of relationship continuity had lower service recovery
   expectations after a service failure and also attributed that failure to
   a less stable cause. Both the lower recovery expectations and the lower
   stability attributions were associated with greater satisfaction with
   the service performance after the recovery. These effects appeared to be
   key processes by which relationships buffer service organizations when

AB The typical view of a marketing channel is that of a
   manufacturer-designed and -controlled distribution system. However,
   today, marketing functions, as well as market power are more evenly
   distributed in the channel. In organizing and managing the modem
   channel, it is important to understand the business circumstances and
   priorities confronting channel members. This article studies how
   re-seller firms establish their goal hierarchies and how these goals are
   related to performance. It hypothesizes that goal priorities emerge in
   relation to the environmental imperatives faced by the firm. The article
   develops hypotheses that are tested on survey data collected from a
   sample of franchisee firms, using structural equation models. The
   results support all the hypotheses about the effects of primary goals on
   performance. The effects of secondary goals are not unequivocal but
   informative nevertheless. Overall, the study points to interesting
   theoretical and managerial conclusions.

AB Customer satisfaction is the predominant metric firms use for detecting
   and managing customers' likelihood to defect. But while satisfaction and
   defection are related, satisfaction is only a weak predictor of whether
   a customer will defect. This article suggests that for repurchase
   decisions that involve an information-based evaluation of alternatives
   to the incumbent, likelihood of defection will be influenced by "how
   much" customers know about those alternatives. The relationship between
   level of knowledge about alternatives and defection is examined in the
   context of actual health insurance choices. Results suggest that the
   level of objective and subjective knowledge about alternatives has a
   direct effect on likelihood of defection-above and beyond satisfaction
   level. The view of defection forwarded in this article suggests that
   managers may be able to gain additional control over customer defection
   through actions aimed at influencing how much customers know (or come to
   know) about alternative vendors.

AB The effect of dynamism in the downstream (i.e., customer and
   competitive) environment on the manner in which manufacturers manage
   their upstream (i.e., supplier) relationships is not well understood in
   the literature. While some prior studies suggest that manufacturers will
   adopt relational governance with suppliers in response to dynamism in
   the downstream environment, other studies suggest that manufacturers
   will avoid relational governance with suppliers when faced with
   environmental dynamism. Drawing from the literature on interparty
   learning, the authors develop a conceptual framework wherein the
   validating conditions for each conclusion are identified. Results from a
   survey of 221 manufacturing organizations show that in dynamic
   environments, manufacturers adopt (avoid) relational governance with
   suppliers under two conditions: (1) when manufacturer collaborative
   belief is high (low) and (2) when supplier knowledge is high (low). The
   results are discussed in terms of their managerial and future research
   implications.

AB This study examines the role of customer emotions in the context of
   service failure and recovery encounters. It investigates how customers'
   emotional responses to service failures influence their satisfaction
   judgments after accounting for cognitive antecedents of satisfaction.
   The study also considers how customers' emotional responses to service
   failures influence how they evaluate an organization's recovery efforts.
   The research is conducted by surveying customers about their
   satisfaction judgments in two service settings, restaurants and hotels.
   The results suggest that customers' emotional responses to service
   failures will influence their recovery effort evaluations and
   satisfaction judgments in some circumstances and that the effects of
   emotion vary across industry settings. This study identifies the types
   of efforts that are most effective in helping customers "recover" from
   the negative emotions caused by service failures.

AB Previous conceptualizations of attitudinal commitment are extended by
   considering two very different components of a manufacturer's attachment
   to an independent channel intermediary. Relying on commitment theory, a
   model is developed that describes how attitudinal commitment may reside
   in either the instrumental or the social strain of a manufacturer's
   relationship with its distributor For each strain, the developmental
   role played by key facets of the channel setting-relative dependence,
   pledges, and trust-are shown. Furthermore, the nature of the attachment
   bond is posited to motivate very different governance mechanisms as the
   distribution agreement is enforced by either social or contractual
   means. Empirical support for the model demonstrates that an expanded
   view of attitudinal commitment is important in understanding the complex
   nature of attachment in channel relationships.

   emotions have not been fully explored. This research investigates how
   individuals' cognitive interpretations of situations correspond to the
   emotions they experience in these contexts. Using analysis of variance
   and multiple discriminant analysis, our results show a systematic
   relationship between cognitive appraisals and 10 consumption emotions.
   The authors' findings offer theoretical insights into these consumption
   emotions, the appraisal/consumption emotion correspondence, basic-versus
   subordinate-level category differences in emotions, and mixed
   consumption emotions. The findings provide a practical framework for
   academics and practitioners interested in better understanding and

   sibling brands (those owned by the same parent company). In a case study
   of a retail coffee market, the authors examine how these brand
   relationships might influence the sibling and competitor brands'
   responses to entry. Using an empirically validated brand-share
   attraction model, the authors compare the actual responses to entry with
   the optimal responses under different incumbent objectives. The authors
   find that the responses by sibling brands are more accommodating than
   those of unrelated brands whose responses are consistent with the
   preservation of preentry levels of sales.

AB The Internet is emerging as a powerful connecting force, allowing firms
   to serve customers, collaborate with partners and suppliers, and empower
   employees more effectively than ever before. In the network economy,
   relationships with key stakeholders are becoming valuable assets of the
   firm, but few firms manage relationships effectively. The authors
   propose that firms need to take a more holistic approach to
   understanding where their relational equity resides and how it should be
   managed and measured. They also propose that relational equity is not
   limited to relationships with customers but also includes relationships
   with partners, suppliers, and employees. Effective management of
   relational equity requires firms to think in an integrative manner along
   several dimensions: strategy, process, technology, organization design,
   and metrics. The authors develop conceptual frameworks for each of these
   dimensions. Taken together these frameworks offer a conceptual
   foundation for research and managerial practice on managing relational
   equity.

   suggest a specific process by which marketing actions influence
   consumers. This article offers a broader philosophical perspective on
   measuring the effectiveness of marketing communications that focuses on
   interaction as the unit of analysis, rather than the behavior of either
   the marketer or the consumer Structuration theory is discussed and
   offered as a viable foundation for the identification, selection, and
   evaluation of new measures of effectiveness in an interactive context
   among active, goal-driven consumers and marketers. Structuration theory
   focuses on the emergence and evolution of the structure of interaction,
   which is posited as a critical factor in devising, selecting, and
   evaluating new measures of the effectiveness of marketing
   communications. This view broadens the potential set of measures of
   effectiveness of interactive marketing communications, implying
   alternative meanings for measures under different interaction structures

   on technology as part of the shopping process. A national survey of
   2,120 online consumers was conducted to explore how people want to shop
   in both online and in-store environments and determine how interactive
   and conventional media work together to move consumers through the
   purchase process. The study investigated 128 different aspects of the
   shopping experience, from common elements to recent innovations. The
   results indicated that consumers are generally satisfied with the
   convenience, quality, selection, and value provided by retailers today.
   They are less satisfied with the level of service provided, the
   availability of product information, and the speed of the shopping
   process. The findings suggest that new technologies can enhance the
   shopping experience, but applications must be tailored to the unique
   requirements of consumer segments and product categories.

AB It has been hypothesized that the online medium and the Internet lower
   search costs and that electronic markets are more competitive than
   conventional markets. This suggests that price dispersion of an item
   with the same measured characteristics across sellers at a given point
   in time for identical products sold by e-tailers online should be
   smaller than it is offline, but some recent empirical evidence reveals
   the opposite. Based on an empirical analysis of 105 e-tailers comprising
   6,739 price observations for 581 items in eight product categories, the
   authors show that online price dispersion is persistent, even after
   controlling for e-tailer heterogeneity. The general conclusion is that
   the proportion of the price dispersion explained by e-tailer
   characteristics is small. Also, after controlling for differences in
   e-tailer service quality, prices at pure-play e-tailers are equal to or
   lower than those at bricks-and-clicks e-tailers for all categories
   except books and computer software.

AB Internet shopbots are automated tools that allow customers to easily
   search for prices and product characteristics from online retailers.
   Some market observers have predicted that shopbots will benefit
   consumers at the expense of retailers. In this view, shopbots will
   radically reduce consumer search costs and reduce retailer opportunities
   to differentiate their products; as a result, they will drive retailer
   margins toward zero. However a review of the literature suggests that
   while shopbots may place pressure on retailer margins in some
   circumstances, retailers retain numerous opportunities to differentiate
   their products, leverage brand names, set strategic prices, and reduce
   the effectiveness of consumer search at shopbots. The article closes by
   identifying significant questions for future research.

AB The World Wide Web has significantly reduced the costs of obtaining
   information about individuals, resulting in a widespread perception by
   consumers that their privacy is being eroded. The conventional wisdom
   among the technological cognoscenti seems to be that privacy will
   continue to erode, until it essentially disappears. The authors use a
   simple economic model to explore this conventional wisdom, under the
   assumption that there is no government intervention and privacy is left
   to free-market forces. They find support for the assertion that, under
   those conditions, the amount of privacy will decline over time and that
   privacy will be increasingly expensive to maintain. The authors conclude
   that a market for privacy will emerge, enabling customers to purchase a
   certain degree of privacy, no matter how easy it becomes for companies
   to obtain information, but the overall amount of privacy and
   privacy-based customer utility will continue to erode.

AB Many businesses on the Internet in the late 1990s spent wildly, doing
   whatever it might take to attract customers to their sites. It soon
   became clear that the challenge was not simply to bring the customers in
   the door but also to retain these customers for future purchases. The
   quest was onto discover what tactics had the most appeal to Internet
   shoppers. This study reveals survey and behavioral data drawn from
   Internet customers that reflect what was most important to the Internet
   shoppers and compare the factors for attraction versus retention. Since
   many have viewed the Internet as creating more perfect information for
   the buyer, the question arises as to how important price will be in the
   purchase process. What becomes clear from the analysis is that what
   attracts customers to the site are not the same dimensions critical in
   retaining customers on a longer term basis.

AB In the year 2000, several dot.com retailers filed for bankruptcy, shut
   down their operations, or faced the risk of their stock being delisted
   on the stock market. But did any dot.com retailer do it right? Were
   there any winners? If yes, who are these winners? What is the product
   and firm profile of these winners? What lesson, if any, can be learned
   from these winners and losers? This article addresses these questions
   based on a study of 48 dot.com retailers, conducted in December 2000.
   The study identified 1-800contacts.com as the sole winner using two
   performance indicators: percentage change in stock price since the
   initial public offering and stock options underwater Based on a proposed
   conceptual framework of product and firm characteristics, the profile of
   1-800contacts.com is compared with the hypothesized winner Amazon.com,
   and other dot.com retailers. Implications of the study and limitations
   and opportunities for future research are discussed.

AB In the context of the wars between the upstart Internet retailers and
   the existing bricks-and-mortar retailers, many e-marketing techniques
   were invented. This article develops a single unifying and theoretically
   based taxonomy for e-marketing techniques: the e-marketing mix. Drawing
   on the paradigms of exchange, relationships, and digital interactions in
   networks, 11 e-marketing functions are identified that form the elements
   of the e-marketing mix. Nine of the 11 e-marketing functions are
   considered basic, while 7 functions moderate the effects of others and
   are termed overlapping. The 11 e-marketing functions provide a
   categorization of the e-marketing techniques. Compared to the
   conventional marketing mix, the e-marketing mix has more overlapping
   elements and directly represents personalization, an aspect of
   segmentation, as a basic function. The existence of multiple elements
   that are basic and overlapping in the e-marketing mix indicates that
   integration across elements should be more commonplace compared to the
   traditional marketing mix.

AB The authors review an incumbent business-to-business distributor of
   electronic components faced with the entry of more than 50
   Internet-based competitors and offer an explanation for why the
   distributor prevailed. Underlying the explanation is an assertion that
   the appropriate unit of analysis is the buyer-distributor-seller triad,
   not the buyer-seller dyad. In the case examined, the channel activities
   were interrelated such that when each party calculated the costs and
   benefits of the activities that occurred within this three-way
   relationship, they out-weighed the net gains from disintermediation or
   Internet intermediation. Particular conditions favoring the status quo
   included existing activities for sharing customer identification
   information between the distributor and the seller a high proportion of
   negotiated distributor-customer contracts, and new entrants' reliance on
   open technologies. While no claims are made about the generalizability
   of this explanation beyond the case studied, the authors believe their
   assertion and hypotheses may have broader applicability.

   sourcing activities. This phenomenon represents a novel emerging area of
   inquiry with significant implications for sourcing strategies. However
   there is little systematic thinking or empirical evidence on the topic.
   This article reviews the use of these auctions in sourcing activities
   and highlights four key aspects: (1) the differences from physical
   auctions and those of the theoretical literature, (2) the conditions for
   using online reverse auctions, (3) the methods for structuring the
   auctions, and (4) the evaluations of auction performance. Some empirical
   evidence on these issues is also provided.

   by all kinds of consumers and under different situational contexts. This
   study investigates the moderating effects of consumer traits and
   situational-factors on the relationships within a core attitudinal model
   for technology-based self-service. An experimental design is used with
   perceived waiting time and social anxiety (through perceived crowding)
   as the situational treatments. Relevant consumer traits for
   technology-based self-service are examined and include inherent novelty
   seeking, self-efficacy with respect to technology, selfconsciousness,
   and the need for interaction with an employee. The results lend support
   to the hypothesized moderating effects. Implications for set-vice

   possible antecedents in the context of personal selling. Applying social
   cognitive theory, this study posits that while self-efficacy positively
   affects performance, the salesperson's learning effort directly affects
   self-efficacy. Furthermore, two task-related factors (perceived job
   autonomy and customer demandingness) and one individual difference
   variable (trait competitiveness) are proposed to affect salesperson
   learning effort and self-efficacy. Two empirical studies show consistent
   results regarding the positive effects of learning on efficacy and

   constructs on learning and efficacy. Implications and future research

   relationship between perceived quality performance, customer
   satisfaction, and repurchase loyalty. The authors define and measure the
   constructs within a relative attitudinal framework and compare these
   results to a noncomparative or individual evaluation of products. In
   addition, loyalty is measured and defined as self-reported repurchase
   behavior instead of purchase intention. The proposed model, with
   satisfaction as a mediator between quality and repurchase loyalty, was
   found to bean acceptable representation of the data across four products
   and for both comparative and noncomparative evaluations. The use of
   relative attitudes, however indicated a much stronger relationship
   between quality, satisfaction, and loyalty than the attitudes toward a
   product when they are performed as an individual evaluation. With
   respect to predictive ability, the study findings suggest that quality,
   satisfaction, and loyalty should be defined and measured within a
   relative attitudinal framework.

AB Although periodic review is a prominent feature of new product
   development (NPD) processes, important questions about how managers make
   critical continuation/termination decisions in risky NPD projects remain
   unanswered. The authors test whether factors unrelated to a new
   product's forecasted performance cause managers to continue NPD projects
   into subsequent stages of development at rapidly accelerating costs. The
   results show that managers who initiate a project are less likely to
   perceive it is failing, are more committed to it, and are more likely to
   continue funding ding it than managers who assume leadership after a
   project is started. There is also the tendency toward increased
   commitment for more innovative products compared with less innovative
   ones. The results suggest that simply giving managers better information
   will not necessarily lead to better decisions. Finally, the results show
   that escalation of commitment is a more serious problem during NPD than
   after the product is commercialized.

AB This article explores the important role of liking in the development of
   the buyer's trust in the sales rep. The authors argue that liking's role
   is richer and qualitatively different from that of the more cognitive
   antecedents of trust. They posit that many cognitive antecedents of
   trust operate mainly through liking. They argue that as the buyer-sales
   rep relationship matures, liking plays an even more important role in
   influencing trust. The authors empirically testa model delineating the
   mediating role of liking in developing trust. They find that when the
   relationship between the buyer and the sales rep is young, liking
   partially mediates the effect of similarity of business values and fully
   mediates the influence of frequency of personal interaction on trust.
   Moreover as the buyer's relationship with the rep ages, liking takes the
   foreground in trust development, while more cognitive antecedents recede
   into the background.

AB The growing number of academic studies on customer satisfaction and the
   mixed findings they report complicate efforts among managers and
   academics to identify the antecedents to, and outcomes of businesses
   having more-versus less-satisfied customers. These mixed findings and
   the growing emphasis by managers on having satisfied customers paint to
   the value of empirically synthesizing the evidence on customer
   satisfaction to assess current knowledge. To this end, the authors
   conduct a meta-analysis of the reported findings on customer
   satisfaction. They document that equity and disconfirmation are most
   strongly related to customer satisfaction on average. They also find
   that measurement and method factors that characterize the research
   often. moderate relationship strength between satisfaction and its
   antecedents and outcomes. The authors discuss the implications
   surrounding these effects and offer several directions for future
   research.
