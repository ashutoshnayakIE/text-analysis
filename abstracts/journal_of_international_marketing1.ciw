AB Despite considerable research on export performance, relatively little
   scholarly attention has been devoted to incorporating managers'
   perspectives into operationalizing this concept. This study proposes a
   new approach for measuring small and medium-sized enterprises' export
   performance in the presence of multiple, potentially conflicting, goals
   while accounting for different approaches to assessing export
   performance. Adopting a contingency approach, the authors develop two
   customized measures of perceived export performance: the individualized
   perceived export performance framework and the simplified model. They
   demonstrate the application of both measures with a sample of 78
   exporting small and medium enterprises in New Zealand and compare the
   outcomes. The proposed frameworks are intended to measure export
   performance considering managers' specific priorities and by
   incorporating manager- and firm-specific differences in the types and
   importance of goals, indicators, and benchmarks. This article extends
   the understanding of export performance by proposing a more nuanced and
   holistic measurement approach that is tailored to individual firms and
   reflects firm-specific idiosyncrasies.

AB Extensive research has investigated how perceived brand globalness (PBG)
   and perceived brand localness (PBL) affect brand. In this systematic
   literature review, the authors organize and synthesize the literature on
   PBG and PBL by analyzing 95 articles published in the past 17 years.
   They identify similarities, inconsistencies, and omissions in the
   literature by investigating different conceptualizations of PBG and PBL,
   boundary conditions of PBG and PBL effects on brand preference,
   psychological mechanisms through which PBG and PBL affect brand
   preference, the theoretical foundations underlying PBG and PBL research,
   and methodological approaches used in the literature. The study outlines
   avenues for further research based on prior research and current global
   trends, such as hybridization/glocalization marketing strategies,
   antiglobalization trends, and digitalization.

AB International marketing has rarely explored the diffusion patterns of
   the spread of a disease or analyzed the factors explaining the
   differences in the disease incidence patterns. The rapid diffusion of
   the novel coronavirus has engulfed the entire world in a very short
   time. Many countries experienced different levels of disease incidence
   and mortality despite implementing similar nonpharmaceutical
   interventions (NPIs). Drawing on the regulatory focus theory, the
   authors propose a framework to conceptualize and investigate the
   comparative efficacy of diverse NPIs that countries could adopt to
   prevent or curtail the diffusion of the disease incidence and mortality.
   They categorize these NPIs as prevention focused (containment and
   closures) or promotion focused (relief measures and public health
   infrastructure) and discuss the moderating factors that enhance or
   impede their effectiveness. Employing functional data analysis, the
   authors examine a comprehensive data set across 70 countries. They find
   that prevention-focused interventions inhibit disease incidence, while
   promotion-focused interventions enhance the nation's ability to respond
   to medical emergencies and augment people's ability to isolate
   themselves and slow the spread. The authors also generate insights on
   how a reallocation of resources between prevention- and
   promotion-focused efforts influence the evolution of disease incidence
   and mortality, with various countries falling in different clusters.

AB Country-of-origin (COO) research cites the influence of country-level
   actions on consumers' attitudes but does not specify how such actions
   might influence the COO image, particularly in a climate change context.
   However, various countries adopt different climate change actions, with
   notable potential implications for products associated with the nations'
   images; therefore, it is vital to understand the relationship between
   climate change actions and consumers' attitudes toward their country.
   This study, which solicits responses from 1,389 consumers in France,
   Morocco, and the United States, investigates whether and how climate
   change actions influence each COO image and consumers' attitudes toward
   it, which vary with consumers' level of climate change concern. Such
   climate change actions also exert distinct effects that are moderated by
   the cultural context. Therefore, this study extends the COO literature
   to a climate change context and provides relevant implications for
   policy makers and marketing managers aiming to improve their COO image.

   between domestic collaborations and international collaborations. The
   authors tested their conceptual model with data from the U.K. Community
   Innovation Survey (2010-2016). Using different time lags for
   exploitation and exploration, the findings indicate that the impact
   varies over time. Specifically, they reveal that the effect of
   exploitation is negative in the long term but positive in the short
   term, while exploration has no significant effect in the short term but
   a positive influence on export sales growth in the long term. Similarly,
   the moderating effect of domestic and international collaborations has
   been found to vary over time. The authors conclude with a discussion of
   the theoretical and practical implications.

AB With the growing importance of strategic alliances and supply chains as
   competitive units, academics and practitioners are interested in
   understanding the techniques used by firms to leverage interfirm
   relationships to gain a competitive advantage. Studies conducted in the
   Western context underline the role of relational governance (i.e., the
   modern Western way), whereas works in the Chinese context highlight the
   importance of guanxi (i.e., the traditional Chinese way). Today's
   Chinese economy operates as a hybrid of the Western modern business
   model and traditional Chinese patterns with the coexistence of Western
   relational governance and guanxi. Therefore, this study addresses two
   issues: (1) whether these two types of governance interact as
   substitutes or complements in leveraging interfirm relationships and (2)
   whether and how foreign firms differ from their Chinese domestic
   counterparts in the use of these two types of governance to improve
   performance. Drawing on data collected from 132 third-party logistics
   providers in China, this study shows that Western relational governance
   and guanxi function as substitutes in improving performance. Moreover,
   while guanxi contributes to performance in a similar manner in Chinese
   domestic firms and foreign firms, Western relational governance is more
   effective for foreign firms than for Chinese domestic firms.
   Furthermore, the joint role (i.e., interaction effect) of Western
   relational governance and guanxi in improving performance also differs:
   these two forms of governance function as substitutes in foreign firms,
   whereas they have no significant interaction in Chinese domestic firms.

AB The number of expatriates has been steadily growing during the last two
   decades. For these reasons, academia has exhibited a growing research
   interest in expatriates' food consumption choices. Although interest is
   there, the extant literature is inconclusive about conditions under
   which expatriate consumers make trade-offs between host-country (local)
   and global food products and brands. The present study presents
   mechanisms that explain expatriate consumers' compensatory coping
   behaviors and choices between local versus global food brands. By
   drawing on compensatory control theory and the person-environment fit
   framework, the authors test the influence of adaptation efforts and
   retail system properties on expatriate consumers' food brand choices.
   Survey findings from 232 expatriates who currently live in five Middle
   Eastern countries reveal that a higher engagement in adaptation efforts
   (acculturation and general adjustment) leads to a dominant preference
   for local (vs. global) food brands. Moreover, this study illuminates the
   importance of retail system properties by showing that a host country's
   retail system development positively moderates the relationship between
   adaptation efforts and local food brand choices, whereas retail
   similarity has a negative impact.

AB Firms strategically expand to countries that offer important location
   advantages. Yet, for digital firms, which can instantly release their
   technologies worldwide, it is unclear whether a focus on specific
   locations can still provide strategic advantages. The authors argue that
   digital firms reap critical demand-side location advantages for the
   internationalization of their technologies by strategically interacting
   with users in lead markets that exhibit either high within-country
   demand heterogeneity or preference overlaps with several other
   countries. Simply penetrating a lead market is not enough, however, as
   both demand-side and supply-side factors influence the digital firm's
   potential to take advantage of lead markets. On the demand side, a
   digital firm should avoid focusing on paying users or acquiring light
   users. On the supply side, the digital firm must deploy adequate
   technological and marketing capabilities to benefit from user
   interactions in lead markets. Thus, the authors link demand-side
   opportunities and supply-side firm capabilities to develop nuanced
   theory on how digital firms can spur international expansion. They find
   empirical support for their arguments by analyzing a large multicounty
   database of mobile apps in Apple's App Store.

AB Firms invest in brand capital through advertising. Financial constraints
   hinder firms' ability to fund their investment projects. Empirical
   studies in the finance literature suggest that firms' access to external
   financial resources, labeled "financial development," affects their
   investment behavior. The authors take the view of advertising spending
   as investment in brands and study the effect of financial development on
   advertising spending at the country level using a panel of 59 developing
   and developed countries during 1990-2016. The results suggest that
   financial development has a positive and significant effect on
   advertising spending, and this effect is stronger in countries with a
   low level of economic development. Furthermore, the authors investigate
   the role of national culture dimensions including uncertainty avoidance,
   long-term orientation, collectivism, masculinity, and power distance in
   the relationship between financial development and advertising. Overall,
   the results provide evidence that the impact of financial development on
   advertising spending depends on the national culture dimensions.

AB Marketing managers generally have to make marketing decisions under
   financial constraints (i.e., the firm's inability to generate cash flow
   for investments and marketing), with limited assurance of the outcomes.
   Little investigation has been made into the effect of financial
   constraints on marketing intensity and the subsequent effect on firm
   value and performance, particularly when it is a volatile environment
   (e.g., Latin America) that creates the financial constraints. Using a
   conceptual framework grounded in agency theory, the authors develop a
   model and test it using a panel data set from the United States and five
   Latin American countries. The results indicate that financial
   constraints have a negative effect on marketing intensity and ultimately
   negatively affect firm value and performance. Furthermore, this study
   confirms the effect of three moderators-market sensitivity, country
   governance quality, and country economic development distance-on the
   relationship between financial constraint and marketing intensity and
   helps explain differences across the United States and Latin America.

AB Research has long established the existence of a global brand halo that
   benefits global brands by triggering "global equals better" inferences
   by consumers. Nevertheless, little is known about the conditions under
   which this halo may or may not be used or about whether and, if so, how
   it can situationally fade. Drawing from regret theory, the authors posit
   that anticipating regret can conditionally both attenuate and accentuate
   consumers' use of the global brand halo and develop a serial conditional
   process model to explain the mechanism underlying regret's influence.
   The results of two experimental studies show that anticipated regret
   affects global brand halo use-and subsequently relative preference for
   global or local brands-by increasing consumers' need to justify their
   purchase decision. Whether and how consumers will use the global brand
   halo depends on consumers' product category schema, while the intensity
   of the halo's use depends on consumers' maximization tendency. The
   findings offer a decision-theory perspective on the competition between
   global and local brands and empirically based advice on managerial
   interventions that can influence global or local brand market shares.

AB Eco-innovations are increasingly manufactured and consumed across
   national borders. Although global outsourcing can be financially
   profitable, it is questionable whether consumers respond to
   eco-innovations manufactured in different countries in the same way.
   This article introduces the ecological country-of-manufacture (COM)
   concept, which reflects consumers' perception of a country's commitment
   to sustainable development policy and practices. Drawing on schema
   theory, the current research examines how consumer reactions to
   "ecological (in)congruence"-when the sustainability reputation of a COM
   is a (mis)match with product eco-friendliness levels-vary across product
   categories (Study 1a), consumption contexts (Study 1b), and national
   settings (Study 2). Consumers report more preferential evaluations when
   there is ecological incongruence for privately consumed products and
   ecological congruence for publicly consumed products. The results also
   demonstrate the differential moderating effects of socioeconomic
   development factors and cultural dimensions. In emerging markets with
   highly embedded, hierarchical, and high-harmony cultures, consumers
   require ecological congruence to justify their adoption decisions,
   whereas in developed markets with highly autonomous, egalitarian, and
   high-mastery cultures, consumers are more likely to adopt
   eco-innovations that are ecologically incongruent.

AB China is the world's second largest retail market and is expected to
   surpass the United States in 2020. This makes China a must-win market
   for global and local firms. However, manufacturers often find it hard to
   reach Chinese consumers due to China's institutional and infrastructure
   weaknesses. The advent of online third-party marketplaces provides
   manufacturers with a new model to tackle these challenges. The question
   remains, however, whether and to what extent joining online third-party
   marketplaces in China can generate market value. Using an event study
   methodology, the authors assess the net impact of online marketplace
   adoption in China on manufacturers' expected profitability. Although the
   abnormal returns are, on average, significant and positive, stock
   markets recognize that not all manufacturers can reap benefits. To delve
   deeper into this variation, the authors relate the abnormal returns to
   various sources of manufacturers' market knowledge and marketing
   capabilities. They find that less diversified manufacturers with
   marketplace experience are expected to achieve greater gains,
   irrespective of their origin. However, the effects of marketing
   strengths diverge for foreign and local firms.

AB Online grocery in China is on the rise. With large differences in
   brands' abilities to secure a portion of China's online pie, a key
   question is what drives these differences. The authors derive how a
   brand's total sales change as the online grocery share goes up, and they
   show that it depends on two indices: (1) the brand's online index
   (brand's online category share relative to its offline category share)
   and (2) the category's online index (category's grocery share online
   relative to its grocery share offline). The authors then identify brand
   and category factors that drive these indices. They estimate their model
   on 448 brands in 60 product categories in China using 2011-2015 data.
   Their analyses show that the brand online index mainly increases with
   higher levels of online availability, lower online-to-offline price
   ratios, and for "trusted," less "fun" brands. As for the category online
   index, expensive, less frequently bought categories benefit from the
   shift toward the online channel, whereas the opposite holds for
   perishable and heavy categories.

AB Research contrasting the marketing strategies of foreign and domestic
   firms within local markets is scarce but is of critical importance to
   both types of firms. This research examines how intentional
   cannibalization (IC) functions in Western and Chinese enterprises
   operating in China and evaluates IC's impact on radical innovation and
   subsequent performance while accounting for the moderating effects of
   cost leadership and differentiation strategies. The investigation
   uncovers important marketing strategy concerns for firms competing in
   emerging markets such as China. The results demonstrate that IC on its
   own correlates with radical innovation for Western firms, but not for
   Chinese firms. For Chinese firms, the link between IC and radical
   innovation becomes significant only in combination with a cost
   leadership strategy. For Western firms, the link between IC and radical
   innovation is strengthened when these firms pursue a differentiation
   strategy and, in contrast to Chinese firms, radical innovation mediates
   the effect between IC and performance. Thus, the way IC and radical
   innovation affect performance varies across Western and Chinese
   enterprises. These findings bolster and extend research regarding
   strategies of local and nonlocal firms in home markets.

AB Efforts to engage customers in cocreating new products have garnered
   much research attention from studies documenting customer cocreation's
   (CC's) positive impact on firm innovation and performance. Less
   research, however, has counterbalanced the bright side with the
   potential dark side of CC, especially as a strategy for multinational
   corporations (MNCs) operating in foreign markets. This study examines
   how MNC subsidiaries' CC affects new product innovativeness and
   knowledge leakage to competitors. Adopting a broader agency perspective
   to recognize that subsidiaries often do not perform up to headquarters'
   expectations due to both self-serving opportunism and honest
   incompetence, this study explores how CC effects are contingent on MNCs'
   global management mechanisms. Using a dyadic managerial survey of 238
   MNC subsidiaries, the authors find that MNCs can control knowledge
   leakage by implementing proper global integration and local adaptation
   mechanisms. However, CC may not improve new product innovativeness,
   except when the subsidiary has low local research-and-development staff
   influence. This study contributes to the CC literature by showing its
   benefits, challenges, and boundary conditions as a growing MNC
   innovation strategy.

AB Trust is key to relationship marketing. Although trust is bilateral,
   studies on the dispersion of trust among exchange parties remain
   limited, leaving the antecedents and outcomes of trust asymmetry largely
   underexplored. To fill the gaps, this study empirically examines the
   effects of different types of trust asymmetry on exchange performance
   and then investigates the institutional origins of trust asymmetry in
   international interfirm exchanges. Drawing on a survey of 134
   international buyer-supplier relationships in China, the study finds
   that both calculative trust asymmetry and relational trust asymmetry
   have negative influences on exchange performance. The study also finds
   that formal institutional distance constrains calculative trust
   asymmetry and informal institutional distance increases relational trust
   asymmetry. Moreover, prior interactions and expectations of continuity
   significantly moderate the effects of formal and informal institutional
   distance. This study advances trust studies in cross-border settings.

AB The author reexamines the cyclical sensitivity of national advertising
   expenditure with a longitudinal data set of 59 countries over 35 years.
   In contrast to prior studies, the author examines the effects of the
   entire set of Hofstede culture dimensions to study cross-country
   variation in the advertising sensitivity and investigates how the
   emergence and growth of online advertising has transformed the cyclical
   sensitivity of advertising spending. National culture substantially
   affects advertising's cyclical sensitivity, but in different ways than
   hypothesized previously. Consistent with the literature, advertising
   sensitivity is lower in long-term-oriented and high-uncertainty-avoidant
   countries and is unrelated to individualism. However, power distance is
   unassociated with cyclical sensitivity, and masculinity and
   indulgence-the two dimensions ignored in previous research-reduce
   cyclical sensitivity. Moreover, there is evidence that culture operates
   differently for the cyclical sensitivity of online advertising.
   Advertising expenditure is cyclically much more sensitive than
   documented previously and has grown more so over time since the advent
   of online advertising. This study provides initial evidence that online
   spending is more elastic than traditional advertising and that
   traditional spending has become more procyclical. The author advances
   timely and refined empirical generalizations on the cyclical sensitivity
   of advertising expenditure.

AB This article analyzes how political leaders communicate with their
   target audiences and examines whether they adopt a country-specific
   communication persona, or react to the global media-intensive
   environment by offering more universal communication. Politicians
   communicate through presentational (e.g., social media) and
   representational (e.g., press) outlets, and the compatibility between
   these outlets represents the leader's effectiveness in transmitting the
   desired messages to the audience. The authors of this study suggest a
   theoretical framework that classifies public figures' communication
   along two dimensions: universality (particular-universal) and media
   compatibility (low-high). The authors used language processing tools to
   study the sentiment, topic mixture, and use of pronouns by 61 global
   world leaders in more than 300,000 messages from the leaders' Twitter
   accounts and press articles. The results show a high level of
   universality across political leaders in sentiment, topic mixture, and
   pronoun usage. The media compatibility is high, with Twitter being
   slightly more positive. Most leaders fall within the categories of
   Cosmopolitan Antagonist (high universality, low media compatibility) and
   Global Icon (high universality, high media compatibility). Overall, the
   sentiment of their communications is positive. Popular topics include
   diplomacy, economy, corruption, and the Arab world. No significant
   relationship was found between the sentiment or communication topics and
   country characteristics.

AB Rapid global economic development and liberalization have increased the
   motivation and opportunities for firms to enter into international joint

   marketing literature have examined the impact of international partners'
   cultural differences on IJV longevity; however, results are
   inconclusive, potentially due to limitations in the methods used. While
   this study examines the varied impact of cultural differences on IJV
   longevity based on the IJV's age, it uses quantile regression, enabling
   the detection of varying effects' strengths across the dependent
   variable's entire distribution. The results demonstrate variations in
   the role of cultural differences across individual cultural dimensions
   as well as variations in the patterns of association between cultural
   differences and IJV longevity dependent on the IJV's age. Implications
   for theory and the practice of international marketing are offered as
   well as potential applications of this study's methodological approach.

AB The literature on consumer choice between global and local brands is
   focused on sales-based measures of brand globalness (BG). When managers
   need to establish an effective social media campaign to raise awareness
   of their brands' activities on social media, the literature focus may
   not provide clear guidance on how such measures can be applied to social
   media. This research contributes to global brand research by combining
   the literature streams on consumer social media engagement and global
   branding marketing strategies. First, to provide a managerial tool for
   this task, the authors propose two novel measures, BG and country brand
   popularity (CBP), based on consumers' brand activities on social media.
   Using these measures, the authors hypothesize that CBP is influenced by
   cultural, social, and economic factors, which is motivated by
   motivation-opportunity-ability theory. Using Facebook data covering the
   top 100 brands that operate across 50 countries in each of 51
   industries, they show that CBP is influenced by BG and cultural, social,
   and economic characteristics.

AB Although prior research is congested with constructs intended to capture
   consumers' dispositions toward globalization and global/local products,
   their effects appear to replicate with difficulty, and little is known
   about the underlying theoretical mechanisms. This investigation revisits
   the relationship between prominent consumer dispositions (consumer
   ethnocentrism, cosmopolitanism, global/local identity, globalization
   attitude) and perceived brand globalness as determinants of consumer
   responses to global brands. Drawing on selective perception and social
   identity theories, the authors consider several theory-based model
   specifications that reflect alternative mechanisms through which key
   consumer dispositions relate to brand globalness and affect important
   brand-related outcomes. By employing a flexible model that
   simultaneously accounts for moderating, mediating, conditional, and
   direct effects, we empirically test these rival model specifications. A
   meta-analysis of 264 effect sizes obtained from 13 studies with 23
   unique data sets and a total sample of 1,410 consumers raises concerns
   regarding the (potentially overstated) utility of consumer dispositions
   for explaining consumer responses to global brands. It also reveals a
   need for further conceptual contemplation of their function in
   international consumer research and managerial practice.

   with import buyers, and the resulting relational performance. They test
   the model with data collected from 262 Greek exporters using structural
   equation modeling. The results indicate that higher levels of exporter
   emotional intelligence enhance communication and social bonding with the
   importer while diminishing distance and conflict in their working
   relationship. Relational performance is positively influenced by
   communication and social bonding but negatively affected by distance and
   conflict. The results also reveal the moderating effect of both
   opportunism and interpartner incompatibility on the association between

   reactions to a new product introduction in a foreign country, along with
   the moderating impact of cultural context. Using a sample of 1,154
   products in 34 product categories launched in 48 countries between 2011
   and 2018, the authors investigate how product characteristics such as
   product innovativeness and product type affect abnormal stock reactions
   to a new product launch event. Furthermore, the authors assess the role
   of the national culture by considering the individualism, uncertainty
   avoidance, and indulgence characteristics of the country where the new
   product is launched. Results of a mixed-effects estimation model
   indicate that product launches in international markets with
   innovativeness and hedonism characteristics positively affect firm
   value. The effects of culture are complex and multifarious, providing
   valuable insights regarding the impact of new product introductions in

   and Chinese exporters. Results suggest contrasting moderating effects of
   experiential knowledge resources (i.e., psychic dispersion,
   multinationality, and duration) and strategy adaptation on the

   the U.K. sample, the authors observe a positive moderation effect of
   psychic dispersion and negative moderation effects of multinationality
   and duration. For the China sample, they find the exact opposite pattern
   of moderation effects for the experiential knowledge resources.
   Marketing strategy adaptation plays a negative moderation role in the

   ventures (RYVs) in both domestic and international networks of
   relationships and knowledge contexts are important for value creation,
   growth, and success of these firms and embody a unique research
   opportunity. Drawing on a framework combining a business relationship
   perspective and the knowledge-based view, the authors propose that RYVs
   take advantage of business relationships and opportunity knowledge from
   both international and domestic markets to nurture their innovation.
   They test their model on a sample of 200 RYVs in China. The findings
   reveal that business relationships are essential for acquiring knowledge
   about technological and business opportunities, though only
   international opportunity knowledge and domestic business relationships
   positively influence new product development. In addition, the
   interaction between international and domestic business relationships
   constrains firms' capacity for obtaining international opportunity
   knowledge. This study offers insights into how the trade-offs between
   dual relationships and subsequently sourced knowledge contribute to new
   product development in emerging markets, and it extends the discussion
   on the paradox view of business relationships with geographically

   separate areas of research on the COO cue: performance-related COO
   images and performance-unrelated country emotions. The authors reconcile
   diverse existing perspectives from both areas into the overarching
   country-induced predispositions model. Conceptualizations and
   measurement approaches for the model's five components are developed and
   empirically validated across three countries and with five COOs. The
   model offers researchers and managers with an interest in the COO cue a
   flexible and operational roadmap, with scales both for in-depth analyses

AB Little is known in the literature about dynamic export pricing, and
   particularly how the external environment interacts with a firm's export
   pricing decisions and its long-term effect on export sales. Therefore,
   this study develops a longitudinal framework to examine the quadratic
   effect of dynamic export pricing and its interaction with
   customer/competitive turbulence on export sales. By employing
   product-level longitudinal data, the authors also estimate the lagged
   effect from past dynamic export pricing and export sales while
   simultaneously controlling for endogeneity and unknown firm
   heterogeneity. The results indicate that dynamic export pricing appears
   to have inverted quadratic effects on export sales; this quadratic
   relationship is moderated by customer turbulence and competitive
   turbulence. The authors also focus on the changes of the curve and
   shifts of the turning point and delineate the fit lines that pinpoint
   the optimal dynamic export pricing in different export markets. Finally,
   previous actions and outcomes significantly influence the following
   year's export sales, which explains the long-term relationships.

AB The extant literature has not examined the conditions that govern
   integrative and exclusionary reactions to cultural hybrid products with
   sufficient detail. Within an emerging-market setting, this study
   explores how culturally mixed symbolic products (CMSPs) from foreign
   global brands can avoid antagonistic consumer attitudes. Building on
   social categorization theory, the authors argue that foreign global
   brands are viewed as belonging to an out-group and may thus encounter
   difficulties in tapping local cultural capital, resulting in a negative
   relationship between brand globalness and consumer attitude toward
   CMSPs. However, they contend that product category moderates this
   relationship such that there is a stronger negative effect for nonfood
   products than for food products. Moreover, the authors theorize that (I)
   cultural respect by foreign global companies directly enhances consumer
   attitudes toward CMSPs and (2) cultural respect attenuates the negative
   brand globalness-CMSP attitude link. These hypotheses are tested using a
   representative consumer sample from eight provinces/municipalities in
   China (n = 646). Results provide important implications for global
   companies on how to benefit from local cultural resources in their
   localization processes.

AB One popular strategy for brands to grow outside of their home markets is
   to use line extensions. Although extensive research has examined how
   factors such as culture influence product acceptance across markets, far
   less is known regarding how such factors influence parent brand
   perceptions in response to an extension. This article investigates the
   role of one aspect of culture, consumers' thinking styles, in terms of
   postextension parent brand spillover effects, and considers potential
   implications for firms' global brand strategies, including the
   extension's direction (upward or downward) and parent brand concept
   (functional or prestige). Through two studies, one using consumer panels
   in the United States and India and the other set in the United States,
   the authors examine consumer-level differences by measuring thinking
   styles. Results based on both studies indicate that vertical line
   extension type affects analytic thinkers' reactions more than those of
   holistic thinkers, and parent brand image benefits (suffers) when a
   vertical line extension is for a functional (prestige) brand, regardless
   of consumers' thinking style. The authors find interesting differences
   in the role of thinking styles based on the particular dimension
   examined.

   country-based interaction orientation and marketing strategy
   implementation adaptation/standardization as drivers of global profit
   growth, contingent on the environmental conditions of competitive
   intensity and market dynamism. The findings from a survey of U.S.-based
   MNCs indicate that managerial attention focused on country-based
   interaction orientation and marketing strategy implementation
   standardization, when considered jointly, have a positive effect on MNC
   profit growth. The findings also show that the effect of a country-based
   interaction orientation on MNC profit growth is not as susceptible to
   competitive intensity and market dynamism when MNCs standardize their
   marketing strategy implementation, but it varies when MNCs take a more
   adapted approach to their implementation strategies across country
   markets. These findings bring to light important implications for

   the hypotheses on a sample of Chinese consumers with respect to salient
   brands from 12 product categories. The results indicate that three of
   the theoretical approaches examined can explain only one side of
   favoritism-most commonly favoritism toward domestic brands-but not
   favoritism toward both domestic and foreign brands. Consumer
   xenocentrism, a concept rooted in system justification theory, seems to
   provide more consistent predictions for both domestic- and foreign-brand

AB Intercultural service encounters, in which customers and service
   employees from different cultures interact, are becoming more common in
   the market. Despite the importance of such encounters for international
   marketers, limited research attention has been directed to this area.
   Drawing on social exchange theory, this study examines how frontline
   employees' cultural intelligence (CQ) influences customer loyalty
   outcomes of service quality perceptions. Specifically, the authors
   propose that the three components of CQ-cognitive,
   emotional/motivational, and physical-have differential moderating
   effects on the perceived service quality (PSQ)-customer loyalty link and
   that these effects vary across two national markets. Data collected with
   a multirespondent (i.e., frontline service employees and customers)
   cross-cultural research design indicate that cognitive CQ negatively
   mitigates the impact of PSQ on customer loyalty in an emerging-market
   context while emotional/motivational CQ has a positive moderating effect
   in a mature-market setting. When service employees have high physical
   CQ, the positive role of PSQ in creating and maintaining customer
   loyalty is strengthened in both markets. The authors discuss these
   implications for theory and practice.

   article reports the findings of a study conducted with 606 Ukrainian
   consumers, which aims to identify personality drivers and behavioral
   outcomes of consumer animosity as well as the moderating role of
   cultural characteristics. Structural equation modeling reveals that
   extraversion and conscientiousness have a negative effect on consumer
   animosity, whereas neuroticism and openness are positively associated
   with this feeling. However, no significant relationship was observed
   between animosity and agreeableness. In turn, consumer animosity was
   found to influence product avoidance, and this association became
   stronger in the case of consumers that have higher levels of power
   distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and masculinity. The
   study also showed that male and educated consumers are more likely to
   harbor animosity toward a hostility-evoking country, while age and
   income had no control effect on animosity. Several implications for
   theory and practice are derived from the study findings, and directions

AB Unlike their counterparts in developed markets, emerging-market firms
   are characterized by limited resources, including international
   experience and access to relevant information, which are essential for
   developing suitable international marketing strategy (IMS). Under such
   circumstances, strategies are expected to produce suboptimal results,
   especially when targeting competitive markets in advanced economies.
   Prior IMS research has largely focused on developed markets. In
   contrast, the authors examine IMS of exporters in Thailand, an emerging
   market. Despite major differences in environments and processes in
   emerging markets, they establish that Thai exporters that match their
   IMS to local market conditions realize superior performance, as
   predicated by strategy coalignment. The authors validate these results
   and discuss emerging-market firms' capacity to adapt their strategies
   and succeed in highly competitive advanced economies, despite relative
   inexperience, volatility, and information asymmetry at home. Exporting
   remains of critical importance to the economies of emerging markets, and
   the findings provide greater optimism for their firms' ability to
   address host-market conditions in their marketing strategies, as well as
   pointing to the competitive threat posed by these emerging-market

AB Consumers around the globe expect firms to contribute to environmentally
   and socially responsible causes. Using construal level theory with a
   spatial distance lens, we examine effects of spatial proximity of the
   firm (domestic firm vs. foreign multinational corporation [MNC]), cause
   (domestic vs. global), and consumer cultural identity (locally oriented:
   nationalism and consumer ethnocentrism; distantly oriented: global
   identity and global citizenship through global brands) on consumer
   attitudes toward the firm. Across three studies with a focus on Russia
   and environmental causes, we consistently find that nationalism
   moderates consumer attitudes, whereas consumer ethnocentrism, global
   identity, and global citizenship through global brands do not. When
   firms engage in cause-related marketing and focus on proximal causes,
   nationalistic consumers are more favorable toward domestic firms (vs.
   foreign MNCs). When firms are not engaged in cause-related marketing,
   consumers with stronger nationalism are more favorable toward domestic
   firms, and consumers with weaker nationalism are more favorable toward
   foreign MNCs. Importantly, the effects of nationalism are mitigated when
   foreign MNCs and domestic firms engage with global causes. Product
   involvement, environmental concerns, and marketplace skepticism are
   predictors of attitudes toward the firm. The results highlight the
   importance of considering the socio-historical-political context of a
   given country and locally oriented nationalistic beliefs.

AB Although the literature generally indicates that service attentiveness
   can increase consumer satisfaction, providing extra care and attention
   in service encounters may backfire and lead to negative consumer
   outcomes. In addition, because of cross-cultural differences, the
   effects of high service attentiveness may vary across international
   markets. The authors conduct a qualitative study, a field experiment,
   and two laboratory experiments in three countries (Canada, the United
   States, and China) across various service contexts (hairdressing,
   telecommunications, and computer repair) to examine cross-cultural
   consumer responses toward high service attentiveness. Consumers'
   negative responses toward high service attentiveness are mediated by
   their suspicion of ulterior motive, which varies according to their
   self-construal. Specifically, consumers with an interdependent
   self-construal (either chronic or primed) tend to have greater suspicion
   of and negative responses toward high service attentiveness.
   Furthermore, the effect of interdependent self-construal fostering
   greater suspicion is attributed to a sharper in-group (vs. out-group)
   distinction, which is mitigated when the service employee is perceived
   to be an in-group member. The authors conclude by discussing the
   theoretical and managerial implications and suggesting future research
   directions.

   involved, the authors show that both the intensity of internal pricing
   coordination and price adaptation have a positive effect on export
   performance. Specifically, in highly turbulent export markets, the
   intensity of internal pricing coordination contributes to export
   performance. Furthermore, a high level of horizontal dispersion of
   pricing authority is advisable in countries in which the enforcement of

   explore whether the differences between male and female shopping styles
   are greater than the differences in shopping styles exhibited by
   consumers across countries. With a conceptual model, this study tests an
   extant convergence hypothesis that predicts that men and women should
   grow more similar in their shopping styles as traditional gender-based
   divisions in wage and domestic labor disappear. The results of a survey
   of shopping behavior across I I countries indicate though that men and
   women are evolutionarily predisposed to different shopping styles. These
   differences in shopping styles also are greater in countries with higher
   levels of gender equality. Empathizing, or the ability to tune in to
   others' thoughts and feelings, mediates shopping styles more for women;
   systemizing, or the degree to which a person possesses spatial skills,
   mediates shopping styles more for men. These results suggest that

   beauty appears universal, industry evidence suggests that it is
   particularly strong in Asia. This research examines the effect of
   culture on the pursuit of beauty. Three studies provide converging
   evidence that interdependent self-construal increases the likelihood of
   using appearance-enhancing products. Study 1 operationalizes culture
   through nationality and self-construal and shows that Easterners (more
   interdependent) are more likely to use appearance-enhancing products
   than Westerners (less interdependent). This use is driven by
   interdependents' tendency to conform to societal norms, which in turn
   leads to heightened self-discrepancy (Study 2). The use of
   appearance-enhancing tools helps minimize this discrepancy. Study 3
   shows that strength of norms moderates the impact of interdependence on
   the use of appearance-enhancing tools. When norms are loosely defined
   and adherence is not strictly enforced, interdependents' appearance
   enhancement tendency is reduced. This research offers actionable
   insights into the pursuit of beauty, marketing of beauty brands, policy
   making, and consumer well-being.

AB Cross-cultural studies indicate the importance of service quality and
   loyalty in different nations, but they do not specify how cultural
   context affects the relationships between such constructs. The current
   research investigates whether mall service quality and its specific
   dimensions affect loyalty, as well as how cultural contexts moderate the
   relationships between these constructs in three developing countries
   (Morocco, Senegal, and Tunisia). With a sample of 750 real customers,
   the authors show that mall service quality and its specific dimensions
   affect customer loyalty through the positive mediation of customer
   satisfaction and mall perceived value. Depending on the country, service
   quality dimensions (mall physical aspects, reliability, problem solving,
   and personnel attention) have distinct effects on customer loyalty.
   Furthermore, mall service quality drives customer loyalty positively in
   Morocco and Senegal. Customer satisfaction has a positive effect on
   customer loyalty in Senegal and Tunisia. Due to their different cultural
   contexts, these three developing countries do not exhibit a homogeneous
   pattern.

AB Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has become
   a key method in international marketing research. Users of PLS-SEM have,
   however, largely overlooked the issue of endogeneity, which has become
   an integral component of regression analysis applications. This lack of
   attention is surprising because the PLS-SEM method is grounded in
   regression analysis, for which numerous approaches for handling
   endogeneity have been proposed. To identify and treat endogeneity, and
   create awareness of how to deal with this issue, this study introduces a
   systematic procedure that translates control variables, instrumental
   variables, and Gaussian copulas into a PLS-SEM framework. We illustrate
   the procedure's efficacy by means of empirical data and offer
   recommendations to guide international marketing researchers on how to
   effectively address endogeneity concerns in their PLS-SEM analyses.

AB Despite promising growth, mobile commerce (m-commerce) still represents
   only a small proportion of the world's total e-commerce market. The
   research behind this article moves away from the predominantly
   single-country (typically developed) and utilitarian-focused market
   scope of past research to examine and provide a more nuanced
   understanding of customers' motivations, whether utilitarian or hedonic,
   for using m-commerce across six countries. The six-country context, with
   data collected from 1,183 m-commerce users, offers a unique opportunity
   to advance mobile-retailing literature by comparing customers' value
   perceptions, trust, and m-commerce use across disparate national
   markets. By treating motivations as conditions activated by individuals'
   chronic regulatory orientations, our results show that hedonic
   motivation plays a more significant role in influencing customers' value
   perceptions and trust for those who are promotion oriented (Australia
   and the United States), whereas utilitarian motivation plays a more
   important role for those who are prevention oriented (Bangladesh and
   Vietnam). Finally, both hedonic and utilitarian motivations play an
   important role in influencing customers' value perceptions and trust for
   those who are moderately promotion and prevention oriented (India and
   Pakistan). These results offer insights to mobile retailers operating
   internationally in their decisions to standardize or adapt the
   mobile-shopping environment to deliver the most valuable, trustworthy,
   and engaging solutions to customers.

AB Despite the prominence of social media (SM) in global branding, no prior
   studies have evaluated an international brand's strategy of establishing
   market-based relational ties with SM users in local markets. This study
   draws from the resource-based theory to conceptualize SM ties as latent
   relational resources and evaluate an international brand's SM ties
   strategy on the basis of three resource attributes: value,
   inimitability, and rarity. Whereas value is the initial basis for a
   relational resource in SM, inimitability and rarity are the foci of an
   international brand's strategy in local SM networks. The authors
   interviewed brand managers and SM users in China and New Zealand and
   conducted direct observations on brands' SM sites. They develop two
   theoretical frameworks (one initial; one advanced) to offer insights
   into the development of brand-user ties as a relational resource in the
   context of an international brand's global or foreign consumer culture
   positioning in a host-country market. The authors conclude that combined
   incentives offered in SM must be tailored to the type of brand-user tie.

AB Little research addresses the likely enabling character of the discovery
   and creation of opportunities during the internationalization of small
   firms or how international opportunities are found and constructed
   during the process of foreign market entry (FME). This article therefore
   studies how opportunities become connected during small firms' FME. By
   incorporating the concept of duality, this article conceives of the
   discovery and creation of opportunity as mutually enabling rather than
   opposed. From this duality perspective, opportunity discovery and
   creation facilitate each other during internationalization processes.
   This case study involves five high-tech Australian firms and 30 FMEs.
   The findings show that knowledge, networks, and capabilities enable
   opportunities in the FME context. International opportunities are
   connected and nested in different levels of generality and specificity.
   The FME opportunities may be based on opportunity embeddedness, because
   each opportunity has implications for other opportunities. The findings
   lead to a model and propositions to explain the relationships between
   opportunity discovery and creation in FME.

AB This research addresses the unexplored postpurchase dynamics of
   global/local brand choices by investigating the experience of regret in
   global versus local brand purchases. Drawing on regret theory, the
   authors demonstrate in four complementary studies that the global/local
   availability of both chosen and forgone brands influences consumer
   responses to regrettable purchases and that the direction and magnitude
   of this influence depend on the consumers' product category schema and
   global identity. Study 1 shows that regrettable decisions to forgo
   global for local brands elicit stronger regret, lower satisfaction, and
   higher brand switching than regrettable purchases of global (vs. local)
   brands for consumers with a global brand superiority schema for the
   category; the inverse holds for consumers with a local brand superiority
   schema. Studies 2 and 3 replicate the effect and show that it is
   mediated by perceived decision justifiability and moderated by global
   identity. Study 4 further validates the observed effect using a real
   brand choice task in a category with a local brand-dominated schema. The
   findings reveal the postpurchase consequences of global/local brand
   choices and provide concrete advice for global/local branding
   strategies.

AB Despite the rapid growth of social media and the enthusiasm surrounding
   social media advertising (SMA), scant theoretical and empirical
   knowledge exists on the cross-border effectiveness of SMA and its
   influence on consumer behavior in the social media environment. This
   research develops a four-stage belief-value-attitude-behavior framework
   to understand the intervening role of SMA value and attitude and reflect
   how consumers react to SMA across cultures and global social media
   types. The results confirm the mediating effects of value and attitude
   and reveal that positive attitude toward SMA increases social
   media-specific behaviors (i.e., message and social interaction
   behaviors). The moderating effect results of culture reveal a greater
   impact of infotainment on SMA value and of credibility on SMA value and
   attitude in the higher-uncertainty-avoidance culture. Infotainment has a
   larger effect on SMA value and attitude in global content community
   sites than in global social networking sites, but there is a reverse
   moderating effect on the impact of credibility. The research provides a
   better theoretical understanding of consumers' behavioral responses to
   SMA in international marketplaces.

AB Early and rapid internationalization has emerged as an established
   phenomenon of research, yet several fundamental issues remain to be
   studied. In this research, the authors aim to analyze the link between
   earliness of internationalization-a temporal dimension of foreign market
   entry-and the geographic diversity of international expansion, as well
   as the contingent nature of the relationship. They test their hypotheses
   with empirical data collected in a survey among international young
   ventures in China. The results show that while earliness of
   internationalization does not directly lead to the geographic diversity
   of a venture's international expansion, its impact becomes salient as
   the venture gains international legitimacy and strategic flexibility.
   Furthermore, the moderating effects of international legitimacy and
   strategic flexibility vary according to the type of the venture's first
   foreign market (regional vs. global). This research advances the
   knowledge not only of the important role of early foreign market entry
   but also of the strategic factors for paths created by accelerated
   internationalization. It potentially contributes to the emergent
   research on foreign market entry timing/speed of internationalization
   and performance implications of international young ventures.

AB China is an extremely complex and "insider-controlled" market for
   foreign businesses. This study offers a yin-yang balancing perspective
   of international exchange relationships in China. The authors
   investigate how "relational gatekeepers" play a key role in achieving a
   dynamic balance between Western companies and local partners in
   international exchange relationships. In-depth interviews are conducted
   with 41 business managers based in China, Australia, and New Zealand.
   Guided by the yin-yang balancing frame, the authors develop four key
   constructs of relational gatekeeping: the gatekeeper resources of mianzi
   (insider status) and renqing (insider favor) and the gatekeeper
   capabilities of zao shi (creating favorable momentum) and ying shi
   (leveraging favorable momentum). The yin-yang frame provides a process
   view of business relationships that accepts paradoxical conditions and
   embraces dynamic network momentum, resources, and capabilities. The
   study concludes by showing the theoretical implications for network
   theory and for the field of dynamic balancing and suggests the
   managerial implications for an international company aiming to engage
   relational gatekeepers to break into insider (guanxi)-controlled local
   business networks.

AB Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) is an important source of influence on

   conceptual model and assess the relationships between country and the
   occurrence of eWOM, as well as between online ratings and relative
   product sales according to country. Online reviews and sales rank data
   for books, CDs, and DVDs were collected from Amazon U.S. and Amazon
   Japan in 2009 and 2017. Results suggest cross-national differences in
   both the occurrence of eWOM (eWOM signaling) and the relationship
   between eWOM and relative product sales (eWOM screening). These national
   differences appear to change over time: some remain stable, some
   disappear, and others emerge. The proposed culturally contingent
   signaling and screening model may be adopted as a framework for future
   research on cross-cultural eWOM. The results also inform the literature
   on cultural change by suggesting that cultural differences in eWOM

   theoretical exporting areas and evaluate the exporting domain
   quantitatively over six decades (1958-2016). For the quantitative
   analysis, they use multidimensional scaling and apply established
   bibliometric principles to offer an understanding of the field and to
   provide suggestions for future exporting research. For the evaluations,
   the authors used data from 830 articles with 52,191 citations from 35
   journals. Using cocitation analysis as the basis to evaluate the data,
   they propose a series of intellectual structure implications on
   exporting that relate to internationalization process stages, dynamic
   capabilities, knowledge scarcity, social networks, export marketing
   strategy, absorptive capacity and learning, and nonlinear performance
   relationships involving marketing channel relationships.

   developments of the past 25 years. This article investigates the effect
   of these new technologies and the changing global business environment
   to understand how relational approaches to international market entry
   (IME) are changing in light of macro developments. Despite substantial
   resources in business practice dedicated to combining relational
   strategies in digital settings, this analysis of extant literature
   reveals that fewer than 3% of peer-reviewed research articles in the
   international marketing domain examine digital contexts. To address this
   gap, the authors assess 25 years of literature to provide (1) a
   description of the evolution of IME research; (2) a review and synthesis
   of pertinent literature that adopts relational, digital, and hybrid
   approaches to IME; (3) a taxonomy of IME strategies; and (4) directions
   for further research.

AB The global competitiveness (GC) literature has proven to be a
   developing, yet critical element in international marketing research.
   Broadly, GC studies have become a part of the marketing, international
   business, and strategic management fields. In light of this far-reaching
   topic and to gain a unique understanding of the dynamics across the GC
   domain, this study examines the intellectual structure of GC research at
   two distinct levels of analysis: overall GC publications and marketing
   and international business GC articles. This review of the literature
   uses cocitation data to provide insight to the field and develop a
   research-based model for future consideration. A total of 48 journals
   are included, providing 1,819 articles with 115,462 citations for
   examination. Applying multidimensional scaling to analyze the data, the
   study introduces a GC-focused model and provides possible topics for
   research. The proposed organizing framework includes elements of a
   market-based perspective (offering development, market orientation, and
   process emphasis), strategy implementation (firm-related advantages,
   strategic approach, and international focus), and performance to advance
   the critical nature of the marketing function in the GC literature.

AB Business scholars and managers stress the importance of achieving and
   sustaining competitive advantage as a critical strategic step in
   enabling superior firm performance. Yet which types of competitive
   advantage may yield the best performance outcomes-and what contingency
   factorsmay affect this-remains largely unexplored. This article examines
   the contribution of price, product, and service advantages to market
   performance in international ventures. Applying customer value logic to
   the literature on value creation and value capture, the authors posit
   that the symmetric achievement of all pairs of advantages leads to
   increased market performance. The findings confirm this conjecture,
   while for the product-service advantage pairing, even asymmetry in
   achievement has a positivemarket performance effect when the asymmetry
   is toward service. Using primary data from a sample of U.K.
   manufacturing exporters, the authors find that price advantage has a
   direct positive effect on market performance, while the strong positive
   effect of service advantage is further strengthened (and the
   nonsignificant effect of product advantage becomes negative) when the
   distributor has high-quality relationships with the overseas customers
   and there is available production capacity, even in technologically
   turbulent environments.

AB Marketing adaptation strategy has been characterized as a strategic
   imperative in markets with protectionist and nationalist sentiments,
   which underscores the need to better understand the effects of
   adaptation strategy. However, empirical investigations of international
   marketing strategy have considered mandatory and discretionary
   adaptations as equivalent. Discretionary adaptations, unlike mandatory
   adaptations, involve choice; thus, they are more relevant to the
   selection of an international marketing strategy. This article focuses
   on the direct and conditional effects of discretionary adaptation on
   export performance. Analyzing data from 203 U.S. small and medium-sized
   enterprises, the authors find a positive effect of discretionary
   adaptation on export performance as well as moderating effects of (1) a
   market characteristic (psychic distance), (2) a firm characteristic
   (international experience), and (3) a product characteristic (product
   positional advantage). The implications suggest that adaptation strategy
   may be more advantageous than previously thought, and that researchers
   should focus on discretionary adaptations when investigating the choice
   of a relatively standardized versus adapted international marketing
   strategy.

AB Although numerous previous studies have investigated consumer
   demographics and psychographics as determinants of counterfeit
   purchases, their findings are diverse and fragmented. In conceptually
   referring to the brand signals that help consumers build their
   identities, the present meta-analysis synthesizes the influence of
   consumer demographics and psychographics on attitudes, intentions, and
   behaviors with regard to branded counterfeit luxury products. It
   empirically summarizes 610 effect sizes from 98 independent studies and
   shows that whereas demographics have little impact, some psychographics
   greatly influence counterfeit purchases, with these influences differing
   between developed and developing countries. In the former, risk
   propensity and reduced integrity are stronger determinants of
   counterfeit purchases and are related to brand signals that refer to
   identities that consumers attempt to avoid. In developing countries,
   consumers are more influenced by psychographics, such as status seeking,
   which are related to positive brand signals for consumer identities. The
   findings lead to a profile of consumers of counterfeit luxury items that
   provides guidance for future research and for improved consumer
   targeting with regard to international anticounterfeiting measures.

AB Choosing the right international market entry mode is of utmost

   analysis concerning the decision-making process (DMP), specifically with

   the DMP among SMEs intent on entering international markets and how it
   affects each firm's international market development strategy. Using six
   cases based in Finland and Italy, the authors develop a model of the SME
   DMP. Their results imply that the DMP evolves and goes through various
   phases. By focusing on the postentry phase, this study enhances
   knowledge on decision-making frameworks by linking the traditional
   international marketing literature related to initial entry mode with
   "mainstream" international business literature. Furthermore, the study
   reveals that SMEs adopting a more rational DMP are more likely to
   succeed in foreign markets, and consequently, it demonstrates the
   importance of real options reasoning as a theoretical lens for making
   entry mode decisions in the context of SMEs.

AB Is coopetition between foreign and local partners good or bad for

   contingent view to examine how the efficacy of coopetition is
   conditional on IJV characteristics (i.e., foreign equity share and
   partner cultural compatibility) and environmental factors (i.e.,
   technological turbulence and market growth). The results from analyzing
   194 IJVs in China reveal that coopetition fosters IJV performance under
   the conditions of high foreign equity share, low partner cultural
   compatibility, high technological turbulence, and/or high market growth.
   In contrast, coopetition hinders IJV performance at low levels of
   foreign equity share, technological turbulence, and/or market growth, or
   at high levels of partner cultural compatibility. These findings support
   the authors' contingent view of coopetition and provide novel insights
   for managing partner coopetition in IJVs.

AB Eastern versus Western culture pricing practices differ with respect to
   price endings; however, Eastern cultures are increasingly influenced by
   Western multinational corporations. At the same time, increasing
   antiglobalization sentiment suggests the use of localization strategies
   in these markets. The authors investigate whether pricing practices
   still differ in this new environment, examine the role of superstition,
   and ask whether Western brands can benefit from localizing pricing
   practices. They explore the use of lucky number price endings and
   consumer responses to such pricing strategies in Singapore, an Eastern
   culture that is strongly exposed to Western multinational influence.
   Using a content analysis of newspaper advertisements and two
   experiments, the authors find that superstitious pricing practices
   continue, especially with high-priced items and brands of Eastern (vs.
   Western) origin. In the experimental studies, they find that
   superstitious pricing has a positive effect on price attractiveness and
   that foreign brands that localize their prices benefit from a more
   positive brand attitude.

AB In today's volatile global marketplace, firms should pursue flexible
   asset distribution and high-quality, low-cost manufacturing operations
   simultaneously. Previous studies have examined the relationships between
   supplier management related variables and market performance with
   cross-sectional data; however, little guidance is available for newly
   internationalizing ventures aiming to build a global supply chain
   network from scratch. To shed light on this dynamic process, we examine
   Uniqlo's successful supply chain development in China, using
   longitudinal contextual data. Our findings show that Uniqlo went through
   discrete dynamic stages in its supply chain development efforts. First,
   Uniqlo, initially a small firm, developed relational governance with its
   suppliers by exercising dynamic economic power concentration over time.
   Second, it began to provide technical support to help its suppliers
   build competence with the aim of increasing their cooperation. Third,
   Uniqlo enforced compulsory nonexclusivity arrangements with suppliers to
   achieve supplier flexibility by not just having Uniqlo as primary
   customer. This provides relational flexibility through both relational
   governance and partner flexibility for the principal firm in the global
   supply chain development.

AB Prior research has established the pivotal role of bilateral norms in
   relationship marketing, identifying them as effective relational
   governance mechanisms that firms can use to manage their international
   alliances with overseas intermediaries. Unfortunately, few studies have
   examined differential effects of specific norms on positive and negative
   behaviors, let alone norms' effectiveness in the harsh export context of
   resource -constrained small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To
   address these gaps, the authors explicate the effects of three norms
   (continuity expectations, equity, and cooperation) on both dysfunctional
   and productive behaviors of foreign distributors. Using two consecutive
   data collections, the results indicate that norms curb importer
   opportunism and help improve importer role performance and that
   continuity expectations and cooperation increase the chances of the
   survival of export ventures. The study further scrutinizes relational
   norms' effects on opportunism in the context of exporting SMEs'
   realities and tests relevant moderating effects. The findings indicate
   that while exporter dependence reduces the shielding effect of norms
   against opportunism, psychic distance and competitive intensity
   strengthen the protecting effect of relational norms. The results of
   this study underscore the heterogeneous nature of relational norms and
   suggest that norms such as continuity expectations play a leading role
   in structuring the ideology of a business dyad.

AB Ethnic consumers are an important market segment in both traditionally

AB International businesses and their marketing managers face complexity in
   the targeting of different customer groups in multiple countries, with
   different purchase histories and brand relationship tenures. Thus far,
   no customer retention model has been suggested to sufficiently reduce
   such complexity. To fill the gap, this study distinguishes three global
   customer groups brand stayers, brand switchers, and category novices
   which are differently prevalent in countries of various economic
   development. In particular, category novices have been a largely
   neglected segment for emerging markets. The study introduces the
   tenure-based customer retention model, which proposes the idiosyncratic
   effects of each group on the basis of tenure-based and attitudinal
   repurchase drivers. A large-scale consumer study (N = 53,744; 30
   countries) cross-culturally validates the suggested model and reflects
   country-specific factors based on cultural dimensions instead of
   economic development. The findings broadly support the standardization
   of international marketing over different countries but not across
   different buyer segments. Consequently, the study offers insights into
   the communicative measures that can be used to globally address
   repurchase intent for each segment.

AB Most brands today attempt to develop a self brand connection with their
   customers. Multiple studies have proposed that a brand can achieve a
   sacred status through "rituals." However, there is limited understanding
   of the mechanism through which rituals and customers' ritualized
   behavior influence brand awareness. As firms in international markets
   face intense competition from local brands, understanding the impact of
   customers' ritualization can help them enhance brand awareness. The
   authors develop a conceptual framework and provide theoretical
   understanding on the relationship between rituals and brand awareness
   for firms operating in international markets. Specifically, they propose
   that internal ritualization leads to brand recall and external
   ritualization leads to brand recognition. As customer firm relationship
   can be affected by market, firm, and customer-specific factors, the
   authors argue that cultural orientation, competition, firms' marketing
   spend, and customers' personality moderate the proposed relationships.
   They provide several research propositions to help understand rituals as
   a strategic tool. The findings of this study indicate that managers must
   incorporate customers' ritualized behavior when developing global
   branding strategies in international markets.

AB Although mobile commerce (m-commerce) growth provides ample potential
   for retailers around the globe, several studies have shown that it has
   failed to attract potential customers across different countries. This
   study advances the literature by comparing m-commerce customers'
   behavioral intentions and actual behaviors using data from 812
   m-commerce users across four countries (Australia, India, the United
   States, and Pakistan). This context offers a unique opportunity for
   understanding how m-commerce consumers' behaviors differ across
   disparate national markets. The authors propose a conceptual framework
   linking m-commerce users' behaviors (intentions and actual usages) to
   key drivers (ubiquity and habit), and they develop hypotheses about the
   moderating roles of m-commerce readiness and habit in these linkages.
   The results reveal important asymmetries between m-commerce readiness
   stage and between habit: users at an early m-commerce readiness stage
   assign more importance to ubiquity relative to habit in influencing
   purchase intentions, whereas the opposite is true for the users who are
   at an advanced stage. Habit moderates the influence of ubiquity such
   that its importance in determining intention decreases as the behavior
   in question takes a more habitual nature. The authors outline how
   m-retailers operating across developed and developing countries should
   adapt their marketing strategies to customers at different m-commerce
   readiness stages.

AB Despite extensive evidence that a brand's country-of-origin (COO)
   affects consumers' brand evaluations and behavioral intentions,
   consumers are often reluctant to admit this influence. Challenging the
   proclaimed irrelevance of the COO concept, the present study assesses
   the phenomenon of COO cue usage denial, an unconscious defense mechanism
   that consumers apply to maintain an acceptable self-image. Drawing on
   self-affirmation theory and based on two experimental studies (combined
   N = 462), the authors demonstrate that a substantial proportion of
   consumers are influenced by the COO cue when assessing brands, despite
   claims to the contrary. Such consumers not only differ from consumers
   who do not know a brand's COO but also modify their brand assessments
   and behavioral intentions when exposed to a COO change. This study also
   develops a consumer typology based on both the stated (self-reported)
   and actual influence of a brand's COO, thus highlighting the importance
   of segmenting consumers according to their susceptibility to COO
   influences. The authors discuss several theoretical and managerial
   implications and identify directions for further research.

AB Relational governance and control mechanisms are important means of
   managing interfirm relationships. Yet, the effectiveness of different
   governance mechanisms remains equivocal, especially in the international
   context. In this study, the authors investigate the value of relational
   and control governance across relationship length. Using a survey of 217
   export ventures from China, they find that relational governance is not
   effective for short-term relationships but that it becomes effective in
   the long run. Output control improves export performance across short-
   and long-term relationships, whereas process control has its limits and
   weakens export performance for short-term relationships. In addition,
   the findings show that relational governance positively moderates the
   effects of output and process control on export performance for
   long-term relationships.

AB Consumer- and producer-generated content on the Internet has become an
   important source of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) for buyers making
   purchasing decisions. However, the cultural effect of eWOM on firm
   performance remains largely unexplored. This research contributes to the
   extant marketing literature by examining the moderating role of culture
   in the relationship between eWOM and product-market performance. The
   author finds that individualism, power distance, and uncertainty
   avoidance tempered the effect of eWOM on market share. In particular,
   the impact of press releases and negative reviews has been overrated.
   The findings suggest that effective online international marketing
   strategies should take into account local market values,

AB Speed of internationalization is a multidimensional concept with
   performance consequences, but little is known about the interrelatedness
   between different time-related concepts. The authors address this
   deficiency by developing three hypotheses, which are confronted with a
   data set collected on site at 203 small and medium-sized enterprises.
   The analysis reveals that (1) the longer the time to
   internationalization, the lower the speed of international expansion;
   (2) the earlier the point in time when internationalization starts, the
   lower the speed of international expansion; and (3) there is an
   antagonistic interaction effect revealing that the negative effect on
   the speed of international expansion caused by a longer time to
   internationalization is moderated by the point in time when
   internationalization starts. The study contributes to theory by
   examining the interrelatedness between temporal concepts in the
   internationalization literature and by showing how the underlying
   mechanisms influencing internationalization speed change over time. For
   managers, insights into the importance of time and temporality for
   successful international expansion are provided.

   confirm that importers' infidelity incidences occur more often in cases
   in which trust, satisfaction, commitment, and cooperation are low in the
   relationship. Indeed, the association between poor relationship quality
   and infidelity becomes stronger when the relationship is at a declining
   stage and is relatively young. The existence of infidelity in the

   measures on the part of the exporter, which are moderated by the degree

AB Most research on the performance of foreign versus domestic brands in
   emerging markets has examined dependent measures of product evaluation
   or purchase intention. However, consumers who intend to buy a product
   may switch to competing brands, thus displaying an intention-behavior
   discrepancy (IBD). Drawing on literature on country associations and
   dual process theory, the authors examine the performance of foreign
   versus domestic brands on IBD in emerging markets and the moderating
   role of consumer prior knowledge. They conduct an intention survey
   followed by a postpurchase survey in the Chinese automobile and
   smartphone industries and find that foreign brands have an advantage on
   IBD relative to domestic brands, indicating that they have the dual
   advantage of higher evaluations and lower IBDs. Furthermore, foreign
   brands' advantage on IBD is smaller for consumers with inaccurate prior
   knowledge because they are more likely to systematically reprocess
   information and discount foreign brands' favorable country associations.
   For these consumers, overestimating the product reduces foreign brands'
   advantage to a lesser degree than underestimating it as a result of
   confirmation bias. These findings provide implications for brands in
   emerging markets.

AB Relationship marketing effectiveness varies across different markets,
   but prior research has provided limited evidence on how cultural
   variations relate to the effects of relationship variables such as
   switching costs. The authors develop and test a theoretical framework
   that explains how culture moderates the relationship between perceived
   switching costs and key consequences. The findings of a meta-analysis,
   based on 451 effect sizes collected in 25 countries, show that similar
   components that refer to a match between the value essence of Hofstede's
   cultural dimensions and the motivators that steer particular
   consequences explain how individualism, power distance, uncertainty
   avoidance, and masculinity moderate the impact of switching costs on
   word of mouth of customers and loyalty types. Furthermore, the economic
   development of a country explains when switching costs either reduce or
   increase switching of customers. The findings of this study support
   international companies in making decisions about the generation of
   switching costs in particular markets and the formation of international
   relationship marketing and referral programs.

AB In contrast to the abundance of research on brand-and consumer-related
   determinants of global/local brand preference, little is known about
   whether and how the product category affects consumer choices between
   local and global brands. Drawing from schema theory, the authors (1)
   argue that consumers rely on their product category schemata to form
   perceptions of global versus local brand superiority, (2) introduce a
   compact scale to measure these perceptions, and (3) identify the key
   antecedents and consequences of these perceptions. Two studies in
   developed and emerging markets empirically support the hypotheses across
   multiple product categories, for both real and fictitious brands. The
   results indicate that consumers perceive global brands as superior to
   local brands in product categories with strong functional character and
   extensive symbolic capacity. Moreover, brands congruent with category
   superiority perceptions are preferred because of their justifiability,
   while brands that deviate from these perceptions are avoided because of
   their proneness to normative criticism. The findings imply that
   global/local brand preference is largely formed at the product category
   level and advocate for the use of category-specific strategies in
   global/local brand management.

AB In the past few decades, consumers around the world have placed
   increasing value on corporate social responsibility (CSR). As a
   response, companies entering new markets have boosted spending in areas
   like cause-related marketing to improve their reputation and create
   goodwill among consumers in the host country. However, these efforts may
   not be effective for all consumers or in all countries. Drawing upon
   research on intergroup bias and attribution theory, the present work
   explores how consumers from individualistic (the United States and
   Canada) and collectivistic (South Korea and India) cultures form
   attributions and attitudes about the CSR activities of foreign and
   domestic firms. Across three studies, we find that collectivistic (but
   not individualistic) consumers make more altruistic (but not egoistic)
   attributions about the CSR motives of domestic (vs. foreign) companies,
   and that altruistic attribution leads to more positive attitudes toward
   the firm. We also showed that collectivists' bias against foreign firms
   is attenuated when level of commitment to the cause (as conveyed by CSR
   duration) is high.

AB International joint ventures (IJVs) need to exploit their existing

   the efficacy of exploitation and exploration depends on the levels of
   control imbalance and product similarity between an IJV's foreign and
   local partners. A sample of 198 IJVs in China reveals that partner
   control imbalance has a U-shaped moderating effect on the relationship
   between exploitation and IJV new product performance but has an inverted
   U-shaped moderating effect on the effectiveness of exploration.
   Exploitation relates more strongly to IJV new product performance when
   partner product similarity is high, whereas exploration has a stronger
   impact on IJV new product performance at low levels of partner product
   similarity. These findings provide novel insights for IJVs to better
   manage exploitation and exploration in their new product development.

AB As global players, multinational product and corporate brands are known

   multinational corporations (MNCs) increasingly compete against domestic
   MNCs, particularly in economically strong countries, little is known
   about (1) whether foreign MNCs can use their globalness to their
   advantage and (2) how the perceptions of foreign versus domestic MNCs
   drive consumer behavior. To examine this issue, the authors propose a
   framework based on accessibility-diagnosticity theory and test it using
   consumer data from countries in which leading foreign and domestic MNCs
   compete. The results show that perceived brand globalness enhances
   consumers' intentional loyalty toward MNCs indirectly by affecting the
   functional and psychological value these MNCs offer. The value-creation
   routes change according to firms' origins that is, foreign MNCs
   translate globalness through functional and psychological value, while
   domestic MNCs translate globalness through psychological value. However,
   the benefits of being global and the value-creation routes for foreign
   (vs. domestic) MNCs differ between countries. Finally, high consumer
   ethnocentrism weakens but does not completely erase the effects of
   perceived brand globalness in all countries and interacts with MNCs'

AB Conflicting evidence on the issue of psychic distance (PD) in

   that country image (CI) is a contingent factor to the effect of PD.
   Expectancy value theory provides the theoretical foundations, and
   structural equation modeling analyses for a sample of 358 exporter
   importer relationships in the global wine industry provide empirical
   support for this argument. Product-related CI mitigates the negative
   impact of PD on the relational exchange orientation (REO) between firms.
   Specifically, a high level of PD dampens REO when product-related CI is
   poor, whereas a strong product-related CI helps firms facing such PD
   conditions to build REO. People-related CI has an indirect effect on REO
   through product-related CI. This study helps explain the "paradox of
   distance" and offers a fresh perspective on how to handle the issue of
   PD when relevant.

AB Although many multinational companies have instituted global account

   coordination as an organizational design issue in managing vertical

   strategy, organizational design, and relationship marketing theories to
   study how the performances of GAM coordination mechanisms vary with a
   host of strategic, relational, and environmental conditions. The
   conceptual model is tested using data collected from a cross-national

   although GAM relational coordination and GAM operational coordination
   both have positive effects on GAM performance, they do not perform

AB Firms increasingly employ global and local consumer culture positioning
   strategies (GCCP/LCCP), but understanding of the drivers that underlie
   consumer responses to such strategies is limited, leaving firms with
   little guidance on when to choose one strategy over another. To shed
   light on consumer preference for GCCP versus LCCP, the authors examine
   the effects of regulatory focus (promotion and prevention orientation)
   and global consumption orientation (GCO) on preference for GCCP/LCCP.
   They report the results of three studies: the first is based on a survey
   with samples drawn from the United States and China, and the second and
   third are behavioral designs manipulating situational promotion and
   prevention regulatory focus. The findings suggest that promotion focus
   is positively related to GCO and prevention focus is negatively related
   to GCO. Furthermore, the authors find that GCO is positively related to
   a preference for GCCP. Thus, this research offers a unique perspective
   by introducing regulatory focus to the GCCP literature, identifying GCO
   as an important mediator, and demonstrating that regulatory focus can be
   situationally activated.

AB Country-of-origin research has provided inconsistent findings about how
   the country of manufacture (COM) affects brand image evaluations. The
   authors examine how the COM, vertical line extension (VLE) type, and
   brand concept interactively affect brand image evaluations after brands
   introduce products in their existing product categories. The authors
   draw on schema congruity theory to develop a conceptual framework and
   confirm it using experimental methods. Results from a sample of U.S.
   consumers demonstrate that the COM's influence on brand image should be
   considered in conjunction with the type of VLE strategy and the intended
   conceptual meaning of a brand. Manufacturing in a country with a
   favorable image does not always improve brand image evaluations.
   Functional brands can improve their image with an upward VLE regardless
   of the COM; however, if these brands pursue a downward VLE, the COM has
   little to no effect. For prestige brands, downward VLEs result in lower
   postextension brand image regardless of the COM. However, a favorable
   COM appears to soften the negative effect of downward VLE on
   postextension brand image evaluations.

AB Traditional country-of-origin strategy in international marketing uses a
   country-image halo to cue beliefs about the country's products. With
   expansive trade globalization, domestic consumers are likely to have
   experience with foreign products but know little of the products' origin
   country. Thus, equally important as traditional theory is the question
   of whether product beliefs can imbue country image, but little is known
   of this reverse influence. If product beliefs can generalize into a
   favorable country image, a chain effect will then enable traditional
   country-of-origin effects to benefit the country's other products. In
   this study, the results of three surveys across two countries show that
   product beliefs can indeed influence country image. However, the
   influence weakens with increasing country familiarity and exists only
   when the product and country are congruent. Furthermore, the influence
   can operate outside of conscious awareness. The authors draw on the
   associative network theory of memory to explain their findings. This
   research improves the theoretical understanding of country- and
   product-image halo and provides the grounds for product and brand
   managers to work with government and tourist organizations for
   increasing mutual effectiveness.

   to fill an important gap by shedding light on the role of country of
   origin in shaping perceptions of healthiness. The authors provide
   evidence that domestic and foreign food products elicit different
   perceptions of healthiness. Consumers choose domestic products because
   they perceive them as healthier and more natural. The effect holds
   across different samples and product categories (apples, tomatoes,
   bread, and yogurt). However, this healthiness bias vanishes when
   products are presented as posing health risks and when products are
   introduced with a dual identity (i.e., both foreign and domestic).
   Researching these health-related effects helps provide a better
   understanding of consumer attitudes toward domestic- versus foreign-made

   Drawing on the relational view of competitive advantage, this study
   investigates the drivers of relationship value in exporter importer
   relationships and its impact on customer loyalty. The study findings
   reveal that relationship-specific investments, knowledge sharing,
   complementary capabilities, and relational norms are powerful
   contributors of importer-perceived value in an overseas supplier
   relationship. Importantly, exporter cultural sensitivity weakens the
   negative effect of psychic distance on relationship value; when cultural
   sensitivity is low, psychic distance takes on greater importance in
   attenuating relationship value, whereas when cultural sensitivity is
   high, psychic distance has no discernible effect. In addition, the
   results demonstrate that relationship value results in insensitivity to
   competitive offerings and future purchase expansion. The article
   concludes with a discussion of implications for international marketing
   theory and practice.

AB International marketing research has shown vivid interest in consumers'
   positive dispositions toward foreign countries and globalization.
   Motivated by the aim to segment international consumer markets, the
   literature has introduced and adopted a plethora of constructs and
   measurement instruments to capture such dispositions. However, the
   current state of literature is problematic because of an unsorted range
   of constructs with overlapping conceptualizations, diverse
   operationalizations, and fragmented empirical findings regarding the
   impact of these constructs on consumer responses. Consequently, making
   an informed choice on which construct(s) to employ in substantive
   research (and why) is extremely difficult. This article aims to advance
   the international marketing literature by (1) developing a conceptual
   taxonomy of constructs of positive consumer dispositions that highlights
   their similarities and unique features; (2) undertaking a comprehensive
   review of the relevant conceptualizations and operationalizations; and
   (3) providing guidance for further research on positive dispositions,
   including antecedents, response variables, and potential mediating and
   moderating influences. To move substantive research in this field
   further, this article also proposes a research framework that comprises
   antecedents, causal sequences of dispositions, effects on consumer
   response variables, and potential boundary conditions.

AB Customer lifetime value (CLV), a metric used in many industries, is
   based on the cumulated cash flow a customer accrues during his or her
   lifetime. Firms have used CLV as a basis for formulating and
   implementing customer-specific strategies; however, these can vary
   across countries because of each country's cultural and economic
   influences. Typically, CLV is computed with three components: purchase
   frequency, contribution margin, and marketing costs. In this study, the
   authors demonstrate that national cultural dimensions affect the drivers
   of purchase frequency and contribution margin and that economic factors
   influence the components of CLV directly. They use customer-level
   transaction data from a global retailer for a random sample of customers
   in 30 representative countries over a six-year period. They estimate the
   model using a seemingly unrelated regression approach while accounting
   for the heterogeneity of customers across countries and the endogeneity
   of marketing costs incurred by the firm. The results indicate that
   global retailers should pay attention to the dimensions of national
   culture and economic conditions because of their differential impact on
   CLV.

AB Marketing and technological capabilities are major drivers of new

   capabilities outperform technological capabilities. This study shows
   that the relative advantage of marketing over technological capabilities
   for new product performance depends on the institutional context in a
   country. Meta`-analytic data of 341 effect sizes of the relationship
   between capabilities and new product performance taken from SO articles
   with 57 independent samples and collected in 17 different countries
   reveal new contingencies to the capabilities framework. Although in
   general, marketing capabilities have a stronger influence than
   technological capabilities on new product performance, this effect is
   moderated by institutional context factors. The relative advantage
   decreases and even reverses with increasing growth rates; it further
   decreases with increasingly stronger rules of law in a country; and it
   increases in societies that put emphasis on self-expression values over
   survival values. These findings contribute to research on the utility of
   different capabilities, inform the institution-based view of firms in
   international marketing, and provide implications for international
   marketing managers.

AB In this study, the authors explore whether investments in market-based
   assets outside of a market economy can be an effective tool for
   influencing buyer behavior. Using data from a sample of Russian
   physicians, along with both primary and secondary information on foreign
   pharmaceutical producers operating in Russia, they demonstrate that
   firms' investments in market-based assets which are positively
   associated with prescription behavior are associated with physician
   perceptions of relationship quality. They further find that these
   investments are most effective when marketers and buyers reside in
   culturally similar markets. The results also indicate that relationship
   quality becomes less important for buyer behavior in the presence of
   authoritative mechanisms a feature of market transition and under
   conditions of low product complexity. In addition, the link between
   relationship quality and prescription behavior is stronger when
   manufacturers reside in countries that are politically similar to
   Russia. These findings demonstrate that the concept of "market"-based
   assets and their influence on buyer behavior and potentially firm
   performance may depend on the existence of at least certain

AB International marketing literature suggests that through market
   learning, businesses develop market-valued capabilities that are the
   basis of their performance. Therefore, market learning is also of
   importance to producers at the base of the pyramid (BoP), whose ability
   to climb out of poverty often depends on the purchasing power of those
   in export markets. However, the ways in which BoP-producer-based export
   chains learn from foreign users of their products and incorporate these
   insights into their decisions are not yet clear. Using case studies from
   Benin, the authors examine how market learning processes function in
   supply chains at the BoP. A cross-case comparison suggests that market
   connections are established when export market information is generated
   by formal-sector organizations and when such organizations establish
   formal ways of sharing information with BoP producers. The access to
   export markets becomes sustainable if formal institutions also support
   the use of information. The study has implications for procurement by

AB Effective relationship marketing (RM) in a firm's global operations
   necessitates that the underlying aspect of reciprocity operate
   consistently across markets. Unfortunately, few studies have empirically
   examined the role of reciprocity in RM, let alone whether the effects of
   reciprocity in RM are universal across national cultures. To address
   these limitations, the authors examine reciprocity as a multidimensional
   norm whose dimensions of equivalence (what is exchanged) and immediacy
   (when the exchange occurs) influence relationship quality and
   satisfaction with performance in cross-border U.S.-Japanese interfirm
   relationships. The results indicate that the effects of reciprocity on
   relationship quality are conditional on national culture. Specifically,
   uncertainty avoidance positively moderates the positive effect of
   equivalence on relationship quality, while individualism and short-term
   orientation positively moderate the negative effect of immediacy on
   relationship quality. Moreover, a supplemental analysis indicates that
   the key mediating variable RM model may not hold across all cultures
   when predicting satisfaction with performance. These findings underscore
   the importance of adapting RM strategies across national cultures and
   provide managers with recommendations for developing high-quality
   cross-border buyer-seller relationships.

AB Consumers' preferences for domestic over imported products have been
   investigated in various isolated studies, but never in a single model
   incorporating several in-group and out-group consumer orientations at
   the same time. Building on social identity theory, this study develops
   and tests-in two countries-a conceptual model that assesses the relative
   influence of consumer ethnocentrism, national identity, and consumer
   cosmopolitanism on consumers' product judgments and willingness to buy
   domestic and foreign products. Furthermore, the study develops an
   empirically based typology of consumer segments using these
   sociopsychological traits and subsequently profiles them on
   consumption-relevant variables. The findings reveal several undiscovered
   patterns regarding the interplay of consumer ethnocentrism, national
   identity, and consumer cosmopolitanism as drivers of consumer behavior
   and offer managerial guidance on their relevance as segmentation
   variables.

AB Companies expend vast resources to create product and brand portfolios
   in the global marketplace. Yet knowledge of the market-based performance
   implications of various positions in a firm's portfolio architecture is
   lacking in the literature. To further the understanding of managing
   brands in the global marketplace, the authors develop a conceptual
   framework based on the tenets of signaling theory, explore the
   relationship between global brand architecture and market-based
   performance, and consider how culture moderates this relationship. The
   results of the analyses, from a panel data set of 165 automotive brands
   operating in 65 countries from 2002 to 2008, reveal that global brands
   perform better in the marketplace than their nonglobal counterparts.
   Cultural values indeed provide boundary conditions for this
   relationship, suggesting that alternative strategies for some markets
   may be advisable.

AB Institutional forces influence the formation of international joint
   ventures (IJVs) in emerging economies and shape both their parents'
   behaviors and their marketing strategies. Whereas previous research has
   centered on governance mechanisms that deter opportunism, this study
   investigates the influence of institutional forces (i.e., rule of law,
   government intervention, and dysfunctional competition) on the IJV's
   foreign parent's opportunism. The authors find that rule of law and
   dysfunctional competition curtail opportunism, whereas government
   intervention drives opportunism. In addition, relationships between
   institutional forces in local markets and the IJV's foreign parent's
   opportunism depend on the IJV's marketing capability. The authors
   further examine the influence of the foreign parent's opportunism on IJV
   relationship extendedness and find support for a negative relationship
   between opportunism and the IJV's continuity. This study enriches
   institutional theory and identifies the boundary of the influence of
   institutional forces on opportunism. Because opportunism is a critical
   relationship hazard, the findings of this study have important
   implications for IJVs' partnership management.

AB Multinational corporations (MNCs) use their overseas subsidiaries to
   access tacit knowledge about host countries. It is generally assumed
   that subsidiary tacit knowledge contributes directly to greater product
   innovativeness; however, little empirical evidence supports this
   assumption. In this research, the authors propose a negative direct
   relationship between subsidiary tacit-knowledge level and MNCs' product
   innovation ability. The authors then examine the role of social
   cognitive capability as an attenuator of this negative relationship
   between subsidiary tacit-knowledge level and MNCs' product innovation
   ability. The results reveal that each of the MNCs' social cognitive
   capability components (i.e., task efficacy, organic structure, and
   affective trust) independently weakens this negative relationship.
   Moreover, combining social cognitive capabilities exerts synergetic
   influences to further excavate the effect of tacit knowledge.

AB This work examines contractual governance in international buyer
   supplier relationships by investigating the linkages between contract
   specificity, contract violation, and relationship performance as well as
   the roles of contract monitoring and a country's institutional factors
   (i.e., country business risk and country globalization). The findings,
   based on a survey of international buyer supplier relationships, provide
   new insights into a contract specificity -> contract violation :
   relationship performance model. For example, the results indicate that
   contract specificity is not directly related to contract violation but,
   rather, that country-level factors moderate the effectiveness of
   contract specificity (i.e., contract specificity is more effective in
   suppressing an international buyer's contract violation if the buyer is
   from a country characterized by low business risk or high country
   globalization). The results also demonstrate that contract monitoring
   can mitigate the negative association between contract violation and
   relationship performance.

   multidimensional construct that encompasses five dimensions:
   prosociality, cognition, insecurity, reflexiveness, and habituation.
   Empirical evidence from the United Kingdom and the United States

AB Relationship marketing (RM) and loyalty programs (LPs) are key
   differentiation strategies for firms facing increasing global

   though researchers examining these marketing activities typically apply
   U.S.-centric frameworks to international research contexts. To
   understand how RM and LPs may be influenced by factors that distinguish
   global markets, this review offers a comprehensive framework of both RM
   and LP mechanisms and considers how cultural and developmental
   contingency factors may alter the effects of these mechanisms on seller
   performance. The results from this review produce eight propositions
   about where specific RM and LP strategies should be most effective. By
   considering these mechanisms jointly, the authors also simultaneously
   delineate RM and LP theories and broaden the scope of global research in

AB Exporting enables organizations to diversify risk and generate multiple
   income streams. In turn, the ability to make good export decisions is
   purported to be a main determinant of performance. Although substantive
   export decisions are well researched, little is known about how export
   decisions should be made in practice and whether different
   decision-making approaches should be combined. This study addresses this
   gap using decision theory; the authors assess the interaction of
   planning and improvisation and examine the impact of these approaches on
   export responsiveness and export performance. They develop a conceptual
   model through exploratory research and test it through structural
   equation modeling. The authors seek insights into the results through
   post hoc in-depth interviews and conclude that improvisation has
   multiple dimensions (spontaneity, creativity, and action orientation)
   and that there is no one "best way" for export managers to make
   decisions. Furthermore, export planning can enhance economic performance
   but detract from customer performance. In addition, improvisation
   improves responsiveness, whereas action orientation leads to greater
   customer performance and results in greater responsiveness with regard
   to planning. However, export managers should be wary of spontaneity and
   creativity, because they detract from planning outcomes.

AB Loyalty programs increase customers' repeat purchase behavior and reward
   their continued patronage by enhancing the firm's value proposition. Yet
   little is known about how cultural values affect loyalty program choice
   as firms expand abroad. This understanding is important because
   multinational corporations must decide whether to standardize or adapt
   their loyalty programs when internationalizing. The authors develop and
   test theory proposing that cultural values influence loyalty program
   choice. The results indicate that cultural differences matter. Consumers
   from countries high in power-distance values and low in individualism
   values prefer loyalty programs that offer related rewards, whereas
   consumers from countries low in masculinity values and low in
   uncertainty avoidance values prefer unrelated rewards. The analysis also
   indicates that consumers from countries high in masculinity values and
   high in uncertainty avoidance values shun loyalty programs altogether
   and prefer immediate promotional offers. This finding suggests that
   loyalty programs do not work equally well in all countries and that
   multinational corporations may need to adapt reward programs as they
   internationalize to ensure that their loyalty-building efforts are
   successful.

AB Consumers around the world are choosing between local versus global
   brands in the marketplace. The authors draw on the dual-drivers theory
   of consumer choice and global consumer culture theory to offer a
   sociocultural-historical perspective on purchases of local (relative to
   global) brands. Their framework focuses on two local global consumer
   values (ethnocentrism and global connectedness) and the identity- and
   quality-signaling functions of local (relative to global) brands. The
   authors argue for a contingency approach such that the effects of these
   local global consumer values are moderated by country level of economic
   development and product category symbolism. This research uses
   consumer-level data (n = 2,197) and country-level data (from
   Euromonitor's Global Market Information Database) from seven countries
   (Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the
   United States). They find that purchases of local (relative to global)
   brands are predicated on local global consumer values, mediated by
   perceptions of the identity function of local (relative to global)
   brands, and moderated by the country's level of economic development and
   product category symbolism.

   trust plays an instrumental role in enhancing the components of the

   and replicate previous findings that brand quality and prestige are
   important links between perceived brand globalness (PBG) and perceived
   brand localness (PBL) and favorable behavioral intentions. The most
   novel finding is that both PBG and PBL can enhance a brand's identity
   expressiveness. The results establish the mediating roles of these
   additional variables between PBG/PBL and behavioral intentions and also
   identify the incremental explanatory value of these additional
   mediators, which have been neglected in previous global branding
   research. Furthermore, PBG which affects behavioral intentions through

   factors help explain the dispersion pattern of PLB penetration across 46
   countries and that the distribution structure has the largest effect on
   PLB share, followed by the logistic structure and retailer typology in
   particular global discounters. The findings can enable manufacturer
   brand managers to better foresee whether specific countries represent
   fertile ground for internationalizing their brands or, contrarily,
   constitute bastions for brand manufacturers to protect their brands'
   shares. The results also provide insights about the time frame over
   which PLB share development may pose a threat in different markets.

AB Spillover of distrust from domestic brands to foreign brands during an
   industry-wide scandal is an important but overlooked issue in the
   international marketing domain. Drawing on assimilation/contrast and
   attribution theories, the authors develop a general model of trust
   erosion in a multibrand product-harm crisis involving three brand
   categories: focal (domestic) brands, contrasting (imported) brands, and
   hybrid (manufactured domestically but with foreign brand names) brands.
   Assimilative associations in an epidemic-like crisis erode trust
   throughout the entire product category, whereas contrastive associations
   protect or even benefit a competing brand category from the brand
   damage. A survey of 2,156 consumers in nine metropolitan centers in
   China measured trust in brands of dairy products after the 2008 milk
   contamination crisis. This study reveals the roles of category
   distinctness, focal versus contrasting categories, category hybridity,
   brand prototypicality, perceived crisis severity, and perceived category
   typicality in moderating the assimilation/contrast effects in such a
   crisis. These findings have important managerial implications:
   international marketers should be wary of the risks in having their
   brand associated with products manufactured domestically in a market

   develop an integrative framework focusing on marketing decision making
   in subsidiaries. The authors empirically test this framework with 133
   international headquarters subsidiary dyads from 29 countries. The
   findings show that a subsidiary's desire for autonomy can significantly
   impair the headquarters subsidiary relationship. While the
   centralization and importance of marketing decision making can amplify
   this harmful desire for autonomy, the headquarters' competence in
   marketing decision making can reduce this desire. Thus, to minimize
   subsidiaries' desire for autonomy, headquarters should credibly display
   high competence while allowing subsidiaries to participate in decision
   making whenever possible.

   international performance is moderated by their choice of exploration
   and exploitation strategies. Specifically, host-home country similarity
   has a positive impact on an SME's international performance when the
   firm adopts an exploitation strategy. Conversely, host-home country
   similarity has a negative impact on an SME's international performance
   when it adopts an exploration strategy. Directly addressing the
   long-standing host-home country similarity debate in the international
   marketing literature, this study sheds additional light on the drivers
   for SMEs' internationalization success.

AB Drawing on a strategic fit perspective in international marketing, this
   study explores how macroenvironmental factors-cultural dimensions and
   globalization forces-affect the relationship between product
   diversification and market value of large international firms. The
   author hypothesizes that (1) the four dimensions of culture
   (individualism-collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and
   masculinity-femininity) significantly affect product diversification and
   (2) economic and social globalization positively moderate the
   relationship between product diversification and market value of large
   international firms. The author empirically examines the hypothesized
   relationships using a sample of 485 firm-year observations from 17
   countries for the period between 2006 and 2009. Using the hierarchical
   linear modeling technique, the author demonstrates that firms in
   countries with cultures characterized by high uncertainty avoidance and
   low power distance have a higher degree of product diversification, and
   product diversification in turn has a significant positive impact on
   firm market value. Furthermore, the author demonstrates that economic
   and social globalization, as indicated by actual flows, personal
   contacts, and information flows, positively moderates the relationship
   between product diversification and market value of large international
   firms.

AB Despite the growing global importance of sustainability issues, scant
   research has examined marketing strategy sustainability issues in
   international settings. Although significant prior work has examined
   drivers and performance consequences of adaptation/standardization of
   marketing strategies in international markets, researchers have yet to
   apply this avenue of inquiry to sustainable marketing strategies.
   Building on contingency theory and the concept of strategic fit, the
   authors develop a model of drivers of sustainable export marketing
   strategy adaptation and explore the circumstances under which such a
   strategy affects export performance. Using a sample of U.K. exporters,
   they find that various macro- and microenvironmental factors are
   responsible for sustainable export marketing strategy adaptation, which
   shapes the nature of sustainable export marketing strategy fit and its
   export venture performance outcomes. The results indicate that
   sustainable export marketing strategy adaptation is the outcome of the
   differences between home and export markets in terms of economic and
   technological conditions, competitive intensity, customer
   characteristics, and stakeholder pressures. Moreover, the performance
   relevance of sustainable export marketing strategy adaptation requires
   adequate fit with these macro- and microenvironmental factors.

   perspective. To fill this research gap, the author proposes a framework
   that categorizes culture and innovation studies into the following six
   approaches: (1) innovation characteristics, (2) adoption of/propensity
   to adopt innovations, (3) geographical innovations, (4) market
   characteristics, (5) learning effect, and (6) organizational functions.
   Each approach contains two perspectives. From these approaches and

AB Psychic distance is a key element in the field of international
   marketing. Unfortunately, the literature exhibits a lack of consistency
   with respect to its effects. To help increase understanding of the
   influence of psychic distance, the authors investigate business and
   cultural psychic distance as separate constructs. They develop a model
   in which an export manager's business and cultural psychic distance
   influences the structuring of the export relationship (i.e., whether it
   has complementarity of capabilities) and explore whether business and
   cultural psychic distance enhances or dampens the leveraging of
   complementary capabilities to increase an export manager's satisfaction
   with export performance. The results, based on a survey of 151 U.S.
   export managers, indicate that when export managers perceive greater
   business psychic distance, they select export partners with fewer
   complementary capabilities. Although more complementarity of
   capabilities results in greater satisfaction with export performance,
   this relationship is moderated by psychic distance. Specifically,
   greater cultural psychic distance enhances the positive influence of
   partner complementarity of capabilities on satisfaction with export
   performance, whereas greater business psychic distance dampens the
   positive influence of partner complementarity of capabilities on
   satisfaction with export performance.

   differentiation capability and that such effects are contingent on
   foreign parent control. Technology orientation leads to stronger
   differentiation capability when foreign equity control is higher or
   operational control is greater. In contrast, customer orientation is

AB Global usage of the Internet has increased remarkably in the past few
   decades, thus necessitating a better understanding of e-commerce
   adoption across cultures. Against this backdrop, this study contributes
   to the existing technology adoption and acceptance literature in the
   following ways. First, the authors develop an extended technology
   acceptance model that incorporates trust and perceived behavioral
   control and examine it in settings outside the United States to better
   understand the adoption of e-commerce across cultures. Contrary to the
   authors' expectations, the predictive power of the technology acceptance
   model seems robust and holds true for both Pakistan and Canada, despite
   some noteworthy differences between the two cultures. Second, although
   the importance of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness on
   consumers' intentions to shop online was validated across both cultures,
   the results highlight the complex relationships between perceived ease
   of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to adopt in each country.
   The authors offer suggestions to technology managers and e-retailers
   regarding navigating through new technology and e-commerce adoption
   under various cultural contexts.

AB This article explores two unresolved issues in the international
   business literature. First, it is not clear why high-tech firms should
   standardize their product strategies across countries. Second, the
   rationale for high-tech firms to forge international strategic alliances
   (ISAs) is unknown. Drawing on organizational ecology and structural
   inertia theories, this study proposes that the interactions between a
   firm's structural inertia and environmental hostility are hazardous to
   firm performance and that ISAs weaken their impacts. Using data from 167
   Canadian high-tech firms, this study supports that hypothesis and
   uncovers important implications for research and practice. Firms'
   structural inertia makes inconsistency in international product
   strategies destructive. When structural inertia interacts with the
   environmental hostility associated with high-tech industries, the
   impacts can be stronger. High-tech firms resort to ISAs, using their
   partners to implement different product strategies to avoid adverse
   outcomes. Thus, ISAs are mechanisms that high-tech firms use to reduce
   the strategy inconsistencies across countries.

AB In numerous country markets (particularly emerging and less developed
   markets), inadequate and/or ineffective investments in infrastructure
   and the resultant quantity and quality gaps in public goods (e.g.,
   water, electricity, sanitation, public transportation) often require
   consumers to engage in ecologically harmful consumption behaviors that
   are inconsistent with their prosustainability attitudes and values.
   Quantity and quality gaps in public goods also have major social and
   economic consequences because they necessitate consumers at the base of
   the market pyramid to spend significant portions of their income to
   purchase substantially higher-priced substitute private goods. This
   article presents a framework of the interdependencies among public
   policy actions, quantity and quality gaps in public goods, abnormal
   demand for certain broad types of unsustainability-accentuating products
   (intrinsically zero demand, intrinsically lower demand, and ecologically
   more harmful substitute products), sustainability-facilitating
   consumption behaviors (consumption elimination, reduction, and
   redirection), and sustainability-facilitating demand effects (demand
   elimination, reduction, and redirection). Implications for public policy
   actions, global social innovations for base-of-the-pyramid markets,
   demarketing, and opportunities for further research are discussed.

   or the derivatives of full acquisition. The findings of Study 2 indicate
   that in a high-animosity host country, consumers prefer the foreign
   products launched through an acquisition joint venture mode that adopts

AB International marketing studies have extensively examined the
   antecedents of firms' marketing standardization/adaptation decisions.
   However, it is unclear whether such decisions, once planned, codetermine
   the choice between buying and building foreign subsidiaries. Analyzing a
   sample of 150 foreign entries by Dutch firms, the authors find that the
   level of marketing adaptation planned for a wholly owned subsidiary is
   positively related to the likelihood that the subsidiary will be
   established through an acquisition rather than through a green field
   investment. Moreover, the authors find substantial evidence that this
   positive relationship is stronger for firms that (1) are establishing
   relatively larger subsidiaries, (2) have less experience with the
   industry entered, or (3) are entering less developed countries. The
   findings show that firms pursuing higher levels of marketing adaptation
   assign more value to the marketing adaptation advantages of acquisitions
   over greenfields, especially if the risks associated with implementing
   the planned adaptation level are high. In addition, firms typically
   strive for a fit between their international marketing strategy and
   their mode of foreign establishment.

AB Manufacturers often use relational governance to manage interfirm
   relationships with their distributors. Yet recent literature has
   cautioned that relational governance may only offer conditional
   benefits. In this study, the authors integrate the resource-, industry-,
   and institution-based views to examine whether there is a limit to the
   positive effect of relational governance on export performance.
   Furthermore, the authors investigate two conditioning factors: industry
   uncertainty and cross-national institutional distance. Using a survey of
   184 export ventures from China, the authors find that relational
   governance has an inverted U-shaped relationship with performance. In
   addition, the findings show that the export performance effect of
   relational governance becomes less effective in uncertain industry
   environments, but cross-country institutional distance enhances the
   value of relational governance.

AB Research on interorganizational relationships is predicated on the idea
   that fairness is always important. The authors question this assumption
   because most fairness research has been conducted in Western countries,
   and mixed empirical support draws into question how important fairness
   actually is. Drawing on Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework, the
   authors examine culture as an antecedent to the importance of outcome
   fairness (OF) and procedural fairness (PF) in retailers' assessments of
   their relationships with suppliers. The authors also propose that
   cultural exposure moderates the impact of culture on fairness
   importance. Using responses from retailers in ten countries analyzed
   with hierarchical linear modeling, the authors find that uncertainty
   avoidance enhances the importance of OF and PF, power distance
   marginally decreases the importance of PF, and long-term orientation
   increases the importance of both OF and PR Cultural exposure also
   positively moderates the impact of uncertainty avoidance and masculinity
   on both fairness types. The pattern of effects is robust when compared
   with two alternative models. This study offers a first step in
   understanding culture's impact on when fairness is more or less
   important.

AB Much scholarly work has explored the benefits firms accrue from
   innovation activities. Although some research has shown that firm
   innovativeness is associated with enhanced export success, the
   conditions under which firm innovativeness activities are most and least
   beneficial are not well understood. The authors take a contingency
   perspective and use social capital theory to investigate how internal
   channel networking capability and structural factors as well as external
   environment factors affect the innovativeness-export performance
   relationship. Analysis of samples of exporting firms from Ghana and
   Bosnia and Herzegovina indicates that innovativeness is most beneficial
   for firms operating in competitive and dynamic export markets; those in
   less competitive and static markets do not benefit from their innovation
   activities to the same extent. Stronger networking capabilities and a
   more organic structure also enhance the innovativeness-export
   performance relationship. The findings imply that the management of firm
   innovativeness is not a straightforward task in which greater emphasis
   on innovation activities is always beneficial for firms; rather,
   exporting organizations must match firm innovativeness levels to
   external environmental conditions and internal capabilities and
   structures.

   (TMT) in a multicultural context. The study uses primary survey data

   Austria; Germany; China, including Hong Kong; Singapore; and the United
   States) to investigate the moderating effects of national culture on the
   relationship between social capital and the influence of CMOs in the
   TMT. The findings show that the social capital dimensions of managerial
   tie utilization and trust are strong drivers of a CMO's influence in the
   TMT and that these relationships are culturally dependent. Trust tends
   to be more effective when the national cultural dimensions of
   collectivism and uncertainty avoidance are high, and solidarity in the
   CMO's network relationship increases his or her influence only in
   collectivistic cultures.

AB To strengthen the theoretical foundations of international marketing
   (IM), the authors propose a framework for conceptualizing the complexity
   of the context that frames international and global exchange systems. In
   particular, they apply a service ecosystems approach, which is grounded
   in service-dominant logic and its foundational premise that service is
   the basis of all exchange. The proposed framework provides insight into
   the nature of context, a distinguishing feature of IM. The authors argue
   that the embeddedness of social networks and the multiplicity of
   institutions within a service ecosystem influence the complexity of
   context. They articulate the way the (co)creation of value influences
   and is influenced by the enactment of practices and the integration of
   resources through various levels (micro, meso, and macro) of interaction
   and institutions. They introduce the concept of "value in cultural
   context" to emphasize the influence of the symbolic and social
   components of context. The article concludes with a discussion of the
   research implications for how a service ecosystems view can aid in the
   advancement of IM theory and practice.

AB Despite growing concerns about environmental issues worldwide, research
   on the subject in the context of international marketing is virtually
   absent. The current study sheds light on the green aspects of exporting,
   using data collected from 216 exporting manufacturers. Drawing on the
   resource-based view and industrial organization theories, the authors
   show that certain organizational resources (i.e., financial, physical,
   and experiential) and capabilities (i.e., shared vision,
   cross-functional coordination, and technology sensing/response) are
   conducive to the deployment of an eco-friendly export marketing strategy
   (comprising product, price, distribution, and promotional elements).
   Such a strategy is more evident for exporters of industrial (vs.
   consumer) goods as well as for firms that sell to developed (vs.
   developing) countries. The results also suggest that the adoption of a
   green export marketing strategy has a positive effect on the firm's
   export performance. In addition, the authors find that the strength of
   the link between eco-friendly export marketing strategy and export
   performance is positively moderated by foreign market environmental

AB Extant country-of-origin research has focused on the deliberate use of
   country-specific associations (CSAs) as a cognitive cue, captured by
   consumer responses to direct questioning. However, such responses only
   capture rational and verbally held aspects of CSAs and do not reveal
   emotional and nonverbally held aspects. Drawing from dual-coding theory,
   the authors (1) develop propositions about the existence of two distinct
   types of CSAs (rational and emotional) and the differences in consumers'
   communication of these associations, (2) apply a three-stage qualitative
   design in two complementary studies to test these propositions, (3) link
   the identified CSAs to brand origin recognition and brand ownership, and
   (4) generate a consumer typology on how CSAs are communicated. Their
   results indicate that people tend to communicate rational CSAs verbally
   and emotional CSAs nonverbally. Whereas both rational and emotional
   associations positively affect consumers' brand origin recognition
   accuracy, only emotional associations affect brand ownership. The
   authors consider theoretical and managerial implications in light of
   recent criticism on country-of-origin research and offer suggestions for
   further research.

   of global company animosity (GCA). Such understanding is important in a
   world increasingly dominated by global brands that are rapidly losing
   their associations with individual countries. This study proposes a
   nomological net that features GCA and perceived value of global brands
   (PVGB) as "dual process antecedents" to global brand attitudes and
   mediators of four relevant exogenous constructs (consumer ethnocentrism
   and localism through GCA and cosmopolitanism and materialism through
   PVGB). Using nonstudent consumers, the authors test the model in three
   diverse national markets ranging from emerging to developed: Brazil,
   South Korea, and Germany. The results show support for the importance of
   PVGB as a counterbalance to GCA in Brazil and Germany. The dominance of
   the PVGB path in South Korea is due to the country's unique
   socioeconomic milieu. Although replication is warranted, international
   marketing managers should benefit from strategic consideration of the
   antecedents and pathways from GCA and PVGB to global brand attitudes.

   heterogeneity, which refers to distinct consumer patterns evoked by
   contextual differences, to elaborate on the requirements of an
   international segmentation that includes EMs, such as microlevel
   analyses and the inclusion of institutional effects. The authors
   numerically illustrate the established requirements by applying a
   multilevel finite mixture modeling of global consumer multichannel
   (search and purchase) behavior. Doing so provides an initial large-scale
   analysis that compares consumers from EMs and high-income countries. The
   findings broadly support the suggested requirements, contributing to the
   international segmentation and EM literature. Practitioners can apply
   the insights of this investigation to establish an international
   marketing strategy. The key recommendation proposes that a case-by-case
   analysis of EMs is necessary and that solely considering EMs derives

   but this effect diminishes for consumers with high global identity.
   Study 3 strengthens these findings by ruling out the alternative
   explanation that imports, not global brands, drive such results.
   Finally, Study 4 indicates that Indian consumers yield a similar pattern
   to Chinese consumers with regard to the global orientation effect, but
   the study reveals a relatively weak influence of ethnocentrism.

   operating abroad by considering the effects of innovation
   (research-and-development intensity, product and process innovations) on
   exports (breadth and depth), and vice versa. The study analyzes a panel
   data set of 696 Spanish manufacturing firms during 1994-2005 using Tobit
   and logit regressions and the Granger test of causality to offer a more
   complete picture of this complex relationship. They find broad support
   for the notion that innovation and exports have a reciprocal causal
   relationship, although the findings are partly nuanced by positive but
   nonsignificant associations between product innovation and exports and
   between export depth and process innovation. Furthermore, both export
   and innovation processes Granger-cause each other, demonstrating that
   there is a double causal relationship.

   unclear whether and how social ties matter in cultivating marketing
   channels for both local and foreign firms in China. Moreover, few
   studies have explicitly distinguished and examined the roles of business
   versus political ties. Drawing on the resource-based view and social
   network theory, the authors propose and test the moderating effects of
   political ties and business ties on channel capability-performance
   relationships. The findings from a survey of 342 firms indicate that the
   value of channel capability is conditional on political and business
   ties, but in opposite directions: business ties impede and political
   ties strengthen the effect of channel capability on firm performance.
   Furthermore, the moderating role of social ties is stronger for local,
   nonleading firms than for foreign, leading firms.

AB It has been observed that some firms succeed in their attempts to
   achieve business goals in emerging economies, whereas others fail. To
   understand the reasons for this phenomenon, the authors conduct a
   qualitative study where they interview 42 managers of multinational
   companies from the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
   From the insights gleaned from these interviews and the available
   literature, they propose a conceptual framework that identifies the
   possible factors that would drive the creation of both a profitable and
   a loyal customer base (termed "profitable customer loyalty" in this
   study) in the emerging economies. The influencing factors are
   categorized as customer-specific variables, marketing-mix variables, and
   firm-specific variables. From these factors, the authors advance
   research propositions that discuss the potential relationships with
   profitable customer loyalty. One of this study's key contributions is
   the proposal that multinational companies monitor the suggested factors
   and assess a degree of comfort before formulating strategies in the
   emerging economies. Further research can focus on the empirical
   validation of the proposed framework.

AB Research shows that most retailers expand abroad by transferring some
   elements of their format, and therefore their value chain, unchanged,
   while adapting other elements. However, little is known about how
   strongly a retail format's standardized or adapted elements affect
   performance in a foreign country. To shed light on this issue, this
   study focuses on the design of important processes and offerings, as
   both determine retailers' efficiency and sales. This study proposes that
   successful retailers build on the unchanged know-how parts of the format
   by combining more standardized core elements with adapted peripheral
   elements. The authors draw from a survey of 102 international retailers
   and interviews with 126 executives conducted at their headquarters. The
   results show that retailers transfer offers (marketing programs) and
   processes (marketing and supply chain) differently and hierarchically;
   that is, peripheral elements are allowed to vary, whereas core elements
   are transferred in a more standardized manner. Furthermore, the
   relationship between marketing program elements and performance varies:
   the use of standardized core elements (e.g., store types, locations) and
   adapted peripheral elements (e.g., assortments, promotions) is advisable
   for increasing performance in another country. Processes are only
   indirectly associated with performance. These observations hold true for
   both psychically close and distant countries.

AB Firms can achieve a competitive advantage across different institutional

   is, their ability to sense and meet customers' demands. However,
   internationalizing emerging markets firm have preferred different
   sources of competitive advantage thus far. Drawing from marketing
   research and the resource-based view of the firm, this article
   investigates the antecedents for building and deploying MCs by Chinese
   firms in Europe. Using a qualitative research approach, the authors find
   that deficiencies in motivation, opportunity, and ability constrain
   these firms from shifting to more marketing-driven business models. The
   authors also identify the underlying reasons for each of these
   antecedents, including causal ambiguity and inertia. The derived
   theoretical framework specifies the constraining effects of different
   levels of motivation, opportunity, and ability on the building and
   deployment of MCs in firms from emerging markets as they evolve from one
   stage of international marketing to another.

AB Internationalizing retailers have shifted their attention to developing
   countries in which they pursue different forms of adapted-format
   transfer strategies to succeed locally. However, little is known about
   whether such retailers can use their core advantage of a global retail
   brand and how consumer perceptions of such global retail brands drive
   retail patronage. To expand knowledge on this issue, the authors use
   data from 1188 Chinese consumer surveys on 36 Western, Asian, and
   mainland Chinese retailers. They find that retailers' perceived brand
   globalness and perceived brand localness enhance retail patronage only
   by affecting consumers' functional and psychological values. These value
   creation routes to success change according to retailers' origins.
   Although Western and Asian retailers draw equally strong benefits from
   their global perceptions, Asian retailers convince consumers
   predominantly through functional values, whereas Western retailers also
   influence consumers emotionally. Chinese retailers gain consumers by
   being perceived as "glocal" brands. Furthermore, perceived brand
   globalness enhances retail patronage most strongly for global identity
   consumers. Thus, retailers in emerging countries benefit from perceived
   brand globalness depending on retailer- and consumer-specific boundary
   conditions.

AB In three institutional environments, this study examines the

   answer the research question: What is the uncertainty-reducing effect of
   experiential knowledge of varying specificity in markets with different
   institutional distances from a firm's home base? The authors develop a
   theoretical model using the most recent developments in
   internationalization process theory. They test the model with a data set
   collected on-site at 203 small and medium-sized enterprises with entry
   experience into the new Eastern European Union member-states, Russia and
   China. The analysis shows no support for the claim that
   internationalization knowledge reduces uncertainty in the market entry
   process. Rather, the analysis reveals that societal knowledge of the
   entering firm has an uncertainty-reducing effect in markets that are
   relatively less distant from its home market. The analysis also shows
   that international experiential knowledge of high specificity, an
   important type of marketing knowledge, provides the greatest
   uncertainty-reducing effect.

AB In an emerging market context, this article examines the impact of early
   international market entry on marketing capability development and
   performance outcomes in young and small entrepreneurial firms. The
   authors identify the importance of marketing capabilities and the
   boundary conditions associated with international commitment, as well as
   the type of international market entered (developed vs. emerging
   market), to determine performance outcomes in early
   internationalization. With survey data from more than 300 senior
   managers in China, the results indicate that early foreign market entry
   enhances a young venture's marketing capabilities, which in turn leads
   to international growth. The findings also reveal that young ventures
   tend to be in a better position to improve their marketing capabilities
   when their senior management demonstrates a high level of commitment to
   foreign markets. Furthermore, the impact of marketing capabilities on
   the performance outcomes of early internationalization seems more
   salient among ventures that target developed, rather than emerging,
   foreign markets. Theoretically, through the lens of organizational
   learning and the development of marketing capabilities, this article
   contributes to the study of international new ventures by demonstrating
   that marketing capabilities serve as enabling factors that help young
   international ventures mitigate their liabilities of foreignness to
   achieve international performance outcomes.

   their marketing activities. Using a cross-country case approach, this
   article explores the role of stakeholders in the marketing
   capability-building processes of INVs in Ireland, Sweden, and Denmark.
   The study reveals that different stakeholders play a critical role in
   influencing how INVs build their marketing capabilities to respond
   effectively to the dynamic nature of international markets in which they
   operate. The results show that different stakeholder groups (allied,
   cooperative, neutral, and entrepreneur) can influence the learning
   processes (single-, double-, and triple-loop) of the firm and can
   determine the nature of dynamic marketing capabilities (incremental,
   renewing, and regenerative) needed to create and sustain international
   competitive advantage. Furthermore, "effectuation logic" can explain how
   entrepreneurs manage and leverage stakeholder relationships in marketing
   capability processes to cocreate value for the firm. By incorporating
   dynamic capabilities, stakeholder, and learning theories, this study
   offers a dynamic, process-oriented model for INV research and provides
   much-needed qualitative insights into the dynamic capabilities theory of
   the firm.

   has a stronger positive effect on financial performance (i.e., lagged
   return on assets) than pure imitation. Furthermore, pure imitation and
   creative imitation, when coupled with strong marketing capability,

   about the determinants of joint action in cross-border exchanges. In
   view of this, the authors investigate the role of interchannel
   communication in motivating buyers for joint action in cross-border
   channel exchange relationships. The authors also propose and examine the
   moderating effect of psychic distance, a crucial aspect of cross-border
   exchanges. They use partial least squares to analyze survey data
   collected from Taiwanese importers, and the findings reveal that trust
   and satisfaction fully mediate the relationships between frequent and
   bidirectional communication and joint action. The authors also confirm
   the detrimental moderating impact of psychic distance on the
   relationships between communication facets and relational mediators
   (trust and satisfaction). However, psychic distance does not hinder the
   relationships between the relational mediators and joint action. The
   research provides insights into two underresearched areas-namely, joint
   action and intercultural communication-and advances theoretical
   understanding on how to encourage joint action in psychically distinct

   foundations of importing research using a comprehensive review of 321
   importing-related articles published during the 1960-2010 period. The
   analysis reveals that, although in general this research adopts a
   certain theoretical perspective, a notable part of it is not
   theoretically anchored. Of those studies that rely on theories, the most
   commonly used are the neoclassical microeconomic model, the behavioral
   model, and transaction cost economics. These theories were mainly
   associated with international buying behavior, importer exporter
   relationships, and strategic aspects of importing. The study also
   identifies a range of other important topics that could be investigated
   using extant theories. In addition, the authors propose several other
   theories not previously employed, such as the institutional,
   stakeholder, and resource dependence theories, to be used in the study
   of new research issues. Finally, the authors suggest several actions
   toward theory advancement, including the need to integrate multiple

   important strategic marketing issues: the breadth of product offering
   and the standardization of marketing strategies across countries. The
   empirical results show that foreign expansion path, foreign business
   experience, and external globalization pressure have an impact on the
   selection of marketing strategies. The study also finds that the fit
   between these contextual factors and the standardization of marketing
   strategy has a positive effect on performance. The novel results

AB By studying consumer samples in an emerging market, Turkey, and two
   mature markets, Singapore and Denmark, the author tests the chain of
   relationships that drive consumers' likelihood of purchasing the global
   brand in the presence of a local brand in a linear structural relations
   framework. The results indicate that perceived brand globalness is
   positively related to local iconness in an emerging market, but the
   relationship is negative in advanced markets. Developing local iconness
   helps build the perception of prestige in all three markets.
   Furthermore, local iconness is positively related to local brand quality
   perceptions in the culturally grounded categories of food in an emerging
   market, whereas in nonfood categories, local iconness has no connection
   to quality. In terms of cross-effects, as expected, the perceived
   quality of the local brand is negatively associated with global brand
   purchase likelihood in all markets and categories studied. In contrast,
   local brand prestige dampens global brand purchase likelihood for older
   consumers in an emerging market. The article concludes with implications
   for global and local brand managers.

AB Countries compete intensely for foreign direct investment (FDI) and
   perform a wide range of activities to attract it. Research on FDI
   promotion often overlooks the effects of advertising. To fill this gap
   in the literature, this study analyzes the content of FDI advertising to
   explain its structure. To guide the analysis, the authors use Dunning's
   FDI location advantages framework. This framework represents an
   effective prism through which to view FDI advertising, and Dunning's
   location advantages are reflected in advertising content. In an effort
   to shed more light on FDI advertising, the authors first provide an
   assessment of how advertising content varies by country income
   classification. Next, using exploratory factor analysis, they identify
   the five factors represented in FDI advertising: knowledge resources,
   market attractiveness, economic governance, infrastructure, and natural
   resources. The findings suggest that high-income countries tend to focus
   on knowledge resources, while lower-middle-income countries focus on
   economic governance. Upper-middle-income countries tap into both
   knowledge resources and economic governance while also promoting the
   attractiveness of their market.

AB Transaction cost economics (TCE) has received much attention in the
   international marketing literature over the past 25 years. Many key
   issues in international marketing have been examined through the lens of
   TCE, including entry mode choice, the governance of international
   distribution channels, propensity to franchise, international pricing
   control, and the governance of international buyer supplier
   relationships. The author presents a review and analysis of 43 empirical
   TCE international marketing studies from 1987 to the present day. The
   results from this review and analysis indicate that the extant
   international marketing TCE studies demonstrate some support for the TCE
   propositions. In addition to these findings, the author also notes some
   key measurement issues, issues involving the dominance of U.S.-based
   studies, and some data equivalence issues. He builds on the results of
   the analysis to lay out important future research directions in the TCE
   international marketing domain.

AB This study theorizes that resource deployment stability is an
   influential characteristic in international research-and-development
   (R&D) alliances. The authors develop and test a model of antecedents and
   performance outcomes of this form of parental persistence. The model is
   novel in its use of self-determination theory to investigate
   self-motivational forces that drive a venturing firm's social
   integration through resource deployment. The results reveal that
   resource deployment stability is positively linked to performance
   satisfaction and schedule adherence. Conflict management is positively
   linked to resource deployment stability, while behavioral control exerts
   a positive influence on performance satisfaction, though it is not
   related to resource deployment stability. Cultural similarity is
   positively linked to resource deployment stability in older (vs.
   younger) alliances. However, it is negatively related to schedule
   adherence in older (vs. younger) alliances. The authors discuss the
   implications of these results for both theory development and
   international R&D alliance management.

AB Price-related consequences of the country-of-origin (COO) cue have
   received limited attention in extant literature. In this study, the
   authors draw from equity theory and cue utilization theory and
   investigate (1) whether a brand's COO affects a consumer's willingness
   to pay and (2) the extent to which the consumer's familiarity with the
   brand moderates this relationship. The results of three complementary
   experimental studies reveal that COO indeed has a positive impact on
   willingness to pay. Furthermore, the authors find a negative moderating
   influence of brand familiarity on the COO effect in a high-involvement
   setting but not in a low-involvement setting. The authors discuss the
   theoretical and managerial implications of the findings, and they
   identify directions for further research.

AB Attribute ratings often contain a holistic or global impression of the
   brand, commonly referred to as "halo." A halo response can occur when
   perceptions of a brand's performance on an attribute are influenced by
   performance perceptions on another attribute or by a global impression
   of the brand. Using cross-national survey data from consumers in
   Argentina, China, Spain, and the United States, the authors examine the
   extent to which a halo response introduces bias to product quality and
   corporate social responsibility perceptions of competing brands. The
   findings show that halo is more pervasive for product quality than for
   corporate social responsibility associations, varies across brands and
   markets, and is strongly related to brand recommendations. Examining
   cross-national brand performance and halo perceptions can help
   international marketing managers understand key perceptual similarities
   and differences between and across markets, which can inform strategic
   considerations such as whether to pursue global, panregional, or
   national branding, positioning, and advertising strategies.

AB Marketers have increasingly employed positioning strategies to appeal to
   either global or local consumer cultures. However, little is known about
   the characteristics of consumers most likely to respond to such
   positioning. The authors find that the collective identities of global
   and national identification are strongly related to responsiveness to
   global and local consumer culture positioning (GCCP and LCCP,
   respectively). The results also show that personality predisposes people
   to adopt collective identities. The personality traits of openness to
   experience and agreeableness are significantly related to global and
   national identity, respectively. On the basis of these findings, the
   authors present implications with regard to developing GCCP and LCCP
   strategies that are congruent with consumers' personality and associated
   collective identity.

AB This article aims to better understand patterns of rapid
   internationalization by using the emerging international
   entrepreneurship paradigm. This involves (1) taking an opportunity-based
   view (OBV) rather than just the firm as a focal point of analysis, (2)
   focusing on dynamic entrepreneurial processes, and (3) stressing the
   importance of history. The authors gathered empirical evidence from 15
   case studies of small and medium-sized enterprises in Australia. They
   find support for the central proposition that behind the gradual or
   rapid internationalization process lies a path-dependent process of
   opportunity development and cross-border venturing activities that is
   shaped by the domestic and international networks in which the key
   actors and organizations have operated in the past and in which they are
   currently operating. The evidence leads the authors to question the
   notion that rapid internationalization is indeed rapid. Importantly, it
   reveals that rapid internationalization seems to be a truly rapid
   process only when not taking an OBV. In doing so, the authors
   demonstrate that the OBV is a fruitful avenue of enquiry to advance
   knowledge in this area and underscore the importance of the
   entrepreneurial process and firm history.

AB Over the past four decades, there has been a considerable number of
   studies that have examined the determinants and outcomes of export
   pricing. However, despite this large volume of studies, the knowledge of
   the determinants and consequences of export pricing is characterized by
   a fragmented, diverse, and inconsistent collection of findings that
   hinders scholarship and practical advancement in the field. A major
   reason for this absence of clear insights is the lack of synthesis and
   assimilation of the fragmented knowledge. To address this gap in the
   literature, the authors review and evaluate 98 articles published
   between 1971 and 2010. The results indicate that although significant
   progress has been made in recent years, research on export pricing is
   still characterized by the lack of a strong theoretical basis, the
   failure to agree on the relevant determinants of export pricing, and
   some weakness in research designs and analytical techniques, which may
   explain the many contradictory and confusing findings in the literature.
   On the basis of these findings, the authors discuss several
   implications, and consider directions for further research.

AB Technological exporters are constantly challenged by the trade-off

   Nonetheless, research directly addressing this topic is scarce, and few
   recommendations exist about the best orientation to emphasize. Using two
   respondents in the same firm, the export manager and the
   research-and-development manager, the authors find that customer
   orientation is as important as technological orientation in the
   development of exploratory innovation capabilities. However, when past
   performance is poor, customer orientation has a greater role. Exporters
   with poor past performance may achieve higher export performance levels
   by focusing more on customers than on technology. Conversely, firms
   performing well may risk export performance if they ignore technology
   orientation. These firms also need to maintain high levels of customer
   orientation.

AB In recent years, increasing interest has emerged in examining global

   choices, lifestyles, and exposure to mass media from other countries. In
   turn, this has sparked interest in concepts such as consumer
   world-mindedness and its impact on attitudes and behavior. The current

   reflecting a global consumer culture positioning (GCCP) versus a foreign
   consumer culture positioning (FCCP) or a local consumer culture
   positioning (LCCP) and the relationship with consumer world-mindedness.
   In Studies 1 and 2, the authors examine the impact of world-mindedness,
   while controlling for ethnocentric attitudes. In Study 3, they examine
   the interactions of world-mindedness, international travel, and
   preference for authenticity. The authors develop several hypotheses and
   examine them using two surveys of 90 (Study 1) and 100 consumers
   (Studies 2 and 3) in the Netherlands. The results demonstrate, for
   example, that advertisements for brands with FCCP and GCCP are

   marketing capabilities: pricing, product development, distribution, and
   marketing communication. The authors investigate the moderating effect
   of national culture on the link between social capital and marketing
   capability using survey data from 891 firms across four countries
   (China, Germany, Hong Kong, and the United States). The findings
   indicate that the elements of social capital managerial tie utilization,
   trust, and solidarity are strong drivers of the four marketing
   capabilities. Managerial tie utilization and solidarity tend to be more
   important when national culture's power distance is low, collectivism is
   high, and uncertainty avoidance is low, whereas the effect of trust is
   not subject to national cultural variations. From a managerial
   perspective, this research emphasizes the strong role and responsibility
   of top management team members, including marketing managers who are at

AB The construct of consumer affinity, which captures country-specific
   favorable feelings toward particular foreign countries, was recently
   introduced in the international marketing literature. In this study, the
   authors conceptually advance the consumer affinity construct and develop
   a measurement instrument for capturing affinity feelings. They also link
   consumer affinity, country image, and consumer ethnocentrism to key
   consumer behavior variables namely, perceived risk and willingness to
   buy products from, invest in, and visit the affinity country. The
   findings indicate that consumer affinity is more powerful than
   consumers' ethnocentric tendencies in explaining both perceived risk and
   willingness to buy. The results also show that consumer affinity is more
   influential than cognitive evaluations of a country for the majority of
   the behavioral outcomes considered in the study (perceived risk, visit
   intentions, and investment intentions). Thus, internationally active
   companies can benefit from leveraging consumer affinity feelings in
   addition to positive country images. Overall, the study emphasizes the
   important role of positive affect in shaping consumer behavior, thus
   complementing prior research that focuses exclusively on the behavioral
   implications of negative affect (most notably consumer animosity).

   staffing approach in the development of a global marketing mind-set
   within global organizations. The premise lies in addressing the
   liability-of-foreignness concept, which, the authors suggest, impedes
   the inpatriate marketing manager's integration process, from the
   individual level of analysis. Drawing from reference point theory, the
   article highlights potential hardships manages face with an analysis of
   the managerial and contextual liability of foreignness that inpatriate
   marketing managers may perceive in their transition from home countries
   to headquarter locations. Implications of identifying and attending to
   such hardships are important in light of the significance attributed to
   these semipermanent to permanent assignments across different cultural

AB Using the facilities transformation usage framework of service provision
   and drawing from control theory, the authors develop a theoretical model
   that examines the influence of different quality control initiatives on
   relative service quality in a business-to-business setting and,
   consequently, on export performance. They explicitly consider quality
   control initiatives that address service employees' performance and the
   customers' coproduction as well as selected firm characteristics as
   antecedents of such initiatives. They test the proposed model on data
   drawn from an export survey of service providers. The results show that
   export customer oriented training, customer coproduction instructions,
   and work process standardization have a positive influence on relative
   service quality, which in turn positively affects export performance.
   However, adaptation to export customers' coproduction competence and
   motivation has a positive influence on relative service quality only
   when the customer integration in the service delivery is high. The
   authors conclude by considering implications for the management of the
   service delivery process in an export setting and identifying future
   research directions.

AB Most recent research on customer relationship management (CRM) has been
   restricted to developed economies such as the United States. Researchers
   have done little to study the growth of CRM in developing markets such
   as Asia and South America, which are becoming increasingly relevant to
   business today. With the changing business climate, firms are beginning
   to embrace the concept of managing customers rather than products. This
   leads managers down the path of customer centricity, and here lies the
   relevance of truly global CRM (GCRM). The authors conduct a qualitative
   study to understand the concept of GCRM and its relevance. Their results
   quantify the growth of CRM on a global scale using a diffusion modeling
   framework. The results of the generalized cross-regional diffusion model
   indicate that there is untapped market potential in the GCRM market,
   with varying adoption patterns across regions. The authors also propose
   a conceptual framework to understand the factors that affect
   cross-regional learning in GCRM adoption. In addition, the study
   provides insights into implementation and calibration of a GCRM
   framework and directions for further research.

AB This research explores the extent to which competitive actions of

   technology products shape the diffusion of their respective products in
   emerging markets. Drawing on competitive technology diffusion, the
   Austrian perspective on firms' market processes, and resource advantage

   characteristics of the competitive actions of MNCs and local vendors.
   They validate the hypotheses with longitudinal field data from two pairs
   of competing Internet technology products in search engine and
   consumer-to-consumer electronic markets. The findings indicate that
   specific market-oriented actions of local vendors and MNCs influence the
   diffusion of technology products. In particular, global marketing
   managers should concentrate on a few key actions and take new actions
   that differ from those of local vendors in emerging markets. This study
   provides a wealth of knowledge in high-technology product diffusion and
   demonstrates how competition between local vendors and MNCs in emerging
   markets differs from typical within-industry competition. In addition,
   this study conveys important implications to the theory of international

AB Existing global account management (GAM) studies mostly focus on
   multinational suppliers' decision on which customers to serve with GAM
   programs, while paying limited attention to how to formulate mechanisms
   of global account coordination to best serve a chosen account. The issue
   of making optimal choices on specific coordination modes is pressing to
   global account managers because GAM programs are both costly and
   consequential. First, building on prior research that suggests the
   existence of two modes of global account coordination-namely,
   interorganizational coordination (IOC) and intercountry coordination
   (ICC)-the authors propose a formal framework that delineates their
   similarities and differences along the domain (internal vs. external),
   level (horizontal vs. vertical), and foci (strategic execution vs.
   relationship maintenance). Second, following the resource-based view and
   power-dependency theory, the authors propose an integrative framework on
   how various supplier, interorganizational, and customer factors
   influence global marketing managers' coordination mechanism choices.
   They further advance several hypotheses on the curvilinear nature of
   influences of several antecedents on coordination mode choices and
   examine the impacts of forms of global account coordination modes on
   suppliers' market and relational performance. They test the conceptual
   model using data collected from a cross-national sample of more than 200
   global account managers. The findings show that the two coordination
   modes have different sets of antecedents and exert independent,
   different influences on supplier performance. Therefore, they should be
   treated separately in research as well as practice.

AB Recent marketing literature has shown that an influential marketing

   some studies, of firm performance. Recognizing the importance of a
   strong marketing department, this study develops a theoretical model of
   the levers of marketing departments' influence and examines the degree
   to which the effects of the levers are subject to national cultural
   variations. The authors empirically validate the theoretical model using
   740 firms from six Western and Asian countries. The findings reveal both
   culturally dependent and independent effects. For example, although a
   great degree of innovativeness in the marketing department has a
   positive impact on the department's influence across cultures, a high
   level of accountability and integration with other departments shows
   cultural dependencies. Global marketing managers learn whether they
   should advise their local marketing department to use standardized
   influence tactics or make necessary adaptations to local circumstances.

   Next, they divide markets into five major spheres, examining the

AB Effective governance of distributors represents a critical success

   framework to delineate the effect of fit between governance strategies
   and distributor role orientations on channel outcomes. They also examine
   the way two contingency factors (relationship stages and market
   uncertainty) may moderate the impact of this fit. Using a four-industry
   survey of distributors in China, the authors confirm the salience of
   strategic fit between the manufacturer's governance strategy and the
   distributor's role orientation (in short, governance fit), in support of
   propositions postulated in recent channel governance research. The
   findings also indicate that the effects of this governance fit are
   dependent on the stages of the channel relationship (buildup versus
   mature) but not market uncertainty. This study extends the current
   literature and suggests the need for finer, phase-oriented dynamic

   codetermines both marketing differentiation and cost leadership
   advantages, and together these link to export venture performance gains.
   The authors reveal that marketing differentiation and cost leadership
   strategies positively influence differentiation and cost advantages,
   respectively. They observe hybrid strategy to influence marketing
   differentiation advantage inversely. Moreover, marketing differentiation
   strategy alone is important in driving innovation ambidexterity. The

AB The spread of global culture is being facilitated by the proliferation
   of transnational corporations, the rise of global capitalism, widespread
   aspiration for material possessions, and the homogenization of global
   consumption. The extent of convergence of cultural values across nations
   has been debated by international marketing researchers. However, from a
   practical standpoint, transnational firms require a cross-national,
   cross-cultural approach to market segmentation that can be used to guide
   the development of global marketing strategies. In this study, the
   authors investigate the application of cross-national versus
   cross-cultural approaches to market segmentation through a rigorous
   empirical investigation in the context of banking services. Although
   services constitute the fastest growing sector of the world economy, few
   studies have examined global market segmentation strategies for them.
   The authors develop theory-based cross-national hypotheses and test them
   by estimating a structural model of consumers' perceived service quality
   using survey data from two countries: the United States and India. They
   test cross-cultural hypotheses by estimating the same model on
   culture-based clusters. They demonstrate that there are distinctive
   differences between cross-national and cross-cultural models of
   perceived service quality and highlight the growing relevance of
   cross-cultural research approaches. More generally, the cross-national,

AB This study tests the effectiveness of global consumer culture
   positioning (GCCP) in terms of perceptions of soft-sell (indirect and
   image-based) and hard-sell (direct and information-based) appeals across
   markets. The authors draw the theoretical base for the study from
   previous research, along with a series of recent conceptualizations on
   culture and branding based on global consumer culture theory. If the
   same appeal is homogeneously and favorably perceived in different
   markets, such an appeal should be a good candidate for use as part of a
   GCCP strategy. From prior research, the authors predict that soft-sell
   appeals are more similarly perceived across markets than hard-sell
   appeals. They conduct a quasi-experimental study in the United States
   and Japan with a general consumer sample. After choosing six
   advertisements using rigorous content analysis, they examine the
   perceptions of soft-sell and hard-sell appeals, including attitude
   toward the ad, believability, irritation, and purchase intention. The
   results indicate somewhat more homogeneous acceptance of soft-sell
   appeals but, surprisingly, also show relatively homogeneous acceptance
   of hard-sell appeals across markets. These findings are suggestive of
   both types of appeals having the potential to be used as part of a GCCP
   across the United States and Japan and perhaps other markets.

AB Globalization of innovation calls for entrepreneurial new ventures from
   emerging economies to develop customer-focused dynamic capabilities. The
   authors argue that firms with proprietary technology and a strategic
   intent to internationalize invest in international customer support
   capabilities to satisfy the demands of their most important
   international customers. Using a unique sample of 173 international new
   ventures from China and India, the authors show that such investments
   are associated with improved organizational learning and performance.
   The results suggest that globalization pays off when entrepreneurial
   firms from emerging economies invest in ongoing support of their most
   important international customers.

   differences in organizational buyers' normative expectations of supplier
   performance. These normative expectations encompass what buyers perceive
   as business standards or norms, regardless of product/service, supplier,
   or industry The first study (four countries) pinpoints the normative
   expectations that help explain why managers across countries may,
   evaluate the same supplier performance differently. The second study
   provides an illustrative example of these differences in a separate
   sample drawn from the same four countries. The inclusion of such
   normative expectations of supplier performance has the potential to add
   explanatory power to models of performance evaluation in international
   business-to-business relationships. The findings suggest that if
   differences in normative expectations of supplier performance are not
   taken into account, performance ratings may be distorted indicators of
   actual performance.

AB Notwithstanding the extensive literature on opportunism in buyer seller
   relationships, scant empirical attention has been given to this issue in
   both international and Chinese contexts. Using a sample of 202 Hong Kong
   Chinese importers, this article highlights the harmful effect of Western
   exporters' opportunism on importers' long-term orientation through the
   intervening role of key behavioral constructs. The study confirms almost
   all hypothesized associations between the constructs examined,
   indicating that an exporter's opportunistic behavior reduces trust and
   generates conflict. In turn, low trust reduces commitment, and conflict
   impedes communication. Low levels of both commitment and communication
   reduce importers' satisfaction, which inhibits their long-term
   orientation. The importer's proactive initiation of the relationship
   moderates the link between opportunism and trust but not that of
   opportunism with conflict. The study also confirms the moderating role
   of importer dependence and exporters' marketing adaptation on the
   association of satisfaction with long-term orientation. The authors find
   moderating effects on this association through the Chinese constructs of
   renqing and mianzi, albeit in the opposite direction to that
   hypothesized.

AB Theory posits that export commitment is key to the effective
   implementation of resource-led strategy. The authors investigate the
   role of export commitment, considered a multidimensional construct, in
   linking export resources and capabilities to positional advantages
   achieved in foreign markets. They test their resource-based view
   assertions among a multi-industry sample of 150 Spanish exporters. The
   results show that experiential resources, specific export capabilities,
   and export market orientation (EMO) reinforce export commitment, which
   exerts a positive effect on perceived positional advantages. These
   perceptions also are likely to he positive if the firm adapts its
   marketing mix to the needs of its foreign markets. Moreover, the results
   show that EMO exerts a positive influence on marketing-mix adaptation.
   Resources linked to experience and informational knowledge about foreign
   markets foster the development of capabilities (i.e., specific export
   capabilities and/or EMO). Finally, the results indicate that specific
   export capabilities influence EMO. The authors conclude with a
   discussion of practical implications for facilitating export competitive

   of service quality and relationship quality for behavioral intentions.
   Using goal and action identification theories, they argue that
   collectivist tendencies become salient depending on a buyer's particular
   goal in a given service context and that when collectivist
   characteristics are salient, they can influence the importance of
   service or relationship quality. In the first study, the authors
   demonstrate the moderation effect of collectivism in a
   high-social-interaction context, in which they argue that collectivist
   tendencies are salient, using data collected in countries characterized
   as high and low in collectivism, and find that collectivism increases
   the importance of relationship and service quality (contrary to the
   hypothesized negative effect) for behavioral intentions. In the second
   study, the authors find that collectivism does not moderate the
   aforementioned relationships in contexts in which social interaction is
   expected to be low. The cross-national and cross-contextual findings
   provide multinational retailers guidance in designing the customer
   retail experience on the basis of the collectivist tendencies of

   position in a global research-and-development network and its
   orientation toward using scientific knowledge (science intensity).
   Drawing on organizational learning and network theory research, they
   focus on the moderating role of a firm's network position in the
   relationship between the firm's science intensity and the impact of its
   innovation. Data derived from the global pharmaceutical industry
   indicate that a firm's science intensity enhances the impact of its
   innovation by facilitating effective search. This relationship is
   reinforced when the firm has network resources derived from an efficient
   network position. These results support the idea that the impact of
   innovation is strengthened when internal research capability and
   external network resources are combined. This study, which is conducted
   in a global industry network context, also enables the authors to
   examine the role of international gatekeepers in bridging ties across

   strength to buffer market turbulence and technological turbulence and
   when the foreign firm can deploy it to support the influences of

   collected from 140 foreign firms in China. Although prior research has
   demonstrated that firms often use multiple strategies and resources to
   cope with environmental forces, the findings illustrate that different
   environmental segments have unequal bearings on market responsiveness,
   product innovation, and MNC network strength. In addition, despite the
   direct positive influences of individual marketing strategic postures
   and MNC network strength on firm performance, their combined effects are
   mixed. The author concludes with a discussion of the implications of

AB Because of suggested beneficial effects of word-of-mouth (AXIOM)
   referral, service companies have invested large amounts of money in
   customer referral programs as well as programs aimed at fostering
   positive communication among their existing customers. The question of
   cross-cultural differences in the effectiveness of WOM has recently
   gained increased prominence. The authors contribute to research on this
   topic by proposing a positive effect of received WO M on service quality
   perceptions among existing customers. Moreover, they predict that
   cultural values moderate this effect. They test the model on 1910 bank
   customers in 11 countries. The results show that received WOM has a
   positive effect on customer service quality perceptions. Furthermore,
   received WOM has a stronger effect on the evaluation of customers in
   high-uncertainty-avoidance than in low-uncertainty-avoidance cultures.
   No other cultural value is a significant moderator. The results imply
   that received WOM is also important to existing customers and that
   managers should adjust their strategy of referral marketing to match
   their target group's uncertainty-avoidance level.

AB Recently relationship learning between supply chain members has drawn a
   great deal of attention in the literature. In the context of the
   international electronics supply chain, which is characterized by
   cultural differences and complexiti of products, relationship learning
   is difficult to achieve and relies largely on close collaboration
   between partners. The authors build on the resource-based view of the
   firm and adopt a communication culture theory to examine drivers and
   performance outcomes of relationship learning in cross-border
   relationships in the electronics industry They propose a research
   framework in which a firm's innovativeness orientation, trust,
   information technology advancement, and technological uncertainty are
   determinants of relationship learning. In the framework, they introduce
   the communication cultures of the supplier and buyer as a moderator.
   Using 246 electronics suppliers in relationships with international
   original equipment manufacturer customers, the authors empirically show
   that innovativeness orientation, trust, and technological uncertainty
   affect relationship learning positively Furthermore, the communication
   cultures of the supplier and buyer moderate the effects of
   innovativeness orientation and technological uncertainty. The authors
   conclude with a discussion of the implications.

AB Firms increasingly employ global brand management strategies for the
   effective coordination of their global activities. Effective
   coordination requires adapting global brand management strategies to
   cultural nuances. This study examines the influence of culture on the
   impact of four key brand management elements (i.e., brand
   innovativeness, brand customer orientation, brand self-relevance, and
   social responsibility) on customer commitment to a brand. Using
   responses from 167 U.K. and 230 Chinese consumers, the authors
   empirically demonstrate that brand innovativeness and brand
   self-relevance have a greater effect on brand commitment in cultures
   that are individualist, short-term oriented, and low on power distance
   (i.e., the United Kingdom), while brand customer orientation and social
   responsibility have a greater impact on brand commitment in cultures
   that are collectivist, long-term oriented, and high on power distance
   (i.e., China). Furthermore, the findings reveal that in collectivist,
   long-term-oriented, and high-power-distance cultures, the four brand
   management activities equally contribute to brand commitment. The
   research informs global brand managers wanting to optimize brand
   positioning and strengthen customers' brand commitment across cultures.

   authors investigate how knowledge acquired from alliance partners

   innovative performance. The authors propose that the knowledge
   innovation relationship is stronger in international alliances than
   domestic alliances. The results from a survey of 127 German firms
   engaged in strategic alliances confirm that knowledge creation mediates
   the effect of knowledge acquisition on innovative performance and that
   international alliances strengthen the effect of knowledge creation on
   innovative performance. In addition, the authors find that interfirm
   cooperation and competition coexist in strategic alliances and that both
   factors increase knowledge acquisition, though from different
   motivational bases.

   7775 respondents from 34 countries using hierarchical linear modeling
   and also analyze click-through rates from 2192 users from 26 countries.
   The findings show that banner advertising effectiveness in terms of
   attitudes toward banner advertising and intention to click on banner ads
   varies along Hofstede's cultural dimensions of individualism,
   uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity. In particular,
   consumers from individualist countries show less acceptance of banner
   advertising than those from collectivist countries. The acceptance of
   Web banner advertising is related to the consumers' click behavior.
   Individual-level variables contribute only marginally to explain banner
   advertising effectiveness, which strengthens the significance of the
   direct effects of national-level cultural variables. The findings
   suggest that marketers should view banner advertising, though largely
   standardized when targeting a global audience, as a culture-specific
   issue.

   ethnic segments of U.S. consumers. Drawing on survey data analysis and
   the estimates of a structural equation model, the research shows that
   associations with global brands as a general category vary across ethnic
   groups. Caucasian consumers show less of an appreciation of global
   brands, whereas African Americans and Hispanics show patterns similar to
   those in prior research. Although the average consumer views brand
   globality as an attribute of little importance, the structural equation
   findings show a direct effect of globality on attitudes and purchases.

   through standardized strategies with those achievable when adapting to
   local conditions. Building on previous work that has explored the role
   of contingency theory and the concept of strategic fit in international
   marketing strategy, the authors posit that there is no one-size-fits-all
   solution to the export product strategy adaptation decision. Using a
   sample of Swedish exporters, they find support for the hypothesis that
   an array of forces from the macro-, micro-, and internal environments
   drives product adaptation, which affects the nature of product strategy
   fit and its Performance outcomes. In terms of the performance relevance
   of product strategy fit, sociocultural environment, technological
   environment, marketing infrastructure, stage of product life cycle,
   scope of exporting experience, and duration of exporting experience all
   matter. However, the pattern of significant and nonsignificant findings
   cautions against excessive aggregation of environmental variables in
   conceptualizing environment-product strategy fit to performance
   linkages. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications of the
   findings for theory building and management practice.

   knowledge transfer research to further understand both the conditions
   under which one subsidiary uses external knowledge from another
   subsidiary and the outcomes of such use in the subsidiary's market.
   Using the theory of value creation and appropriation and field
   interviews with headquarter and subsidiary marketing managers, the
   authors develop a model and research propositions of the enabling,

   attention in recent years. Yet the question whether entry order affects
   firm performance for service firms in developing markets has remained
   unanswered. Despite lacking empirical evidence, prior research has
   suggested that first-mover advantages (FMAs) do not translate to service
   firms and developing markets. However, framed in a resource-advantage
   theory perspective, the authors' empirical analysis of 379 multinational
   subsidiaries of advertising agencies in 43 developing markets indicates
   a significant relationship between entry order and firm performance. The
   authors also examine the moderating effects of international experience,
   firm size, subsidiary ownership structure, and rate of economic
   development to assess how late entrants can mitigate late-mover
   disadvantages. The authors provide empirical evidence that, contrary to
   recent literature, service firms do enjoy FMAs. They add to the
   understanding of the FMA phenomenon as well as to the broader issue of
   the internationalization process and performance effects for service
   firms.

   represents an important issue faced by managers of global firms and has
   attracted significant research attention. Although previous research has
   established that standardization enhances performance outcomes, more
   recent theorizing suggests that this may not always be the case.
   However, empiri-cal investigators have paid little systematic attention
   to moderating conditions. The major Purpose of this article is to
   investigate the organizational factors that moderate the
   standardization-performance relationship and, thus, to explore the types
   of firm for which standardization is particularly beneficial. The
   authors examine survey data from 489 firms, and their results indicate
   that the standardization-performance link is significantly stronger for
   large firms with a homogeneous product offering, high levels of global
   market penetration, a cost leadership strategy, and strong coordination
   capabilities. The authors conclude that managers evaluating the adequacy
   of a standardization strategy should consider the list of contingencies
   advanced in this research.

AB A relatively recent trend in international marketing is the rising
   number of firms from nontriad countries seeking growth and profits from
   foreign markets. Yet no study has examined the international performance
   of these firms. How successful have their efforts been? What factors
   drive their success? The authors examine these questions by building a
   theory-based conceptual framework that links firm international
   performance to its antecedents. They test the framework using a sample
   of 110 Taiwanese firms. The key findings are as follows: (1) The
   internationalization-performance relationship is characterized by a
   joint U + N shape, (2) learning capacity is positively associated with
   international performance, and (3) research and development intensity is
   not a key driver of performance. Though based on a sample of Taiwanese
   firms only, these results imply that nontriad firms embarking on
   internationalization must persist despite early setbacks, must develop
   their learning capacity, and should not develop extensive research and
   development capabilities while internationalizing. The authors conclude
   with a discussion of the reasons for these findings.

AB This study examines the interplay of product development strategy,

   of Chinese subsidiaries of multinational companies. When firms strive to
   develop highly innovative products (breakthrough focus), the amount of
   resources allocated has a U-shaped relationship to subsequent product
   innovation performance (i.e., market rewards of new products). When the
   aim of product development activity is to reinforce and maintain
   moderately innovative products (platform focus), increased resource
   allocation shows a positive relationship to product innovation
   performance. The amount of resources allocated to minor revisions
   (incremental focus) shows no significant relationship to product
   innovation performance. Knowledge utilization is an important predictor
   of the benefits of developing highly and moderately innovative products.
   Moreover, it helps to mitigate the drawbacks of a breakthrough focus and
   strengthens the positive impact of a platform focus.

AB When new products and brands are introduced into other cultures, the
   speed and extent of the product's acceptance are important concerns for
   marketers. The spread of positive word of mouth (WOM) and the lack of
   negative WOM about the product or brand by early adopter groups are
   critical to the product's successful diffusion in a population. This is
   the first study to investigate the effects of consumers' cultural values
   on their WOM behavior. Data analysis from two samples indicates that the
   pattern, type, and target receivers of consumers' WOM activity depend on
   their cultural values. The authors use Hofstede's four cultural
   dimensions to test the effects of cultural values on WOM behavior to
   social in- and out-groups. They find that all four dimensions have
   significant effects on WOM engagement to those groups. Although the
   authors could not determine the causal nature of the relationships
   because of the sample design used, they argue that marketers should
   monitor the cultural values of their market to anticipate in- and
   out-group discussions and the choice of appropriate brand communication

   develop a theory that predicts that the relationship between market
   orientation and business performance is an inverted U shape, such that
   high levels of market orientation may reduce performance. The authors'
   empirical study of firms' export market-oriented (EMO) activities in
   their export operations finds support for the hypothesized inverted
   U-shaped relationship between EMO behavior and export sales performance.
   They show that the inverted U-shaped relationship becomes greater in
   magnitude (more pronounced) as market dynamism increases and that the
   optimal value of EMO behavior (i.e., the value that generates the
   highest performance return) decreases as market dynamism increases and
   increases as exporting firms' internationalization increases. Therefore,
   they conclude that management's task is not to aim for ever-increasing
   levels of market orientation but to manage market orientation so that
   its level is optimal given the firm's environment and the international
   diversification strategy being pursued.

AB This research contributes to the understanding of global sourcing
   strategy of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBSs) by offering an
   explanation for the differential performance among firms, even when they
   use similar global sourcing strategies. Using a systems integrator as
   the sourcing firm's perspective, the authors argue that complex KIBSs
   involve a complicated mixture of interfaces in that the performance of
   an individual KIBS is insufficient in defining the overall performance
   of the integrated KIBS system. The theoretical framework uses a
   two-stage strategic fit model that emphasizes the conditions under which
   global sourcing of KIBSs influences performance. Firms that
   strategically coalign sourcing strategy with KIBS attributes for each
   KIBS activity should perform more effectively than firms that lack such
   a coalignment. After selecting an appropriate sourcing strategy, the
   firm's dynamic capabilities (i.e., absorptive capacity and integration
   capability) may accentuate or attenuate the performance of the strategy
   at the integrated KIBS system level. Thus, although managers may be
   tempted to source KIBSs globally to reduce labor costs, they must

AB Research on international marketing constructs, such as consumer
   ethnocentrism and country-of-origin effects, typically focuses on
   consumers' initial evaluations of foreign products but ignores
   consumers' emerging cross-border exchange relationships with foreign
   service providers. The influence of international marketing constructs
   on the development of these relationships also seems to be largely
   ignored. The authors call for new research on cross-border service
   relationships and integration of relationship marketing with
   international marketing models. They introduce an exploratory test and
   develop a research agenda that identifies several avenues for further
   research. The empirical test involves a study of German consumers who
   regularly cross the German-Dutch border to attend to their accounts with
   a foreign (i.e., Dutch) bank. Loyalty to the foreign financial service
   provider may be explained using substantive relational antecedents, such
   as satisfaction, trust, and value, and international marketing
   antecedents, such as consumer ethnocentrism and consumer beliefs about
   the industry. The results show that the international variables
   complement the relationship model. The authors discuss the managerial
   and research implications and provide avenues for further research.

AB Although there is a consensus that industries are globalizing, the
   notion that consumer attitudes and behaviors worldwide are likewise
   homogenizing remains disputed. Despite widespread discourse on this
   topic, there is a dearth of empirical investigations. This international
   research examines similarities and differences with respect to the
   nature of three consumer attitudinal dispositions: cosmopolitanism,
   consumer ethnocentrism, and materialism. The authors cross-culturally
   compare demographic antecedents with these dispositions, as well as
   behavioral outcomes. They test the validation of the construct measures
   and associated hypotheses using survey data drawn from consumers in
   eight countries and structural equation modeling techniques, including
   multigroup analysis. Empirical findings broadly support the
   cross-cultural applicability of the constructs, though the links to the
   various demographic antecedents vary considerably from sample to sample.
   The role of each construct on behavior also varies substantially across
   the range of product categories considered and across and between
   national groups.

AB A multinational corporation's (MNC's) competitive advantage depends
   increasingly on control over intangible resources, such as knowledge and
   relational capital. Although prior research has suggested that
   cross-border knowledge transfer in MNCs is critical to their new product
   outcomes, the conditions under which such knowledge transfer can serve
   to induce positive outcomes remain unclear. This study builds on
   resource-based theory to suggest that knowledge and MNC network strength
   are the two critical firm resources individually and collectively
   influencing new product outcomes. Because MNCs are subject to the
   pressures on various environmental changes, the authors rely on the
   contingency theory to examine when knowledge transfer works in
   differential global market and technological turbulence. The results of
   a survey of MNC headquarters show that the impacts of cross-border
   knowledge transfer on new product outcomes are not always positive,
   depending on the levels of network strength and environmental
   turbulence.

   types of marketing strategies work by examining the effects of both pure
   and dual strategies on financial performance for domestic versus foreign
   firms and across different market concentration levels in China's
   emerging economy. According to a survey of 249 firms, the effectiveness
   of specific strategy choices varies depending on domesticity and the
   level of market concentration, In Particular, the impacts of both cost
   and dual strategies on financial performance ore stronger for foreign
   firms than for domestic firms. Although cost-leadership and dual
   strategies are less effective in less concentrated markets than in more
   concentrated ones, the effect of a differentiation strategy is stronger
   when the level of market concentration is low rather than high.

   likelihood with a nomological net comprised of constructs derived from
   three theoretical streams in consumer behavior: consumer culture theory,
   signaling theory, and the associative network memory model. By
   integrating these diverse theories, the authors provide a conceptual
   framework, explaining the processes leading to consumers' attitudes
   toward and likelihood of purchasing global brands. Global brand
   authenticity cultural capital, and perceived brand globalness are
   constructs based mainly on consumer culture theory, and global brand
   credibility is borrowed from signaling theory. Global brand quality,
   social responsibility, prestige, and relative price are included as
   brand associations, deriving mainly from the associative network memory
   model. These constructs have direct and indirect effects on global brand
   attitude and global brand purchase likelihood, reflecting the
   three-dimensional belief-attitude-behavior model in consumer behavior.
   The authors also introduce self-construal and cosmopolitanism as two
   pertinent moderators of some of the model paths.

   ability to classify brands correctly according to their origin is

   COO identification is consumer ethnocentrism, with sociodemographics

   Norwegian exporting companies, the author analyzes relational drivers'
   effect on relationship quality between trading partners-namely,

   demonstrates the multifaceted effects of culture on consumer responses
   to service failures. A cross-cultural study involving American and
   Chinese participants in the setting of a computer repair service
   confirms seven of eight hypotheses derived from the resource preference
   model. The results indicate that Americans (versus Chinese) are more
   dissatisfied with an outcome failure but less dissatisfied with a
   process failure. This interactive effect of culture and failure type
   seems to be driven by a corresponding pattern of attribution tendencies
   across cultures. Not only do Americans and Chinese differ in service
   dissatisfaction, but they also tend to express their dissatisfaction in
   different ways, preferring voice and private responses, respectively.
   Overall, the resource preference model enhances theoretical
   understanding of cross-cultural consumer behavior and provides
   culture-specific guidelines for managing the inevitable service
   failures.

AB Multinational corporations' (MNCs) control over their foreign operations
   plays an important role in implementing their global marketing strategy.
   In the past, transaction cost analysis and bargaining power theory have
   been widely cited to explain the degree of control MNCs exert over their
   foreign operations. However, research explicitly combining these two
   perspectives has been limited. To address the gap in the literature, the
   authors present a joint model that combines the two alternative theories
   to explain MNCs' control, and they compare their relative explanatory
   power. Using primary survey data, they perform an empirical test of the
   relative explanatory power of these two theories. The results suggest
   that three factors, two drawn from bargaining power theory and one from
   transaction cost analysis, are key factors in explaining MNCs' degree of
   control over their foreign operations. The article concludes with a
   discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications.

AB Export manufacturers face challenges associated with intrafirm
   coordination among functional units and interfirm coordination with
   foreign distributors. The majority of research on export coordination
   examines intra- and interfirm coordination strategies separately.
   Consequently, limited insights have been gained into how export
   manufacturers combine the various intra- and interfirm coordination
   strategies to achieve export success. Using a cluster analysis, the
   authors incorporate both intra- and interfirm coordination strategies as
   inputs to identify profiles of export manufacturers. They identify four
   distinct profiles: balanced coordinators, interactive coordinators,
   flexibility only coordinators, and unfocused coordinators. The authors
   find that the best performers are balanced coordinators, or the export
   manufacturers that concurrently deploy multiple intra- and interfirm
   coordination strategies.

AB The authors find that U.S. consumers hold contradictory notions of what
   characterizes a global brand beyond its wide recognition, availability,
   and standardization across markets. In particular, they find that the
   association of brand globality with higher quality is not as strong as
   the literature has proposed and that affect directly influences how
   people perceive global brands. The initial results imply that previous
   research on globality effects may have confounded brand globality and
   brand strength and that the latter is responsible for the quality
   effect. A follow-up study shows that for most consumers, brand globality
   is associated with positive affect and that this affect is also
   reflected among consumers who are explicitly against global brands. The
   authors conclude that response to global brands is driven more by affect
   and less by cognition.

   The findings suggest that different dimensions of social capital are

   change. The roles include the efficacy role, the serendipity role, and
   the liability role of social capital. These three roles incorporate both
   the positive and the negative aspects of social capital. The liability
   role is the most frequently observed form of social capital to influence
   mode change. The most frequent type of mode change is toward a

AB Export performance has long been an issue of concern in the literature;
   however, there has been little research on managers' evaluations of
   their firms' performance in the presence of multiple export objectives.
   This study proposes a framework for understanding managerial assessments
   of export performance and illustrates its application using the analytic
   hierarchy process methodology. The framework explicitly acknowledges
   that the importance of different export objectives may differ both
   within and between firms and that the latter may also differ in terms of
   the frame of reference and/or time horizon used when assessing the
   attainment of objectives. Using this framework, the authors construct a
   composite index of assessed export performance that allows for valid
   interfirm comparisons. They use data from an online survey of 171
   exporting firms to demonstrate the application of the framework and the
   assessed export performance index in an empirical setting.

AB Substantial scholarly work has shed much light on the development of a
   contemporary global environment-namely, the phenomenon of born-global
   firms. These young entrepreneurial firms, which take on
   internationalization early in their evolution, are now found in large
   numbers in most economies, especially in smaller, saturated, developed
   markets. In this article, the authors advance some theoretical
   explanations regarding the behavior of these firms. In the current
   Australian case-based study, rather than engaging in a firm-level
   analysis, the authors focus on the attitudinal orientations of senior
   management in this new breed of internationally active firms. In
   contrast to an incremental approach, the authors offer a theoretical
   explanation that integrates the network perspective and resource-based
   view with international entrepreneurship. Their exploration of the
   managerial mind-set of these smaller born-global firms leads to the
   identification of four states of commitment to accelerated
   internationalization by top management. Delineating these states should
   assist managers in achieving their accelerated internationalization
   objectives. Any of the four attitudinal mind-sets facilitates
   internationalization, but the strategist state adopts a more benevolent,
   collaborative behavioral stance designed to preserve key relationships.
   The strategist also avoids the short-term orientation, competitiveness,
   and self-interest of the responder, the opportunist, and the
   experimentalist.

   develops and tests a theoretical model to delineate how e-commerce
   drivers affect export marketing strategy. The empirical findings suggest
   that internal e-commerce drivers (product online transferability and
   e-commerce assets) directly increase a firm's degree of promotion
   adaptation, enhance communication and distribution efficiencies,
   facilitate greater distribution support, and improve price
   competitiveness for export ventures. Furthermore, both internal and
   external e-commerce drivers (export market e-commerce infrastructure and
   demand for e-commerce) moderate the relationships between environmental
   factors and elements of export marketing strategy. Overall, the findings
   support incorporating e-commerce constructs into existing theory on
   export marketing strategy. The authors discuss theoretical and

AB Consumers make stereotypical associations between products and countries
   based on their perceptions of a country's know-how and reputation
   relative to the design, manufacturing, or branding of particular generic
   goods. When such associations are shared globally, they reflect product
   ethnicity, a concept that the authors empirically explore in this
   article. Operationalization of product ethnicity is based on
   country-product associations that consumers make with either a product
   or a country as the initial stimulus, resulting in a combined two-way
   measurement. The authors first investigate product ethnicity at an
   exploratory level across five survey countries for a large set of
   products and countries (Study 1). They identify what they term
   "context-centered association tendencies" because respondents tend to
   associate goods more closely with their own country. The authors then
   relate product ethnicity and context-centered association tendencies to
   the country-of-origin literature and test research hypotheses with a new
   set of countries (Study 2), comprising two collectivist cultures (China
   and Mexico) and two individualist cultures (Germany and the United
   States). Finally, Study 3 shows that consumers are more willing to buy
   product offerings that are congruent rather than noncongruent with
   product ethnicity.

AB Psychic distance, as described in the Uppsala internationalization
   model, is based on the impediments to information flows between a
   country market and a firm. The greater the impediments, the longer is
   the distance. The operationalization of psychic distance in empirical
   investigations is most commonly accomplished through the estimation of
   perceived "differences" between countries because it is argued that
   differences account for impediments to knowledge flows. However, this
   process is highly flawed. This article responds to the many calls for an
   improvement in the understanding and operationalization of psychic
   distance. It does so not only by holding to the original definition but
   also by accounting for wider measures than the differences between the
   firm's home country and the target country The author identifies 15
   variables from the literature and discusses the relationship between the
   variables and psychic distance. Using these variables, he constructs an
   index that measures psychic distance and then applies it to measure
   distances between 25 country combinations. Finally, he compares the
   results with actual exporter behavior. A close, negative correlation
   exists between the psychic distance index and firms' actual selection of
   export markets.

   greater understanding of the conversion of firm resources into
   exploitation and exploration capabilities and the influence of these
   firm capabilities on firm outcomes. Specifically, they theorize that
   marketing and technological resources provide a foundation for the
   establishment of exploitation and exploration capabilities,
   respectively, and that these dynamic capabilities influence the degree
   of product innovation and market performance. The theorized
   relationships, which the authors examine using a survey of 111 U.S.
   importers, indicate that marketing resources influence an importer's
   development of exploitation capabilities, whereas technological
   resources influence the development of exploration capabilities.
   Furthermore, the authors find that exploitation capabilities provide a
   foundation for the development of exploration capabilities. They also
   find that whereas exploitation capabilities are negatively related to
   the degree of product innovation, exploration capabilities positively
   influence both the degree of product innovation and market performance.

   requires researchers to investigate variables that go beyond those drawn

   these new variables may well provide further evidence of the
   determinants of service firms' entry mode choices. On the basis of 174
   entry decisions of service firms, this study's results support the
   necessity of including additional strategic variables that specifically
   address this complex phenomenon, a decision that is not always
   associated just with efficiency and value-based considerations but with
   strategic issues as well. In addition, some variables that are routinely
   used in studies of the manufacturing sector were not significant or

AB This study examines the question whether joint ventures or wholly owned
   subsidiaries are more likely to survive in the context of Japanese
   subsidiaries in China. The author suggests that the answer to this
   question depends on the time the subsidiary was established.
   Specifically, it is argued that joint ventures founded during the early
   stage of institutional reforms are more likely to survive than wholly
   owned subsidiaries set up at that time, and vice versa for subsidiaries
   established in the late phase of institutional reforms. The rationale
   for these propositions is that at the beginning of market-oriented
   reforms, contributions provided by local partners make shared ownership
   an optimal entry mode strategy, whereas a relatively stable regulatory
   framework in the late stage of institutional reforms enables the firm to
   realize benefits associated with sole ownership more efficiently.
   Empirical evidence supports both propositions.

AB This study uses cross-cultural samples from the United States and China
   to replicate previous empirical findings regarding the relationship
   among moral philosophies, moral intensity, and ethical decision making.
   The authors use a two-step structural equations modeling approach to
   analyze the measurement and structural models. The findings partially
   replicate those from previous studies and provide evidence that the
   measurement model is somewhat invariant across the two groups studied
   but the structural model is not. In addition, there is evidence that the
   relationship between personal moral philosophies (mainly relativism) and
   moral intensity varies across the two cultures. That is, whereas
   relativism is a significant predictor of moral intensity for the Chinese
   sample, it is not for the U.S. sample. However, idealism is a
   significant predictor of perceived moral intensity for both samples of
   marketing practitioners. Finally, perceived moral intensity is a
   significant, direct predictor of ethical judgments, and ethical
   judgments are a significant, direct predictor of behavioral intentions
   in both instances.

   distinct governance forms. Based on data from 129 relationships between
   U.S. manufacturers and foreign-based independent distributors, the
   empirical results show a differential effect of relationship structures
   on the use of control-based and norms-based governance. Furthermore, the
   results show that these governance forms have distinct performance

   as an individual difference variable, is as an explanatory variable for
   propensity to voice in the context of dissatisfactory marketplace
   experiences. They find that individualism has a positive effect on
   propensity to voice at the pancountry and intracountry levels and that
   self-confidence fully mediates the relationship between individualism

AB Recent international attention has been drawn to marketing opportunities
   in Asia and the important role of customer relationships in supplier
   performance. However, empirical research on industrial buying behavior
   in Asia is sparse, and the extant literature indicates that buyer
   behavior may differ in non-Western industrial marketing relationships.
   Drawing on transaction cost economics and relational exchange theory,
   the authors develop a model that provides new insights into how
   international supplier behaviors affect manufacturer trust-performance
   perceptions and their business share allocation in a Chinese-dominated
   business environment. The results from 340 industrial relationships
   indicate the significant role of communications and adaptations in
   relationship development. Moreover, trust in suppliers and their
   performance are equally important factors in a manufacturer's business
   share allocation. The study contributes to the generalizability of
   relationship marketing theory and practice through empirical evidence on
   the transferability of Western business concepts.

   suggest that approximately 70% of country choices can be explained by
   software market size and geographic distance alone. The findings also
   show that SMEs' entry priorities shift quickly from countries within a
   short geographic distance to countries with high purchasing power and at
   a greater geographic distance. The authors discuss relationships of
   these macrolevel factors and compare them with prior qualitative and

   cultural framework to theorize differences in the relationships between
   key firm resources. Specifically, they explore relationship resources
   (i.e., the influence of trust on commitment), knowledge resources (i.e.,
   the influence of information sharing on problem resolution), and their
   linkage (i.e., the influence of commitment on information sharing) both
   cross-culturally and interculturally from the perspective of Japanese
   and U.S. firms. The authors use a sample of Japanese and U.S. firms that
   report on their primary intra and intercultural business partners to
   test the hypotheses. The results indicate that national culture
   influences relationship resources (i.e., the relationship between trust
   and commitment) and the linkage of relationship resources to knowledge
   resources (i.e., the relationship between commitment and information
   sharing). The authors address implications for both academics and

   technology for IIM activities. Using a business-to-business context and
   a multiple-case-study approach, this article focuses on two main areas
   of study: (1) the critical examination of the literature and
   identification of the most important factors that have a significant
   influence on business-to-business IIM and (2) the first-hand
   verification of how the identified factors are implemented in various
   organizational contexts.

AB International animosity significantly affects the purchase of foreign
   products. However, domestic conflicts are also rampant in many
   countries, giving rise to similar issues. October 2000 marked the
   beginning of the second Arab Intifada (uprising) in Israel. In contrast
   to the first Intifada of the late 1980s and early 1990s, this time,
   Israeli Arabs joined the Palestinians in violent demonstrations in
   Israeli locations with large Arab concentrations. This research studies
   Jewish Israelis' reactions to Arab Israelis in the context of purchases
   and consumption of products and services produced or marketed by Arab
   Israelis, It examines animosity, its antecedents, and its consumption
   consequences within the large Jewish majority of the population in
   Israel. The authors find that dogmatism, nationalism, and
   internationalism affect animosity, which in turn predicts willingness to
   buy and actual changes in purchase behavior for goods and services
   produced or marketed by Israeli Arabs. In contrast to previous research,
   animosity also predicts product judgments.

AB This study reports the results of a survey of executives of subsidiaries
   of Japanese and U.S. firms operating in the European Union (EU). The
   fundamental issues addressed are the degree to which firms perceive EU
   national markets as similar, the degree to which firms use standardized
   advertising across the EU, and firms' reasons for standardizing
   advertising. Global marketing strategy theory contends that firms are
   more likely to follow a strategy if the environment is conducive to that
   strategy, suggesting that greater convergence of EU markets would lead
   to greater standardization of advertising. The findings of this study
   indicate that both Japanese and U.S. managers still note obstacles to
   the standardization of advertising in the EU. Consistent with global
   marketing strategy theory, overall levels of standardization of
   advertising are somewhat moderate. Firms in the United States are
   slightly more likely than Japanese firms to use a standardized
   advertising strategy in the EU. In addition, U.S. firms tend to put
   greater emphasis on the creation of a uniform brand image, whereas
   managers from both countries value cost savings. Japanese firms value
   the higher level of central control that can emanate from
   standardization.

   rates. The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications of

   effects of industry- and firm-level variables on the first-mover
   advantages and effective follower strategies in an emerging-market
   context. Using hierarchical regressions, the authors analyze a large
   data set of foreign investors in China. Contingency models that include
   the interactions of entry order with the moderating variables have
   better fit of the data than the main-effect models. Industry growth and
   competition, firm size, entry mode, resource commitment, and marketing
   intensity have significant moderating effects on first-mover advantages.
   After the authors correct for multicollinearity bias using ridge
   regression, it seems that pioneers still enjoy a small advantage in
   market share but not in profitability, indicating a trade-off between
   the two. Furthermore, followers may augment performance by increasing
   resource commitment and marketing intensity. These findings have
   significant implications for entry-order strategies and for improving
   foreign direct investment performance in foreign markets; they also
   suggest meaningful directions for further research.

   construct, which, in some literature, is called guanxi. A key aspect of
   this research is that the authors investigate the impact of each
   dimension of guanxi on salesperson trust separately. Moreover, the
   authors consider the buying firm's trust in the supplying firm and its

AB Rapid new product developments (NPDs) have drastically changed the
   competitive landscape in the global economy. Because the time-to-market
   dimension of product introduction has become a crucial determinant of
   multinational corporations' (MNCs') competitive advantage, the ability
   of MNCs to exploit their knowledge globally across subsidiaries using
   cross-teams has become an important source of competitive advantage.
   Recognizing the crucial role of MNCs' knowledge management in NPD, the
   authors develop a conceptual framework to investigate the antecedents
   and outcomes of international knowledge acquisition at the cross-team
   level. The framework suggests that though it is important to acquire
   necessary knowledge resources for NPD, managers must nurture an NPD
   project team's realized absorptive capacity to transform the acquired
   knowledge resources into NPD capabilities, which in turn affect new

   performance, (2) annual export venture strategic performance, (3) annual
   export venture achievement, (4) contribution of the export venture to
   annual exporting operations, and (5) satisfaction with annual export
   venture overall performance. The authors use the APEV scale to generate
   a scorecard of performance in exporting (the PERFEX scorecard) to assess
   export performance at the corporate level while comparatively evaluating
   all export ventures of the firm. Both the scale and the scorecard could
   help disclose export venture performance and could be useful instruments
   for annual planning, management, monitoring, and improvement of

AB Despite the growing importance of service exports in the world economy,
   there is limited research into the unique success factors in this
   sector. This article reports the key lessons from 17 Australian
   exporters of knowledge-based services (e.g., market research, legal,
   advertising, engineering) that conduct business in Southeast Asia. The
   authors selected the cases in accordance with Patterson and Cicic's
   (1995) classification scheme, which recognizes key differences across
   service types. Analysis of the data shows that though there are some
   common success factors across service types, services characterized by
   high tangibility on the one hand and low tangibility on the other hand
   derived additional success factors on the basis of their tangible and
   intangible assets, respectively, Furthermore, the performance of firms
   with high face-to-face contact during service manufacturing and delivery
   was enhanced by personnel-related factors. This suggests a "contingency
   guide" to knowledge-based service exports.

   emergence of global companies, the use of marketing programs in these
   firms has become increasingly important. This research examines global
   marketing program-related factors, their drivers, and their performance
   consequences. The global marketing program, as the authors conceptualize
   it, consists of three key factors: global marketing strategy, global
   marketing structure, and global marketing processes. The authors develop
   and test an empirical model to portray the application of the global
   marketing program factors with respect to product standardization and
   product processes. As such, global customer convergence and leadership's
   global orientation have significant, positive effects on global product
   standardization and global marketing structure. The authors find that
   global product standardization and global marketing structure drive the
   implementation of global product processes, which ore positively related
   to marketing performance.

   statistically identical across the countries. Tests of hypotheses
   related to performance of firms in the Asian samples produced results
   that are qualitatively similar to a previous study of five industrial

   different. In particular, the significant effect of market orientation
   on performance is greater in Asia, whereas the similarly significant

AB Many tenets of cross-border governance arrangements are broad-brush
   projections of domestic findings. To explore such generalizations, this
   study uses data from a large set of U.S. based manufacturers to
   formulate and test propositions about limiting the potential
   opportunistic behavior of foreign distributors. The findings challenge
   two generalizations about governance arrangements in the cross-border
   context. The first is that a manufacturer is often handicapped
   disproportionately by its level of brand and scale prominence. Formal
   contracts as prescribed by transaction cost analysis, though negatively
   related to opportunism, do not have a significant effect on the
   alleviation of foreign distributor opportunism. The second
   generalization is that the joint use of trust and formal contracts is
   not significantly associated with opportunism. Trust and formal
   contracts serve different purposes. Trust makes the relationship
   function, and contracts institute and legitimize it. Furthermore,
   previous studies investigate opportunism in isolation, whereas this
   study points to the influence of legal hostility on the management of
   opportunism in the export market.

AB This article presents a newly developed survey-based method for the
   measurement of customer-based brand equity in a cross-national context.
   The proposed national brand equity (NBE) model decomposes customer-based
   brand equity into two components: measured and unmeasured brand equity.
   Whereas the measured component of brand equity identifies the
   effectiveness of individual benefit associations across the globe, the
   unmeasured component captures the value that is attached to the brand
   but not measured by the commonly elicited associations. The author
   applies the NBE model to 18 brands across 16 worldwide automobile
   markets, which provides opportunities for assessing the applicability of
   the proposed model. Furthermore, in response to the trend of increasing
   brand globalization, the author develops a model of global brand equity
   to assess a brand's value relative to that of its global competitors.
   Based on the NBE model, the global brand equity model incorporates
   national weighting factors in the aggregation of NBE across countries.
   The resultant aggregation yields a global brand equity index, which
   provides practical applications for benchmarking against the best brand
   and serves as a good indicator of a brand's relative value in the global
   market.

   dimensions are (1) satisfaction with short-term performance improvement,
   (2) short-term exporting intensity improvement, and (3) expected

   reliability as well as convergent, discriminant, and nomological

   in their prior motivations and capabilities. The main findings are that
   many attributes of the born-global model also characterize firms
   that-began their internationalization along traditional lines but were
   radically transformed in the process of achieving global reach. This
   study identifies the consequences of rapid international growth,
   referred to as "the gusher," among these firms and the destabilizing
   effects of the experience as the firm is taken in unexpected directions.
   The authors conclude that the born-global model has much in common with
   the internationalization of small entrepreneurial firms and that its
   most distinctive elements lie in the model's relevance to an
   increasingly globalized world economy and in the more aggressive
   learning strategies that are required to follow this path.

   relationships between each NATID scale component (national heritage,
   cultural homogeneity, belief system, and consumer ethnocentrism) and
   overall national identity for invariance across two different Russian
   age cohorts: Soviet Russians and contemporary Russians. Soviet Russians
   reached their "age of socialization" when the Soviet Union was intact,
   whereas contemporary Russians achieved their age of socialization during
   the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras. The results indicate a lack of
   invariance across age cohorts in the relationship between all the
   subconstructs, with the exception of national heritage, and overall
   national identity. As a result, researchers should consider that the
   relationship between components of the NATID scale and overall national
   identity is likely to vary in strength across groups in the same
   country. This insight is significant for firms that conduct market
   research, introduce products, and develop marketing strategies for

AB In a recession economy, consumers tend to be more sensitive about price,
   and firms have difficulty obtaining necessary resources for effective
   pricing. However, previous studies into pricing appear to overlook the
   possible effect of economic environment on the effectiveness of a
   pricing strategy. By observing the current recession and the resultant
   price war in Asian countries, the authors examine marketing decisions by
   retailers in a recession economy. The authors propose a contingent
   model, based on organizational resources and consumer price
   consciousness, to guide-the examination of the strategy-performance
   bond. The results show that only resource-abundant retailers are able to
   use strategies proposed in this study to thrive in a recession. A
   value-centric strategy outperforms all other approaches.

AB This study addresses how managers' perceived familiarity with local
   markets develops during a period of entry or expansion. The authors
   derive different predictions of how foreign-market familiarity changes
   during periods of entry from the internationalization process
   literature. They then subject the predictions to an empirical
   examination, using a data set that covers foreign business operations as
   reported by managers of international firms from small, open economies
   (Denmark, Sweden, and New Zealand). In addition to addressing these
   predictions, the empirical study gives insight into the incidence and
   character of "shock effects" in foreign-market entries. The effects are
   evident in managers' inclination to underestimate differences between
   the home and host countries in terms of business environments. The data
   support the supposition that, in general, managers of entrant firms
   experience these shock effects. For example, the authors find the lowest
   level of market familiarity among managers of entrant firms that are in
   the eighth year after entry or initiation of foreign-market expansion.
   The company data indicate that, in general, managers of entrant firms
   experience shock effects in relation to entry into adjacent but not into
   distant countries. Thus, the hypothesis of the psychic-distance paradox
   that the authors Put forward is supported. Entrant firms also
   experience, shock effects with respect to the acquisition of tacit
   rather than explicit knowledge; furthermore, the data suggest that shock
   effects befall producers of customized products but not producers of
   standardized products.

   authors postulate that the field of international marketing has already
   and can continue to make major contributions to the improvement of

   sake of a renaissance of the field: (1) remember the roots and purpose
   of the field, (2) resist the temptations of overspecialization, (3) work
   with a new paradigm and new methods, (4) look to the world, (5) maintain
   the dialogue with all possible constituents, (6) work also with those
   who place or show, and (7) profess expertise.

AB As a transitional economy, Vietnam is open to many new marketing
   experiences. Along with slowly increasing wealth, changes are occurring
   in the retail environment as stores begin to replace individual vendors.
   The changing retail environment suggests the usefulness of understanding
   shopping behaviors relevant to retail settings. The authors examine
   impulse buying behaviors of urban consumers in Vietnam. The authors
   conducted an exploratory study that included both qualitative and
   quantitative methods to provide a general understanding of urban
   Vietnamese consumers' impulse buying behaviors. Results show that
   individualism, age, and income are significantly related to impulse
   buying behaviors of Vietnamese consumers. In addition, personal-use
   products are the most common impulse purchase items, despite the
   collectivist nature of consumers in Vietnam. The authors' findings
   suggest that, at least with respect to impulse buying and despite
   cultural differences, consumers from transitional economies such as
   Vietnam may share some common tendencies and behaviors with consumers in
   advanced economies. The authors discuss other observations and conclude
   with suggestions for further research.

   an important issue faced by multinational managers and has been the

   studies have examined the intricacies of this issue, and thus there is
   little guidance for academics or practitioners. This study empirically
   examines the influence of four factors-market similarity, process
   standardization, environmental similarity, and mode of entry-on two
   elements of promotion standardization: advertising message and
   packaging. The authors test the hypotheses with both quantitative and
   qualitative data from U.S. multinational corporations conducting
   business in the emerging market of India. Results indicate that the four
   antecedent factors have different effects on advertising message and

AB In the People's Republic of China (PRC), consumers have recently shown a
   tendency to shift away from foreign products in preference for local
   offerings. Some commentators have speculated that this new market
   phenomenon is a result of government intervention, consumer
   ethnocentrism, and improvement in the quality of local products. In this
   study, the authors offer an alternative reason, which pertains to the
   fading symbolic value of foreign products in the PRC market. To provide
   support for their argument, Zhou and Hui present the results of a study
   of Chinese consumption behaviors involving a foreign, inconspicuous
   product item (Canadian pork sausage). By using such a privately consumed
   item, the authors attempt to demonstrate that symbolic benefits (such as
   modernity, prestige, and associations with foreign lifestyles)
   constitute one of the primary motivating forces of PRC consumers'
   purchases of products of nonlocal origin, including products that may
   not be commonly regarded as conspicuous. The results challenge the
   conventional wisdom that improvement in the qualify of local products is
   the main cause of the decreasing competitiveness of foreign products in
   the PRC. The authors also discuss implications for global marketers with
   respect to market adaptation and positioning strategies in the PRC.

   internal and external factors, extent of standardization, program and
   process, performance, and home-host/intermarket scenarios are included

   the study relies on the experiences of 146 Australian and New Zealand
   firms operating in the Greater China markets. Factors identified as
   significantly related to the selection of standardized marketing
   strategies in the home-host scenario include product type, consumer
   behavior, marketing infrastructure, political environment, and firm
   size. Factors suggested by the multivariate regression analysis as
   significantly related to standardized strategies in the intermarket
   scenario are product type, international business experience,
   competitive environment, political and legal aspects, and firm size. For

   for market information and marketing technology for the international
   neophyte firm. However, aware that their intermediary role can become
   redundant over time, ITIs may adopt survival strategies that are
   suboptimal from the manufacturer's point of view. This article
   identifies the catalytic and sometimes ambiguous role of ITIs in the

AB The authors attempt to identify the types of marketing strategies that
   Korean marketers employ in China and investigate the strategies'
   relationships with market performance. The authors expect Korean
   marketing strategies in China to differ from those of Western
   multinational corporations. Data were collected from surveys of managers
   of 86 Korean firms. The results identify four groups of firms with
   distinctive marketing strategies, including firms pursuing a
   localization strategy, those emphasizing product competitiveness, those
   pursuing a medium price-quality positioning strategy, and those
   passively selling quality products at high prices. In addition, the
   analysis suggests that Korean firms emphasizing product competitiveness
   have superior market performance, whereas firms pursuing localization
   show poor performance. Conversely, Korean firms pursuing the medium
   price-quality positioning strategy with an emphasis on value for money
   exhibit moderately good performance. Finally, the authors also discuss
   managerial implications pertaining to appropriate marketing strategies
   and tactics for Korean marketers.

AB Firms in South Korea and Japan are designing and introducing new
   products to global markets, contributing to their strong export-led
   economic growth. To better understand how Korean and Japanese firms are
   succeeding, the authors conducted a study on new product development.
   They surveyed product developers in both countries about how strategic,
   organizational, and process factors influence new product performance
   (NPP). The authors learned that the determinants of NPP are interrelated
   and that the new product development process itself is central, namely
   the stages of initiation and implementation. These two stages directly
   determine NPP, though initiation appears to be more important. The
   stages are strengthened by factors such as customer orientation,
   cross-functional integration, and new product team proficiency, however,
   the effects are not uniform. Although the model and hypotheses are
   largely supported, indicating that, in general, they describe South
   Korean and Japanese new product development, the authors found a few
   differences between the countries.

AB The Chinese market's attractiveness to international marketers has
   recently received a significant boost as a result of the country's
   admission into the World Trade Organization. Membership in the World
   Trade Organization requires trade barriers to be reduced and new sectors
   of the economy to be opened to foreign firms according to a
   predesignated timetable, which in turn will make this most populous
   country a promising market for marketers. Despite these positive
   developments, acquiring reliable information and, in particular, the
   understanding of the market presents big challenges to the development
   of a viable Chinese marketing strategy. In this article, the authors
   explore barriers to information acquisition in China and focus on the
   need to understand crucial dimensions of the operating environment with
   respect to internal protectionism, relationship development, the
   diversity of the market, and competitive contexts.

   marketing clothes across racial, cultural, and religious borders.
   Changes in market trends and consumer demands have required the Italian
   company to redevelop its manufacturer and retail processes in order to
   remain competitive in the growing market. Renowned for using social
   issue-themed pictures to promote its brand, Benetton's campaigns have
   resulted in increasing legal and ethical concerns, and world courts have
   now been asked to define further the line between artistic expression
   and exploitation. The author discusses the legal action taken against

   different consumer responses to Benetton's unique campaigns with respect
   to changes in global politics and more frequent acts of terrorism. The

AB This study focuses on how small exporting firms use the Internet in
   their international marketing activities. The authors conducted six case
   studies of software firms. The software sector has several notable
   features: It is one of the world's fastest-growing industries, its
   products can be distributed electronically, and software companies are
   "Internet literate." This study's findings suggest that most firms use
   the Internet to search for information about customers, distributors,
   and partners. The Internet does not replace personal sales; most firms
   reported a rather complex purchasing process and an extensive need for
   communication with customers before the purchase decision. The authors
   found standardized products to be most suited for Internet-based sales;
   however, standardization reduced firms' competitive advantage and profit
   margins. Software firms' most significant use of the Internet was for
   postsales service and support activities'. these activities both
   generated revenue and improved customer relations. Partnership
   agreements with well-known firms, positive product reviews, and image
   building through the Internet were important to most firms in order to
   reduce the uncertainty that potential customers often experience when
   unknown suppliers offer unfamiliar products. The authors also discuss
   implications for managers in industrial sectors other than software.

AB Even though the transaction costs framework has evolved considerably in
   the past decade, there is still only modest empirical knowledge about
   the governance performance implications of the theory. This article
   focuses on the governance performance of vertical coordination in
   relationships between manufacturing firms. On the basis of transaction
   cost analysis and related works in international marketing, the authors
   examine the impact of asset specificity and vertical coordination on ex
   post transaction costs in domestic and international buyer-seller
   relationships. In accordance with current literature in international
   marketing, performance measurement problems are expected to be more
   evident in international business trade than in domestic
   business-to-business relationships. The empirical findings show that
   under conditions with substantial asset specificity, vertical
   coordination reduces ex post transaction significantly more in
   international buyer-seller relationships than in domestic channel dyads.

   relationships) with manufacturing firms on both sides of the dyad. The
   analysis is based on data from 511 industrial customers from the United
   States and Germany, 201 of which reported on a transnational
   relationship. The results indicate that quality and flexibility are
   important antecedents Of customer satisfaction. These antecedents were
   significantly lower in transnational relationships than in domestic
   ones. Using equity theory and the confirmation/disconfirmation paradigm,
   the authors develop alternative models for describing the relationships
   between customer satisfaction and its antecedents in transnational as
   opposed to domestic relationships. The findings reveal that there are no
   structural differences between transnational and domestic relationships
   regarding the relationships between customer satisfaction and its
   antecedents. Specifically, a lower level of customer satisfaction in
   transnational relationships is due to lower levels of the antecedents
   and does not constitute an effect of transnationality per se.

AB The author investigates the standardization/adaptation issue in
   international advertising from an organizational perspective,
   introducing two variables: knowledge of local market conditions at the
   center (exporter/headquarters level) and headquarters' influence on
   local marketing decisions. The author interviewed 150 Norwegian
   exporters by mail on their experience in this respect. The results
   reveal that the two dimensions indeed have some impact on how firms
   develop their international marketing strategies. Knowledge of local
   market conditions seems to play an overriding role, leading to a more
   standardized approach by firms. Not surprisingly, centralized decision
   power seems to lead to more negative reactions at the intermediary
   level. In contrast, firms that have a more relaxed stance on the
   standardization issue and leave the marketing decisions to the local
   representatives seem to have better relations with these representatives
   than do other firms. The author discusses implications for global brand
   management and research.

   that facilitate brand name memory. The authors examine the integration
   in memory of auditory and visual brand identifiers with brand names
   written in the logographic Chinese script compared with the alphabetic
   English script. The first experiment compares native Mandarin speakers
   living in China with native English speakers living in the United
   States. The second experiment examines bilingual Cantonese-English
   speakers living in Hong Kong. The results of the experiments suggest
   that visual brand identifiers are integrated in memory more easily with
   Chinese brand names, whereas auditory brand identifiers are integrated
   in memory more easily with English brand names. These results are of
   theoretical interest because they demonstrate that writing systems
   affect cognitive processes that are involved in the integration of words
   with nonverbal information. The results are of practical interest
   because they suggest that the relative success of auditory and visual
   brand identity strategies is affected by differences in writing systems.

   should be customer focused in terms of stressing resources,
   capabilities, and performance that are most important to the private
   sector and to other stakeholders. Although this requires a balancing
   act, it will help ensure successful public/private partnerships,
   performance outcomes that are customer driven, and planning and policy
   oversight that is performance based. The authors investigate the
   relative importance and availability of supply chain capabilities and
   performance measures for more than 3500 firms in three global regions:
   North America, Europe, and the Pacific Basin. The authors present
   additional analyses for best-practice firms that score the highest on an
   excellence index. The study finds that public policy-enabled customer
   service or, more broadly, demand-oriented performance capabilities may
   confer greater competitive advantages than cost- and supply-oriented
   performance capabilities, though both are important. The study findings
   have important implications for international public policy, such as
   trade policies, and for linking policy priorities with private sector
   requirements for specific capabilities, resources, and performance. The
   authors discuss additional managerial implications and recommendations
   for the integration of international marketing and global supply chain
   strategies with supporting marketing capabilities of standardization,
   adaptation, or customization and for governmental planning, policy
   formulation, and data availability.

AB The continuing globalization of marketing activities has given
   considerable impetus to the study of cosmopolitanism as a consumer
   construct. Most recent research has focused on the normative activities
   of cosmopolites, as consumers who seek to broaden their cultural
   horizons by immersing themselves in a breadth of local cultural
   experiences. Although this is true of some cosmopolites in some
   circumstances, it is not a general characteristic. The authors return to
   the original meaning of cosmopolitanism as presented (independently) by
   Merton and Gouldner in the late 1950s, examining the concept in light of
   subsequent research and the social forces that have tended to promote an
   increasingly cosmopolitan perspective. They then propose several
   patterns of cosmopolitan behavior, only one of which is a normative
   search for culturally broadening experiences. Finally, they suggest some
   managerial implications for marketing practitioners.

   (1) whether the Pattern of brand image dimensionality is similar across
   international markets and (2) how cohesive a brand image perception is
   in a global market. Results from a 20-country, 70-region study provide
   concrete evidence that supports the applicability of the proposed
   benefit-based multidimensional image structure that corresponds to
   consumers' sensory, utilitarian, and symbolic and economic need at both
   the global and the national level. On the basis of the identified image
   dimensions, the author proposes an alternative approach to measuring the
   degree of global brand image cohesiveness as an indicator of brand
   globalization. Global brand image cohesiveness is calculated on the
   basis of the summation of Euclidean distances between the column score
   of image dimensions of the home country (i.e., initial market) and that
   of foreign countries. Furthermore, nations are clustered on the basis of
   these column scores, and the resultant clusters correspond approximately
   to groups of countries that share similar levels of economic
   development, cultural dimension, or geographic distance, which suggests
   that national characteristics affect brand image perceptions. The
   findings provide implications for the practice of global brand image
   management.

AB Over the past decade, several studies have questioned the stage models
   of the internationalization process. Many of these studies concentrate
   on the exporting versus nonexporting factor, identifying an increasing
   number of firms that are active in international markets shortly after
   establishment. Limited empirical evidence exists as to whether this
   actuality indicates simply a reduced time factor in the preexport phase
   or an important change in the export behavior of firms. Using small and
   medium-sized exporting firms from Norway, Denmark, and France, the
   authors focus on the concept of gradual development. The results suggest
   that export intensity, distribution, market selection, and global
   orientation are not influenced by the firm's year of establishment or
   first year of exporting activity. One-third of the firms sampled
   reported that the time period between establishment and export
   commencement was less than two years. In terms of export intensity,
   these firms outperform those that waited several years before exporting.
   The results indicate that the future export involvement of a firm is, to
   a large extent, influenced by its behavior shortly after establishment.
   The results further indicate that the development of resources in
   support of international market competitiveness may be regarded as the
   key issue and that the basic resources and competencies of the firm are
   determined during the establishment phase. The authors review how the
   management challenges differ depending on the type of firm (age and
   export involvement) in question.

AB Recent export studies have focused on the internal/controllable
   determinants of export performance. The external/uncontrollable
   determinants of export performance have received scant research
   attention. In this study, the authors examine two key
   external/uncontrollable factors, namely, industry concentration and firm
   location, in the context of Chinese manufacturing firms. In addition,
   the authors include several frequently studied factors such as firm
   size, capital intensity, technology innovation, and industry in the
   analysis as covariates. On the basis of logistical regression and
   multiple regression analysis, the authors find that both domestic market
   concentration and firm location are potent predictors of Chinese firms'
   export propensity and export intensity. The authors discuss implications
   of the findings to expose the reason behind the success of Chinese
   exporters in international markets.

   international strategic alliances. Theoretical foundations are drawn
   from resource dependency and social exchange theories as frameworks for
   the analysis of interdependency. The model is tested in the context of
   U.S.-Mexican strategic alliances. The results of this study show that
   trust and commitment assist in building interdependency between both
   partners and perceived structural dependency is a prerequisite to
   maintain and develop social dynamics in the relationship. Trust is built
   mainly on economic and strategic cooperation for U.S. managers whereas
   Mexican managers perceive social and affective dimensions as its driving
   forces. Both U.S. and Mexican managers perceive commitment to the
   relationship as supported on high levels of trust. The authors discuss
   the implications of these results for the management of the relationship
   and building interdependency from a cultural perspective.

AB Brands are powerful symbols that reflect not only the image with which
   marketers hope to imbue them but also the cultural milieu in which they
   are imbedded. If that milieu is in a state Of flux, brands can come to
   represent some surprising ideas and values to which marketing efforts
   must be sensitive. In this research, the authors relate the nature Of
   societal change, a common occurrence in many developing markets and
   especially China, to evaluation of a brand by a broad cross-section of
   urban Chinese consumers. Using the methodology of scenario completion,
   the authors reveal that the McDonald's brand is evaluated in the context
   Of societal norms and values that are brought up in various usage
   situations. Brand evaluations can be inconsistent and often paradoxical
   depending on the context. The results suggest that marketers should be
   closely involved with the way their brand is interacting with cultural
   values in transitional markets.

   institutional factors as another motive for distributor commitment in
   channel relationships. Specifically, the authors suggest that long-term
   orientation is an essential institutional environment to consider for a
   comparative study of distributor commitment. The authors hypothesize
   that distributor commitment is driven by both task environmental factors
   and institutional factors. The authors conduct national surveys of
   industrial distributors in the United States and Japan to test the
   hypotheses. The hypothesis test results indicate that task environmental
   factors are related significantly to distributor commitment regardless
   of the channel contexts and that the effect of an institutional factor
   varies across the channel contexts.

AB Brands represent the most valuable asset that many firms possess, and
   the associated brand equity is usually the result of years of
   development efforts. Yet many brands are becoming increasingly
   threatened by the worldwide phenomenon of brand counterfeiting, whereby
   imitations of the brand are sold to unwary consumers as the original.
   Counterfeits are known to flourish especially in developing countries
   that have weak legal infrastructures and corruptible public officials.
   What can a company do in the face of this threat? The authors summarize
   the literature that addresses this issue and provide an in-depth
   description of how one company addressed the threat of counterfeits in a
   lucrative developing market. The case illustrates the lengths companies
   may need to go to respond to counterfeits and raises many issues in
   relation to these actions.

   harmonious relationships are more experienced, employ more people, and
   exhibit more active behavior toward conducting their foreign business.
   Such firms sell to a greater number of export markets, deal with more

   findings and argue that there is evidence that countries are moving
   toward global norms in trademark protection. However, an international

   Motivations are categorized into three dimensions: efficiency,

   The authors collected data from Japanese, Korean, and U.S. partners of

   the model and examine cross-national differences using a multigroup
   comparison method. The results suggest a complex relationship among
   motivation, control, and performance. More control over joint ventures
   in China is beneficial to foreign partners, but the ability to exert
   control is influenced by firms' strategic intentions and familiarity
   with the local culture and market. Foreign partners that have such
   familiarity can exert considerable control over joint ventures and still
   obtain local knowledge. Foreign partners that want to enhance
   competitiveness can apply their advanced skills and technology in
   research and development, production, and management to exert more
   control over these functional areas.

AB Developing effective international joint ventures (IJVs) is critical for
   firms entering economies in transition, such as Kazakhstan. The
   resource-based view of the firm forms the foundation to examine the
   influence of knowledge transfer between IJV partners. Traditionally, the
   transfer of knowledge between IJV partners has been theorized to lessen
   dependence, increasing IJV instability. However, the relationship
   development literature indicates that the exchange of assets between
   partners can strengthen relationship ties, enhancing IJV stability. The
   authors use a sample of 87 matched dyads from two-party IJVs formed in
   Kazakhstan to examine the influence of knowledge transfer between IJV
   partners on commitment and resulting satisfaction. The results,
   supportive of relationship development theory, indicate that
   Kazakhstan-foreign IJVs with higher levels of knowledge transfer
   resulted in higher levels of firms' commitment to and satisfaction with
   their relationships, thus supporting a relationship development
   perspective of knowledge transfer. The authors address implications for

AB Formulating a strategy to compete effectively in international markets
   is one of the major challenges a firm faces. The authors provide insight
   into how automobile firms devise strategies that respond to the
   conflicting pressures for local responsiveness and integration in the
   context of Western Europe, where Japanese automobile firms compete with
   European-based manufacturers. The authors develop a conceptual framework
   to test integration-responsiveness in terms of marketing-mix responses
   and market conditions, using data that cover four major European markers
   (73% of Western European sales) and a critical period in European
   integration. The findings indicate that Japanese firms are successfully
   pursuing standardization strategies rather than fully combining
   integration and responsiveness. These firms competitively adapt to
   limited differences between markers, and this strategy appears to be
   quite successful compared with the European firms' strategies of
   combining integration and responsiveness. The European strategy appears
   to undermine the ability to respond to Japanese firms' targeted
   competitive moves, despite the presence of significant barriers to
   Japanese exports. Whereas Japanese firms were able to maintain market
   share, European firms' market shares decreased over the three-year
   period examined.

   marketing strategies, particularly pricing strategies. However, few
   studies focus on the pricing practices of export firms, which makes it
   difficult to understand whether the same pricing strategies apply across
   markets, particularly in emerging markets. Using a framework of price
   complexity, the authors examine and compare the cost variables that are
   factored into price (price complexity) by export firms in the United
   States and Korea. The authors also investigate and compare some
   important noncost factors that influence pricing decisions for exporters
   in both their domestic and international markets, The results show that
   firms from the United States, a developed market, tend to factor more
   cost variables into price than do firms from an emerging market such as
   Korea. On the basis of the results of the study, the authors discuss

AB The authors develop a transaction cost model of the circumstances in
   which small, knowledge-intensive firms switch from the channel they use
   in the domestic market to a different channel in a foreign market. The
   authors argue that the domestic channel is frequently extended into a
   foreign market to gain economies of scale, because product
   characteristics are generally similar and because of strategic momentum.
   In knowledge-intensive sectors, integrated channels predominate in both
   domestic and foreign markets. Integrated channels facilitate the
   protection of knowledge-based assets and high levels of interaction with
   customers. However, firms may switch to a less-integrated mode in a
   foreign market if asset specificity is relatively low, as a response to
   environmental diversity, and when the market makes a small contribution
   to overall sales. Data gathered through a disk-by-mad survey of the
   export channel choices of Canadian software developers generally support
   these propositions. The authors make a contribution to the literature by
   rephrasing the channel selection decision so that the conditions under
   which firms switch modes are emphasized, thus linking the choice of
   modes in a foreign market to experience in the domestic market. The
   authors suggest that managers need to be aware of the momentum created
   by domestic channels and fully evaluate alternatives before extending
   existing channels into or foreign market. The results help identify
   conditions under which an international channel strategy that is

AB In an era of intense global competition, firms realize that the
   effective use of global sourcing contributes significantly to their
   market performance. Increasingly, successful firms use a higher level of
   strategic alliance-based global sourcing for major components by
   cooperating with their suppliers, even when highly specific assets are
   involved. This phenomenon is contradictory to the recommendation of
   transaction cost analysis, in which global internal sourcing should be
   used by firms when asset specificity is involved. Through the
   integration of different perspectives, the author examines variables
   that may influence buyer firms to rely more on strategic alliance-based
   global sourcing for major components when highly specific assets are
   involved. In addition, the author suggests that strategic alliance-based
   global sourcing when highly specific assets are deployed may enhance a
   firm's competitive advantage through the combination of resources in
   unique ways, This article is intended to increase managers' awareness of
   the strategic benefits that arise from outsourcing through partnerships
   with their suppliers.

AB "Pricing is the moment of truth." This phrase is especially valid for
   international pricing. As most markets reach saturation, communication
   technologies such as the Internet lead to more transparency, retail
   price maintenance disappears, and product life cycles become shorter
   firms will find it increasingly difficult to establish and maintain
   price differences across markets. Given their power, pricing issues have
   attracted little research interest compared with other marketing tools.
   The author aims to shed more light on the process of industrial
   exporters' international pricing practices. On the basis of a series of
   45 qualitative interviews with seasoned international business
   executives from five different industries, the author describes common
   "best practices." Along with insights gained from the available
   literature, these linkages are tied to a conceptual framework. As the
   information comes from experienced, internationally active firms from a
   European Union country, findings are indicative for other European Union
   countries.

   positioning strategy differs from the content of its home market
   strategy. The research is significant for two reasons: (1) It uses a
   more comprehensive and rigorous definition and measurement of firm
   strategy than previous adaptation research, and (2) it systematically
   measures the magnitude and direction of the adaptation. Previous
   research has concentrated only on the need to adapt. This approach opens
   up an entirely new debate about what patterns of adaptation should be
   expected. The author uses a large-scale survey of Australian exporters
   to test the emerging hypotheses, which are strongly supported,
   Domestically based Australian exporters tend to have a narrower focus
   and rely more heavily on operations-based differentiation in foreign
   markets.

AB The objective of this article is to identify the major determinants of
   trust in the context of industrial buying behavior among ethnic Chinese
   buyers and sellers in Malaysia. The authors adopt the dyadic approach to
   examine empirically the antecedents and consequences of trust to secure
   a realistic assessment of the determinants and outcome of trust. The
   authors employ structural equation modeling to test the proposed trust
   models. The study identifies perceived intention, organizational trust,
   strength of personal relationship, dialect fluency, and perceived
   similarity in cultural values as major determinants of trust among
   ethnic Chinese industrial buyers and sellers in Malaysia. One important
   managerial consideration is the need for companies to place more
   emphasis on the cultural and relational factors that affect trust. The
   results of the study confirm that the presence of trust enhances
   buyer-seller relationships among ethnic Chinese businesspeople. Along
   with satisfaction, trust between the buyer and seller dictates the
   probability of future interaction between the exchange parties, and thus
   trust is a central concept in the business exchange process.

   analysis of survey data from Portugal and the United States to test the
   model. The results strongly support the model and are quite consistent
   for both nations. in both nations, supportive purchase-related behavior
   increases as purchasers feel competent to help; believe that the threat
   from imports is salient; perceive social influences that support
   helping; hold values that derogate foreigners but support domestic

   frameworks in the subsidiary context. Findings based on a two-phase
   longitudinal study provide initial support for the framework that
   suggests that marketing structure follows marketing strategy. In
   response to increased target market similarity, companies in the study
   opted for more standardized marketing strategies. Furthermore,
   centralization of structure mediated the relationship between marketing
   strategy and subsidiary performance. The performance impact of

AB For a young, resource-constrained, technology-based start-up embarking
   on international sales, the choice of entry mode is a strategic decision
   of major importance. Yet within the emerging research stream of
   international entrepreneurship, curiously little attention has been
   devoted to the empirical analysis of foreign market entry forms. The
   authors address this important issue by analyzing the determinants of
   398 export decisions taken from a U.K. survey of 246 technology-based
   start-ups with international activities. The findings show that the
   entry mode decision is necessarily a trade-off between the resources as
   available and the support requirements of the customer. Issues of the
   innovativeness of the technology and the historic channel experience of
   the firm in its domestic market are particularly strong determinants of
   mode choice. The authors suggest that an organizational capability
   perspective on these firms' behavior offers a better explanation of
   their entry decisions than either transaction cost or stage theory.

AB In this study, the author investigates the antecedents of information
   search effort and information source use and the implications of firms'
   information acquisition activities on export performance. The author
   examines four major sets of variables to understand their impact on
   firms' information search effort and the use of personal,
   quasi-government, and documented sources. These variables are
   information source characteristics, firm strategic orientation,
   environmental characteristics, and organizational characteristics.
   Empirical results based on a survey of U.S. exporting firms provide
   mixed support for these factors in predicting firms' information search
   effort and information source use. Findings on firm performance support
   the notion that firms that engage in greater information search and
   those that rely on personal and quasi-government information sources
   fend to have higher performance levels.

AB Although retail operations traditionally have been considered poor
   candidates for international expansion, firms in mature retail markets
   are increasingly turning to international markets as a means for
   strategic growth. In this study, the authors examine how internal
   determinants affect the international ventures of large U.S. retail
   chains, comparing infernal characteristics of international and domestic
   firms. The authors use the behavioral internationalization paradigm to
   develop a model of international retail involvement, which serves as a
   conceptual framework for the study. Through a logistic regression model,
   the results support the relevance of six of eight explanatory
   determinants of international retail involvement. The findings highlight
   the powerful influence of the strategic management characteristics,
   competitive advantages related to retail concept and logistics, and a
   retailer's size. In contrast, neither previous experience in direct
   foreign sourcing nor competitive advantages related to retail
   merchandise were significant in this model.

AB The concept of psychological distance, or psychic distance, was first
   proposed by Beckerman (1956) and later popularized by Johanson and
   Vahlne (1977). However, efforts to test the impact of psychological
   distance on export market selection have been sporadic and flawed. The
   author calibrates a single-item indicator of psychological distance
   using an independent panel of experts. The predictive ability of the
   resulting instrument is then tested on the order in which Australian
   exporters select their first five foreign markets. The author then
   compares this instrument with three other scales that are commonly
   employed as indicators of psychological distance. Scales based on
   Sethi's (1971) and Hofstede's (1980) work prove to be inferior
   predictors of early market selection. Geographic distance is found to be
   a significant predictor, but its effect is largely independent of
   psychological distance. The author also explores the dynamic nature of
   psychological distance. The impact of psychological distance on market
   selection appears to decrease substantially after the first market entry
   decision but remains a significant predictor.

   examine the effects of exposure to organizational learning, the authors
   test the hypotheses in low- versus high-learning groups in two different
   samples. The user sample consists of 175 users, representing the
   international strategic business units of one U.S.-based multinational
   corporation (i.e., strategic business units located outside the home

   activities and relationships between II) users and buyers (as perceived
   by the users) and (2) buyers and suppliers las perceived by the buyers)
   in the supply chain. Overall, the results suggest that facets of
   organizational learning have a positive influence on customer

   addition, attending learning seminars to increase understanding and use

   The results show that national culture affects integration patterns.
   Product innovativeness significantly moderates the
   integration-performance relationship in Japanese firms but not in U.S.
   firms. When developing highly innovative products, Japanese firms should
   increase the level of cross-functional integration in conducting
   technical activities (compared with marginally innovative products) but
   decrease the level of integration in conducting market analysis and
   launching activities. In U.S. firms, however, cross-functional
   integration has a similar effect for more and less innovative products.
   This may suggest the high cost of implementing a differentiated
   integration pattern in a strongly individualistic culture.

   developments. Cross-impact analysis will become a more important tool
   for dealing with uncertain interactions among complex forces. The
   managerial mindset will have to grasp the big picture, think outside the
   box, discount the present to create the future, and move far beyond
   benchmarking. This will lead to changes in decision-making orientations,
   including a shift from relatively stable environments and mechanistic
   management approaches to more turbulent environments and systemic
   management approaches and a shift from hard facts for solving problems
   to virtual facts for problem prevention.

   firms that are just emerging in the global marketplace may have a
   correspondingly constrained range of options available. The decision of

   how-illustrates the strategic thinking behind such a constrained
   decision, focusing on an increasingly feasible option of partnering with
   a single retailer for the market entry The case covers a wide spectrum
   of strategic issues faced by a branded consumer goods manufacturer in
   the early stages of venturing beyond its domestic market. Students can
   assume the role of the chief executive officer in (1) balancing the
   attraction of a potentially strong market against the mission and
   resources of the firm, (2) balancing the lack of resources (both
   financial and managerial) for a company-controlled brand-building
   strategy against the apparent hazards in granting brand development
   rights to a licensee, (3) making the best of the increasing
   consolidation and strength of the retailer sector, and (4) developing
   trust with a local partner.

AB In cross-national marketing research, the question whether measurement
   accuracy reliability, and validity are achieved across samples
   traditionally has hampered research efforts. Measurement equivalence
   across samples has particularly perplexed researchers in their efforts
   to evaluate responses regarding latent variables. Recently,
   multiple-group structural equations modeling has been suggested as a
   reliable method for determining measurement equivalence. To date,
   however, the use of this approach has remained limited. In this study,
   the authors apply multiple-group structural equations modeling to assess
   measurement equivalence in three distinct constructs across U.S. and
   Korean samples on data derived from cross-cultural advertising research.
   The authors propose an extension of this method using the measurement
   error covariance matrices, which will enable researchers to evaluate
   measurement reliability across samples better and to attempt to
   disentangle cultural differences in instrument usage from
   measurement-related differences. The authors evaluate the results and
   discuss the findings, as well as outline the implications and
   limitations of this method for further research.

   role of relationship commitment as a key predictor. Cross-cultural
   adaptation and relational norms are introduced into the
   commitment-interaction chain because they may reduce cultural
   dissimilarity and enhance bilateralism, which in turn may promote
   ongoing interaction. The model is tested empirically using LISREL on

AB This study of 196 small high-technology firms embraces the areas of the
   internationalization of entrepreneurially led firms and the early stages
   of the international growth and development of high-technology firms.
   The author's conceptual stance is that the early internationalization of
   small firms should be viewed as an holistic process, that is, one in
   which interrelated and even integrated decisions and processes combine
   to accomplish a firm's individual pattern of internationalization. The
   study explores firms' patterns of international development through
   their establishment of cross-border activity in key value chains and
   associated service activities.

   marketing and empirically investigates their differential effects on new
   product performance. The results, based on data collected from 114
   high-technology firms in China, suggest that marketing's influence is
   related positively to new product market performance and timeliness of
   development. They also support the argument that the positive effect of
   marketing's participation on new product performance is mediated
   completely by its influence. Furthermore, the study reveals that the
   effectiveness of marketing's influence on new product performance
   depends an product newness to the firm, project formalization, perceived

AB Long noted as highly competitive, the Japanese market has become even
   more cutthroat in the "post-bubble" era, the period following the
   Japanese economic collapse. Only the fittest are likely to survive the
   correction taking place as Japan grapples with a severe recession that
   is threatening to extend worldwide. The research question pursued is how
   these "moment-in-time" market changes affect foreign-affiliated
   companies in Japan. The study examines whether lessons that may be
   learned from those foreign companies that have successfully negotiated
   the minefield of Japan's business culture can be applied to other world
   markets. It then aims to induce, from their responses, some implications
   for international marketing strategy. A is based on a study of the
   post-bubble changes in the Japanese market from 1990 to 1998. Using a
   Grounded Theory approach, the research process involves 58 personal
   interviews with executives of 52 successful foreign firms operating in
   Japan. A framework distilled from a previous article by the author is
   used to compare and contrast the pre- and post-bubble situations.

AB Internationalization traditionally has been examined using a single
   theoretical framework in the context of large manufacturing firms. The
   authors argue that it is more relevant to examine foreign direct
   investment (FDI) theory (including transaction cost analysis), the stage
   models of internationalization, or network theory in an integrated and
   holistic manner. Using case studies of four New Zealand-based
   engineering consulting firms classified as small or medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs), the study identifies and analyses patterns and
   influences related to the smaller service firm's decision to
   internationalize, subsequent internationalization market selection, and
   mode of entry. The findings show that SME internationalization in the
   engineering consulting sector is a complex process, and concepts
   inherent in FDI theory, the stage models, and the network perspective
   are all evident. These results support the argument that service
   internationalization is too broad a concept to be defined exclusively or
   examined by any one theoretical framework. implications are drawn for
   research and practice.

AB Existing literature provides little guidance to international managers
   for selling to public- and private-sector companies in emerging
   countries. This research attempts to fill this gap using the context of
   India. The study focuses on the criteria used by industrial buyers to
   evaluate suppliers. Four hypotheses related to the differences in the
   importance placed on economic criteria, familiarity with the supplier,
   reliability of the supplier, and other capabilities of the supplier by
   purchasing managers from public- and private-sector companies in India
   are proposed and tested. Purchasing managers from private-sector
   organizations place more importance on economic criteria and other
   capabilities of the supplier than do purchasing managers from
   public-sector organizations. However, there is no difference in the
   importance placed on the reliability of the supplier by public and
   private-sector purchasing managers. Also, no differences in the
   perception of familiarity as a supplier evaluation dimension are found.
   Specific recommendations are made on the basis of the findings that can
   aid managers in making marketing strategy decisions, including
   positioning pricing, product promotion, and distribution decisions.
   Finally, limitations of the study and extensions for further research
   are provided.

   influences on rapid internationalization. in what might be regarded as a
   rather sleepy sector of the economy, if is interesting to find
   microbusinesses that have gone international in their first year of
   business. Portraits of three companies are presented to illustrate the
   internationalization process, the importance of networks, and how
   sometimes, the process can be unplanned. The key influences as to why
   they are instant internationals are classified as (1) product related,
   (2) personal and psychological, (3) industry related, and (4) cognitive.
   The analysis identifies the distinguishing features of these firms in
   relation to their internationalization activities, namely, that the
   entrepreneurs view themselves as businesspeople rather than
   craftspeople.

   multicultural marketing in terms of the interrelations among three types
   of factors, that is, the multicultural marketplace in Australia,
   international markets, and the multicultural resources that exist in
   Australia. The authors argue that Australia's cultural diversity, as
   well as that of other multicultural societies, is a valuable resource
   for recognizing and responding to the opportunities presented in
   international markets. Several case studies are used to illustrate the
   ways in which opportunities in the domestic and international
   marketplace can arise and be responded to as a result of the
   multicultural dimensions of a society. The cases are drawn from winning
   entries in the annual Australian Multicultural Marketing Awards.
   Although developed in terms of Australian society, the ideas are
   relevant to all culturally heterogeneous societies.

AB Edward T. Hall(1976) and others have told us that status and role are
   more important considerations in Japan than in the United States.
   Specifically addressed in this study is the moderating effect of culture
   on the relationships between negotiators' roles (buyer or seller) and
   their behaviors and outcomes. A laboratory negotiation simulation was
   conducted with more than 200 Japanese and American businesspeople as
   participants, and several of the simulated negotiations were videotaped
   for subsequent content and sociolinguistic analyses. The integration of
   findings supports Hall's notion that in Japan hierarchy is more
   important, and indeed, Japanese buyers receive greater deference from
   sellers.

AB Global procurement of services has received an increasing amount of
   managerial attention in recent years. Service firms seem to have begun
   sourcing some of their activities from abroad in much the same way that
   manufacturing firms have outsourced in the past 30 years. However,
   little is known about the performance implications of a service sourcing
   strategy. This study applies, with appropriate modifications. a global
   components/finished goods sourcing strategy framework to the service
   sector. If also tests hypotheses relating service firms' global sourcing
   strategy to their market performance.

AB In this study, the export performance scale developed by Cavusgil and
   Zou (1994) is refined and tested for cross-cultural validity in
   Australia and the United Kingdom. The aim is to encourage a more
   integrated approach to export performance measurement so that valid
   comparisons of international research can be made and export theory
   advanced. Two key steps are reported. First, the scale was refined
   through exploratory research. Then, data were collected from a sample of
   434 exporters in Australia and the United Kingdom. Based on the
   procedures suggested by Singh (1995) and Mullen (1995), factorial
   similarity, factorial equivalence, and measurement equivalence is tested
   across the two national samples. Although support is found for factorial
   similarity and equivalence, the results do not support full measurement
   equivalence. It is therefore recommended that some caution be exercised
   when comparing research conducted in Australia and the United Kingdom,
   ryhich uses this scale. Suggestions for further research are also made.

AB Franchising is already an important component of global strategy in many
   service sectors such as hotels. This article asks, "Given a choice
   between a company-run and a franchised operation, what factors will tip
   the strategic selection toward franchising, for a particular hotel
   property?" The modal choice is influenced by both the environment or
   conditions in the market in which the hotel property is located-as well
   as the characteristics and strategy of the global hotel firm that is to
   decide whether to franchise, or run the property themselves. The
   propensity to franchise is shown to reflect a mix of factors, including:
   level of development of the intended foreign market; the extent of
   globalization and international experience of the firm; and strategic
   factors such as the degree of investment in its global reservations
   system and brand, as well as the size of its overall operations.

AB The unification of Europe offers major opportunities for firms providing
   products and services to the consumer market of nearly 400 million
   people. To capitalize effectively on these opportunities, firms must
   comprehend fully the changing macroenvironmental and consumer behavior
   trends in the European Union (EU). Recent research indicates that,
   though individual member countries differ substantially, convergence is
   increasing in the EU market. This observation requires a major revision
   in the marketing strategies of most firms; Pan-European marketing may be
   the name of the game for the future. This study empirically investigates
   changing consumer trends in the EU by comparing diffusion rates for new
   products introduced during the first and second half of the unification
   process. Managerial implications are drawn on the basis of the research
   findings.

AB Recently, there has been a renewed interest in market orientation or the
   implementation of the marketing concept by marketing professionals. This
   study addresses the issue from the foreign manager's
   perspective-specifically, the conceptual model of factors affecting the
   manager's decision to adopt the orientation is proposed and empirically
   tested. Findings show that the foreign manager's intention to adopt the
   orientation is positively affected by attitude toward market orientation
   and attitude toward innovation in management orientation. Attitude
   toward market orientation is, in turn, affected by the manager's beliefs
   regarding the relative advantage of market orientation, market
   turbulence, competitive intensity, and attitude toward innovation in
   management orientation. Attitude toward innovation in management
   orientation is, on the other hand, positively affected by the manager's
   innovativeness and negatively affected by opinion leadership.
   Theoretical contributions, managerial implications, limitations, and
   future research directions are also discussed.

AB A large number of studies have attempted to identify factors that are
   correlated with ex-porting success. However, much controversy exists
   about the key determinants of export performance and their relative
   importance. A major reason for this lack of consensus is the absence of
   a unified measure for capturing export performance. In this study, an
   attempt is made to develop a generalized export performance measure, the
   EXPERF scale, that can be applied to multiple countries. Results from a
   survey of top executives of U.S. and Japanese exporters support a
   three-dimensional scale for measuring export performance. The three
   dimensions of the export performance (EXPERF) scale are financial export
   performance, strategic export performance, and satisfaction with export
   venture. Implications of the study for further research and managerial
   practice are also discussed.

AB During China's rapid transition from a planned to a market economy, a
   major issue that has not been adequately addressed is "What determines a
   firm's performance?" This study proposes an institutional and
   environmental approach to evaluate how a firm performs in this dynamic
   transitional economy. Using a data set containing China's entire
   industrial market, this study finds that a firm's performance is shaped
   by its institutional characteristics and its environment, along with
   other strategic factors such as its market share. A surprising and yet
   important finding is the superior performance of the so-called
   "collectively owned" enterprises. The article not only explores the
   theoretical relationship between firm performance and institutional and
   environmental factors in transitional economies, but also is helpful for
   managers in developing such marketing strategies as market assessment,
   entry strategy, or partner selection.

AB Export performance has been a central construct in the study of export

   managerial antecedents of export performance and assess the relative
   importance of these antecedents. However, despite these fruitful
   efforts, there is little agreement in the literature about a conceptual
   definition of export performance, as well as about its operational
   definition. This article follows up on two previous articles that dealt
   with export performance conceptually (Madsen 1987; Shoham 1991) and uses
   a similar, three-dimensional conceptualization of export performance.
   This conceptualization is explored empirically with data from 93 Israeli
   exporters. The data indicate that there are indeed three dimensions to
   export performance, though the structure of these dimensions is somewhat
   different from expectations.

   at building cooperative links between small companies to exploit wider

   through the evaluation of a new export promotion scheme, specifically
   addresses the policy issues arising when networks are both the means to
   achieve international market outcomes and the outcomes themselves, that
   is, part of the foundation for ongoing international market penetration.
   Furthermore, it is argued that network outcomes should be included as
   part of the criteria for evaluating the success of export promotion
   schemes.

   article reviews the conceptual, methodological, and empirical insights
   gained from a systematic analysis of 46 studies conducted on this
   subject. Undoubtedly, this stream of research has enhanced understanding
   of the importance of managerial elements in affecting exporting
   activities. However, conceptually this research is still in its
   exploratory phase of development, lacking an integral theoretical
   framework. Certain methodological limitations are also identified,
   especially with respect to sampling designs, fieldwork procedures, and
   analytical methods. Empirically, hypothesized associations between
   managerial factors and export dimensions lead to diverse and sometimes
   conflicting findings, except for attributes of a general-subjective
   nature that demonstrate a consistently strong relationship with
   exporting-particularly in relation to the firm's propensity to export.
   The review reaches certain significant conclusions and suggests
   directions for future research in the field.

   Furthermore, they often use a benchmarking approach, comparing the
   results of a particular export venture with results of other export
   markets or the domestic market. Consequences of such practices are
