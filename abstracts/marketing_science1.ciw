TI PRICE-COMPETITION IN A CHANNEL STRUCTURE WITH A COMMON RETAILER
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In recent studies of channel competition, it has been found that channel intermediaries reduce the intensity of direct competition between manufacturers. The underlying channel structure in most studies consists of two manufacturers and two retailers each of whom sells only one manufacturer's product exclusively. This paper adds to this growing literature of channel competition by analyzing a channel structure with two competing manufacturers and one intermediary (a common retailer) that sells both manufacturers' products. Unlike some exclusive dealers or retail outlets of a manufacturer, however, a common retailer is often a powerful player in the market. This paper studies three noncooperative games of different power structures between the two manufacturers and the retailer, i.e., two Stackelberg and one Nash games. It is shown that some of the results depend critically on the form of the demand function. With a linear demand function, a manufacturer is better off by maintaining exclusive dealers while a retailer has an incentive to deal with several producers. All channel members as well as consumers are better off when no one dominates the market. The common retailer benefits more than the manufacturers do from a symmetric decrease in the manufacturing cost. As products are less differentiated, all channel members' prices and profits increase: a counterintuitive result. When the demand function is nonlinear, however, an exclusive dealer channel provides higher profits to all than a common retailer channel given a power structure. As products are more differentiated, a manufacturer's profit decreases when a common retailer is used, but increases when an exclusive dealer is used. These results underscore the importance of choosing a correct demand function for a channel decision.

TI A SIMULTANEOUS APPROACH TO THE WHETHER, WHAT AND HOW MUCH TO BUY
   QUESTIONS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumer's purchase decisions of whether to buy, what to buy and how much to buy are examined simultaneously. Based on a consumer utility maximization problem, an unobservable threshold price, about which a consumer pivots from nonpurchase to purchase, can be deduced. With any model specification, the interrelationships between purchase decisions can be explicitly derived. The model is applied to coffee purchasing data. In addition, by suppressing the nonpurchase options the model is compared with an alternative approach appearing in the marketing literature.

TI EFFECTS OF PRICE PROMOTIONS ON VARIETY-SEEKING AND REINFORCEMENT
   BEHAVIOR
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A stochastic model is proposed to examine how changes in frequency of price discounts affect brand choice decisions of consumers who exhibit variety-seeking and reinforcement behavior. It is shown that the effect on choice depends on whether the brand offering discounts is a major or minor brand in the product category. This model extends the existing literature on stochastic models of variety-seeking behavior by explicitly incorporating switching due to promotions along with intrinsic switching due to variety-seeking. The model yields testable hypotheses which are supported in a laboratory experiment and on analyses of the IRI cracker data.

TI ON TESTING COMPETITIVE MARKET STRUCTURES

AB A recent paper by Novak and Stangor (Marketing science, Winter 1987) on testing competitive Market structures involves testing a two-sided hypothesis to determine the nature of the competitive market structure. In this paper we provide an improvement to the Novak and Stangor procedure by considering a one-sided multivariate hypothesis and suggest methods for testing such hypotheses.

TI THE BB/NBD+1 MODEL APPLIED TO ROTATION POLICY
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB An early dismissal policy for unproductive recruiters is proposed. The policy is based on a bivariate stochastic model for productivity; this model considers both incidence of reporting a positive quantity of sales and the quantity per report. All recruiters are observed for a probational period; those who exceed minimum incidence and quantity requirements are allowed to continue to the end of a (fixed) maximum tenure while others are replaced with new recruiters after the probational period. We show that those who report less often must report a larger total quantity over the probational period in order to compensate for a larger chance variation. The univariate negative binomial distribution (NBD) model which considers quantity only is examined with respect to its robustness as an approximation in this context. It is found that the NBD leads to serious errors when the quantity reported is relatively homogeneous and reporting incidence is bimodal. Extensions to more conventional salesforces and to direct mail applications are indicated.

TI NEW BRAND POSITIONING AND PRICING IN AN OLIGOPOLISTIC MARKET
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The positioning and pricing of a new brand requires knowledge about the relationship of both demand and cost with potential attribute locations and prices. This paper addresses this problem and illustrates it in the context of the automobile market. Multi-attribute expected utility theory which allows for consumer uncertainty about the brands is used to model individuals' behavior. Attribute weights are estimated from market survey data on brands' attributes and preferences using LINMAP as an estimation procedure. Expected utility is then updated using the multinomial logit model and choice data to account for the observation that stated preferences do not perfectly reflect the eventual choice. It is hypothesized that, when faced with an actual choice, price may become more important to the consumer, while other attributes may become more or less important than is reflected in stated preferences. The resulting estimated choice probabilities are aggregated to form demand functions facing each brand which depend on all brands' prices and attribute space locations. Assuming there is a price equilibrium in the existing market and that firms have the same variable cost function, variable costs as a function of a brand's attribute levels are estimated. Given the demand and cost functions facing each firm including the potential new entrant, the profit maximizing positioning and pricing of a new brand is analyzed using a game theoretic approach. A solution is sought under the assumption that incumbents react to entry by changing their prices. Possible approaches to the translation of the perceptual attribute positioning of the new brand to physical and engineering attributes are reviewed. Improvements and future extensions of the study are discussed.

AB Given that durable products are long-lived, there exists the possibility of secondary markets for used products as well as the potential for product obsolescence. This is an important issue in markets where technology changes rapidly, because the introduction of new versions of a product can make earlier versions obsolete. More generally, prices of older versions in the secondary market adjust in response to changes incorporated in new versions of the product. Thus. another method of evaluating consumers' response to a new product is by looking at the variation in market prices of the old product. This paper develops a general model to explore the relationship between primary markets for new cars and secondary markets for used cars. The results suggest that the depreciation of used cars is influenced strongly by the types of changes in new model cars.

TI A DYNAMIC-MODEL OF CHANNEL MEMBER STRATEGIES FOR MARKETING EXPENDITURES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We develop a dynamic model for determining the equilibrium marketing effort levels for a manufacturer and a retailer in a two-member marketing channel. The existence of carry-over effects of marketing effort of channel members leads to an accumulation of goodwill for them over time. This necessitates modeling the relationship between the effort and channel sales in a dynamic framework as goodwill accumulation creates an incentive for channel members to invest in marketing effort in order to obtain future benefits. By explicitly recognizing that each member's decision is affected by the other's actions, we derive their equilibrium effort levels over time when they follow either a coordinated or an uncoordinated strategy and also determine the profit implications of these strategies for the channel members.
   We examine the effect of channel dynamics on the difference in profits resulting from following coordinated as opposed to uncoordinated strategies and identify situations in which this profit differential provides an incentive for channel members to coordinate their marketing efforts. Further, we derive empirically testable hypotheses that provide a basis for predicting when channel coordination would take place in a dyadic context.

TI A PROBIT MODEL OF CHOICE DYNAMICS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB There are many products which are repeatedly purchased by consumers. In such cases it is likely that choice history, that is the sequence of choices made in the past, as well as marketing variables affect subsequent choice decisions. Attempts to model the effects of choice history have been generally based on the inclusion of variables that represent brand loyalty and/or variety seeking behavior. In this paper we present a model of dynamic choice behavior which is more general and incorporates four characteristics. The first characteristic labeled preference reinforcement and preference reduction represents loyalty and variety seeking. The second is the short-term reluctance of a consumer to move from the current brand (inertia) or the willingness to move to another brand (mobility). The third characteristic captures the effect of repetitive consumption (the long term effect) on inertia and mobility. The fourth characteristic incorporates the similarity or dissimilarity of choice alternatives. This is important in a dynamic model because choice on the current purchase occasion can be affected by whether a similar or dissimilar alternative was chosen on the previous occasion. Similarities of alternatives are represented in terms of distances. The effect of price on choice behavior is also modeled.
   Individual-level purchase data from a consumer panel are used to estimate a covariance probit and an independent probit specification of the model. From a substantive perspective the model gives interesting insights into the dynamics of choice behavior. The model predicts switches better than a benchmark model which incorporates only loyalty. In addition, it is superior to three benchmark models in overall predictive ability.

TI THE EFFECT OF PRICE PROMOTIONS ON VARIABILITY IN PRODUCT CATEGORY SALES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Our objective in this research is to relate variability in product category sales to promotional activity in the product category, and other category specific characteristics. The findings may be relevant from retailers' perspective as retailers' revenues are more closely related to the sales of the product category as opposed to the sales of any particular brand. We analyze data on about 2,000 brands from 25 different SAMI categories, obtained with the cooperation of a major grocery chain. Our data suggest that an increase in the magnitude of discounts increases the variability in category sales but an increase in the frequency of discounts has an opposite effect. Furthermore, categories which are bulky, or categories where the degree of competitiveness is high, exhibit lower variability in sales.

TI PULSING POLICIES FOR AGGREGATE ADVERTISING MODELS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Classical continuous-time models of advertising expenditure tend to fall into two categories, those that prescribe spending at a constant level and those that prescribe switching infinitely quickly between several different levels of spending. The latter practice, chattering, though impossible literally, can be interpreted in practice to imply that the faster the switching the better, Empirical evidence, however, sometimes suggests the superiority of pulsing, alternating between different spending levels with finite frequency, for example in a periodic fashion. Furthermore, the actual behavior of marketing managers, who often advertise in flights or pulses, appears to differ from the optimal policies many current models prescribe.
   Showing how structural properties of common advertising models rule out finite-frequency pulsing a priori, we develop a continuous-time model for which finite-frequency pulsing can be optimal. Relaxing these structural assumptions yields a new class of models which, for certain values of their parameters, lead to periodic pulsing optima; this is accomplished by inclusion of both S-shaped response and an exponential-smoothing filter. These theoretical results are illustrated through simulation of a variant of the Vidale-Wolfe model.

TI DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF THE ORDER OF ENTRY ON MARKET SHARE, TRIAL
   PENETRATION, AND REPEAT PURCHASES FOR FREQUENTLY PURCHASED
   CONSUMER-GOODS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A time series cross-sectional analysis of 18 successful later entrants in 8 categories of consumer packaged goods over the period from October 1983 to January 1988 confirms previous empirical findings that, after correcting for differences in marketing effort, later entrants suffer a long-term market share disadvantage. New evidence of the penalties associated with later entry are found in statistical estimation of models of cumulative trial, first repeat, and subsequent repeat purchasing. Significantly lower asymptotic levels are found in both trial and repeat behavior. However based on this data, the rate of approach of later entrants to their lower asymptotic performance measures is either equal to or faster than early entrants and provides evidence of a compensating partial effect accrued by later entrants.

TI THE DYNAMIC PRICING OF NEXT GENERATION CONSUMER DURABLES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Learning curve effects, aspects of consumer demand models (e.g., reservation price distributions, intertemporal utility maximizing behavior), and competitive activity are reasons which have been offered to explain why prices of new durables decline over time. This paper presents an alternative rationale based on the buying behavior for products with overlapping replacement cycles (i.e., next generation products). A model for consumer sales of a new durable is developed by incorporating the replacement behavior of a previous generation product. Pricing strategies for two product generations are investigated analytically and with numerical methods. Results indicate that durable replacement behavior leads to a wider set of optimal pricing strategies than previously obtained. Several empirical illustrations of industry pricing practices for successive product generations are also shown to be consistent with the theoretical results. Finally, various areas for future research are outlined.

TI THE NORMATIVE IMPACT OF CONSUMER PRICE EXPECTATIONS FOR MULTIPLE BRANDS
   ON CONSUMER PURCHASE BEHAVIOR
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Empirical research indicates that some consumers form price expectations which may impact their purchase behavior. While literature in operations research has built purchase policy models incorporating uncertain price expectations, these models have been built for commodities. Consumers face an environment with multiple brands. In this paper, we develop a model that incorporates consumer preferences and price expectations for multiple brands as determinants of normative consumer purchase behavior. The model demonstrates how commodity purchase policy models recognizing price uncertainty can be adapted to the study of multi-brand markets. The model is used to analyze the normative impact of changes in price promotion policies and holding costs on individual purchase behavior. It is also used in a Monte-Carlo market simulation that illustrates some scenarios where a post-promotion dip is more or less evident, and provides an explanation for the nonexistent post-promotion dip.

TI INCORPORATING REFERENCE PRICE EFFECTS INTO A THEORY OF CONSUMER CHOICE
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Although there has been a good deal of research on incorporating the effects of reference price formation into empirical models of consumer buying behavior, little formal theoretical work had been undertaken to date. This paper incorporates reference price effects into the traditional economic theory of consumer choice, and examines the effects of reference price formation on the results of the traditional theory, its marketing implications, and the implications for empirical models which examine the effects of reference price formation on actual consumer behavior, Several implications of the theoretical model are empirically tested using weekly retail egg sales data from Southern California. This analysis indicates that reference price formation does have significant effects on consumer behavior. Furthermore, these effects are asymmetric with consumers two and a half times more responsive to egg price increases that are in excess of the reference price than they are to comparable egg price decreases.

Using such a model, the superiority of Advertising Pulsing Policy over an equivalent Uniform Advertising Policy is explored analytically for both S-shaped and concave advertising response functions in relation to initial sales and the employed discount rate.
   The basic results of the research, summarized in four propositions, indicate that under the presence of advertising wearout and for both S-shaped and concave advertising response functions that: -Pulsing is superior to the even policy for a zero discount rate. -For all positive values of the discount rate, pulsing is superior to the even policy provided that initial sales are close enough to the equilibrium sales of the even policy. -If initial sales are much different from the equilibrium sales of the even policy, pulsing would be superior for small values of the discount rate whereas the even policy would be superior for large values of the discount rate.

TI DEMAND SIGNALING AND SCREENING IN CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper examines two ways channel members at the manufacturing and retail ends deal with asymmetric information in the context of new product introduction. A manufacturer who has private information that demand for a new product will be high can differentiate itself from a manufacturer less confident of demand by undertaking high levels of pre-launch advertising and offering a high wholesale price. A retailer, for its part, can screen potentially high demand from potentially low demand products by stipulating a take-it-or-leave-it slotting allowance, the assumption being that the offer will be accepted only by manufacturers confident of sufficient demand to recover the high initial cost of slotting allowances. It is shown that manufacturers prefer to signal demand through advance advertising and wholesale price, retailers to screen demand through slotting allowances. It is shown that, unless advance advertising is sufficiently effective slotting allowances yield higher total channel profits and higher social welfare.

TI AN EQUILIBRIUM-ANALYSIS OF DEFENSIVE RESPONSE TO ENTRY USING A COUPLED
   RESPONSE FUNCTION MODEL
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We determine the optimal response to competitive entry in a market characterized by a market share attraction model. The response of an incumbent is limited to changes in prices, advertising and distribution expenditures; brand positions are assumed to be fixed. We also assume that the entrant's position is chosen exogenously and that the sales potential of the market is constant.
   After proving the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium, we show that the optimal response depends on the relative market share of the incumbents. The response by nondominant brands (with market shares less than 50%) mirrors the prediction by decoupled response function models-reduce price, advertising and distribution spending. For the dominant brand (having a market share of 50+%), the response is to reduce price and increase marketing spending. This finding explains previous empirical results that could not be addressed by the decoupled models.

TI PRICE SENSITIVITY AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING EXPOSURES - SOME
   EMPIRICAL-FINDINGS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Empirical research (as well as theoretical reasoning) has led to contradictory findings with regard to whether increases in brand advertising activities lead to increases or decreases in consumer price sensitivity. Lack of data to measure the exposure of individual households to advertisements and to capture competitive activities has been an important limitation to date. This study, using single source data for a midwestern US market, finds that increased advertising exposures are associated with increases in a household's brand choice price sensitivity for two frequently purchased consumer products. However, under high levels of advertising exposure, it is possible for a household's brand choice price sensitivity to decrease.

TI ESTIMATING NONLINEAR PARAMETERS IN THE MULTINOMIAL LOGIT MODEL
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Multinomial logit models, especially those calibrated on scanner data, often use explanatory variables that are nonlinear functions of the parameters to be estimated. A common example is the smoothing constant in an exponentially weighted brand loyalty variable. Such parameters cannot be estimated directly using commercially available logit packages. We provide a simple iterative method for estimating nonlinear parameters at the same time as the usual linear coefficients. The procedure uses standard multinomial logit software and, in experience to date, converges rapidly. We prove that, under suitable conditions, the resulting parameter values are maximum likelihood estimates and show how to calculate asymptotic standard errors from normal computer output. Three applications illustrate the method in practice.

TI ESTIMATING A MULTINOMIAL PROBIT MODEL OF BRAND CHOICE USING THE METHOD
   OF SIMULATED MOMENTS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The multinomial probit model of brand choice is theoretically appealing for marketing applications as it is free from the "independence of irrelevant alternatives" property of the multinomial logit model. However, difficulties in estimation have restricted its widespread use in marketing. This paper presents an application of the method of simulated moments, a new methodology that enables easy estimation of probit models with a large number of alternatives in the choice set. We describe the theoretical development of the technique and using pseudo-simulated data, conduct numerical experiments to compare the method with existing techniques for estimating probit models.
   Using the scanner panel data on the purchases of catsup, we provide an empirical application of the method of simulated moments to the estimation of the parameters of a multinomial probit model. Estimating the covariance structure associated with the underlying latent variable probit model enables us to identify broad patterns of similarities across alternatives. It also enables us to derive a pairwise similarity matrix across choice alternatives which when input into a multidimensional scaling routine provides us with a graphical representation of competitive structure in the catsup market. For completeness, we compare the substantive implications for the effects of marketing variables obtained from the multinomial probit model with those obtained from models in the extant marketing literature.

TI A NEW MULTIDIMENSIONAL-SCALING METHODOLOGY FOR THE ANALYSIS OF
   ASYMMETRIC PROXIMITY DATA IN MARKETING-RESEARCH
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper presents a new multidimensional scaling (MDS) methodology which operationalizes the Krumhansl (1978) distance-density model for the analysis of asymmetric proximity data.  In Krumhansl's conceptualization, the symmetric Euclidean interbrand distances typically associated with the traditional MDS model are augmented by the spatial density around the brands in the derived space.  This modification allows the distance-density model to accommodate many of the empirically observed violations of the metric axioms (such as asymmetry).  An operationalization of the distance-density model is particularly attractive to marketers who often work with asymmetric brand switching data to investigate market structure and competition.  We describe this new MDS procedure which is sufficiently flexible to fit a number of competing hypotheses of proximity.  The algorithm employed for estimation is technically presented together with various program options.  An analysis of an asymmetric brand switching matrix for automobiles is presented to illustrate the methodology.  The results of this analysis are also compared with the solutions obtained from several of the currently available procedures for handling asymmetric proximity data.  Finally, technical extensions to three-way analyses, hybrid models, etc., are discussed.

TI BRAND LOYALTY AND MARKETING STRATEGY - AN APPLICATION TO HOME APPLIANCES

AB In the academic literature, the modelling of brand choice and switching behavior has a long history for frequently purchased packaged goods.  Comparable efforts with consumer durable goods, however, are generally absent.  This paper presents an application of the brand switching model proposed by Colombo and Morrison (1989) to a set of four major home appliances.  Applicance brand loyalty, however, is shown to be a function of the timing of replacements, a factor that has not entered into the modelling of packed goods.  As a result, the brand switching matrices are analyzed over the replacement cycle.  This application illustrates how a brand switching analysis can be used to assess the relative competitive position of a firm in terms of the primary customer sources that a brand attracts.

TI A CHOICE-BASED APPROACH TO THE DIFFUSION OF A SERVICE - FORECASTING FAX
   PENETRATION BY MARKET SEGMENTS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Motivated by poor performance of standard estimation methods in our application, the problem of modeling the diffusion of a new service (or a product) is considered without the assumption of a homogeneous population.  The model consists of a two-stage procedure where customers receive purchase occasions according to a conventional diffusion model and at each purchase occasion they buy according to a binary choice model.  This approach permits explicit incorporation of individual customer demographics and product attributes, whence one can study changes in diffusion as a function of changes in product attributes, prices, advertising, and customer demographics.  The model has provided excellent results in a number of applications including the one on fax penetration reported here.  In our applications this approach has been useful in market segmentation, studying the effect of marketing strategies, and in evaluating the effects of new service features.  A limited validation is carried out to judge the forecasting performance of the model used in the fax example.  A simulation study is carried out to compare the proposed solution with the result obtained by fitting the Bass model to a set of market segments separately.  The simulation indicates that the proposed approach substantially improves over the aggregate fitting.

TI A MINIMUM DISCRIMINATION INFORMATION ESTIMATION OF MULTIATTRIBUTE MARKET
   SHARE MODELS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Multiattribute market share models (MMSM) using supplier, product, and buyer attributes as explanatory variables generally use a logit model structure.  The literature indicates two basic types of approaches for estimating coefficients, regression type approaches generally using log-share ratios and a nonregression approach which is based on maximum-likelihood principles.  This article discusses a nonregression estimation approach, a minimum discrimination information (MDI), whose formulation differs from MDI procedures previously applied to the marketing literature.  The MDI formulation enables researchers to estimate a logit model with proportions as the dependent variable and is computationally easy because it uses the same estimators as an MLE approach which assumes independence of trials.  Equivalence between MDI and MLE estimates, under certain conditions, are discussed.  The estimation methods are applied to a real world data set.  The results indicate the MDI/MLE method does best in predicting the market shares of the suppliers according to some basic error criteria both at disaggregate and aggregate levels.

This paper investigates three paired comparison taste tests, each requiring a different judgment.  These are:  preference ("Which of these two do you prefer?"), identification ("Which one of these two is Brand X?") and detection ("Are these two products the same or different?").  Each task has biases that may influence the level of measured discrimination ability.  To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to compare subject discrimination ability as measured by all three tasks.  Additionally, we test two scales of subject confidence ratings and discuss implications for product testing.

TI STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS OF MODELS WITH COMPOSITE DEPENDENT-VARIABLES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Composite variables are those that may be mathematically decomposed into additive and/or multiplicative component variables.  Several researchers have noted that the relationship between a composite variable and its components may be a mathematical artifact, but the effect of their inclusion as independent variables on the coefficients of the remaining variables in the model has not been recognized, nor has a formal expression for the resulting bias been presented.  Structural analysis of composite dependent variables, as presented here, provides the key to understanding the nature and extent of this bias.  It separates higher and lower level components from one another and also separates these components from other antecedent variables in the model.  The advantages of this hierarchical decomposition are that (1) it reduces problems of misspecification and omitted variables, (2) by separately estimating antecedent effects on each component, it offers some insights into the underlying causal mechanisms that are not available from other techniques and (3) it ensures that regression coefficients can be interpreted in the standard way:  the expected change in the dependent variable associated with a change in the independent variable, holding other independent variables in the equation constant.  Moreover, hierarchical decomposition of the dependent variable can reproduce all information available from techniques that mix levels of analysis, but the converse is not true.

TI RECALL, RECOGNITION AND THE MEASUREMENT OF MEMORY FOR PRINT
   ADVERTISEMENTS - A REASSESSMENT
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Application of the two-step approach to structural equation modeling to the PARM data studied by Bagozzi and Silk (1983) results in quite different conclusions as to the psychometric properties of recall and recognition scores.  The data they analyzed are more consistent with a simple, alternative measurement model, which has different implications for the dimensionality questions Bagozzi and Silk raised.  After controlling for random error, recall and recognition scores for print ads are highly correlated and yet discriminable.  So, while recall and recognition have considerable common variance, the unidimensionality hypothesis is rejected.  Either recall or recognition (or both) contains a significant amount of specific variance.  Taking reader interest scores into account does not change the conclusion; reader interest scores are best accounted for as a lower reliability indicator of recognition.

TI THE ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION FOR FIRMS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This research investigates the antecedents and consequences of customer satisfaction. We develop a model to link explicitly the antecedents and consequences of satisfaction in a utility-oriented framework. We estimate and test the model against alternative hypotheses from the satisfaction literature. In the process, a unique database is analyzed: a nationally representative survey of 22,300 customers of a variety of major products and services in Sweden in 1989-1990. Several well-known experimental findings of satisfaction research are tested in a field setting of national scope. For example, we find that satisfaction is best specified as a function of perceived quality and ''disconfirmation''-the extent to which perceived quality fails to match prepurchase expectations. Surprisingly, expectations do not directly affect satisfaction, as is often suggested in the satisfaction literature. In addition, we find quality which falls short of expectations has a greater impact on satisfaction and repurchase intentions than quality which exceeds expectations. Moreover, we find that disconfirmation is more likely to occur when quality is easy to evaluate. Finally, in terms of systematic variation across firms, we find the elasticity of repurchase intentions with respect to satisfaction to be lower for firms that provide high satisfaction. This implies a long-run reputation effect insulating firms which consistently provide high satisfaction.

TI A LOOK ON THE COST SIDE - MARKET SHARE AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In this paper we develop a model relating market share to average costs. We start with a theoretical model of the factors that affect the firm's average cost curve, partitioning these factors into (a) measurable firm and competitive environment characteristics, and (b) unobserved factors that are either fixed, random, or follow a first-order autoregressive process. We then link this theoretical model to an empirical model in which we specify three average cost equations for the organizational areas of purchasing, production, and marketing. Main effects for initial (lagged) market share position, as well as their interactions with factors characterizing the firm's competitive environment, represent the variables of key theoretical interest in our equations. We estimate these equations using PIMS data, and control for fixed, contemporaneous, and autoregressive unobservable factors. Our results suggest that market share can often lead to market power in the form of lower average costs. However, the firm's operating environment greatly moderates the effect of market share on average cost. In particular, we find that market share position only leads to lower average costs when the organizational unit operates in a competitive environment that gives it both motivation and ability to realize power from its market share position.

TI TRUTH IN CONCENTRATION IN THE LAND OF (80/20) LAWS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Among the more prominent truisms in marketing are 80/20 type laws, e.g., 20 percent of the customers account for 80 percent of the purchases. These kinds of statistics indicate a certain degree of concentration in customer purchases; i.e., the extent to which a large portion of the product's total purchases are made by a small fraction of all customers. Such concentration levels, suggesting that markets can be segmented in various ways, are often reported in basic marketing texts.
   We show that a meaningful interpretation of these concentration statistics is not nearly as easy or immediate as it is to compute them. The key factors influencing the degree of apparent concentration in purchases are reviewed, and we present a modeling approach for estimating the true level of relevant concentration among customers.

TI INVESTIGATING PURCHASE INCIDENCE, BRAND CHOICE AND PURCHASE QUANTITY
   DECISIONS OF HOUSEHOLDS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We develop a comprehensive utility maximizing framework to study the impact of marketing variables on the category purchase, brand choice and purchase quantity decisions of households for frequently purchased packaged goods. The model allows for dependence among the three decisions while ensuring that these decisions provide, in combination, the greatest possible utility to the household. By accounting for variations in reservation prices and intrinsic brand preferences across households, the modeling framework explicitly captures the effects of unobserved heterogeneity on all three purchase decisions.
   The principal empirical finding from analyzing the A. C. Nielsen data for the yogurt product category is that the substantive implications for the effects of marketing variables are sensitive to whether these effects are determined conditional or unconditional on a product category purchase. Our results show that reservation prices and intrinsic brand preferences vary across households, and not accounting for these variations in the estimation could lead to biased estimates for the coefficients of the marketing variables. A comparison of our results to those obtained from a nested logit model of purchase incidence and brand choice reveals that our proposed model performs better using both a formal statistical test as well as the criterion of predictive validity in a holdout sample of panelists. Further, the purchase quantity model compares favorably with two alternative models of quantity choice in the validation sample.

TI COMPOSITE DEPENDENT-VARIABLES AND THE MARKET SHARE EFFECT
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Farris, Parry and Ailawadi ( 1992; hereafter denoted FPA) demonstrate that bias can arise in a regression involving a composite dependent variable where a subset of components of the dependent variable are used as explanatory factors. They correctly observe that the Jacobson and Aaker ( 1985; hereafter denoted JA) model has explanatory factors that are also components of the ROI dependent variable and, as such, is subject to ''composite variable bias.'' FPA note that another way of viewing composite variable bias is that the coefficients in the model reflect not their impact on the dependent variable but rather their impact on the dependent variable less the elements of the components included as explanatory factors. As such, additional effects (analogous to indirect effects) may be present to the extent strategic factors influence the included components. FPA conclude that such bias explains the low estimate of the market share effect reported in JA. However, FPA's attempt to replicate our analysis and assess composite variable bias is flawed by a mistake in their analysis, i.e., their disaggregate models do not follow from the JA aggregate specification. The purpose of this note is to correctly assess the extent to which the JA estimate of the market share effect is affected by composite variable bias and to suggest approaches for modeling a composite dependent variable in the presence of unobservable factors. In particular, we (i) show that the disaggregate specifications of FPA do not follow from JA, (ii) look at specifications not subject to composite variable bias to investigate the magnitude of the composite variable bias in JA, and (iii) provide a disaggregate modeling framework that controls for unobservable effects.

AB We offer a framework to specify and estimate various sources of heterogeneity in multinomial logit brand choice models. We let each brand-specific intercept and each parameter of the explanatory variable vector vary randomly across households. In addition, we distinguish loyal households from the rest. Our results suggest that incorporating multiple sources of heterogeneity improves the model fit and suggests higher impact of marketing mix elements on brand choice. We highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of heterogeneity. The model we implement yields valuable managerial insights.

TI WARRANTY POLICY AND EXTENDED SERVICE CONTRACTS - THEORY AND AN
   APPLICATION TO AUTOMOBILES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper characterizes the manufacturer warranty policy and its effect on consumer behavior under the following conditions: consumers are heterogeneous in risk-preferences, consumer actions affecting the probability of warranty redemption are unobservable to the manufacturer, and the product reliability is known. We obtain the ''menu'' of warranty contracts, and then make connections with its institutional counterpart: the extended service contract.
   The model's implications for consumer behavior are examined using data obtained from a sample of recent buyers of new cars. The role of risk in consumer behavior with respect to choice of extended service contracts, and the allocation of effort for maintenance are found to be consistent with the model's predictions.
   The empirical analysis permits quantifying the demand for extended service contracts as a function of the extent of manufacturer warranty. The estimates show that for our sample of buyers a manufacturer warranty of three years is optimal in the sense of overcoming the role of risk-aversion in the choice of extended service contracts.

AB ''Single Source'' databases based on scanner data offer new opportunities for evaluating promotions and improving their effectiveness. Decision support needs vary depending on the decision maker's organizational vantage point. Some managers require the evaluation of promotion results in the short term. Others should take a medium- to long-term focus. An implemented model and automated system for measuring short-term incremental volume due to promotions by developing baselines of store-level ''normal'' sales is presented using store-level scanner data. Empirical validation results and real life applications are presented and discussed, including the use of the baselines as measures of ''brand health.''

TI PRETESTING QUESTIONNAIRES - CONTENT ANALYSES OF RESPONDENTS CONCURRENT
   VERBAL PROTOCOLS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Conventional questionnaire pretesting methods focus on directly identifying question defects, such as an ambiguous question. This paper proposes a new method that identifies respondents' cognitive difficulties as they form answers to survey questions. It entails a content analysis of concurrent verbal protocols elicited during pretest interviews. The effectiveness of the methodology is illustrated with pretests of multiple versions of the same survey. The results are used to illustrate how this method yields diagnostic information about questionnaire problems and improvements. Then, the results are compared with the results of observational monitoring by managers. The findings indicate that a questionnaire pretesting methodology that quantifies respondents' cognitive difficulties is a useful enhancement for identifying and ''improving'' defective questions.

TI ACCOUNTING FOR HETEROGENEITY AND NONSTATIONARITY IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL
   MODEL OF CONSUMER PURCHASE BEHAVIOR
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB When calibrating a brand choice model cross-sectionally, a measure of brand loyalty is often introduced into the utility function to account for differences in utility across households and over time. One of the most widely used measures of brand loyalty, proposed by Guadagni and Little (1983), is an exponential smoothing model of past choice behavior by the household. In this study, we argue that the exponential smoothing model of brand loyalty cannot properly distinguish between sources of variation in utility due to heterogeneity (across households) and sources of variation due to nonstationarity (within household over time). We introduce a new measure of brand loyalty, derived from a nonstationary Dirichlet-multinomial choice model, in which heterogeneity and nonstationarity are handled distinctly.

TI A RETAILER PROMOTION POLICY MODEL CONSIDERING PROMOTION SIGNAL
   SENSITIVITY
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Recent research suggests that the signal (e.g., sign or marker) with a point of purchase promotion will stimulate a significant sales increase, regardless of whether or not that signal is accompanied by a price cut. This paper develops a model of retailer profitability that incorporates this ''promotion signal sensitivity.'' In a field test, the profitability of the promotion policy prescribed by this model is compared to the profitability of two other promotion policy-setting paradigms: a model-based policy that does not consider promotion signal sensitivity and one prescribed by industry experts. The test results support the proposed model. Its policy generates 11% more category profit per unit than the model-based policy and 12% more than the industry experts. Implications for retailers and future research are discussed.

TI THE EFFECT OF LOCAL CONSIDERATION SETS ON GLOBAL CHOICE BETWEEN LOWER
   PRICE AND HIGHER QUALITY
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A set of alternatives under consideration is often divided into subsets (or local sets) by some external (e.g., product display format at the store) or internal (e.g., a decision rule) factor. We propose that the manner in which a global set of alternatives varying in price and quality is divided into local sets can have a systematic effect on consumer choice between a lower price alternative and a higher quality alternative. Three such effects are investigated: (1) Consumers who first choose from pairs of products ( { A, B }, { B, C }, { A, C } ) and then choose from the set of all three products ( { A, B, C } ) are more likely to prefer the cheapest alternative than consumers who only choose from the complete set; (2) The choice share of a low-price, low-quality brand is greater when alternatives varying in price, quality, and features are displayed by brand (i.e., each display presents different models of one brand) as compared to a display by feature level (i.e., each display presents comparable models of different brands); and (3) Consumers considering a pair of two-option local sets, each consisting of different brands and feature levels (e.g., a feature enhanced model of a low quality brand vs. a basic model of a high quality brand), are more likely to select a feature enhanced model from the global set (of four options) than those who consider the same alternatives in other local set configurations or consider only the global set. These predictions were supported in seven studies, which also provided insights into' the boundaries of the effects (focusing on the paired-comparison effect). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.

TI MODELING LOSS AVERSION AND REFERENCE DEPENDENCE EFFECTS ON BRAND CHOICE
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Based upon a recently developed multiattribute generalization of prospect theory's value function (Tversky and Kahneman 1991), we argue that consumer choice is influenced by the position of brands relative to multiattribute reference points, and that consumers weigh losses from a reference point more than equivalent sized gains (loss aversion). We sketch implications of this model for understanding brand choice.
   We develop a multinomial logit formulation of a reference-dependent choice model, calibrating it using scanner data. In addition to providing better fit in both estimation and forecast periods than a standard multinomial logit model, the model's coefficients demonstrate significant loss aversion, as hypothesized.
   We also discuss the implications of a reference-dependent view of consumer choice for modeling brand choice, demonstrate that loss aversion can account for asymmetric responses to changes in product characteristics, and examine other implications for competitive strategy.

TI ANALYZING DURATION TIMES IN MARKETING - EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS
   OF HAZARD RATE MODELS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Some statistical methods developed recently in the biometrics and econometrics literature show great promise for improving the analysis of duration times in marketing. They incorporate the right censoring that is prevalent in duration times data, and can be used to make a wide variety of useful predictions. Both of these features make these methods preferable to the regression, logit, and discriminant analyses that marketers have typically used in analyzing durations.
   This paper is intended to fulfill three objectives. First, we demonstrate how decision situations that involve durations differ from other marketing phenomena. Second, we show how standard modeling approaches to handle duration times can break down because of the peculiarities inherent in durations. It has been suggested in recent marketing articles that an alternative to these conventional procedures, i.e., hazard rate models and proportional hazard regression, can more effectively handle duration type data. Third, to investigate whether these proposed benefits are in fact delivered for marketing durations data, we estimate and validate both conventional and hazard rate models for household interpurchase times of saltine crackers. Our findings indicate the superiority of proportional hazard regression methods vis-a-vis common procedures in terms of stability and face validity of the estimates and in predictive accuracy.

SO MARKETING SCIENCE

Analytic as well as simulation results relate the statistical power of the test to the allocation of sample observations to estimation and validation subsets. The results indicate that splitting the data into halves is suboptimal. More observations should be used for estimation than validation. Furthermore, the proportion of the sample optimally devoted to validation is small for very limited samples (N < 20), increases to about 40% for medium-sized samples and decreases again for large samples (N > 60). However, although the 50/50 split is suboptimal, it is not tremendously so in a wide variety of circumstances.

TI THE VOICE OF THE CUSTOMER
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In recent years, many U.S. and Japanese firms have adopted Quality Function Deployment (QFD). QFD is a total-quality-management process in which the ''voice of the customer'' is deployed throughout the R&D, engineering, and manufacturing stages of product development. For example, in the first ''house'' of QFD, customer needs are linked to design attributes thus encouraging the joint consideration of marketing issues and engineering issues. This paper focuses on the ''Voice-of-the-Customer'' component of QFD, that is, the tasks of identifying customer needs, structuring customer needs, and providing priorities for customer needs.
   In the identification stage, we address the questions of (1) how many customers need be interviewed, (2) how many analysts need to read the transcripts, (3) how many customer needs do we miss, and (4) are focus groups or one-on-one interviews superior? In the structuring stage the customer needs are arrayed into a hierarchy of primary, secondary, and tertiary needs. We compare group consensus (affinity) charts, a technique which accounts for most industry applications, with a technique based on customer-sort data. In the stage which provides priorities we present new data in which product concepts were created by product-development experts such that each concept stressed the fulfillment of one primary customer need. Customer interest in and preference for these concepts are compared to measured and estimated importances. We also address the question of whether frequency of mention can be used as a surrogate for importance. Finally, we examine the stated goal of QFD, customer satisfaction. Our data demonstrate a self-selection bias in satisfaction measures that are used commonly for QFD and for corporate incentive programs.
   We close with a brief application to illustrate how a product-development team used the voice of the customer to create a successful new product.

TI THE MEASUREMENT AND DETERMINANTS OF BRAND EQUITY - A FINANCIAL APPROACH
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper presents a technique for estimating a firm's brand equity that is based on the financial market value of the firm. Brand equity is defined as the incremental cash flows which accrue to branded products over unbranded products. The estimation technique extracts the value of brand equity from the value of the firm's other assets.
   This technique is useful for two purposes. First, the macro approach assigns an objective value to a company's brands and relates this value to the determinants of brand equity. Second, the micro approach isolates changes in brand equity at the individual brand level by measuring the response of brand equity to major marketing decisions.
   Empirically, we estimate brand equity using the macro approach for a sample of industries and companies. Then we use the micro approach to trace the brand equity of Coca-Cola and Pepsi over three major events in the soft drink industry from 1982 to 1986.

TI SCALE AND SCOPE EFFECTS ON ADVERTISING AGENCY COSTS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Economies of scale are evident when a firm's average costs decline while its output expands, as when an advertising agency raises its gross income by serving more accounts and/or larger accounts. Economies of scope appear when cost savings can be realized by a single agency producing several products jointly, as compared to many agencies each producing them separately. How important are economies of scale and scope in advertising agency operations? In this paper cost models are formulated which represent how the principal component of agency costs, employment level, varies according to the mix of media and services an agency provides and the total volume of advertising it produces. These models are estimated and tested cross-sectionally utilizing data pertaining to the domestic operations of 401 U.S. agencies for 1987.
   The empirical evidence reported here indicates that both scale and particularly scope economies are highly significant in the operations of U.S. advertising agencies. We find that of the 12,000 establishments comprising the industry in 1987, approximately 200-250 had domestic gross incomes of $3-4 million or more (or equivalently, billings of $20-27 million) and therefore had service mixes and operating levels sufficiently large to take full advantage of all available size-related efficiencies. Furthermore, the overall structure of the industry is one where these large, fully efficient firms created and produced more than half of all the national advertising utilized in the U.S. during 1987. At the same time, vast numbers of very small agencies appear to operate with substantial cost disadvantages compared to large firms as a consequence of these scale and scope economies.
   These findings carry important implications concerning possible future changes in the industry structure. It seems highly doubtful that scale economies could motivate further mergers among the largest 200-250 agencies. On the other hand, for small agencies, mergers and acquisitions might be attractive as means of mitigating their size-related cost disadvantages. Finally, our findings demonstrating the existence of scale and scope economics are consistent with the diminishing reliance on fixed rates of media commissions as the principal basis of agency compensation. They also cast strong doubts on size-related economies in operating costs as a viable explanation for the limited degree of vertical integration of agency services by large advertisers.

TI AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION OF RETURNS TO SEARCH
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Using data on search and choice behavior from a local automobile market, we estimate monetary returns to search in terms of lower prices resulting from additional time invested in price search. For our analytical framework, we adapt a model developed in the job search literature to the problem of consumer search; this framework is especially useful for illuminating the relationship between time spent searching, the outcome of search, and demand and supply side variables. Our results indicate that, for this particular sample of buyers, marginal returns to search are broadly consistent with what one might expect if consumers balance costs and benefits of search, and that potential gains from additional search for lower car prices do not appear to be large for most consumers. Our study highlights many of the methodological difficulties involved in estimating returns to search, including isolating returns to different outcomes of search, and sensitivity of results to model specification and sampling error. We deal with these problems by trying to isolate time spent searching for price from other uses of search time, by deriving our model used in estimation from a specific conceptual framework, and by extensive specification testing.

TI PREDICTING ADVERTISING PULSING POLICIES IN AN OLIGOPOLY - A MODEL AND
   EMPIRICAL-TEST
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Given that firms pulse in advertising, should firms pulse in or out of phase? It is shown that out of phase maximizes the oligopoly profits and is also the Markov perfect equilibrium of the infinite horizon game. The basic intuition for this result comes from the following fact: it is more profitable to increase consideration when the competitor's consideration is lower.
   Evidence from several product categories seems to support this theoretical result.

TI AN EMPIRICAL POOLING APPROACH FOR ESTIMATING MARKETING MIX ELASTICITIES
   WITH PIMS DATA
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The PIMS (Profit Impact of Marketing Strategies) data entail sparse time-series observations for a large number of strategic business units (SBUs). In order to estimate disaggregate marketing mix elasticities of demand, a natural solution is to pool different SBUs. The traditional, a priori approach is to pool together those SBUs which one believes in advance to be very similar with respect to their marketing mix elasticities. We propose an alternative maximum likelihood, latent-pooling method for simultaneously pooling, estimating, and testing linear regression models empirically. This method enables the determination of a ''fuzzy'' pooling scheme, while directly estimating a set of marketing mix elasticities and intertemporal covariances for each pool of SBUs. Our analyses reveal different magnitudes and patterns of marketing mix elasticities for the derived pools. Pool membership is influenced by demand characteristics, business scope, and order of market entry.

TI STRUCTURING A MULTIPRODUCT SALES QUOTA BONUS PLAN FOR A HETEROGENEOUS
   SALES FORCE - A PRACTICAL MODEL-BASED APPROACH
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper presents an agency theoretic model-based approach that assists sales managers in determining the profit-maximizing structure of a common multiproduct sales quota-bonus plan for a geographically specialized heterogeneous sales force operating in a repetitive buying environment. This approach involves estimating each salesperson's utility function for income and effort and using these models to predict individual sales achievements and the associated aggregate profit for the firm under a specified plan. The utility function estimation is based on the salesperson's own preference rank-ordering of alternative sales quota-bonus plans. Once these functions have been estimated, they are incorporated in a mathematical programming model that the sales manager can use to determine the best plan. The authors demonstrate the approach in the context of a case involving the design of a two-product sales quota-bonus plan for a set of salespeople at a pharmaceutical products firm.

TI THE EFFECT OF PACKAGE COUPONS ON BRAND CHOICE
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We propose a stochastic choice model, and supporting empirical analyses, to understand the effect of package coupons on brand choice. Package coupons can be broadly classified into three types: peel off coupons, on-pack coupons, and in-pack coupons. Our model helps understand the relative impact of these three types of coupons on market share. We find that on-pack coupons may lead to a higher market share than peel-off coupons. What makes this result potentially interesting is that while the benefit of a peel-off coupon is realized immediately, the consumer has to wait until the next purchase occasion to cash in the benefit of an on-pack coupon. Though we primarily examine situations where package coupons are dropped frequently, a scenario that is quite representative of today's marketplace, we show that our results are also applicable when a manager is evaluating a particular coupon campaign. We compare the key predictions of our model with data collected from a series of in-store quasi-experiments. The data are consistent with the model's predictions.

TI SIGNALING QUALITY BY SELLING THROUGH A REPUTABLE RETAILER - AN EXAMPLE
   OF RENTING THE REPUTATION OF ANOTHER AGENT
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper gives an example of renting the reputation of another agent to signal quality. We show that in a ''maximally'' separating equilibrium, manufacturers of high quality products distribute through retailers with strong reputation (reputable retailers), while manufacturers of low quality products distribute through retailers with no reputation (discounters). In this way, even if high quality manufacturers have no reputation of their own to post as bond, they can signal quality by posting the reputation of the retailers. In equilibrium, reputable retailers never default on their reputation. We also show that it pays the retailers to invest in reputation, as reputable retailers earn profits bounded away from zero under endogenous sequential entry, while the discounters' profits are zero.

TI SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY - SHOULD COMPETITORS SHARE THE SAME ADVERTISING
   AGENCY
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The possibility of account conflicts is generally regarded as a very serious problem in the advertising industry. The problem is that once an advertising agency works for a firm it learns private information which it can use strategically, i.e., make available to the firm's competitors. But, in oligopolistic situations, knowing more about a competitor may not necessarily be beneficial, because the competitor may react to this knowledge. Similarly, allowing the competitor to have more information may not necessarily be detrimental. In fact, the decision of whether to share the same agency depends on three effects, which are identified here: (1) the decision-making framework effect, (2) the strategic effect, and (3) the uncertainty effect. The first effect always favors sharing the same agency. The direction of the latter two effects is ambiguous. This ambiguity is resolved against the sharing of agencies when (1) the competitor's reaction to the firm's situation is especially harmful in that particular situation (strategic effect) and (2) the competitor's actions are increasingly harmful (uncertainty effect).

TI WHY THE BASS MODEL FITS WITHOUT DECISION VARIABLES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Over a large number of new products and technological innovations, the Bass diffusion model (Bass 1969) describes the empirical adoption curve quite well.  In this study, we generalize the Bass model to include decision variables such as price and advertising.  The generalized model reduces to the Bass model as a special case and explains why the Bass model works so well without including decision variables.  We compare our generalized Bass model to other approaches from the literature for including decision variables into diffusion models, and our results provide both theoretical and empirical support for the generalized Bass model.  We also show how our generalized Bass model can be used for product planning purposes.

TI ANALYSIS OF NEW PRODUCT DIFFUSION USING A 4-SEGMENT TRIAL-REPEAT MODEL
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A four segment trial-repeat model is developed to model sales of a frequently purchased product in the early stage of the product's life cycle.  The model can be calibrated using aggregate data alone.  Two versions of the model, one emphasizing the competitive aspect of marketing communications and another emphasizing the informative aspect, are estimated from data on 21 newly launched pharmaceutical products.  The model provides valuable diagnostics such as an early estimate of the long-run market share of the new product, a decomposition of total sales (into trial sales due to marketing activities, trial sales due to word-of-mouth, and repeat sales), the changing composition of the trial market and repeat market over time, and the time when the trial market is expected to be saturated.  In addition, the effectiveness of the entrant's marketing efforts, word-of-mouth communication, and buyers' trial experience are analyzed with the model.  A cross-sectional analysis based on the empirical estimation results of our model reveals interesting insights into product introduction strategies.  We find that:  1) the effectiveness of the firms' communication activities on trial is related mainly to product quality attributes and market growth whereas that of word-of-mouth is associated with product class characteristics and market competitiveness, and 2) the effect of product trial on repeat purchases is related mainly to product quality attributes and various market characteristics such as size, growth, competitiveness, and familiarity.

TI COMPETITIVE POSITIONING IN MARKETS WITH NONUNIFORM PREFERENCES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We investigate the nature of competitive equilibrium for brands competing in a multi-attribute product space when consumer preferences for product attributes follow nonuniform distributions. We establish subgame-perfect equilibria in a two-stage game, where firms choose positions in the first stage and prices in the second stage. Two types of entry scenarios are investigated. In the first, the number of brands is given exogenously, and all of them choose positions simultaneously. In the second scenario, firms enter in sequence, and the early entrants can choose strategies to deter the entry of later entrants. We find the equilibria for two, three, and four brands for consumer preferences that follow a beta distribution. Nonuniform distributions results in equilibrium configurations that are substantially different from those obtained for uniform consumer distributions. In the two brands case, for sufficiently concentrated distributions we find asymmetric position equilibria with one firm at the corner of the market and one firm at an interior position. In the case of three brands, for sufficiently concentrated preferences we find symmetric equilibria that do not yield maximal differentiation. We also establish an equilibrium for the case of four competing brands. In addition we characterize entry deterring positioning strategies and examine how they vary with the distribution of consumer preferences.

TI A MODEL OF STOCHASTIC VARIETY-SEEKING
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In this paper, we propose and test a stochastic model of consumer choice that incorporates attribute-based variety seeking.  Our stochastic variety-seeking model (SVS) has nested within it a fixed variety-seeking model, a zero-order model of choice, and a first-order (''pure variety'') model.  We compare the SVS model to alternative models.  Under stochastic variety seeking, we examine the nature of the variety sought and provide a test of the ''station'' hypothesis.
   Unlike fixed variety-seeking models, our model allows variety seeking to vary in intensity and consistency over individuals as well as over purchase occasions.  We show that the model is equivalent to a random utility model with the features that the attributes of brands relative to those of the brand previously bought influence choice, and the extent of variety seeking is random over choice occasions for a given individual.  The model permits a closed-form solution to the conditional switching probabilities parameterized by variety-seeking parameters, and dependent on brand attributes.  We apply our model to individual choice data obtained from a field study specifically designed for the purpose at hand.

Since these costs are sunk at the moment of trade, buyers may refrain from incurring them for fear of later opportunism on the part of sellers.  It is found that the use of many common selling formats can be explained in terms of their ability to alleviate this problem.  Specifically, I explain price advertising, seller colocation, and bargaining.  The theory explains much of the divergence in retail trading institutions and leads to several testable predictions.

TI NONLINEAR PRICING TO PRODUCE INFORMATION
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We investigate the firm's dynamic nonlinear pricing problem when facing consumers whose tastes vary according to a scalar index.  We relax the standard assumption that the firm knows the distribution of this index.  In general the firm should determine its marginal price schedule as if it were myopic, and produce information by lowering the price schedule; ''bunching'' consumers at positive purchase levels should be avoided.
   As a special case we also consider a market characterized by homogeneous consumers with a static, but unknown, demand curve.  We show that when there are repeat purchases the forward-looking firm should tend towards penetration pricing; otherwise its strategy should tend towards skimming.  We extend our insights to more general settings and discuss implications for pricing product lines.

TI CUSTOMER SATISFACTION INCENTIVES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Customer satisfaction incentive schemes are increasingly common in a variety of industries.  We offer explanations as to how and when incenting employees on customer satisfaction is profitable and offer several recommendations for improving upon current practice.  Faced with employee groups (including managers) who may have shorter time horizons than the firm, such systems enable a firm to use customer reaction to monitor implicitly how employees allocate effort between the short and long terms.  These systems can be used to encourage employees to make tradeoffs that are in the best interests of the firm.
   We derive optimal reward systems for an equilibrium in which the firm maximizes profits, employees maximize their expected utility, and customers choose purchase quantities based on initial reputations, employee efforts (both ephemeral and enduring), and price.  The formal model shows how the reliance placed on customer satisfaction in an incentive scheme should depend upon the precision with which customer satisfaction is measured and the extent to which employees focus on the short term.  Recommendations for improving upon current practice include:  measure customers, former customers, and potential customers; measure satisfaction with competitors' products; disaggregate satisfaction to reflect better the performance of employee groups; and, when different customer segments have different switching costs or they vary in the precision with which their satisfaction can be measured, then measure the segments separately and assign different weights in the incentive plan.
   Throughout the paper we interpret the formal results based on our experience with actual firms and the current literature.  We close with a brief discussion of on-going research at field sites.

TI THE IMPACT OF DEALING PATTERNS ON PURCHASE BEHAVIOR
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We explore the effect of dealing patterns on consumer purchase behavior by developing a normative purchase quantity model that can incorporate any dealing pattern.  The model adds to the stream of research on optimal purchasing policy by demonstrating how dealing patterns can be incorporated in a simple manner in dynamic programming models.  Implications for purchase behavior are derived by employing the model in a numerical simulation in which time between deals is characterized by a Weibull distribution.  The flexibility of the Weibull distribution enables us to establish how particular facets of the dealing distribution (e.g., certainty in deal timing, minimum time between deals) affect consumer behavior with respect to optimal purchase quantity, inventory, etc.  One of the implications of the model is that the average quantity purchased on deal should be larger when there is greater certainty in deal timing.  The model also shows that the average quantity purchased on deal should be larger when deals are spaced further apart, even though the buyer is presented with the same number of deals.  We test certain model implications in a laboratory experiment and find actual behavior varying across dealing patterns in a manner consistent with model implications.

SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In increasingly competitive and deregulated service environments, telecommunications service providers are interested in using advertising to stimulate usage. Measuring response in telephone usage to advertising presents difficulties because the effects are likely to be small, and the usage exhibits high variability. The substantive question of whether advertising has any effect on telephone usage is addressed through a systematic analytical process that combines exploratory data analysis with formal modeling. We find that telephone usage does respond to advertising, that this response can be quantified, and that households with heavy usage of telephone service respond proportionally more than light usage households.

TI WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOUR COMPETITORS SEND IN THE CLONES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper develops a model to address an important problem facing a manufacturer of a durable product. That is, how can it plan its new product introductions to minimize the obsolescence of the old product, preserve its market for the new product, and keep copycat products at bay? We analyze these issues by developing a two-period model in which a firm sells an ''old'' product in period 1 and a ''new'' product in period 2. We consider various new product introduction strategies such as product replacement, line extension, and upgrading. We find that the optimal response to a threat of competitive clones is to increase the level of product innovation. This increase in innovation coupled with the entry of a competitive product implies that the incumbent firm has less of an incentive to leapfrog the old product or shelve the new product.

TI ADOPTION, TRANSFERS, AND INCENTIVES IN A FRANCHISE NETWORK WITH POSITIVE
   EXTERNALITIES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We study franchise arrangements that allow franchisees with exclusive territories to own their customers.  This permits franchisees to benefit from positive externalities in the franchise network through interfranchise transfers based on the purchases by their customers at other franchises on the network.  Using the structure of a single franchisor and many franchisees, we show that, in general, interfranchise transfers between franchisees and incentives for franchisee investment in the expansion of their customer base are critical both to the size and to the benefits derived from the franchise network.  Specifically, we find that when individual franchisees make investments in marketing effort to increase their customer base, the franchisor's setting of the interfranchise transfer trades off the positive effects on network size with the negative effects of removing franchisee incentive for investment.  This result is due to the fact that interfranchise transfers encourage adoption, but discourage full investment in marketing effort.  As compared to first-best franchisee investment, use of the royalty and the inter-franchise transfer directly dissipates franchisee profits, and indirectly dissipates franchisee profits through less than universal adoption, thereby causing franchisees to underinvest.  As compared to traditional franchise systems, however, use of the interfranchise transfer results in franchises making greater investments than they otherwise would.

TI GAINING MORE BY STOCKING LESS A COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS OF PRODUCT
   AVAILABILITY
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The price competition between two firms can affect their decisions about product availability. With occasional stockouts a firm loses from foregone sales, yet it may indirectly benefit from the higher price a competitor is able to charge. The more prone customers are to search elsewhere for the product upon encountering a stockout, the greater is the gain from the reduced price competition between firms.
   This paper establishes conditions whereby the strategic interaction of reduced price competition between firms outweighs the loss from foregone sales. In such cases, a firm can increase its expected profits by choosing to stock less. These results provide a competitive rationale for the high stockout levels observed in some retail situations and have implications for the analysis of product availability in public policy settings.

TI EXPERIMENTAL-EVIDENCE ON THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF PRODUCT FEATURES AND
   SALES PROMOTIONS ON BRAND CHOICE
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Sales promotions and product enhancements are commonly expected to increase a brand's sales, when they do not negatively impact its utility and cost. That is, the purchase probability of consumers who find the promotion or additional feature attractive will increase, whereas the purchase likelihood of other consumers will not be affected. In contrast, we propose that consumers, who perceive a new feature or promotion as providing little or no value, will be less likely to purchase the enhanced brand even when the added feature clearly does not diminish the value of the brand. Thus, a new product feature or promotion may decrease a brand's overall choice probability when the segment of consumers who perceive it as providing little or no value is large compared to the segment that finds the feature attractive. This prediction was supported in three studies using actual promotions that have been employed in the marketplace (e.g., a Doughboy Collector's Plate that buyers of Pillsbury cake mix had the option to purchase for $6.19). We examined five alternative explanations for this effect. The results suggest that, when consumers are uncertain about the values of products and about their preferences, such features and premiums provide reasons against buying the promoted brands and are seen as susceptible to criticism. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings for segmentation, product, promotional, and pricing strategies.

TI CUSTOMER BASE ANALYSIS - AN INDUSTRIAL PURCHASE PROCESS APPLICATION
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB customer base analysis is concerned with using the observed past Purchase behavior of customers to understand their current and likely future purchase patterns. More specifically, as developed in Schmittlein et al. (1987), customer base analysis uses data on the frequency, timing, and dollar value of each customer's past purchases to infer the number of customers currently active, how that number has changed over time, which individual customers are most likely still active, how much longer each is likely to remain an active customer, and how many purchases can be expected from each during any future time period of interest.
   In this paper we empirically validate the model proposed by Schmittlein et al. In doing so, we provide one of the few applications of stochastic models to industrial purchase processes and industrial marketing decisions. Besides showing that the model does capture key aspects of the purchase process, we also present a more effective parameter estimation method and some results regarding sampling properties of the parameter estimates. Finally, we extend the model to explicitly incorporate dollar volume of past purchases.
   Our results indicate that this kind of customer base analysis can be both effective in predicting purchase patterns and in generating insights into how key customer groups differ. The link of both these benefits to industrial marketing decision making is also discussed.

The products are differentiated and the map identifying the best match between a consumer's situation and a product is known only to the sales assistant. I look at procedure which involves the consumer revealing his needs and the sales assistant identifying the best matching product. This is compared to several other procedures and found to be best when the number of possible consumer situations is large. It is shown that reputational considerations may keep the sales assistant honest. I look at the impact of guarantees and other modifications to the model and discuss normative implications.

TI THE GOVERNANCE OF EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIES WHEN DEALERS CAN BOOTLEG
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A transaction cost approach is used to investigate a manufacturer's policy towards exclusive territory dealers who bootleg (sell across their assigned territories). We show that optimal enforcement policies will generally tolerate some level of bootlegging. This tolerance is a natural consequence of the transaction cost principle that institutional arrangements are not fully enforceable, and that self-enforcing implicit agreements will require some degree of tolerance. The actual degree of tolerance is determined by (a) the importance of reseller services, (b) the reduction in margin realized from surreptitious sales, and (c) the resellers' beliefs about the manufacturer's long-run commitment to the channel. We also show that deploying exclusive territories is beneficial to the manufacturer because it safeguards reseller services and permits resellers to capitalize on their superior local information. However, the latter effect is contingent on being able to convince resellers of the manufacturer's long run commitment to the channel.

TI DURABLE-GOODS MONOPOLISTS, RATIONAL CONSUMERS, AND IMPROVING PRODUCTS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We consider the case of a monopolist Supplying an improving durable product to a population that is heterogeneous in its valuation of product quality. In a two-period framework, we show that if consumers expect the product to improve in ''present-value'' terms, then intertemporal discrimination might result in the first-period marginal consumer being left with zero surplus and some higher-end consumers postponing purchase. The resulting trajectories for quality and price do not constitute a subgame-perfect equilibrium.
   One of our conclusions is that the logic of profit maximization in the context of rational consumer choice imposes a demand-side constraint on the rate of product improvement. We also emphasize the disequilibrium consequences of improving a product so rapidly that high-end consumers are tempted to wait for a future new-and-improved version. Finally, the formulation adopted in the paper may be useful to understand observed differences in product improvement rates in different markets.

TI ATTRIBUTE IMPORTANCE WEIGHTS MODIFICATION IN ASSESSING A BRANDS
   COMPETITIVE POTENTIAL
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Increasingly, researchers in marketing are recognizing the ''lability'' of attribute importance weights derived from measurement techniques, such as conjoint analysis. As has been suggested by Simonson and Tversky, attribute importance weights can be sensitive to competitive product context and to purchase situation.
   This paper describes and applies a procedure for adjusting conjoint importance weights to predict consumers' actual or potential product choices. We discuss the approach from both a descriptive and prescriptive viewpoint. In particular, the latter perspective provides strategic insights into how attribute importance modifications can increase brand share. An industry case, based on real data, is used to illustrate the approach.

TI TACKLING THE RETAILER DECISION MAZE - WHICH BRANDS TO DISCOUNT, HOW
   MUCH, WHEN AND WHY
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We propose a model that seeks the optimal timing and depth of retail discounts with the optimal timing and quantity of the retailer's order over multiple brands and time periods. The model is based on an integration of consumer decisions in purchase incidence, brand choice and quantity with the dynamics of household and retail inventory. The major contribution of the model is that it shows how the optimum depth and timing of discount varies with key demand characteristics such as consumer stockpiling, loyalty, response to the marketing mix, and segmentation. In addition, the optima also vary with key supply characteristics such as retail margins, depth and frequency of manufacturer deals, retail inventory, and retagging costs. The most valuable contribution of the model is that it can provide an optimal discount strategy for multiple brands over multiple time periods.
   The optimization model runs on a user-friendly personal computer program. An application based on UPC scanner data illustrates the model's uses. Sensitivity analyses of the optimization model under alternative scenarios reveal novel insights as to how optimal discounts vary as a function of the key demand and supply characteristics.

TI A NONPARAMETRIC DENSITY-ESTIMATION METHOD FOR BRAND CHOICE USING SCANNER
   DATA
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Nonparametric density estimation using a kernel method is proposed to model consumer brand choice. Recent availability of large scanner panel data allows the use of nonparametric approach, which has few or at least fewer underlying assumptions and affords greater structural flexibility. By removing as many assumptions as possible, the author constructs the ''ultimate'' nonparametric model, radically departing from the traditional approaches, to highlight the differences in implementation and performance, The proposed model does not involve either parameters that approximate certain distributions as in stochastic models or latent concepts such as utility as in utility maximization models. The performance criteria include prediction of market response and brand choice, share tracking, and robustness under violation of various assumptions involved in parametric choice models, such as correlated disturbance and misspecification. The method is compared with a popular parametric counterpart, the multinomial logit model, on simulated and actual scanner panel data. The paper emphasizes the conceptual importance of the nonparametric approach by discussing its advantages, limitations, and its complementary role in developing, refining, and diagnosing parametric models. This perspective affords insight to modeling philosophy and suggests the possibility of a hybrid approach,

TI THE SPATIAL REPRESENTATION OF HETEROGENEOUS CONSIDERATION SETS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consideration sets have been the recent focus of a large volume of research in marketing. The primary orientation of this stream of research has been toward consideration set composition, measurement, and the theoretical formation process itself. This paper proposes a new multidimensional scaling methodology (MDS) devised to spatially represent preference intensity collected over consumers' consideration sets. Predictions concerning the probability of consideration set membership, as well as the degree of preference intensity of these brands within a consideration set, are possible from such a model. In addition, consumer heterogeneity is accommodated vis a vis latent market segment level estimation. The technical details of the proposed MDS methodology are presented. Two actual commercial applications of the procedure are provided in the modeling of consideration sets and respective preference intensity for ''intenders'' for mid-size and luxury automobiles. Finally, limitations and directions for future research in this area are discussed.

TI Channel coordination mechanisms for customer satisfaction
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We consider two broad categories of incentives by which a manufacturer can motivate its retailers to provide high customer satisfaction: (1) manufacturer assistance that reduces the retailer's cost of providing customer satisfaction (CS assistance); and (2) customer satisfaction index (CSI) bonus. We show that if a retailer has a long-term orientation, CS assistance is a more effective coordination mechanism that induces the retailer to expend more effort at customer satisfaction. However, if the retailer has a short-term orientation, CSI bonus is a more effective coordination mechanism. We then show that a long-term oriented retailer is more valuable to a manufacturer than a short-term oriented one. Finally, we show that the use of CS incentives results in greater profits for both the manufacturer and the retailer.

TI Channel coordination when retailers compete
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper explores channel coordination by a manufacturer that sells through competing retailers and that treats these retailers equally, as required by the Robinson-Patman Act. The authors show that, in general, there exists no single two-part tariff with a constant per-unit charge that will duplicate the behavioral results (i.e., prices, quantities, and channel profits) that are obtained by a vertically integrated system; that is, the channel cannot be coordinated except in the trivial cases of identical or noncompeting retailers. However, an appropriately specified quantity-discount schedule will enable the channel to earn the same profits generated by a vertically integrated system. Conditions are derived under which a manufacturer will prefer to offer various two-part tariffs with constant per-unit charges instead of the channel-coordinating quantity-discount schedule.
   The authors also establish the existence of a menu of two-part tariffs that mimics all results of a vertically integrated system. However, only under stringent conditions will retailers select the appropriate tariff from the menu. When these conditions are not satisfied, the channel is worse off than in the case of a single, second-best tariff. It is also demonstrated that under a wide range of parametric values the manufacturer will prefer to offer the second-best two-part tariff rather than a menu of two-part tariffs that could maximize channel profits.

TI Optimal selection for direct mail
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Direct marketing (mail) is a growing area of marketing practice, yet the academic journals contain very little research on this topic. The most important issue for direct marketers is how to sample targets from a population for a direct mail campaign. Although some selection methods are described in the literature, there seems to be not a single paper discussing the analytical and statistical aspects involved. The objective of this paper is to introduce a comprehensive methodology for the selection of targets from a mailing list for direct mail. At least theoretically, this methodology leads to more efficient selection procedures than the existing ones. The latter are not based on an optimal selection strategy, whereas we explicitly take the profit function into account. By equating marginal costs and marginal returns we determine which households should receive a mailing in order to maximize expected profit. In the empirical part we show that our methodology has great predictive accuracy and generates higher net returns than traditional approaches.

TI Competitive coupon targeting
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB With the advent of panel data on household purchase behavior, and the development of statistical procedures to utilize this data, firms can now target coupons to selected households with considerable accuracy and cost effectiveness. In this article, we develop an analytical framework to examine the effect of such targeting on firm profits, prices, and coupon face values. We also derive comparative statics on firms' optimal mix of offensive and defensive couponing, the number of coupons distributed, redemption rates, face values, and incremental sales per redemption. Among our findings: when rival firms can target their coupon promotions at brand switchers, the outcome will be a prisoner's dilemma in which the net effect of targeting is simply the cost of distribution plus the discount given to redeemers.

TI Why do we observe minimal warranties?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Why is it that some products carry a minimal manufacturer base warranty even though all consumers are risk-averse? Conventional wisdom suggests that it is profitable for the manufacturer to offer a comprehensive warranty tn this setting. We provide in this paper an explanation for the provision of minimal warranty in markets where all consumers are risk-averse. Minimal warranties are created by the impact of consumer moral hazard and competition in the insurance after-market for the product. We show that consumers who purchase optional extended warranties from an independent provider of insurance create a significant negative externality on the warranty redemption costs of the manufacturer. This, in turn, creates a significant erosion in the manufacturer's profits from warranty insurance. Consequently, it is in the best interest of the manufacturer to drop the level of warranty coverage provided with the product. This intuition holds for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous markets of consumers.

TI Signaling quality with a money-back guarantee: The role of transaction
   costs
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
CT Marketing Science Conference
CY JUL, 1992
CL LONDON, ENGLAND
AB Direct marketing is witnessing explosive growth. As consumers increasingly purchase products from their homes, their ability to judge the quality of products they buy is significantly reduced. In this paper we study how money-back guarantees can signal product quality in such environments. We interpret product quality broadly to mean both the level of attributes promised as well as the firm's consistency in delivering on those promises. Key aspects of our formulation are the explicit consideration of transaction costs, and alternative signals of product quality. Transaction costs are the costs the seller or buyer faces when redeeming a money-back guarantee. We show that money-back guarantees signal quality by exploiting the higher probability of returns for a lower quality product, and the attendant higher transaction costs. However, if the seller's transaction costs are very large, then there are less costly ways to signal, namely charging a high price. We compare the signaling performance of (1)price, (2) price with uninformative advertising, and (3) price with a money-back guarantee. Whereas uninformative advertising does not work at all in our model, under certain conditions a money-back guarantee is necessary to signal, and under other conditions, a money-back guarantee is a useful supplement to price.

AB Marketing has matured to the point where it seems desirable to take stock of where we are, what we have learned, and fruitful directions for extending the knowledge base that has developed. Science is a process involving the interaction between empirical generalizations and theory. An empirical generalization is ''a pattern or regularity that repeats over different circumstances and that can be described simply by mathematical, graphic, or symbolic methods.'' One of the purposes of the Empirical Generalizations Conference held at Wharton on February 16-18, 1994 was to develop a list of examples of such empirical generalizations in marketing. Empirical generalization can precede a theory to explain it or it can be predicted by a theory. Science is the process of interaction between theory and data that leads to higher level theories. Examples are provided here of empirical generalizations in marketing and their theoretical counterparts. One example is provided of a higher level theory.

CY FEB 16-18, 1994
CL PHILADELPHIA, PA
SP Univ Penn, Wharton Sch
AB This paper provides an approach for assessing generalizable effects of strategic actions on firm performance. We identify five key issues that need to be addressed before one can have confidence in the obtained strategic generalization. In addition, we suggest a methodology for attacking each of these five issues. We then illustrate this framework using the example of demand-side returns to R&D spending.
   We document two empirical generalizations in this research, First and foremost, we show that demand returns to R&D spending depend on whether the firm has ability and motivation to take advantage of the R&D investment, Thus, only firms with high ability and motivation leverage the R&D investment into monopoly rents in the form of subsequent price increases, Second, we show that the concept of a firm needing both ability and motivation to sustain returns from a strategic action generalizes across strategic actions. We make two other conclusions about empirical approaches to strategy research. First, to produce valid empirical generalizations about the effects of strategic actions on firm performance requires a study to address adequately the five issues we establish herein. Second, one readily available strategy database, PIMS, enables the researcher to address each of these issues.

AB We present empirical generalizations about conditions under which marketing variables evolve or remain stationary. We first define evolution statistically and make the case why it is an important concept for increasing our understanding of long-run marketing effectiveness. We then briefly review ways in which evolution can be tested empirically from readily available data. We present a database of over 400 prior analyses and catalog the relative incidence of stationarity versus evolution in market performance and marketing spending. We find that evolution is the dominant characteristic for sales and marketing-mix spending, but that stationarity is the dominant characteristic for market share. Thus we find strong support for the conjecture that many markets are in a long-run equilibrium where the relative position of the players is only temporarily disturbed by their respective marketing activities. We assess the impact of a number of covariates on the likelihood of finding stationarity/evolution in sales and market share, and discuss the managerial implications of our findings.

CY FEB 16-18, 1994
CL PHILADELPHIA, PA
SP Univ Penn, Wharton Sch
AB In this paper we investigate how to make empirical generalizations in marketing. We argue that for substantive empirical generalizations to exist in an area, there should be a sufficient body of relevant research about recurring phenomena. We outline criteria and a procedure to search for and identify such generalizations, and we apply the procedure to the area of business marketing negotiations. We find that, in spite of a sizable literature on business marketing negotiations, there appears to be little overlap between what researchers have studied to date and many characteristics of real-world bargaining situations, We do identify one significant generalization: that bargainers who are problem solvers settle disputes more efficiently than those who take adversarial positions. However, we note that a significant theory-practice gap exists that must be bridged before more substantive generalizations can be identified in the area of business marketing negotiations. More broadly, we suggest that issues such as the sampling or selection of research studies and the match of reported research with real phenomena are serious concerns in our search for empirical generalizations in marketing and that it is not apparent that such generalizations exist in all marketing domains.

AB A decade of work in marketing meta-analysis has produced empirical generalizations concerning parameters in models of advertising, price, diffusion, and consumer behavior. Results from these meta-analyses should replace the now discredited zero null hypotheses of such parameters in future work. Probably more important than nonzero ''grand mean'' average effects is an approach called Parametric Adjustability, which provides estimated parameter values for specific conditions reflecting markets and research technologies. Systematic application of the methodology can also help guide research along productive routes and away from repetition of work which has little potential to add new knowledge.

AB As more nations add customer satisfaction-as a measure of quality of economic output-to what they presently collect about the economy, it becomes increasingly important to understand the role of customer satisfaction and its relationship to other economic measures. In an attempt to contribute to such an understanding, this paper presents two empirical generalizations about customer satisfaction. First, the distribution of customer satisfaction is negatively skewed. It is suggested that negative skewness is a condition for a free market. Second, the association between market share and customer satisfaction is not positive (and often negative) in cross sectional analysis. While challenging to firms that pursue both market share goals and increased customer satisfaction, the finding is consistent with fundamental economic theory and the strategy literature.

AB Considerable theoretical justification for consumers' use of psychological reference points exists from the research literature, From a managerial perspective, one of the most important applications of this concept is reference price, an internal standard against which observed prices are compared. In this paper, we propose three empirical generalizations that are well-supported in the marketing literature. First, there is ample evidence that consumers use reference prices in making brand choices. Second, the empirical results on reference pricing also support the generalization that consumers rely on past prices as part of the reference price formation process. Third, consistent with other research on loss aversion, consumers have been found to be more sensitive to ''losses,'' i.e. observed prices higher than reference prices, than ''gains.'' We also propose topics for further research on reference prices.

TI ORDER OF MARKET ENTRY - ESTABLISHED EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS, EMERGING

AB Three established and four emerging empirical generalizations are identified below. The first established generalization is that there is a negative relationship between order of market entry and market share. Second, for consumer packaged goods and prescription anti-ulcer drugs, the entrant's market share divided by the first entrant's share roughly equals one divided by the square root of order of market entry. Third, in mature markets, market pioneer share advantages slowly decline over time. While the emerging generalizations require additional research support, the initial findings suggest: (1) for consumer packaged goods, order of market entry has a stronger negative relationship with trial penetration than with repeat purchase; (2) market pioneers have broader product lines than late entrants; (3) skill and resource profiles differ across market pioneers, early followers, and late entrants; and (4) order of market entry is not related to long-term survival rates. Future research topics are also discussed.

SP Univ Penn, Wharton Sch
AB Consumers' sensitivities to price changes are an important input to strategic and tactical decisions. It has been argued that price sensitivities depend on factors such as advertising Prior studies on the effect of advertising on consumer price sensitivity have found seemingly conflicting results. We analyze the characteristics of previous studies in marketing and generate a set of three empirical generalizations. These are (1) an increase in price advertising leads to higher price sensitivity among consumers, (2) the use of price advertising leads to lower prices, and (3) an increase in nonprice advertising leads to lower price sensitivity among consumers. These generalizations have important implications for managers and researchers. Managers need to coordinate their advertising and pricing decisions to attain maximum profits. For researchers, our summary and discussion of empirical results provide directions for future.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between market share and promotional expenditures in the long run. Using data that span a decade and 91 product categories we find that market shares are stationary for a majority of the products in the data base. We find that relative promotional expenditures for the products are offsetting in the long run. Finally, for products whose market shares show a trend, it is difficult to discern the impact of relative promotional expenditure on the evolution of market share. This result generalizes the empirical finding of Bass et al. (1984) that ''... offsetting competitive activity plays a role in the maintenance of what appears to be stationary and zero order behavior.''

CY FEB 16-18, 1994
CL PHILADELPHIA, PA
SP Univ Penn, Wharton Sch
AB There are three classical measures of brand awareness: aided, spontaneous, and top-of-mind. The relationships between these measures, across a set of brands in the same product category, are close, but highly nonlinear. We show that these relationships can be linearized, in all product classes, by performing a logistic transformation on each measure. This amounts to describing the process by which consumers answer awareness questions by a Rasch model, originally proposed to describe the success of students in answering exam questions. The brand's salience is equivalent to the students' competence, and the difficulty of the awareness question is equivalent to the test difficulty. We briefly summarize the research process that led to this empirical generalization. Managerial implications are described, mainly linked to the diagnosis of ''locked'' versus ''open'' product categories.

AB This article reports on the first in-market experimentally based measurement of long-term TV advertising effects for a representative cross-section of 55 tests for established consumer packaged goods. The typical BehaviorScan(R) weight test has a test group exposed to a heavier TV advertising weight than a matched control group for a one-year period, after which the experiment stops. For this analysis, the two groups were tracked and analyzed for another two years, when the only difference between the two groups was the TV advertising treatment during the first year. The analysis shows that when TV weight increases had a significant impact during the year of the weight increases, during the following two years, on average, the sales impact of the first year is approximately double and, on average, it was from an increasing in buying rate in the test group. The analysis also shows that if TV weight increases had no significant impact during the first year, on average, they had no impact in the two following years.

TI EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS IN THE MODELING OF CONSUMER CHOICE
SO MARKETING SCIENCE

CY FEB 16-18, 1994
CL PHILADELPHIA, PA
SP Univ Penn, Wharton Sch
AB Are there general algebraic laws which describe how consumers make choices from sets of alternatives? In this paper we review the verdict of research which has sought to answer this question. We focus on the functional forms which have been found to best characterize three component processes of consumer choice: those of attribute valuation, attribute integration, and choice. Our central conclusion is that there exists support for three major generalizations about the form of consumer decision processes: (1) subjective attribute valuations are a nonlinear, reference-point dependent, function of the corresponding objective measure of product attributes; (2) the integration rule which best describes how these attribute valuations are integrated to form overall valuations is multiplicative-multilinear, characterizing an overweighting of negative attribute information; and (3) the choice rule which links overall valuations of an option to the likelihood that it is chosen from a set is a member of a family of functions which recognize the attribute-wise proximity of a considered alternative to others in the set. The evidence supporting these generalizations is reviewed, as well as their implications for future theoretical and applied work in consumer choice modeling.

CY FEB 16-18, 1994
CL PHILADELPHIA, PA
SP Univ Penn, Wharton Sch
AB This paper offers the generalization that competitive promotions are mixed strategies. First an empirical regularity is established that promotions are independent across competitors. This regularity is then elaborated on in the context of a promotion game. The promotion game is linked to observable outcomes, and a classification of possible situations is developed. In particular, the classification includes the prisoners' dilemma, battle of the sexes, and marketing models of promotion competition. The evidence for the generalization comes from a variety of product markets, spanning trade promotions, retail price reductions, and retail promotions such as advertised specials. The product markets include coffee, baby diapers, toilet tissue, saltines, dishwashing fluid, ketchup, and detergents, among others. The data in some cases were from cooperating grocery chains and in others from IRI scanner panels. The evidence from extant research and from new analyses is presented. Each situation is identified as belonging to one or another element of the classification. Based on the entirety of the evidence, there is strong support for the proposition that competitive promotions are mixed strategies. A second generalization, based on more limited data, is that the depth of promotion has a bimodal distribution. Implications of the generalizations both for managerial practice and future research are discussed.

TI MARKET SHARE AND DISTRIBUTION - A GENERALIZATION, A SPECULATION, AND
   SOME IMPLICATIONS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
CT Wharton Conference on Empirical Generalizations in Marketing
CY FEB 16-18, 1994
CL PHILADELPHIA, PA
SP Univ Penn, Wharton Sch
AB In this paper we review evidence of a generalized convex cross-sectional relationship between retail distribution and unit market share, i.e., large-share brands have more share points per percentage of distribution than small-share brands. The dynamics and structure of distribution and share can help explain many phenomena in marketing, including this convex shape: (1) market share is both a cause and an effect of distribution, and (2) in the typical convenience goods distribution system there are a few large outlets that stock many brands and numerous smaller outlets that stock the leading brands only. Generally, the observed cross-sectional ''curve'' relating distribution and share will reflect the retailers' stocking decisions, not the incremental effect of distribution on share. However, a logically consistent model of share based on (1) and (2),when combined with the assumption of low search loyalty, results in customers being willing to switch from preferred to available brands. A further consequence is that the marginal effect of weighted distribution on share is likely to be increasing, i.e., result in convex curves relating distribution and share for a given brand. In some cases, and for some measures of distribution, these convex curves have been observed in time-series data for brands that failed and lost distribution over a relatively short period of time. The implication is that marketers should monitor distribution carefully, as it is the result of combined effects of brand preference, loyalty, and ''push'' programs. With a better understanding of the market share/distribution relationship, managers should be in a better position to forecast marketplace results for a given level of distribution.

TI THE FORECASTERS DILEMMA
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Influential forecasts occur when the forecast itself determines whether the forecast is tested. New product sales forecasts are often influential because a low forecast may cause a firm not to launch a new product so that actual sales are never observed.
   This paper considers a dilemma we face as influential forecasters. Our client requests an unbiased forecast but pressures sometimes exist to provide a bias forecast. From theoretical and empirical perspectives, we discuss the impact of these pressures on the quality of forecasts. We find that:
   Noninfluential forecasts, generally, create no pressure for statistically biased forecasts.
   As influence increases, the pressures increase.
   When our forecasts eliminate alternatives, (e.g., product designs, advertising campaigns), not all forecasts are tested.
   Not validating all forecasts causes two effects: Survivor's Curse and Prophet's Fear.
   Survivor's Curse makes statistically unbiased forecasts appear optimistic (i.e., overestimate actual sales) because, often, only optimistic forecasts are tested.
   Forecasts appearing statistically unbiased or pessimistic might cause concern. Perhaps, some failures are justified.
   Prophet's Fear encourages pessimistic forecasts because these forecasts cause hidden opportunity losses while optimistic forecasts cause observable actual losses.
   Tested forecasts may appear completely unbiased despite a pessimistic pre-launch bias.
   Although no perfect solution exists, clients may lessen bias with experimentation and by seeking more accurate forecasts. Forecasters may lessen bias with forecasts conditioned on launching and by seeking more accurate forecasts.

Whether they are best off purchasing an assortment of alternatives or an equal number of one alternative is addressed in this paper. Models of an expected-utility-maximizing consumer are developed, and it is shown that an assortment may have greater expected utility than an equal number of any one alternative. The rationale is that the assortment allows the consumer to choose from inventory the alternative most appropriate for a consumption occasion using preference information not available at the purchase occasion. It is also shown that, when consuming alternatives from inventory, the consumer may forego the alternative offering the most utility in the expectation that it will yield even more utility in the future.

TI SIGNALING PRICE IMAGE USING ADVERTISED PRICES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper addresses the issue of retail price image by offering an explanation for how and when stores can use their advertised prices to signal the prices of other products in the store. A model of a two-product retail market is presented in which stores advertise the price of one product and customers do not know the price of the other product before selecting which store to visit. In a model with full customer information, stores with different marginal costs charge. different prices for each product When customers do not know each store's marginal cost type, an opportunity arises for each store to signal its cost type using its advertised prices. In such a model additional equilibria exist. In particular, stores with different costs may charge the same advertised price while continuing to charge different prices for the unadvertised product. Data from competing drycleaning stores is generally consistent with the model predictions. A number of additional properties of the equilibria are discussed and possible extensions to the model are proposed.

TI PRODUCT AND PRICE-COMPETITION IN A 2-DIMENSIONAL VERTICAL
   DIFFERENTIATION MODEL
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In this paper, the one-dimensional vertical differentiation model (Shaked and Sutton 1982, Moorthy 1988) is extended to two dimensions and an analysis of product and price competition is presented. A two-stage game theoretic analysis in which two firms compete first on product positions and then on price is conducted. Closed form equilibrium solutions are obtained for each stage in which competitors are unrestricted in their choices of price or product positions. A significant finding of this research is that unlike the one-dimensional vertical differentiation model, firms do not tend towards maximum differentiation, although this solution is possible under certain conditions. When the range of positioning options on each of the dimensions is equal, MaxMin product differentiation occurs. That is, in equilibrium, the two firms tend to choose positions which will represent maximum differentiation on one dimension and minimum differentiation on the other dimension.

TI THE PERSISTENCE OF MARKETING EFFECTS ON SALES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Are marketing efforts able to affect long-term trends in sales or other performance measures? Answering this question is essential for the creation of marketing strategies that deliver a sustainable competitive advantage. This paper introduces persistence modeling to derive long-term marketing effectiveness from time-series observations on sales and marketing expenditures. First, we use unit-root tests to determine whether sales are stable or evolving (trending) over time. If they are evolving, we examine how strong this evolution is (univariate persistence) and to what extent it can be related to marketing activity (multivariate persistence). An empirical example on sales and media spending for a chain of home-improvement stores reveals that some, but not all, advertising has strong trend-setting effects on sales. We argue that traditional modeling approaches would not pick up these effects and, therefore, seriously underestimate the long-term effectiveness of advertising. The paper concludes with an agenda for future empirical research on long-run marketing effectiveness.

In this paper, we develop a three-stage model of trade show performance, relying on different indices of performance at each stage: attraction, contact, and conversion efficiency. We model the impact of preshow promotion, booth space, use of attention-getting techniques, competition, number and training of booth salespeople on the extent of attraction, contact, and conversion. The results from an empirical application using data from 85 firms that participated in a major trade show in 1991 suggest significant and different impact of these variables. In addition, we illustrate how the model can be used to evaluate trade-offs among different decision variables. Finally, we develop some general results implied by our model concerning the optimal allocation of trade show resources.

Uncoordinated decisions of both manufacturer and retailer to charge high prices can break down the effort to expand the market, resulting in losses to the channel as a whole. We show that manufacturers can enhance channel price coordination by designing pull price discounts that target price-conscious consumers. The increased price coordination improves total channel profits and consumer surplus. Supporting pull with push increases the probability of coordination.

TI A HIGH-TECH PRODUCT MARKET SHARE MODEL WITH CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In a product category based on dynamic technology, new products enter the market in rapid succession, and the competitive situation changes almost daily. Because technological features of available products tend to improve while prices tend to decline, customers develop expectations that may influence their purchase decisions. We model the impact of customer expectations regarding price and technology on product market share in the personal computer industry, finding significant nonlinear effects of both. These effects are observed when actual product price and/or technology differ from expectations by a threshold amount. Our results suggest implementable implications for high-tech product managers: in particular, price and technology should meet, but not exceed, customer expectations. This does not mean that managers should strive for mediocrity; rather, continuous improvement should be implemented so that product development efforts lead customer expectations.

TI THE IMPACT OF REFERENCE PRICE EFFECTS ON THE PROFITABILITY OF PRICE
   PROMOTIONS
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper investigates the impact of reference price effects on retailer price promotions and describes why these effects can make promoting profitable. First, we analyze the profit impact of reference price effects generated by a single period of promotion. The promotion can increase profit if the gain that these effects create in the promotion period outweighs the loss they create in future periods. We then describe how retailers can estimate the optimal strategy of recurring promotions that maximizes profits from reference price effects over a time horizon. Examples of such strategies are presented for a retailer selling a national brand of peanut butter. We obtain insights into how promotion prices, timing and profits are affected by changes in costs, interest rates, consumers' reactions to reference price effects, and error in estimates used in the model. The retailer's optimal reaction to a trade deal is also examined. This strategy involves a phase of increased promotion activity sandwiched between phases of decreased activity. We explain these results using the effects described in the single-period model.

TI COMPETING COUPON PROMOTIONS AND CATEGORY SALES
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Recent reports show that manufacturers in many consumer product industries continue to use coupons as one of their main promotional tools. The rising intensity of coupon competitions, however, makes the issue of having better measures for coupon effects ever more important. This paper proposes a method to assess the category expansion effect in an environment where rival brands distribute coupons repeatedly over a period of time. A consumer utility maximization model is presented in which the decision of coupon use is endogenized along with the demand decision. Using single-source detergent data as benchmark, the proposed model is an advance over the conventional regression model in that the latter tend to produce upward-biased estimations for the category impact of coupons.

TI Decision-making under uncertainty: Capturing dynamic brand choice
   processes in turbulent consumer goods markets
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We construct two models of the behavior of consumers in an environment where there is uncertainty about brand attributes. In our models, both usage experience and advertising exposure give consumers noisy signals about brand attributes. Consumers use these signals to update their expectations of brand attributes in a Bayesian manner. The two models are (1) a dynamic model with immediate utility maximization, and (2) a dynamic ''forward-looking'' model in which consumers maximize the expected present value of utility over a planning horizon. Given this theoretical framework, we derive from the Bayesian learning framework how brand choice probabilities depend on past usage experience and advertising exposures. We then form likelihood functions for the models and estimate them on Nielsen scanner data for detergent.
   We find that the functional forms for experience and advertising effects that we derive from the Bayesian learning framework fit the data very well relative to flexible ad hoc functional forms such as exponential smoothing, and also perform better at out-of-sample prediction. Another finding is that in the context of consumer learning of product attributes, although the forward-looking model fits the data statistically better at conventional significance levels, both models produce similar parameter estimates and policy implications. Our estimates indicate that consumers are risk-averse with respect to variation in brand attributes, which discourages them from buying unfamiliar brands.
   Using the estimated behavioral models, we perform various scenario evaluations to find how changes in marketing strategy affect brand choice both in the short and long run. A key finding obtained from the policy experiments is that advertising intensity has only weak short run effects, but a strong cumulative effect in the long Nn.
   The substantive content of the paper is potentially of interest to academics in marketing, economics and decision sciences, as well as product managers, marketing research managers and analysts interested in studying the effectiveness of marketing mix strategies. Our paper will be of particular interest to those interested in the long run effects of advertising.
   Note that our estimation strategy requires us to specify explicit behavioral models of consumer choice behavior, derive the implied relationships among choice probabilities, past purchases and marketing mix variables, and then estimate the behavioral parameters of each model. Such an estimation strategy is referred to as ''structural'' estimation, and econometric models that are based explicitly on the consumer's maximization problem and whose parameters are parameters of the consumers' utility functions or of their constraints are referred to as ''structural'' models.
   A key benefit of the structural approach is its potential usefulness for policy evaluation. The parameters of structural models are invariant to policy, that is, they do not change due to a change in the policy. In contrast, the parameters of reduced form brand choice models are, in general, functions of marketing strategy variables (e.g., consumer response to price may depend on pricing policy). As a result, the predictions of reduced form models for the outcomes of policy experiments may be unreliable, because in making the prediction one must assume that the model parameters are unaffected by the policy change.
   Since the agents in our models choose among many alternative brands, their choice probabilities take the form of higher-order integrals. We employ Monte-Carlo methods to approximate these integrals and estimate our models using simulated maximum likelihood. Estimation of the dynamic forward-looking model also requires that a dynamic programming problem be solved in order to form the likelihood function. For this we use a new approximation method based on simulation and interpolation techniques. These estimation techniques may be of interest to researchers and policy makers in many fields where dynamic choice among discrete alternatives is important, such as marketing, decision sciences, labor and health economics, and industrial organization.

TI A theory of forward buying, merchandising, and trade deals
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Manufacturer-supported trade deals remain one of the major competitive tools in today's marketplace. This is true despite the fact that such trade deals are often claimed to be unprofitable for manufacturers. The unprofitability is attributed to the fact that retailers forward buy and do not pass the price discounts on to the consumers. The audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who have been concerned with the ubiquitous practice of trade dealing in spite of its purported unprofitability.
   The paper attempts to understand the motivations for trade dealing by comparing the profitability of trade dealing in the presence of forward buying to a situation in which retailers carry no inventory. Moreover, we shed Light on why manufacturers sometimes offer trade deals even though the retailers do not pass through these deals to the consumers.
   We study the problem of trade dealing through an economic model that includes the manufacturers, the retailer, and the consumers. In this way we include all three levels of the distribution system, and model the dynamic effects of forward buying by the retailer.
   The main features of the model can be summarized as follows. At the manufacturer level, each of two manufacturers is allowed to offer a regular price and a deal price, which, if accepted by the retailer, requires the retailer to display and merchandise the product. Moreover, the manufacturer is assumed to incur a selling cost with respect to offering a trade deal. The retailer, on the other hand, decides whether to accept the deal, determines how much to order, and sets the retail prices of the two brands. The retailer needs to set a price below the regular price to achieve maximum effectiveness from its display and merchandising activities. If the retailer accepts a trade deal, it incurs a fixed cost of display and merchandising the product reflecting the opportunity cost of display. If the retailer does not accept the trade deal, it can order at the non-deal price. Furthermore, the retailer can order more than what can be sold to the consumers in that period, i.e, forward buy. The retailer can carry inventory from either manufacturer at a cost but has an upper limit to the total amount of inventory carried in any period.
   The consumer population is assumed to consist of brand loyals and switchers. The brand loyals buy as long as the price is below the reservation price, while the switchers choose the brand on display if the retail price is lower than the regular price and the price of the competing brand. With these as the basic elements of the model, we characterize the equilibrium manufacturer and retailer pricing strategies with and without inventories in an infinite-horizon model with discounting.
   The central result of the paper is derived by comparing the profits to the manufacturers for the case when retailers are allowed to forward buy to the case when they are not allowed to forward buy. This comparison shows that although forward buying is profitable to the retailer through the availability of goods at lower prices, an important consequence of forward buying is the decreased intensity of competition between manufacturers. The decrease in the intensity of competition yields higher profits to the manufacturers as compared to the case where the retailer is not allowed to carry any inventory. The intuition behind our result is seen by taking a closer look at intensity of trade dealing in the presence and absence of forward buying. Consider the worst and the best trade deals offered by manufacturers, in equilibrium, when the retailer is not allowed to carry any inventory and explore their viability when the retailer is allowed to inventory. If the retailer is allowed to carry inventory and holds some inventory, the worst trade deals become unacceptable to the retailer. This is because the inventory allows the retailer to not buy all the units demanded in the subsequent period, and the retailer can therefore reject such trade deals. Similarly, the best trade deals offered by manufacturers when the retailer is not allowed to inventory do not remain as profitable because the retailer forward buys and the manufacturers lose future sales and profits. Thus trade deals at both extremes (the best and the worst) that were profitable to the manufacturers when the retailer is not allowed to forward buy are no longer viable when the retailer is allowed to forward buy. This increases the overall probability of not offering trade deals and leads to decreased intensity of competition.

TI A segment-level model of category volume and brand choice
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB It is an everyday marketplace occurrence that brands lose and gain share. However, a brand's sales gain or loss can be attributable to very different factors, and thus understanding the sources of sales gain or loss would seem to be an important aspect of a brand manager's job.
   The primary purpose of this research is to develop a model that can answer the following questions: (i) What are i he sources of gain or loss of a brand's sales due to category volume and brand switching? (ii) What consumer and marketing characteristics affect consumers' purchase frequency of the product category and that of different brands? (iii) Do all consumers behave similarly, or are there distinct segments which respond to marketing actions differently? (iv) If such segments exist what is the sire and composition of each segment, and what is the appropriate strategy for each group of consumers?
   Our modeling approach, which decomposes a brand's sales into category volume and brand choice components, has many similarities and also several differences with traditional approaches. Similar to :he NBD and Dirichlet models, we assume that a-consumer's category purchase rate follows a Poisson distribution, and the number of purchases per brand follows a multinomial distribution. Our model differs from traditional models by including marketing mix variables, by accounting for loyal or near-loyal consumers, by explicitly incorporating consideration sets, and by segmenting consumers on the basis of their brand perceptions and their responses to marketing mix variables.
   We account for consumer hetereogeneity by identifying homogeneous latent segments that capture differences in consumers' response to marketing variables in both brand choice and category volume behavior. Calibration of the category volume and brand choice models and the separation of loyalty and switching segments are done simultaneously so that there is no need to assume any specific hierarchy and, in contrast to the usual, assumption of independence between choice and volume which may be unreasonable at the aggregate level, the requirement is that choice and volume decisions be independent only at the segment level.
   We investigate the properties of our model in the context of a national survey of supermarket purchases of jumbo paper towels. 2,500 households were surveyed who were asked to provide information on: rolls of paper towels bought in the last 4 weeks, rolls of each brand of paper towel bought in the last 4 weeks, brand usually bought, brands that a household bought or would consider buying, average price paid or expected for each brand bought or considered, ratings on 20 brand attributes (e.g., strength, absorbency, etc.), and demographic information (e.g., family size).
   We found that not only did the modeling framework outperform a variety of competing models, it also provided insights into the competitive structure in this market. The loyal segments could be distinguished on the basis of price sensitivity. Less than 10% of the loyal households were price insensitive and, in general, households showed increasing price sensitivity in their category volume decisions if they had more children and were heavier users of paper towels. This was consistent across all brands. The model estimates that about 71% of the households are switchers and five switching segments are needed to characterize household purchase patterns. Two of the largest switching segments (labeled as Price Sensitive and Value Segments) are very price sensitive in both their brand choice and category volume components. in both these segments private label brands are dominant with about 30% share. Segments also emerged on the basis of Strength, Absorbency, and Tearing Ease of paper towels, Interestingly, we found that brand shares within these segments are quite consistent with the objective quality ratings of brands as given by Consumer Reports. Finally, price elasticity analysis for one oi the brands, Bounty, reveals that a 5% drop in Bounty's price increases its sales by 13.6%. Almost half of this increase comes from brand switching, with the other half coming from increases in category volume (e.g., stockpiling). Bounty gains the most from the price sensitive segments (Price and Value Segments). Private labels are hurt least by Bounty's price cut.

TI Asymmetric reference price effects and dynamic pricing policies
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We consider a group of frequently purchased consumer brands which are partial substitutes and examine two situations; the first where She group of brands is managed by a retailer, and second where the brands compete in an oligopoly. We assume that demand is a function of actual prices and reference prices, and develop optimal dynamic pricing policies for each situation. In addition to researchers studying pricing strategy our results may interest retailers choosing between hi-lo pricing and an everyday low price, and manufacturers assessing whether to follow Procter & Gamble's lead and replace a policy of funding consumer price reductions through trade deals with a constant wholesale price.
   A reference price is an anchoring level formed by customers based on the pricing environment, The literature suggests that demand for a brand depends not only on the brand price, but also whether the brand price Is greater than the reference price (a perceived loss) or is less than it (a perceived gain). The responses to gains and losses are asymmetric. Broadly speaking, we find that when enough consumers weigh gains more than losses, the optimal pricing policy is cyclical. Likewise, when they weigh losses more than gains, a constant price is optimal. Thus, we provide a rationale for dynamic pricing which is quite distinct from the three explanations previously offered: (1) decreasing unit variable costs due to learning effects, (2) the transfer of inventory to consumers who face lower inventory holding costs than do retailers, and (3) competitive effects. Our explanations apply even when the other explanations do not, i.e., in mature product categories where learning effects are minimal, when retailer inventories are minimized through the use of just-in-time policies and when competitive effects do not exist, as in a monopoly.
   Greenleaf (1995) has shown numerically that in the presence of reference price effects, the optimal pricing policy fur a monopolist can be cyclical. We first analytically extend Greenleaf's result to a monopolist with a constant cost oi goods, facing a homogeneous market where all customers either weigh gains more than losses or vice versa, Using this building block we examine a monopolist retailer managing multiple brands. We assume that demand is a linear function of prices of multiple brands, and together with an expression which reflects the reference price effect. Further, we assume that the retailer maximizes average profit per period, Next, we analyze a duopoly and extend the results to an oligopoly. We assume that the manufacturers are able to set the; retail prices, as in an integrated channel. Here, we retain the same demand function as for the retailer and derive Markov Perfect Nash equilibria. We use two alternative processes of reference price formation: the exponential smoothed (ES) past price process which is frequently used in the literature, and for the multi-brand situations, the recently proposed reference brand (RE) process (Hardie, Johnson, and Fader 1993). in the latter, the reference price is the current price of the last brand bought-the reference brand. We adapt the individual level RE formulation in Hardie et al,, to an aggregate demand specification. For the ES process, we obtain most results analytically; for the RE process we use simulation. Finally, we extend our results to a population with two customer segments: Segment 1 which weighs gains more than losses, and Segment 2 which does the opposite, i.e., is loss averse.
   When the market consists exclusively of Segment 1 customers and ES is the reference price process, we find that prices are cyclical in ail cases analyzed, i.e., for a monopoly, a monopolist retailer managing multiple brands, a duopoly, and an oligopoly. If the RE formulation is the underlying process, a monopolist retailer managing two brands uses cyclical prices, but in a duopoly, the equilibrium solution is for the brands to maintain constant prices. When all customers belong to Segment 2 (i.e., they are loss averse) constant. prices are optimal in all cases for both reference price formulations. When the population consists of both Segment I and Segment 2 and the ES process applies, we develop a sufficient condition for cyclical pricing policies to be optimal. The condition is expressed in terms of the proportion of the two segment sizes, the absolute difference between the gain and loss parameters of each segment, and their respective exponential smoothing constants. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the latter two factors, cyclical policies are optimal even when the proportion of Segment 1 is quite small. Similar magnitudes are obtained numerically for the RE case.

TI Effect of brand loyalty on advertising and trade promotions: A game
   theoretic analysis with empirical evidence
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In this payer we examine the issue of balancing media advertising (pull strategy) and trade promotions (push strategy) for manufacturers of consumer packaged goods utilizing a three-stage game theoretic analysis and test model's implications with scanner panel data.
   We develop a model of two competing manufacturers who dir;tribute their brand to consumers through a common retailer, In the model the manufacturers directly advertise their brand to consumers and also provide trade deals to the retailer. Each manufacturer's brand has a loyal segment of consumers who buy their favorite brand unless the competing brand is offered at a much lower price by the retailer. The number of loyal consumers is different for the two brands and so is the strength of their loyalty to their favorite brand. The loyal consumers of the brand with stronger loyalty require a larger price differential in favor of the rival brand before they will switch away from their favorite brand.
   The manufacturers first decide advertising spending level, and then the wholesale price of their respective brands. The two manufacturers do not observe each other's decisions while making these decisions, however they do take into account how the other firm is likely to react as a function of their own decisions, Advertising directly affects the strength of loyalty a consumer has for the favorite brand, If the favorite brand advertises, the loyalty strength increases but if the rival brand advertises, it decreases The marginal effect of own versus competing brand advertising is different in magnitude.
   The two manufacturers provide trade deals to the retailer by discounting the brand from a regular wholesale price. The trade discounts are partially passed on to the consumers by the retailer who sets the retail prices of the two brands alter observing the wholesale prices. The retail shelf price discounts make the promoted brand more attractive to the consumers due to the reduced price differential between their favorite brand and the promoted brand, thus affecting their switching behavior.
   The model and its analysis shed light on the role of brand loyalty in the optimal advertising and trade promotion polices for the two manufacturers. The analysis indicates that, if one brand is sufficiently stronger than the other and if advertising is cost effective, :hen the stronger brand loyalty requires less advertising than weaker brand loyalty, but a larger loyal segment requires more advertising than a smaller loyal seg ment. Moreover, stronger brand loyalty requires more trade promotion spending under these conditions. The analysis also indicates that the retailer promotes the stronger loyalty brand more often but provides a smaller price discount for it compared to the weaker loyalty brand.
   These analytical results can be understood better if we view advertising as a ''defensive'' strategy used to build brand loyalty which helps in retaining the loyal consumers, and price promotions as an ''offensive'' strategy used to attract the loyal consumers away from the rival brand. For example, the result that the stronger brand invests less in advertising than the weaker brand can be explained as follows. The stronger loyalty brand does not find use of advertising attractive because it faces little threat from the weaker brand due to its sufficiently stronger loyalty. Instead it spends more on promotions (provided advertising is cost effective) to attract away the weaker brand's loyal consumers. The weaker brand, on the other hand, finds It optimal to defend its loyal franchise by spending more on advertising, as promotions do not help much due to the difficulty in attracting away the stronger brand's loyal consumers. In this sense, the stronger brand plays ''offensive'' by using more trade promotions, and the weaker brand plays ''defensive'' by emphasizing advertising.
   We also conduct an empirical analysis of the model's propositions using scanner panel data on seven frequently purchased nondurable product categories, In a sample of 38 national brands from the seven categories we find that weaker loyalty brands spend more on advertising; brands with larger loyal segment spend more on advertising; and the retailer promotes stronger loyalty brands more often but provides a smaller price discount on average for them compared to weaker loyalty brands. These findings are consistent with the model.

TI A parsimonious model for forecasting gross box-office revenues of motion
   pictures
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The primary objective of this paper is to develop a parsimonious model for forecasting the gross box-office revenues of new motion pictures based on early box office data. The paper also seeks to provide insights into the impact of distribution policies on the adoption of new products. The model is intended to assist motion picture exhibitor chains (retailers) in managing their exhibition capacity and in negotiating exhibition license agreements with distributors (studios), by allowing them to project the box-office potential of the movies they plan to or currently exhibit based on early box-office results. It is also of interest to practitioners in other software industries (e.g., music, books, CD-ROMs) where the distribution intensity is highly variable over the product life cycle and is an important determinant of new product adoption patterns. The model and its extensions are of interest to academic researchers interested in modeling distribution effects in new product adoption, as well as forecasters looking for ways to leverage historical data on related products to forecast the sales of new products. We draw upon a queuing theory framework to conceptualize stochastically the consumer's movie adoption process in two steps-the time tc, decide to see the new movie and the time to net on the adoption decision. The parameter for the time-to-decide process captures the intensity of information intensity flowing from various information sources, while the parameter for the time-to-act process is related to the delay created by limited distribution intensity and other factors. Our conceptualization extends existing new product forecasting models, which assume that consumers act instantaneously on the motivating information they receive about the new product. The resulting model is parsimonious, yet it accommodates a wide range of adoption patterns. In addition, the stochastic formulation allows us to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the expected adoption pattern. In the empirical testing, we focus on the most parsimonious version of the modeling framework, BOXMOD-I, a model that assumes stationarity with respect to the two shape parameters that characterize the adoption process. The model produces fairly accurate early forecasts using at most the first three weeks of data of calibration, and the predictive performance of the model compares favorably with benchmark models. We propose extensions of the basic model that account for more realistic nonstationary distribution intensity patterns-including a ''wide release'' pattern that relies on intensive distribution and promotion, and a ''platform release'' pattern that involves a gradual buildup of distribution intensity. Finally, we present an adaptive weighing scheme that combines initial parameter estimates obtained from a meta-analysis procedure with estimates obtained from early data to produce forecasts of box-office revenues for a new movie when little or no box-office data are available.
   An important finding from the empirical testing is that motion picture box-office revenue patterns display remarkable empirical regularity. We find that there are only three classes of adoption patterns, and these can all be represented within the basic model by using a two-parameter Exponential or Erlang-2 probability distribution, or a three parameter Generalized Gamma distribution. We also find that cumulative box-office revenues can be predicted with reasonable accuracy (often within 10% of the actual) using as little as two or three data points. However, our attempts to predict revenue patterns without any sales data meet with limited success. While the scale parameter can be estimated reasonably well from a historical database of parameter values, we find that it is considerably more difficult to predict the shape parameters using historical data. The parsimony we seek in developing the model comes at the cost of several limiting assumptions. We assume that the time-to-decide subprocess and the time-to-act subprocess are independent, which may not be the case if decisions on continued exhibition by retailers are endogenously related to box-office revenues over the life cycle. In the basic model formulation, we also assume that th; time-to-act process can be represented by an exponential distribution, which may not always be the case. While we provide some empirical evidence to support these assumptions, further research could relax these and other assumptions to enrich the basic model, although this would entail some loss in parsimony.

TI The inverse relationship between manufacturer and retailer margins: A
   theory
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Our objective in this paper is to explain the relationship between a manufacturer's brand advertising and its impact on wholesale and retail margins in consumer goods markets. We construct a model of re-tailers and manufacturers, and using tools from game theory explain why under some conditions a manufacturer's advertising can squeeze, i.e., lower, the retail margin while simultaneously increasing the wholesale margin. Our paper should be of interest to apjplied analytical and empirical researchers in marketing as well as managers interested in understanding the strategic impact of brand advertising on margins.
   The consumer goods retail market is characterized by intense rivalry among retailers competing hr a share of the consumer dollar. Retailers carry many products, and on any given purchase occasion a typical consumer buys a subset of the vast number of items a retailer ha; on its shelf. in general consumers are ignorant about the prices of all the products they want to buy and consequently select a retailer to shop at based on the advertised prices of a subset of the products they intend to buy. Given this, retailers tend to compete more aggressively based on the prices of a selected set of items by advertising these prices to consumers. The items that the retailers select to compete on are those that most consumers desire and value highly. Since the profit from any customer is the sum of profits from advertised and unadvertised items, the intensity of retail competition, as evident from the prices of these items, increases with the amount the consumer will expend on the unadvertised items once at the store. This aggressiveness therefore translates into lower retail margins on these selected items since the retailers expect that consumers, once inside a store, will buy non-advertised products as well on which the retailers make money. Thus manufacturers who are more adept at using ''pull'' strategies to enhance the popularity of their product, obtain a significant competitive advantage vis a vis others. The positioning of the product and the image conveyed through advertising act as drivers in creating this advantage which results in higher wholesale prices that these manufacturers can charge the retailers.
   There are several key insights from our analysis. Our model explains why retail and wholesale margins can move in opposite directions and also suggests when-in those retail markets where consumers shop for a basket of goods. Our analysis also reveals that retailers make higher margins on unadvertised products and les on advertised prods Furthermore it shows the power of a popular brand where its popularity can be enhanced through brand advertising. From a managerial standpoint we also show that the effectiveness of advertising should not be narrowly interpreted in terms of increase in share or awareness but should include the ability to charge a higher wholesale price. Finally our analysis sheds light on extant, and provides guidance to future, empirical work in this area.

TI Modeling preference and structural heterogeneity in consumer choice
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumer heterogeneity is fundamental to the marketing concept, providing the basis for market segmentation, targeting and positioning, as well as micro-marketing. Substantial effort has already been devoted to incorporate heterogeneity in brand choice models. However, most of the research in this area has focused on differences in preferences or tastes across consumers. In contrast, limited attention has been given to the possibility that consumers might also differ in the process they follow when making choices. Failure to account for either form of consumer heterogeneity may lead to misinterpretations of market structure and market segments, as demonstrated in our simulations. Our main research objective in this paper is to account for these two forms of consumer heterogeneity with an integrated model. We develop a choice model that simuitaneously identifies consumer segments on the basis of their preferences, response to the marketing mix, and choice processes. This choice model is a finite mixture of nested logit models chat incorporates the mixture of multinomial logits as a special case. One main limitation of the now popular multinomial logit model is that choices by each consumer are assumed to be Independent from Irrelevant Alternatives. As a consequence. that model predicts that, within each segment, a brand has exactly the same cross-elasticities upon every competitor. In contrast, our mixture of nested logits allows for violations of the IIA property within each segment, leading to more realistic patterns of brand competition, where one brand draws differently from each competitor, depending on the choice process used by members of the segment.
   In addition to the flexible combination of choice processes and preference structures, our model also incorporates a latent class of ''hard-core loyal'' consumers who are expected to always buy the same brand, and are thus insensitive to price and promotions. Application of our model to household scanner data in the peanut butter category led to four types of segments:
   (a) hard-core loyals, who do not respond to price and promotions. (b) brand-type, for which the brand choice precedes the choice of product form (creamy vs. crunchy).
   (c) form-type. Members of these segments first choose the product form and then decide for the brand (Peter Pan, Jif, Skippy, or Store brand).
   (d) IIA-type. Members of these segments make choices according to the IIA property.
   Our results showed a large (14%) hard-core loyal segment. We also identified three segments of the brand-type, one segment of the form-type and three IIA-type segments. All these segments also differ in their preferences for brands and product forms. One useful feature of our model is that it allows for cross-elasticity structures with non-proportional draw, even when computed within a homogeneous segment. Most importantly, the proposed model allow for more complex cross-elasticity structures within a segment, rather than ticities to any particular pattern a priori. These cross-elasticity patterns imply distinct competitive environments within each segment, leading to different price and promotion strategies in each segment. For example, a promotion by iii-crunchy to a brand-type segment is more likely to cannibalize on shares of the creamy form of the same brand, than to draw from competitors. If offered to a form-type segment, the same promotion is more likely to draw shares from competitors.
   Because of its finite-mixture formulation, our proposed model shares the same limitations of this category of models. For example, maximum-likelihood estimation of the model may lead to local optima, thus requiring a multiple number of random starts, in order to increase the chances of finding the model that best fits to the data. Our model also requires specification of the number and type of segments in each particular application. Several criteria are available to select the number of segments. However, the specification of choice precesses must be based on a heuristic procedure, or on the basis of prior knowledge.

TI Hierarchical bayes conjoint analysis: Recovery of partworth
   heterogeneity from reduced experimental designs
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The drive to satisfy customers in narrowly defined market segments has led firms to offer wider arrays of products and services. Delivering products and services with the appropriate mix of features for these highly fragmented market segments requires understanding the value that customers place on these features. Conjoint analysis endeavors to unravel the value, or partworths, that customers place on the product or service's attributes from experimental subjects' evaluation of profiles based on hypothetical products or services. When the goal is to estimate the heterogeneity in the customers' partworths, traditional estimation methods, such as least squares, require each subject to respond to more profiles than product attributes, resulting in lengthy questionnaires for complex, multiattributed products or services. Long questionnaires pose practical and theoretical problems. Response rates tend to decrease with increasing questionnaire length, and more importantly, academic evidence indicates that long questionnaires may induce response biases.
   The problems associated with long questionnaires call for experimental designs and estimation methods that recover the heterogeneity in the partworths with shorter questionnaires. Unlike more popular estimation methods, Hierarchical Bayes (HE) random effects models do not require that individual-level design matrices be of full rank, which leads to the possibility of using fewer profiles per subject than currently used. Can this theoretical possibility be practically implemented? This paper tests this conjecture with empirical studies and mathematical analysis. The random effects model in the paper describes the heterogeneity in subject-level partworths or regression coefficients with a linear model that can include subject-level covariates. In addition, the error variances are specific to the subjects, thus allowing for the differential use of the measurement scale by different subjects. In the empirical study, subjects' responses to a full profile design are randomly deleted to test the performance of HE methods with declining sample sizes. These simple experiments indicate that HE methods can recover heterogeneity and estimate individual-level partworths, even when individual-level least squares estimators do not exist due to insufficient degrees of freedom.
   Motivated by these empirical studies, the paper analytically investigates the trade-off between the number of profiles per subject and the number of subjects on the statistical accuracy of the estimators that describe the partworth heterogeneity. The paper considers two experimental designs: each subject receives the same set of profiles, and subjects receive different blocks of a fractional factorial design. In the first case, the optimal design, subject to a budget constraint, uses more subjects and fewer profiles per subject when the ratio of unexplained, part worth heterogeneity to unexplained response variance is large. In the second case, one can maintain a given level of estimation accuracy as the number of profiles per subject decreases by increasing the number of subjects assigned to each block. These results provide marketing researchers the option of using shorter questionnaires for complex products or services. The analysis assumes that response quality is independent of questionnaire length and does not address the impact of design factors on response quality. If response quality and questionnaire length were, in fact, unrelated, then marketing researchers would still find the paper's results useful in improving the efficiency of their conjoint designs. However, if response quality were to decline with questionnaire length, as the preponderance of academic research indicates, then the option to use shorter questionnaires would become even more valuable.

TI The effect of package coupons on brand choice: An epilogue on profits
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In Raju, Dhar, and Morrison (1994), a paper that appeared earlier in this journal, we developed an analytical model and conducted empirical analyses to examine the effect of package coupons on market share. In this epilogue, we extend the analytical framework in our earlier paper to study the relative impact of package coupons on profits. We also report findings from five quasi-experiments (including two new quasi-experiments) that provide empirical validity to our model-based predictions. Our results have significance for brand managers in packaged goods firms. Our analysis suggest that while selecting among package coupons, brand managers should carefully define which performance criterion to use: market share impact, redemption rate, or profit impact. Package coupons that lead to the highest market share impact (or redemptions) may not lead to the highest profit impact.
   We compare the relative profit impact of the following package coupons: peel-off, on-pack, and in-pack. Peel-off coupons must be redeemed on the same purchase occasion on which they are obtained. On-pack coupons are obtained at one purchase occasion but can only be redeemed for a discount on the couponed brand at a future purchase occasion. In-pack coupons are similar to on-pack coupons except that the consumer is unaware of the presence of these coupons when the product is purchased (in-pack coupons are printed or placed inside the package). Consumers with an in-pack or on-pack coupon from a previous purchase occasion will have a higher probability of purchasing the couponed brand even if the brand was not currently offering coupons. Consequently, to understand choice behavior, it is not enough to take into consideration the current choice environment; our model therefore must also keep track of whether or not a consumer has a package coupon that was obtained on an earlier purchase occasion. In other words, since choice is dependent on the purchase environment as well as the state of the consumer, we use a Markov model to represent the choice process. Analytical results are derived based on the long run probabilities of the Markov transition matrix.
   Our analytical and empirical results suggest that by and large, of the various package coupons examined in our research, on-pack coupons lead to the highest impact on profits. Furthermore, while peel-offs lead to a higher market share than in-packs, because in-packs stimulate repurchase among previous buyers, they lead to higher profits than peel-offs; though only for stronger brands.

TI Pricing decisions under demand uncertainty: A Bayesian mixture model
   approach
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The advent of optical scanning devices and deceases in the cost of computing power have made it possible to assemble databases with sales and marketing mix information in an accurate and timely manner. These databases enable the estimation of demand functions and pricing / promotion decisions in ''real'' time. Commercial suppliers of marketing research like A. C. Nielsen and IRI are embedding estimated demand functions in promotion planning and pricing tools for brand managers and retailers.
   This explosion in the estimation and use of demand functions makes it timely and appropriate to re-examine several fundamental issues. In particular, demand functions are latent theoretical constructs whose exact parametric form is unknown. Estimates of price elasticities, profit maximizing prices, inter-brand competition and other policy implications are conditional on the parametric form assumed in estimation. In practice, many forms may be found that are not only theoretically plausible but also consistent with the data. The different forms could suggest different profit maximizing prices leaving it unclear as to what is the appropriate pricing action. Specification tests may lack the power to resolve this uncertainty, particularly for non-nested comparisons. Also, the structure of these tests does not permit seamless integration of estimation, specification analysis and optimal pricing into a unified framework.
   As an alternative to the existing approaches, I propose a Bayesian mixture model (BMM) that draws on Bayesian estimation, inference, and decision theory, thereby providing a unified framework. The BMM approach consists of input, estimation, diagnostic and optimal pricing modules. In the input module, alternate parametric models of demand are specified along with priors. Utility structures representing the decision maker's attitude towards risk can be explicitly specified. In the estimation module, the inputs are combined with data to compute parameter estimates and posterior probabilities for the models. The diagnostic module involves testing the statistical assumptions underlying the models. In the optimal pricing module the estimates and posterior probabilities are combined with the utility structure to arrive at optimal pricing decisions.
   Formalizing demand uncertainty in this manner has many important payoffs. While the classical approaches emphasize choosing a demand specification, the BMM approach emphasizes constructing an objective function that represents a mixture of the specifications. Hence, pricing decisions can be arrived at wen when there is no consensus among the different parametric specifications. The pricing decisions will reflect parametric demand uncertainty, and hence be more robust than those based on a single demand model.
   The BMM approach was empirically evaluated using store level scanner data. The decision context was the determination of equilibrium wholesale prices in a noncooperative game between several leading national brands. Retail demand was parametrized as semilog and doublelog with diffuse priors for the models and the parameters. Wholesale demand functions were derived by incorporating the retailers' pricing behavior in the retail demand function. Utility functions reflecting risk averse and risk neutral decision makers were specified. The diagnostic module confirms that face validity measures, residual analysis, classical tests or holdout predictions were unable to resolve the uncertainty about the parametric form and by implication the uncertainty with regard to pricing decisions. In contrast, the posterior probabilities were more conclusive and favored the specification that predicted better in a holdout analysis. However, across the brands, they lacked a systematic pattern of updating towards any one specification. Also, none of the priors updated to zero or one, and there was considerable residual uncertainty about the parametric specification.
   Despite the residual uncertainty, the BMM approach was able to determine the equilibrium wholesale prices. As expected, specifications influence the BMM pricing solutions in accordance with their posterior probabilities which act as weights. In addition, differing attitudes towards risk lead to considerable divergence in the pricing actions of the risk averse and the risk neutral decision maker. Finally, results from a Monte Carlo experiment suggest that the BMM approach performs well in terms of recovering potential improvements in profits.

TI Order of entry as a moderator of the effect of the marketing mix on
   market share
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Order of entry has been demonstrated to have a significant effect on market share. A number of explanations for this effect have been suggested in the marketing and strategy literatures. To date, the market share advantage gained by pioneers has typically been treated as a main effect-an automatic regularity. Treating order-of-entry as a main effect implies that there is no penalty on the effectiveness of a brand's marketing instruments for late entry and that a late entrant can compensate for being late by dedicating sufficient marketing resources to their product.
   In this study, we investigate the influence of order-of-entry into a market on the effectiveness of a firm's marketing mix decisions by asking the question, ''Can followers compensate for not being first by their marketing mix decisions?'' Also, even if they can compensate for being late, does this effort become increasingly more difficult with later entry? That is, are there asymmetries in the effectiveness of a brand's marketing mix variables that relate to its order of entry into the market, or as has been typically assumed to date, is order of entry strictly a main effect? An asymmetry exists, for example, if the market response to advertising is different for the first entrant versus the second or third entrant. An asymmetry also exists if the effects of, say, a price change by the first entrant on the second entrant are different than the effects on the third entrant. We develop a market share attraction model where the parameters vary as a function of order-of-entry. Our main contribution is in modeling the sources order-of-entry advantage as asymmetries in effectiveness of a brand's marketing instruments. Hence, distinct from previous research we explain why there are inherent order-of-entry effects. This paper is potentially of interest to researchers developing market share models and studying the effectiveness of marketing-mix variables. The substantive implication of our results concern directly academics interested in marketing strategy as well as the practicing marketing strategists.
   We model asymmetries in the market response of early entrants versus late entrants using data from two durables and three nondurables categories. With one exception, all data sets are established from the inception of the category and hence do not suffer from the possible bias of excluding pioneers who have failed. Results show that asymmetries in the effectiveness of a brand's marketing mix variables are an essential source of order-of-entry effects; we find that the main effects of order of entry are minimal. Order-of-entry effects do not necessarily lead to lower shares, but overcoming these effects is not without substantial cost to the late entrant.
   Our results support previous research that has demonstrated advantages to early entry. In addition, we provide guidelines for how late entrants should compete. Later entry tends to reduce a competitor's price sensitivity, suggesting that they not instigate in a price war with earlier entrants in order to gain share. Order-of-entry tends to decrease response to quality and to promotion. To achieve the same impact on market share, later entrants need a bigger change in quality and need to spend more on promotion. Our data did not support an asymmetric effect on advertising.

TI A multiplicative fixed-effects model of consumer choice
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The issue of consumer heterogeneity in discrete choice analysis has been attracting much attention recently. Research has suggested that heterogeneity can result in biased parameter estimates which, in turn, can lead to incorrect conclusions. Among the many methods proposed in the literature to handle heterogeneity, fixed effects models seem to be the most attractive from a substantive point of view. However, in order to provide consistent estimates, these models typically require long purchase histories. This difficult constraint has prevented their widespread use.
   In this paper, we propose a new model which offers the benefits of fixed effects models without requiring long purchase histories. Our approach differs from the classic formulation in two ways. First, we calibrate the common and fixed-effects sequentially rather than simultaneously. This two-stage estimation permits us to obtain unbiased estimates of the common parameters even when the sample has households with very few observations. Second, we incorporate the fixed effects in a multiplicative rather than in an additive form.
   Our assumptions regarding the error term result in a probit model with heteroskedastic and temporally correlated random utilities. We develop a method of moments based estimator to calibrate parameters of models with this type of error structure. This procedure exploits the property that the method of moments yields estimates which are asymptotically as efficient as the maximum likelihood estimates given an appropriate starting point and a matrix of instruments. This is a very general procedure in that its mechanics are not tied to the proposed model. It can be readily applied to other problems where probit models are used to analyze data with serial correlation. This is a methodological contribution of the paper.
   The model and estimation procedure are illustrated on the A. C. Nielsen scanner data base for the liquid detergent category. Our results indicate that the proposed model can provide a better fit than random effects and loyalty based models and better predictive performance than random effects models. From a substantive perspective, our analysis provides the following findings.
   (a) the distribution of price sensitivities has a low variance-thus, most households have very similar price sensitivity in this category;
   (b) the promotion response distribution has a high that there are some households that are highly responsive to promotions while there are quite a few households that are less influenced by promotions;
   (c) preferences and price sensitivity have a negative covariance-which is an indication that a reduction in preference for a brand is associated with an increase in price sensitivity and vice versa;
   (d) preferences and promotion response have a positive covariance-thus, as the preference for a brand increases, response to promotions by the brand also increases; and
   (e) price sensitivity and promotion response have a negative covariance-implying that, as households become more price sensitive, purchases may be driven more by price than by promotions; in other words, rather than responding to promotions such as displays and features as signals of a reduced price, price sensitive households actively evaluate prices in arriving at a choice.
   The proposed approach can be used by theoretical as well as applied researchers of brand choice behavior. Specifically, estimates of fixed-effects provided by the model can be used to cluster households into groups with similar parameters. Profiling the resulting groups in terms of demographics would provide interesting insights-from a theoretical perspective-regarding the household characteristics that are associated with different types of response behavior. It would also help managers to better target their brands.
   Using the proposed approach for cross-category analyses of fixed-effects would be an interesting area of future research. For instance, given a sample of households and their purchase histories in multiple categories, the proposed model can be used to explore the relationship between household behavior and category characteristics. In particular, issues such as the following can be investigated by comparing household-level estimates across categories:
   (a) are households that are highly price sensitive in one category also price sensitive in other categories?
   (b) what household characteristics are associated with high (low) price sensitivity or high (low) promotion response across categories? and
   (c) in what types of categories are households likely to exhibit high (low) price sensitivity or high (low) promotion response?

TI Estimating the impact of consumer expectations of coupons on purchase
   behavior: A dynamic structural model
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We examine the basic premise that consumers may anticipate future promotions and adjust their purchase behavior accordingly. We develop a structural model of households who make purchase decisions to minimize their expenditure over a finite period. The model allows for future expectations of promotions to enter the purchase decision. Households with adequate inventory of the product may face a trade-off of buying in the current period with a coupon or defer the purchase until next period, given their expectations of future promotions. Thus, we provide a framework for examining the impact of consumer expectations on choice behavior.
   The target audiences for our paper are (a) empirical researchers who intend to make structural models part of their applied research agenda; and (b) managers who value and seek to understand the impact of consumers' coupon expectations on current purchase behavior. Our research objective is to provide an empirical framework to examine whether and to what extent consumers anticipate future coupon promotions and adjust purchase behavior. The central premise of our approach is that a rational consumer minimizes the present discounted value of the cost of a purchase where cost in a single period consists of purchase price, inventory holding cost, gains from coupons, and potential stockout cost. We aim to test whether our hypotheses regarding the various elements of the cost structure are supported and that whether consumers take into account future discounted cost when making current purchase decisions.
   The research methodology we adopt is relatively new in econometrics and known as the estimable stochastic structural dynamic programming method. The methodology amounts to incorporating a maximum likelihood routine embedded in a dynamic programming problem. The dynamic programming problem is solved several times within a maximum likelihood iteration for each value of the state space elements and for each value of the parameters in the parameter set. The state space in our model consists of purchase and nonpurchase alternatives in each time period, coupon availability and no coupon availability in each time period, level of inventory in each time period for each household, and consumption rate of each household.
   We use scanner panel data on purchases in the disposable diaper product category and promotions. We estimate the inventory holding and stockout costs, brand-specific value of coupons, and consumers' expectations of future coupons. The key insights and lessons learned can be summarized as follows: (1) Our results are consistent with the notion that consumers hold beliefs about future coupons, and that such beliefs affect the purchase decision. We find that the dynamic optimization model performs significantly better than a single-period optimization model and a naive benchmark model. (2) We find a high and significant stockout cost, consistent with the essential nature of the product category. Our estimate of the holding cost yields a reasonable annualized percentage value when converted to the cost of capital. We find that consumer valuation of coupons differ markedly across brands. (3) Our empirical evidence supports the notion that consumers hold beliefs about future coupon availability. We also find that the expectations about future coupons, estimated endogenously, differ depending upon whether or not a coupon was available in the current period. Thus, the proposed model structure yields rich managerial insights and facilitates several ''what if'' scenarios.
   A possible limitation of our model, and estimable structural models in general, is the computational cost. While it is possible to conceptually extend the state space to accommodate variations across households and add a richer parameter structure, each addition multiplies the size of the state space and the computation time. For this reason, we have kept the state space as tight as possible and refrained from additions that would otherwise enable us to incorporate heterogeneity in consumer decisions. For example, we assumed that consumers are similar other than reflected by their purchase behavior. We built a category purchase incidence model rather than a brand choice model. We refrained from including unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters. We chose to opt out of modeling autocorrelation and other time-dependent error term patterns in the likelihood function. Thus, we have made an effort to build a structural model that reasonably reflects consumer purchase behavior without requiring expensive computation. Currently, there are developments in econometrics to approximate the computation of the valuation functions without sacrificing much accuracy. When these methods are well developed we expect that structural models will become more commonplace in marketing.

TI A framework for investigating habits, ''the hand of the past, and
   heterogeneity in dynamic brand choice
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In this paper we develop a general class of dynamic brand choice models, called Lightning Bolt (LB) models, which are consistent with the theory of random utility maximization of consumer choice behavior. The underlying random utility process is Markov, and the inter-temporal evolution of the (utility-maximizing) brand choice process is also Markov. The models permit parsimonious parameterizations of the random utility process in brand choices with the resulting switching probabilities being functionally related to explanatory variables. The model allows for structural state dependence (feedback), habit persistence (inertia), and unobserved heterogeneity. The theoretical development shows that several well known stochastic brand choice models can be deduced from random utility maximization theory.
   From a managerial perspective, the usefulness of the proposed model stems from its ability to separate out the effects of habits, state dependence and heterogeneity. Strong state dependence effects imply incentives for inducing trial of a brand (e.g., product sampling). In contrast with state dependence, a strong habit persistence effect may be indicative of buyer behavior where inducement of trial of a different brand may not be sufficient to maintain a (sustained) defection of the consumer from the habitually purchased brand to the trial brand. Failure to distinguish between these two effects has important implications. For example, a model that only accounts for state dependence effects would, in the presence of only habit persistence, incorrectly attribute it to state dependence. Based on this the manager could decide to embark on an expensive sampling program that might prove ineffective due to the absence of state dependence. It is also important to distinguish between the effects of unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence. In the absence of true state dependence, failing to account for unobservable variations across households (such as differences in price sensitivities), results in the temporally persistent unobservable elements showing up as state dependence in the model. Hence, a manager may incorrectly opt for sampling as the appropriate marketing action, whereas, a couponing or price promotion strategy should have been preferred.
   We estimate the model parameters using the AC Nielsen household scanner panel data set on catsup purchases. Further, we investigate empirical techniques for overcoming the ''initial conditions'' problem that affects many dynamic models of brand choice. Through simulation analysis using the estimated parameters, we show that the calculated profitability of a promotion must take into account the multi-period impact due to state dependence. Further, we demonstrate how ignoring heterogeneity can result in spurious state dependence, thereby making marketing tactics such as product sampling appear far more attractive than they actually are. Specifically, the model that accounts only for habit persistence and state dependence effects predicts a share increase of 2.4% points through sampling for one of the brands in the empirical analysis. Once the effects of unobserved heterogeneity are accounted for, however, this number drops precipitously to 0.3%. While even this low number might fulfill the objectives of the brand manager, it ensures that expectations are not eight times that number.
   It is important to note that this paper is a first attempt at analyzing the three fundamental dimensions of dynamic brand choice behavior. Our formulation represents a ''reduced form'' approach as opposed to a ''structural'' approach. Other limitations of the model include our focus on time-invariant choice sets. Extensions of the model to situations where choice sets vary over time are possible, but are difficult. Another limitation is the dependence on multivariate extreme value distributions. An alternative would be to use multivariate normal distributions, i.e., a probit-like structure which has certain useful properties. A comparison of the two approaches would be useful. Empirical extensions of the model to allow for higher-order processes and nested legit type model structures could also be fruitful. Explicitly incorporating variety-seeking behavior in the model would further enrich the theoretical framework proposed in this paper.

TI Evaluation of salesforce size and productivity through efficient
   frontier benchmarking
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The efficient operation of a salesforce is a critical element in the profitability of many firms. Three factors play key roles: the salesforce's size, its allocation and its productivity. This gives rise to the following questions: can salesforce performance be improved by (1) hiring more salespeople, (2) allocating them more effectively to the various sales districts and/or (3) improving salesperson productivity through better calling patterns in terms of consumers and product line items?
   The practice of most firms and the methodology used in most of the academic literature to address salesforce design and productivity questions is a ''Bottom Up'' approach. This approach starts with assessments by each salesperson of the sales and effort corresponding to each customer and prospect in their territory. These assessments are then aggregated to the territory, district and national levels. This paper takes an alternative ''Top Down'' approach. It is based on an estimated relationship between district level sales and salesforce size, effort and other variables. This more macro level decision tool can be used by management in parallel to, and as an objective check of, the more conventional and more subjective ''Bottom Up'' approach.
   We develop an efficient frontier methodology which allows us to estimate how total district sales respond to salesforce size, district potential and competitive activity in the firm's best performing districts. The methodology utilized is based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and yields a benchmark measure of each districts efficient frontier sales (sales assuming the district's salesforce allocates its effort as done in the best performing districts).
   Based on the estimated response function we discuss the three potential sources of increased profitability: closing the inefficiency gap of each of the lower performing districts, optimally reallocating the current salesforce to the various districts, and changing the current size of the salesforce to its optimal level. The inefficiency gap issue is addressed through comparison of the parameter estimates for the best districts obtained through our methodology with those of an average district sales response function obtained using regression analysis. This comparison points to an important methodological finding. The use of multiple estimation results may lead to an improved understanding of the phenomenon being studied (in our case, the identification of the likely causes of district productivity inefficiencies). The latter two sources of increased profitability, salesforce reallocation and changes in the current salesforce size, are addressed analytically given the district level efficient frontier sales response function.
   The proposed ''Top Down'' procedure using the efficient frontier methodology and the insights it provides are examined by evaluating the operations of two different sales forces, one selling manufacturing equipment and the other business equipment. In both cases, regression-based analysis would have resulted in a declaration that the status-quo was close to optimal, while the frontier-based analysis pointed out that strong gains were possible in certain districts. In particular, for both firms, the greatest increases in profit are obtained through improved salesforce efficiency in the lower performing districts, not through salesforce size or district allocation adjustments. At the more micro-level, a comparison of the frontier and regression parameters made it possible to identify which specific changes in the daily operations of the salesforces would allow the realization of these potential productivity gains. In our two cases this could be obtained through more emphasis on pursuing prospective accounts.

The premise of this activity is that there exist distinct segments of homogeneous consumers who can be identified by readily available demographic information. The increased availability of individual consumer panel data open the possibility of direct targeting of individual households. The goal of this paper is to assess the information content of various information sets available for direct marketing purposes. Information on the consumer is obtained from the current and past purchase history as well as demographic characteristics. We consider the situation in which the marketer may have access to a reasonably long purchase history which includes both the products purchased and information on the causal environment. Short of this complete purchase history, we also consider more limited information sets which consist of only the current purchase occasion or only information on past product choice without causal variables.
   Proper evaluation of this information requires a flexible model of heterogeneity which can accommodate observable and unobservable heterogeneity as well as produce household level inferences for targeting purposes. We develop new econometric methods to implement a random coefficient choice model in which the heterogeneity distribution is related to observable demographics. We couple this approach to modeling heterogeneity with a target couponing problem in which coupons are customized to specific households on the basis of various information sets. The couponing problem allows us to place a monetary value on the information sets.
   Our results indicate there exists a tremendous potential for improving the profitability of direct marketing efforts by more fully utilizing household purchase histories. Even rather short purchase histories can produce a net gain in revenue from target couponing which is 2.5 times the gain from blanket couponing . The most popular current electronic couponing trigger strategy uses only one observation to customize the delivery of coupons. Surprisingly, even the information contained in observing one purchase occasion boasts net couponing revenue by 50% more than that which would be gained by the blanket strategy. This result, coupled with increased competitive pressures, will force targeted marketing strategies to become much more prevalent in the future than they are today.

TI Controllable factors of new product success: A cross-national comparison
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB While the new product literature suggests that managerially controllable factors most strongly affect new product success, few studies have examined how these factors differ across countries. The objectives of this article are: (1) to develop a model of managerially controllable factors associated with new product success, (2) to directly compare the factors that managers perceive to be associated with new product success in the United States and China, and (3) to demonstrate the application of various statistical analyses for increasing the confidence that may be placed in empirical findings and outline methods for assessing whether significant estimation biases exist in cross-sectional data. Our paper should be of interest to new product researchers and international comparative marketing researchers. The implications of our results should also be of considerable value and interest to executives faced with the complex task of selecting and managing new product development projects as well as to those firms experiencing international competition.
   To accomplish our objectives, we develop a model of managerially controllable factors related to new product success, which includes variables related to the organization, the new product development process, and the product itself. The model is tested using data collected on 142 new products launched in the United States and 470 new products launched in China. We conduct case studies to examine the appropriateness of the data collection methods, to establish the content validity of the concepts, and to assess the usefulness of the measures and constructs in a Chinese context.
   The model was tested using EQS with covariance matrices as input. We tested the measurement model before assessing the structural relationships. Once the measurement issues were satisfactorily resolved, the structural model was tested for each country individually. Since the results of the individual models for the United States and China were satisfactory, we performed a two-group simultaneous path analysis in order to test for similarities and differences in the factors of new product success between the United States and China. We tested whether or not the path coefficients were invariant across the two countries using a Lagrangian Multiplier test.
   The challenge for all cross-sectional studies is to reject the hypothesis that many of the parameters associated with the dependent variable are biased by ''omitted'' firm level effects and other specification errors. We examine these possible biases within the structural equations framework by examining the robustness of the parameters with and without the measurement error interactions fixed and an examination of nominological validity for each country. In addition, since we collected two observations per firm in our Chinese sample, we also examine whether bias exists due to omitted firm effects by comparing within and between estimates. The stability of the within and between estimates also suggests that our findings are robust to omitted firm effects.
   Our findings provide important managerial guidelines concerning appropriate managerial actions to take in the new product development process for new product managers. First, firms are advised to build appropriate new product development resources and expertise. In both countries, our findings suggest that adequate marketing research, sales force, distribution, advertising, and promotional resources and skills are required for proficiently conducting market assessment studies, testing products, and introducing products. Furthermore, technical resources and skills are positively linked with proficiency in conducting technical activities. Sufficient R&D and engineering resources and skills are related to proficiency in performing technical assessments, designing products, and manufacturing products.
   Second, our results reveal that a higher proficiency in marketing and technical activities leads to a higher level of new product success in both countries. The level of proficiency of technical activities appears to relate more to the level of new product success than do marketing activities.
   Third, it is important to collect and assess market and competitive information in order to understand customers' needs, wants, and specifications for the product; to know customers' price sensitivity; to understand customers' purchase decisions; and to learn about competitors' strategies, strengths, and weaknesses. In China, product quality is the second most highly correlated factor of new product success. Therefore, firms competing in China should direct their marketing and technical efforts toward developing quality products.

TI A dynamic analysis of market structure based on panel data
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Internal market structure analysis infers brand positions in an attribute space from preference and choice data, given a market in which consumers have heterogeneous tastes for attributes. Previous market structure models have adopted a static framework (e.g., Elrod 1988, Chintagunta 1994, Elrod and Keane 1995). Furthermore, they assumed that consumer perceptions of brand attributes do not vary across consumers. Yet, these approaches may render inaccurate representations of market structure if there is state dependence in consumer choice behavior. This paper attempts to incorporate consumer choice dynamics into market structure models by specifying the source of choice dynamics explicitly. In particular, the process by which past purchases affect current choices is modeled in a framework which captures both consumer habit persistence and variety seeking behavior. More specifically, consumer preferences for brand attributes are modeled to depend on the attributes of brands bought on the previous purchase occasion. Furthermore, the modeling approach adopted incorporates heterogeneity in both consumer preferences and perceptions of brand attributes. The audience of this paper includes practitioners and academics interested in understanding consumer choice processes and inferring market structure from consumer choice data.
   The proposed models are estimated on Nielsen scanner panel data for margarine, peanut butter, yogurt, and liquid detergent using simulated maximum likelihood techniques. The empirical results suggest that accounting for choice dynamics improves both in-sample and out-of-sample fit. The results indicate that the average consumer is habit persistent in all the product categories studied. This result is consistent with the findings of Kannan and Sanchez (1994), who conducted an aggregate analysis of consumer variety seeking behavior across product categories. However, the results obtained in this paper suggest that consumers are heterogeneous with respect to the processes by which past purchases affect current purchases.
   These results provide strong evidence for habit persistence and variety seeking in brand attributes to be the behavioral source of consumer choice dynamics in food categories. Thus, consumer tastes (utility weights) seem to be affected by the attributes of the brands consumed in the past. Given the empirical result that a large proportion of consumers are habit persistent, this suggests that tastes are reinforced by the brand attributes consumed in the past.
   The empirical results also show that not accounting for state dependence in market structure models for panel data may produce misleading results, that is, depending on consumer behavior patterns, models that do not account for state dependence may distort the true nature of competition among brands. More specifically, the results confirm the expectation that if there is habit persistence, that is, if consumer tastes are reinforced by attributes of brands consumed in the past, models that do not capture this choice dynamics will overestimate the distance between (similar) brands.
   Furthermore, the policy experiments conducted suggest that (1) static models overestimate the short-run impact of a price cut on the sales of the brand on promotion, (2) price cuts hurt the sales of the more similar brands more, and (3) free samples affect relatively less similar brands the most.
   Finally, this paper studies variety seeking and habit persistence across brands over purchase occasions. However, variety seeking behavior may also involve the purchase of a portfolio of brands or items at a purchase occasion. Consumers may buy multiple items knowing that prior to the next trip they may want to consume different items (Simanson 1990, Walsh 1995). This type of behavior can be modeled within the context of dynamic expected utility maximization with forward-looking consumers. The development and estimation of market structure models that include forward-looking consumers who maximize expected-utility over a planning horizon, incorporating their future tastes and needs, and shopping for an inventory of brands, remain an important future research issue.

TI Asymmetric promotion effects and brand positioning
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Several studies have shown that promotions of national brands yield more effect than those of store brands (e.g., Allenby and Rossi 1991, Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989). However, the evolution of price-quality data available from Consumer Reports over the last 15 years seems to reveal a reduction of the quality gap between store brands and national brands, while price differences remain substantial. Simultaneously, the share of private label brands has increased (Progressive Grocer 1994). In this context, we study whether we can maintain a view of the world where national brands may easily attract consumers from store brands through promotions, whereas store brands are relatively ineffective in attracting consumers from national brands by such means.
   We analyze consumer reactions to price discounts in a parsimonious preference model featuring loss aversion and reference-dependence along dimensions of price and quality (Hardie, Johnson, and Fader 1993, Tversky and Kahneman 1991). The key result of our analysis is that, given any two brands, there is an asymmetric promotion effect in favor of the higher quality/higher price brands if and only if the quality gap between the brands is sufficiently large in comparison with the price gap. Thus, the direction of promotion asymmetry is not unconditional. It depends uniquely on the value of the ratio of quality and price differences compared to a category specific criterion, which we call Phi. If the ratio of quality and price differences is larger than this criterion, the usual asymmetry prevails; if such is not the case,the lower quality/lower price brands promote more effectively.
   More precisely, our model predicts that cross promotion effects depend on two components of brand positioning in the price/quality quadrant. First, we define a variable termed ''positioning advantage'' that indicates whether, relative to the standards achieved by another brand, a given brand is underpriced (positive advantage) or overpriced (negative advantage). Promotion effectiveness is increasing in this variable. Second, cross promotion effects between two brands depend on their distance in the price/quality quadrant. This variable impacts promotion effectiveness negatively and symmetrically for any pair of brands. ''Positioning advantage'' and ''brand distance'' are orthogonal components of brand positioning, irrespective of the degree of correlation between available price and quality levels in the market.
   Empirically, we investigate the role of brand positioning in explaining cross promotion effects using panel data from the chilled orange juice and peanut butter categories. We compute the independent positioning variables, ''positioning advantage'' and ''brand distance,'' from readily available data on price and quality positioning after obtaining our estimates of Phi. We next measure promotion effectiveness by estimating choice share changes in response to a price discount, using a choice model that does not contain any information about quality/price ratios. Finally, we test the relation between the two positioning variables and the promotion effectiveness measures.
   The data reveal that in the orange juice category lower quality/lower price brands generally promote more effectively than higher quality/higher price brands. In the peanut butter data the opposite asymmetry holds. In both cases, inter-brand promotion patterns are well explained by the positioning variables. An attractive feature of our model is that, in addition to the direction of promotion asymmetries, it also explains the extent of those asymmetries.
   A further interesting aspect of this approach is that we go beyond a categorization of brands into price tiers. For instance, lower tier brands in our data may promote more effectively than one national brand but less effectively than another. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, the data presented here seem to confirm that such cases occur because the lower tier brand offers a favorable trade-off of price and quality differences compared with one national brand and a less favorable trade-off compared with the other.
   The content of this paper is potentially relevant for brand managers or retailers concerned with predicting the impact of their promotions. The paper is of particular interest to marketing scientists who study the performance of store brands versus national brands and may also appeal to those who wish to explore the marketing implications of behavioral decision theory.
   Finally, our investigation does not reject Blattberg and Wisniewski's (1989) finding, shared by Allenby and Rossi (1991) and Hardie, Johnson, and Fader (1993), that national brands have a principle advantage in promotion effectiveness. Rather, it formalizes when this principle advantage is overruled by positioning disadvantages of such brands.

TI A model of retail formats based on consumers' economizing on shopping
   time
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Retailers in developed countries increasingly provide one-stop shopping. Why? Are they responding to growing demand for time-saving convenience? Or are they responding to economies of scale made possible by new retail technology? And what role, if any, is played by improvements in automotive, refrigeration, and other consumer technology?
   To examine these questions, we develop a model that can help explain the growth of one-stop shopping, estimate the model with aggregate grocery retail data, and compare the implications of our model with competing explanations.
   Our model includes several desirable features:
   (1) The extent of one-shop shopping is endogenously determined.
   (2) Consumer store choice is determined in an explicit household-production, utility-maximizing context. This choice is based on a tradeoff between time-saving shopping convenience and price.
   (3) The model is readily amenable to empirical testing.
   The key endogenous parameter of our model describes the number of categories carried by a store. In the context of grocery retailing, this parameter can distinguish between a single-category specialty store, a simple grocer, a supermarket, and a large superstore. This parameter is determined by the interplay of consumers economizing on shopping time and retail competition in the presence of technological constraints which relate operating cost with assortment size.
   Our approach may also be viewed as an example of how the boundary between retail service production and household service production can be modeled as a market outcome (in the spirit of Betancourt and Gautchi 1990 and Wernerfelt 1994). The nature of extant retail formats and other channel-related institutions circumscribes the boundary between retailers and households. With the notable early exception of Baumol and Ide (1956), few explicit models describe retail format determination as an equilibrating market mechanism. Our model describes the determination of one aspect of retail formats (namely, the extent of one-stop shopping). Our hope is that similar approaches can be used to describe other aspects and types of emergent retail formats.
   We estimate our model using U.S. aggregate annual data for a 26-year period, and later corroborate parts of the analysis using cross-sectional data for the 48 contiguous states of the U.S. The equilibrium conditions of our model translate into a system of two equations with two endogenous variables. Estimates of the reduced form parameters provide our central empirical finding-that per capita disposable income has had a significant positive effect on both supermarket assortment (as expected from our model) and store operating costs (perhaps somewhat less expected). This suggests that greater prevalence of one-stop shopping has been a response to growing demand for time-saving convenience. The estimates of the underlying structural parameters also provide a measure of the imputed net savings to consumers from supermarket shopping, taking into account reductions in shopping time made possible by supermarkets (savings equivalent to approximately 2.2% of expenditures on grocery products over the 1961-1986 period).
   We lastly consider competing hypotheses. While a number of explanations can account for increased store assortment, these explanations have divergent implications for retail margins, operating costs, and profits. These implications suggest that retail scale economies were not the drivers of one-stop shopping in the years of our data. Nor was the impetus to increase store size primarily a desire to bring in new higher-margin items. However, we acknowledge that transportation and inventory-holding technologies are prerequisites to one-stop shopping and that improvements in these technologies were particularly important in the early growth period of supermarkets.

TI Marketing information: A competitive analysis
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Selling information that is later used in decision making constitutes an increasingly important business in modern economies (Jensen 1991). Information is sold under a large variety of forms: industry reports, consulting services, database access, and/or professional opinions given by medical, engineering, accounting/financial, and legal professionals, among others.
   This paper is the first attempt in marketing to study competition in the rapidly emerging information sector. Specifically, we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) Is competition fundamentally different when competing firms sell information rather than traditional goods and services, and-if yes-why? (2) What are the implications of such differences for decision makers (marketers and regulators)? (3) Can we explain some of the observed marketing strategies in the information industry? As such, the audience of the paper includes academics as well as professionals who are interested in understanding what is specific about competition in information markets. Familiarity with the practical implications of such differences and understanding of the mechanisms that drive them is essential for those who are faced with the problem of marketing information.
   To answer the above research questions we build a simple game-theoretic model that consists of two firms selling information to a population of consumers who are heterogeneous in their willingness to pay for the quality of information. The most important features of the model are the following. Information products sold by the two firms are modeled as random draws from two normal distributions having equal mean. The variances of these distributions and their correlatedness constitute the product-attribute space, which is assumed to be common knowledge. Consumers are interested in assessing the mean of the distributions and to do so they can buy the sample from any of the firms or they can buy both samples and combine them to obtain a more accurate estimate. Quality of information is linked to the accuracy of consumers' estimate of the mean which in turn is influenced by the accuracy of each sample as well as by their correlatedness. Consumers' utility depends on the quality of information they purchased, on their inherent utility for quality (taste), and on the total price they paid to acquire information. Knowing consumer preferences, firms simultaneously price their information products.
   The main finding of the paper is that information markets face unique competitive structures. In particular, the qualitative nature of competition changes depending on basic product characteristics. While traditional products and services compete either as substitutes or as complements in the relevant product-attribute space, information may be one or the other, depending on its position within the same product-attribute space. Said differently, the nature of competition changes qualitatively with a continuous change in basic product-attribute levels. The intuition behind this finding is the following. When purchasing information, consumers facing important decisions may find it beneficial to purchase from several information sellers. This is more likely to happen when the reliability of information is low and the sources of information are independent. Under such conditions information products tend to be complements and, as a result, competition between sellers is relatively mild. In the opposite case, when information is reliable and/or sellers' sources are highly correlated, consumers are satisfied after consulting a single source. In this case, information products are substitutes and sellers tend to undercut one another's prices to induce consumers to choose their brand.
   Understanding this discontinuity in competitive structures has important implications for decision makers as very different strategies are optimal under different product characteristics. Under substitution, traditional strategies to avoid competition (e.g., differentiation) are recommended. When the competing products' reliability is generally low (they are complements) firms are better off accommodating competition. In fact, we find that a firm may benefit from ''inviting'' a competitor. Finally, our findings are also important for regulators of information markets. As the literature on complementarity suggests, price fixing agreements between firms offering complementary products may benefit firms as well as consumers.

TI Finite-mixture structural equation models for response-based
   segmentation and unobserved heterogeneity
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Two endemic problems face researchers in the social sciences (e.g., Marketing, Economics, Psychology, and Finance): unobserved heterogeneity and measurement error in data. Structural equation modeling is a powerful tool for dealing with these difficulties using a simultaneous equation framework with unobserved constructs and manifest indicators which are error-prone. When estimating structural equation models, however, researchers frequently treat the data as if they were collected from a single population (Muthen 1989). This assumption of homogeneity is often unrealistic. For example, in multidimensional expectancy value models, consumers from different market segments can have different belief structures (Bagozzi 1982). Research in satisfaction suggests that consumer decision processes vary across segments (Day 1977).
   This paper shows that aggregate analysis which ignores heterogeneity in structural equation models produces misleading results and that traditional fit statistics are not useful for detecting unobserved heterogeneity in the data. Furthermore, sequential analyses that first form groups using cluster analysis and then apply multigroup structural equation modeling are not satisfactory.
   We develop a general finite mixture structural equation model that simultaneously treats heterogeneity and forms market segments in the context of a specified model structure where all the observed variables are measured with error. The model is considerably more general than cluster analysis, multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, and multigroup structural equation modeling. In particular, the model subsumes several specialized models including finite mixture simultaneous equation models, finite mixture confirmatory factor analysis, and finite mixture second-order factor analysis.
   The finite mixture structural equation model should be of interest to academics in a wide range of disciplines (e.g., Consumer Behavior, Marketing, Economics, Finance, Psychology, and Sociology) where unobserved heterogeneity and measurement error are problematic. In addition, the model should be of interest to market researcher; and product managers for two reasons. First, the model allows the manager to perform response-based segmentation using a consumer decision process model, while explicitly allowing for both measurement and structural error. Second, the model allows managers to detect unobserved moderating factors which account for heterogeneity. Once managers have identified the moderating factors, they can link segment membership to observable individual-level characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic and demographic variables) and improve marketing policy.
   We applied the finite mixture structural equation model to a direct marketing study of customer satisfaction and estimated a large model with unobserved constructs and 23 manifest indicators. The results show that there are three consumer segments that vary considerably in terms of the importance they attach to the various dimensions of satisfaction. In contrast, aggregate analysis is misleading because it incorrectly suggests that except for price all dimensions of satisfaction are significant for all consumers. Methodologically, the finite mixture model is robust; that is, the parameter estimates are stable under double cross-validation and the method can be used to test large models. Furthermore, the double cross-validation results show that the finite mixture model is superior to sequential data analysis strategies in terms of goodness-of-fit and interpretability.
   We performed four simulation experiments to test the robustness of the algorithm using both recursive and nonrecursive model specifications. Specifically, we examined the robustness of different model selection criteria (e.g, CAIC, BIG, and GFI) in choosing the correct number of clusters for exactly identified and overidentified models assuming that the distributional form is correctly specified. We also examined the effect of distributional misspecification (i.e., departures from multivariate normality) on model performance. The results show that when the data are heterogeneous, the standard goodness-of-fit statistics for the aggregate model are not useful for detecting heterogeneity. Furthermore parameter recovery is poor. For the finite mixture model, however, the BIC and CAIC criteria perform well in detecting heterogeneity and in identifying the true number of segments. In particular, parameter recovery for both the measurement and structural models is highly satisfactory. The finite mixture method is robust to distributional misspecification; in addition, the method significantly outperforms aggregate and sequential data analysis methods when the form of heterogeneity is misspecified (i.e., the true model has random coefficients).
   Researchers and practitioners should only use the mixture methodology when substantive theory supports the structural equation model, a priori segmentation is infeasible, and theory suggests that the data are heterogeneous and belong to a finite number of unobserved groups. We expect these conditions to hold in many social science ay,plications and, in particular, market segmentation studies.
   Future research should focus on large-scale simulation studies to test the structural equation mixture model using a wide range of models and statistical distributions. Theoretical research should extend the model by allowing the mixing proportions to depend on prior information and/or subject-specific variables. Finally, in order to provide a huller treatment of heterogeneity, we need to develop a general random coefficient structural equation model. Such a model is presently unavailable in the statistical and psychometric literatures.

TI Supermarket competition: The case of every day low pricing
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Every Day Low Pricing (EDLP) strategy has proved to be a successful innovation resulting in higher profits to supermarkets adopting it in competition with Promotional Pricing (PROMO). Conventional wisdom attributes this success either to lower costs or to EDLP better serving time constrained consumers, while discouraging cherry pickers who seek promotions. However, it is unclear that such cost savings are being fully realized since EDLP stores also engage in price promotions. Also, continued existence of PROMO stores means that costs are not the only factor, and they compete effectively without relying just on the cherry pickers. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that a supermarket cannot obtain higher profits by merely setting constant low prices, leading to the question: exactly what makes EDLP successful? This question is of particular relevance to both academics and practitioners who have been intrigued by the success of this retailing strategy. More generally, the retailing issues addressed in this paper, the economic analysis of competition, and the empirical findings should be of interest to the broader community of researchers and managers.
   We investigate the factors contributing to EDLP's success by analyzing the competition between supermarkets through a game theoretic analysis of a market consisting of both time constrained consumers and cherry pickers. Key features of our model are: consumers shop and purchase a basket of goods based on price announcements by stores and rational expectations of unannounced prices; stores carry more than one good and compete through prices, service, convenience, and appropriate communication strategies; and no exogenous cost asymmetries. We derive the conditions under which retailers choosing different strategies (EDLP and PROMO) is a perfect Nash equilibrium.
   Our analysis shows that the EDLP store's offering of constant every day low prices is an equilibrium outcome, endogenously determined. Successful implementation of the EDLP strategy involves communication of relative basket prices, implying that merely setting constant low prices is not viable. We further demonstrate that while time constrained consumers find every day low prices at EDLP attractive and cherry pickers the promotions at PROMO, clientele effects are in fact more complicated. Specifically, in equilibrium the PROMO store offers a higher service level as desired by time constrained consumers and the EDLP store a lower service level in keeping with the needs of cherry pickers. This choice of service by the two stores results in a cleaner segmentation of the market. The higher relative basket price and service at the PROMO store results in a larger base of time constrained consumers to shop at the PROMO store and a larger base of cherry pickers to shop at the EDLP store, even though some cherry pickers continue to visit the PROMO store to avail of the price specials. In this way, our results contradict the conventional wisdom on EDLP strategy as being mainly geared towards time constrained consumers. Finally, industry profits are higher in an EDLP-PROMO equilibrium than when stores adopt identical strategies.
   Our analysis and results also offer a more complete characterization of the EDLP and PROMO strategies. Indeed, we show that EDLP and PROMO strategies are positioning strategies, rather than merely pricing strategies, with different elements: price/promotions, service, and communications. While the EDLP store uses basket prices to attract both segments, the PROMO store uses service and price specials to compete in the time constrained and cherry picking segment, respectively. Given these different approaches of the two stores, the communication strategies of the EDLP and the PROMO stores emphasize these differences as well. In this way we show, as suggested by Corstjens and Corstjens (1994), that positioning in a retail context involves developing multidimensional strategies appealing to all segments, while each element of the strategy may focus on a different consumer segment. This is in contrast to the traditional view of segmentation in which different products in a product line, for example, are designed to appeal to different segments.
   We complete the analysis by examining the data from the trade press and a survey conducted in a major metropolitan area. These data, while limited in scope, support our theoretical results.

TI Manufacturer's returns policies and retail competition
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Manufacturers' returns policies are a common feature in the distribution of many products. The obvious rationale for returns policies is insurance. Practitioners, not surprisingly, have a different perspective and view returns as a cost of doing business. In this paper, we study the strategic effect of returns policies on retail competition and highlight its profitability implications for a manufacturer. The setting for our research is the distribution of products with uncertain demand, limited shelf lives, and retail competition. Our objective is to provide a better understanding of when manufacturers should adopt returns policies. The insights are obtained with a model based on the economics of strategy and decision making under uncertainty.
   We show that when retailing is competitive and there is no uncertainty in demand, a returns policy subtly induces retailers to compete more intensely. The provision of a returns policy reduces retail prices without affecting wholesale prices, thereby reducing retailer margins and improving manufacturer profitability. The intuition is that with a returns policy, Cournot-like levels of retail stocks cannot be sustained. Each retailer will order stocks so that it will not be constrained by stocks, and so, intensifying retail competition.
   When, however, demand is uncertain and there is a single retailer, a returns policy encourages the retailer to over-stock, and so decreases (upstream) manufacturer profits. While the provision of a returns policy leads to lower retail margins, the optimality of returns policy depends on the overall uncertainty and marginal cost. A returns policy reduces the dispersion in retail prices between the high and low states of demand and the range of retail prices in the returns case is contained within the range of retail prices for the no-returns case.
   In the general setting, when there are competing retailers and demand is uncertain, there is a trade-off for the manufacturer between the benefits (more intense retail competition) and the costs (excessive stocking) of a returns policy. We find that a manufacturer should accept returns when the marginal production cost is sufficiently low and demand uncertainty is not too great.
   To validate the results of our theory, we conduct an empirical test with data from a major U.S. retailer. The tests confirm our prediction that a returns policy intensifies retail competition and reduces retailer margins. Our theory and empirical test should interest practitioners and researchers in distribution, especially those concerned with managing retail competition.

TI A generalized utility model of disappointment and regret effects on
   post-choice valuation
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In this paper we show that performance information about ''forgone'' alternatives (i.e., alternative that were considered but not chosen) can have a significant impact on post-choice valuation. Our approach introduces a new and parsimonious way of looking at satisfaction that combines the literature on post-choice valuation with research regarding generalized expected utility theory. While the post-valuation literature focuses on the selected brand as the valuation's basis (e.g., Anderson and Sullivan 1993, Bolton and Drew 1991), we draw on a stream of research in generalized expected utility theory that considers both chosen and forgone alternatives as the basis for valuation (e.g., Bell 1983, 1985; Loomes and Sugden 1982, 1986). The result is a combined model of post-choice valuation that explicitly incorporates both concepts.
   Specifically, we extend the existing paradigm of post-choice valuation to include buyers' regret concerning forgone alternatives, proposing a generalized utility theory-based treatment of post-choice product assessment that uses the intuitively appealing concerts of disappointment and regret as the basis. We propose a model for conceptualizing post-choice valuation that is consistent with the existing literature, discuss how this model extends the construct to consider the influence of forgone alternatives, and report results of an empirical test that contrasts our model to important recent work in the area (e.g., Boulding et al. 1993).
   Our generalized model of post-choice valuation is based on the sum of three components that represent factors that may contribute to consumers' assessment of a chosen product or service. The first component is expected performance. The second component is disappointment, which captures the discrepancy between actual and expected performance (much as the disconfirmation construct in traditional satisfaction research). The third component is regret, which captures the difference between the performance of the chosen product/service and the performance of a forgone product/service. This perspective is useful in that risk is captured by the disappointment and regret terms, providing an intuitively appealing decomposition of post-choice valuation and offering several advances over previous representations of disappointment and regret.
   We test our model via a choice experiment. Participants in the empirical study were asked to make choices between successive lottery pairs. They were then given outcome feedback on the forgone alternative as well as on the chosen alternative in each lottery pair. Immediately following outcome feedback for each choice, subjects were asked to evaluate their decision. Our results clearly suggest an effect of regret on post-choice valuation-information about the forgone alternative influenced subjects' valuation of the chosen alternative. We also find evidence that, as predicted, the effects of disappointment and regret on post-choice valuation are asymmetric. Specifically, the negative effect of disappointment on post-choice valuation was greater than the positive effect of elation. Similarly, the negative effect of regret was greater than the positive impact of rejoicing.
   Our research offers five contributions to the Literature on post-choice valuation. First, our results illustrate the advantage of using generalized utility theory as the basis for conceptualizing and modeling post-choice valuation. We derive a model of post-choice valuation that formally captures the components of disappointment and regret and show that the outcome of both the chosen alternative (through disappointment) and a forgone alternative (through regret) can influence the chosen alternative's valuation. Second, we formally integrate the concepts of disappointment and regret, which have been examined separately for many years, into a single model based on a multiattribute preference structure. Third, we argue that the effects of disappointment and regret on post-choice valuation are asymmetric and present empirical evidence in this regard. Fourth, our results suggest that word-of-mouth regarding forgone alternatives may affect post-choice valuation, extending research that has not heretofore considered forgone outcomes' role in this process.
   Finally, our development provides a preconsumption measure of ''potential disappointment and regret'' in modeling choice. At the time of choice, consumers may visualize the feelings of disappointment and/or regret that will be derived at consumption, taking into account both the chosen brand and forgone brands. Our generalized utility theory-based approach to the post-choice valuation construct can be useful in examining the role of disappointment and regret as preconsumption constructs.

TI Slotting allowances and new product introductions
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Slotting allowances-lump sum transfers from manufacturers to retailers for carrying new products-have become an important part of promotional agreements over the past decade. Hardly known before the mid-1980s, they now represent a significant cost to launching a new entry in a wide range of product categories. Despite being commonplace, slotting allowances have remained extremely controversial both with manufacturers and retailers. The controversy, in part, follows from a poor understanding of the role that slotting allowances actually play in new product introductions. We attempt to clarify the purpose slotting allowances serve by relating the payment of a slotting allowance to the retailer's cost structure and informational asymmetries within a channel.
   We consider a manufacturer introducing a new product into a retail channel. The retailer is independent of the manufacturer and only accepts the product if he expects to recover a positive fixed cost at the terms of trade offered by the manufacturer. Following acceptance, the retailer exerts merchandising effort and sets the retail price. We show that if the manufacturer and the retailer are equally informed of the product's demand, the terms of trade never include a slotting allowance. High retail costs are compensated through a lower wholesale price.
   Similarly, if the manufacturer is better informed of the product's demand, she prefers to convey that information through the wholesale price alone. That is, a high wholesale price, not a slotting allowance, is the manufacturer's preferred signaling instrument. Signaling with the wholesale price alone fails, however, when the retailer has high fixed costs. To convey information and assure retailer participation, the terms of trade must include a positive slotting allowance. A slotting allowance thus serves two purposes in launching a product: passing information down to the retailer and shifting costs up to the manufacturer. We show that the manufacturer prefers paying a slotting allowance to undertaking purely wasteful advertising. A principal virtue of a slotting allowance, then, is keeping money within the channel.
   Our work is novel along two important dimensions. First, others (e.g., Chu 1992) have assumed that slotting fees arise as manufacturers respond to retailer demands. Here, the manufacturer willingly offers an allowance, As a consequence, slotting allowances do not represent a windfall for the retailer; he merely breaks even on a product for which a slotting allowance is paid. Second, we tie the payment of a slotting allowance to the retailer's fixed cost and the overall terms of trade. This allows us to consider a number of comparative statics with interesting implications. For example, a retailer may receive a slotting allowance for some categories and not for others if his costs differ actress categories. A ''slotted'' product is offered at a lower wholesale price which results in greater retailer effort than for a product on which no allowance is paid. Over a range of fixed costs, greater retailer effort should be correlated with a higher slotting allowance. Finally, for a specific functional form, we show that slotting allowances become more common (in the sense that they are paid over a greater range of retailer costs) as the retailer has greater merchandising ability.

TI Customer satisfaction, productivity, and profitability: Differences
   between goods and services
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB There is widespread belief that firms should pursue superiority in both customer satisfaction and productivity. However, there is reason to believe these two goals are not always compatible. If a firm improves productivity by ''downsizing,'' it may achieve an increase in productivity in the short-term, but future profitability may be threatened if customer satisfaction is highly dependent on the efforts of personnel. If so, there are potential tradeoffs between customer satisfaction and productivity for industries as diverse as airlines, banking, education, hotels, and restaurants. Managers in these types of service industries, as well as goods industries in which the sen ice component is increasing, need to understand whether or not this is the case. For example, if efforts to improve productivity can actually harm customer satisfaction-and vice-versa-the downsizing of U.S. and European companies should be viewed with concern. It follows that developing a better understanding of how customer satisfaction and productivity relate to one another is of substantial and growing importance, especially in light of expected continued growth in services throughout the world economy.
   The objective of this paper is to investigate whether there are conditions under which there are tradeoffs between customer satisfaction and productivity. A review of the literature reveals two conflicting viewpoints. One school of thought argues that customer satisfaction and productivity are compatible, as improvements in customer satisfaction can decrease the time and effort devoted to handling returns, rework, warranties, and complaint management, while at the same time lowering the cost of making future transactions. The second argues that increasing customer satisfaction should increase costs, as doing so often requires efforts to improve product attributes or overall product design.
   A conceptual framework useful in resolving these contradictory viewpoints is developed. The framework serves, in turn, as a basis for developing a theoretical model relating customer satisfaction and productivity. The model predicts that customer satisfaction and productivity are less likely to be compatible when: Ij customer satisfaction is relatively more dependent on customization-the degree to which the firm's offering is customized to meet heterogeneous customers' needs-as opposed to standardization-the degree to which the firm's offering is reliable, standardized, and free from deficiencies; and 2) when it is difficult (costly) to provide high levels of both customization and standardization simultaneously.
   To move forward from the model's propositions to the development of testable hypotheses, we argue that services are more Likely than goods to have the preceding characteristics. Hence, tradeoffs between customer satisfaction and productivity should be more prevalent for services than for goods. Although this classification is not precise-many services are standardizable and many goods have a service component-it has the advantage of allowing an initial test of the propositions.
   The empirical work employs a database matching customer-based measures of firm performance with traditional measures of business performance, such as productivity and Return on Investment (ROI). The central feature of this database is the set of customer satisfaction indices provided by the Swedish Customer Satisfaction Barometer (SCSB). The SCSB provides a uniform set of comparable customer-based firm performance measures and offers a unique opportunity to test the study's hypotheses.
   The findings indicate that the association between changes in customer satisfaction and changes in productivity is positive for goods, but negative for services. Ln addition, while both customer satisfaction and productivity are positively associated with ROI for goods and services, the interaction between the two is positive for goods but significantly less so for sen ices.
   Taken together, the findings suggest support for the contention that tradeoffs are more likely for services. Hence, simultaneous attempts to increase both customer satisfaction and productivity are likely to be more challenging in such industries. Of course, this does not imply that such firms should not seek improvements in both productivity and customer satisfaction. For example, appropriate applications of information technology may improve both customer satisfaction and productivity simultaneously.
   The findings should provide motivation for future research concerning the nature of customer satisfaction and productivity, as well as appropriate strategy and tactics for each one. It is worth emphasizing that this is an issue that is not only important today, but certainly will become even more important in the future. As the growth of services continues and world markets become increasingly competitive, the importance of customer satisfaction will also increase. To compete in such a world, firms must strike the right balance between their efforts to compete efficiently and their efforts to compete effectively.

TI Products with branded components: An approach for premium pricing and
   partner selection
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB An increasing number of products are being sold with components that themselves are brand names. Examples are personal computers with Intel microprocessors and diet soft drinks that use the NutraSweet formulation. Branded com ponents may alter consumers' valuation of the bundle, necessitating changes in the ways firms identify and price such bundled products. Surprisingly, the existing marketing Literature is silent on this issue.
   The purpose of our paper is to propose an analytical approach that helps marketers of products with branded components make optimal pricing and partner selection decisions. Our managerial objectives are twofold: (a) To the seller of the bundled product, we suggest the optimal bundled product offering, optimal selling prices of alternative products, revenues and profits; and (b) to the branded component manufacturers, we indicate the most favorable alliance partner(s), and payoff gains/losses of aligning with other branded components instead of unbranded alternatives. Our analytical approach is also likely to be helpful to academics researching bundling and ingredient branding issues.
   The specific problem modeled assumes the bundled product has two components that are consumed jointly. Furthermore, each component can be either a brand name or ''unbranded.'' In this model, the consumer has no control over the choice of the components in the bundle; the seller decides what form of bundle components (i.e., branded or unbranded) to offer. We assume that the product that is marketed eventually enjoys a monopoly. Drawing from research in signaling and brand alliance, we posit each branded component may either enrich or suppress the value of the partnering component in the bundle as perceived by the consumers.
   Our approach has three methodological stages. First, we build an individual level model to assess the valuation of alternative products and their principal components at the level of a randomly drawn consumer. To do so, we rely primarily on the theory of reservation prices and Weber's theory on price/value changes. Second, we aggregate such valuation across consumers to assess the market's overall valuation. For this purpose, we invoke parametric distributions based on integral transform theory. Third, we develop payoff functions based on market valuation of alternative products and supply-side costs. The managerial objectives are met based on results from this stage. Our approach was successfully applied to the context of a university bookstore that intends to sell ''Windows''-based laptop computers. The two principal components of the laptop computer bundle are the microprocessor chip and the personal computer platform on which the chip is implanted. The seller may choose either Compaq with ''Intel Inside'' or a simpler bundle featuring one of these with an unbranded, complementary component, or an entirely unbranded bundle. We used data collected from 192, potential consumers via a survey. Included in the survey were measures of consumers' perceptions of functional aspects of the components, and their reservation prices for alternative bundled products.
   The approach identified the most profitable bundle for the seller and its optimal price. It also provided estimates of the revenue impact of the gain or loss for each branded component by partnering the other branded component instead of the unbranded alternative, As such, the model facilitates the determination of the optimal price, price premium, and profits for products with branded components, as well as the identification of the ideal partner for each branded component manufacturer.
   It is apt to caution that products with branded components need not always lead to price premiums or lead to win-win outcomes. Reasons such as incongruity between the branded components or domination of one of the components over the other may drive potential consumers away, thus hurting profits.
   Implications of the results to negotiate component prices are discussed in the payer. The study limitations and directions for future research are also prcsented.

TI Incorporating demographic variables in brand choice models: An
   indivisible alternatives framework
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Incorporating demographic variables in brand choice models is conceptually appealing and has numerous managerial benefits. Retailers and brand managers can assess geodemographic variations in demand and marketing mix response in order to implement micromarketing strategies. For example, a retailer planning to locate a new outlet can get some sense of the differences in demand patterns and price and promotion sensitivities in the new trading area in order to make initial stocking, inventory, pricing, and promotion decisions. For existing outlets, retailers can fine tune the assortment and merchandising activities in a category to match local market conditions. Similarly, a packaged goods manufacturers would benefit from getting a sense of whether they should stress promotional activity for one part of a brand's product line in some retail trading areas, and other parts of the brand's line in other retail trading areas.
   Unfortunately, a general finding across existing studies is that the impact of demographic variables on brand choice is neither strong nor consistent. These findings are puzzling given that one would expect certain demographic variables, such as income, to have some influence on brand choice behavior, Moreover, Hoch et al. (1995), using store level data, find that a relatively small set of demographic variables is much more influential than competitive variables in explaining differences in price sensitivity across retail trading areas. In light of such contradictory findings, there is a need for a better conceptualization of the role of income and other demographic variables in household purchasing, and this is the primary objective of this study.
   This paper presents a microeconomic-based framework called the ''indivisible alternatives'' (IDA) framework to model household brand choice. A key aspect of the IDA framework is that it explicitly models alternatives in the market as being indivisible, while past work has either explicitly or implicitly assumed perfect divisibility. Indivisibilities force a household's selection of a brand size and its level of category expenditure into a single joint decision. Hence, demographic variables that influence category expenditure (e.g., income) also influence the choice of a brand size. In addition, since alternatives in the category come in several discrete sizes, indivisibilities introduce differences in holding costs in the choice of a brand-size combination. Consequently, demographic factors that influence holding costs through consumption rate differences (e.g., household size) impact the choice of a brand size in a product category. In this manner, indivisibilities in market offerings naturally lead to differences in choice behavior across households that can be linked to demographic factors in a logical fashion.
   In empirical applications tea two different scanner panel data sets (ketchup and ground coffee), the proposed framework compares favorably with two benchmark specifications in terms of both goodness of fit and predictive validity. The results from these product categories indicate that a household's price sensitivity is inversely related to its income level, and that factors such as household size and seasonality, which are likely to influence consumption rates, make households mure or less willing to buy larger package sizes. Income elasticity estimates from the model confirm that, ceteris paribus, households with lower incomes will have a higher propensity to purchase private lab,els and generic brands, and a lower propensity to purchase national brands, compared with households with higher incomes.
   The micromarketing potential of the IDA framework is explored in market simulations conducted for two different zip codes within a metropolitan area that vary with respect to income levels and other demographic factors. The results indicate that for the product categories studied, there are substantial differences across market areas in their response to the retail promotion of very large and very small package sizes within the same brand's product line. The differences in response suggest that it may be beneficial to customize promotional programs to market areas based on their underlying demographic composition. Finally, our findings suggest a link; between household income and deal proneness that is conditional on other demographic variables and the expenditure required for the brand size in question. Specifically, we find that smaller households with lower income levels are moro likely to respond to promotions for smaller, less expensive items within a category, while larger households with higher incomes are more likely to respond to promotions for larger, more expensive items within a category.

TI Vertical strategic interaction: Implications for channel pricing
   strategy
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper examines two strategic pricing decisions within channels: using foresight (i.e., price leadership) and considering category implications (i.e., product line pricing). Are price leadership and product Line pricing always the best pricing strategies for a channel member? If not, when does this occur and why? By investigating these questions, we address some major concerns of both marketing practitioners and scholars interested in channel management issues. In addition, this study provides an indepth discussion on why previous analytic studies produced answers to these questions that depend upon the choice of the form of demand functions. As such, this study should significantly resolve the debate among analytic marketing modelers about the ''right'' demand specification.
   At the core of our discussion lies the concept of vertical strategic interaction, which is defined in terms of the direction of a channel member's reaction to the actions of its channel partner within a given demand structure. Specifically, if a channel member's best reaction is to reduce its margin when its channel partner increases its margin, the type of vertical strategic interaction is referred to as vertical strategic substitutability (VSS). If the best reaction is to increase the margin, the environment is referred to as vertical strategic complementarity (VSC). If the best reaction is no margin change, it is referred to as vertical strategic independence (VSI). Using a game theoretic approach, we demonstrate that these three types of vertical strategic interactions represent a key driving force for optimal decisions on channel price leadership and product line pricing.
   Our investigation involves mathematical analyses of an industry model composed of two manufacturers selling competing products, both carried by two competing retailers. As such, the model allows for retailer product Line pricing as well as manufacturer and retailer level competition. In addition, this general model can be used to analyze three more restrictive industry settings often found in the channels literature, i.e., a bilateral monopoly (Jeuland and Shugan 1983), two competing manufacturers selling through competing franchised retailers (McGuire and Staelin 1983), and two competing manufacturers selling through one common retailer using product line pricing (Choi 1991). Unlike many other channel studies, most of our analyses are performed without assuming particular functional forms of demand curves. Thus, this payer provides greater assurance that the insights from this stream of research are broadly applicable, not only across industry structures but also across demand conditions.
   The paper starts out by defining three different rules for how prices are set: The manufacturer uses foresight, the retailer uses foresight, and neither channel member uses foresight. We then show a one-to-one mapping between the type of vertical strategic interaction and the optimality of channel price leadership. Specifically, a channel member finds it profitable to be a price leader for VSS but prefers to be a follower for VSC. For VSI, channel members are indifferent to the channel price leadership issue, as it has no effect on channel member profits. We also show that there exist conditions under which a retailer might see a reduction in profits when it changes its policy from non-product line pricing to product line pricing. Such conditions arise when the retailer is not a price leader and the environment is characterized by VSS or VSC. At a more general level, this study suggests not only the value but also the cost to a firm for using superior knowledge (i.e., foresight and/or product line pricing) in making strategic marketing decisions. In this way, ''ignorance can be bliss.''
   We also explore the link between demand characteristics and the three types of vertical strategic interaction. We show that the type of vertical strategic interaction present in a given environment is closely related with the convexity of the demand curve and the level of demand for a given price. Interestingly, we End that linearity of demand is not a necessary condition for any of the three types of vertical strategic demand function. Consequently, in evaluating the robustness of analytic analyses, it may be more important to determine the type of vertical strategic interaction assumed instead of whether the demand is linear or nonlinear.
   Finally, our results are limited to situations where the channels are not coordinated and the retailer's precommitment to particular pricing policy and decision is credible. Although such situations still capture a significant portion of reality, we acknowledge that the insights from this study might not be applicable in all situations.

TI Why store brand penetration varies by retailer
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Our objective in this paper is to explain across-retailer variation in private label performance. Although retailers have lots to gain by better understanding the determinants of successful store brand programs, this knowledge also is very valuable to manufacturers, Lessons learned from competing with other national brands may not transfer one-to-one to the store brand case because, quite simply, a popular private label program changes the status of the retailer from being solely a customer to also a competitor. When customers are competitors, standard predatory tactics may not be appropriate; instead there is a premium on creating a successful basis for coexistence. Our findings from this study are therefore expected to have a broad based appeal both to practitioners and academics working in the evolving area of store brands.
   Store brands are the only brand for which the retailer must take on all responsibility-from development, sourcing, and warehousing to merchandising and marketing. Unlike decisions retailers take about national brands, which in large measure are driven by the manufacturer's actions, the retailer plays a more determinant role in the success or failure of its own label. Based on data from 34 food categories for 106 major supermarket chains operating in the largest 50 retail markets in the U.S., we use regression-based analyses to show that variation in store brand performance across retailers is systematically related to underlying consumer, retailer, and manufacturer factors.
   The key insights provided by our analysis are as follows:
   (1) Overall chain strategy in terms of commitment to quality, breadth of private label offerings, use of own name for private label, a premium brand offering, and number of stores consistently enhance the retailer's store brand performance in all categories. Also, the extent to which the retailer serves a customer base containing less wealthy anti more elderly households and operates in less competitive markets improves the performance of the store brand.
   (2) The everyday low price (EDLP) positioning benefits the store brand but only in lower quality categories where the value positioning of the store may be better aligned with the price advantage of the store brand.
   (3) Supporting recent statements in the popular press, our analysis suggests that retailer promotional support can significantly enhance private label performance.
   (4) Retailers often use national brands to draw customers to their stores. Retailers who pursue this traffic building strategy usually carry more national brands, deeper assortments, and offer better everyday (lower price gap) and promotional prices on national brands. Each of these actions works against the retailer's own brands, highlighting the important balancing act the retailer must perform to profitably manage the sales revenue and margin mix In each of their categories. At the same time, adding a higher quality premium store brand program may mitigate this tradeoff.
   (5) Unlike cross-category studies, our within-category across-retailer analysis shows that the national brand-private label price differential exerts an important positive influence on store brand performance.
   (6) When retailers obtain more than their fair share of a category (high category development index), they also do much better with private labels.
   (7) From the national brand's perspective, encouraging the retailer to carry more brands and deeper assortments may be the most effective way to keep store brands in check. The importance of these variables, however, may depend on the national brand's market position. For example, a category leader may be glad to see a rise in store brand share if it comes at the expense of one of its secondary national brand competitors.
   (8) The exact impact of most of the variables depends on the underlying quality of store brands in a category. When store brand quality is high, competition at the retail and brand level is more important, as are variables capturing economies of scale and scope enjoyed by the retailer. In contrast, demographics associated with consumer price sensitivity and EDLP pricing matter more in low quality categories.
   (9) Finally, premium store brands offer the retailer an avenue for responding to the national brand's ability to cater to heterogeneous preferences. This appears more likely in categories where store brands already offer high quality comparable to the national brands.
   We argue that private labels threaten national brands most in categories when there is high variance in share across categories (as opposed to high average share per se). In high variance categories, store brand share could increase dramatically if the poor performing retailers imitate best praci tices. Future research can extend this work in several ways both on the substantive and methodological fronts.

TI Dual distribution channels: The competition between rental agencies and
   dealers
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Managerial decisions involving marketing channels are among the most critical that an organization must make. Part of the reason for this importance is that relationships between manufacturers and their intermediaries usually involve long-term commitments that are difficult to change. On the other hand, in order to respond to the realities of the market place, an organization must be ready to adapt its distribution practices-sometimes under considerable uncertainty about the long-term consequences. Such a problem faces the U.S. automobile industry, which has led manufacturers to experiment with various channel structures. When manufacturers first changed their distribution policies, they were clear about the short-term effect on sales, but were unsure about its longer term impact on profitability. In this article, we develop a model to analyze the marketing of durable products through multiple channels. Our analysis suggests that, oven though it was not apparent at the time, manufacturers were indeed behaving optimally when they changed their policies. Our model provides insights not only to automobile manufacturers but also to practitioners and academics who are interested in understanding the unique problems associated with marketing durable products through multiple channels.
   We develop a two-period model by assuming that a single manufacturer markets a durable product through two retailers-a rental agency and a dealer. The rental agency focuses mainly on renting the product in a daily rental market while the dealer focuses on selling the product to a different set of customers in the sales market. To model the development of channels in the U.S. automobile industry, we analyze three different channel structures. The first structure, a separate channel, reflects the state of the industry through most of the 1980s, when rental agencies were franchised solely to rent and dealers solely to sell the cars. In response to a decrease in overall sales, manufacturers encouraged rental agencies to sell their ''slightly used'' rental cars in the consumer market, resulting in the second structure, an overlapping channel. Dealers did not like this arrangement, however, and in the next experiment, a buyback channel, some manufacturers began buying back used rental ears and selling them through dealers.
   In terms of the consumer side of the model, we assume that consumers are heterogeneous and have product valuations that are distributed uniformly between a low and a high value. In addition, they recognize that as the durable depreciates with use, its secondhand market value decreases. While both sold and rented goods depreciate with use, we assume, based on an analysis of market prices, that sold goods depreciate at a higher rate than rented goods. Given these different depreciation rates and consumers' underlying utility functions, we develop the market demand functions in the dealer's and rental agency's markets. Then for each of the channel structures, we solve the intermediaries' and manufacturer's problems.
   The main contribution of this article is that it allows us to evaluate the profitability associated with various channel structures for all the players in our analysis-the dealer, the rental agency, and the manufacturer. In terms of the intermediaries, we find that the overlapping channel is the most profitable structure for the rental agency; on the other hand, it is the least profitable for the: dealer. In terms of manufacturer profitability, our model suggests that the separate channel is the least profitable, and the overlapping channel is the most profitable. It is interesting to note that the distribution structure in existence today is more akin to a buyback channel. ntis strikes us as a compromise channel, which alleviates dealer concerns with the overlapping channel, and;Vet does not harm rental agencies as much as a separate channel, These are surprising results because conventional wisdom has been that the overlapping channel was competing away profits for all players. This suggests to us that automobile manufacturers were indeed on the right track when they began experimenting with the structure of their distribution channels.

TI Side payments in marketing
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Side payments, known politely as gainsharing and pejoratively as bribery, are prevalent in marketing. Indeed, many management schools have added ethics modules to their basic marketing courses to discuss these issues and there is much discussion of side payments in the literature (e.g., Adams 1995, Borrus 1995, Mauro 1997, Mohl 1996, Murphy 1995, Peterson 1996, and Rose-Ackerman 1996). We seek to provide insight with respect to one class of marketing side payments. We hope that our analyses clarify some of the issues and suggest how these side payments affect marketing activities.
   We begin by focusing on one common example of potential side payments-salesforce ratings of internal sales support. We derive two formal results and speculate on how these results generalize. The two results are (1) that having one group of employees rate another implies that there are almost always incentives for side payments, but (2) the side payments need not reduce the firm's profit. At least in theory, the firm is always able to revise the reward system to factor out these side payments. The first result, based on a straightforward proof, has important practical implications for managers who may wish to preclude side payments. They may be unable to design a ratings-based reward system that does not have inherent incentives for side payments. The second result, in our opinion, is quite surprising. It suggests that marketing managers might be advised to invest more time into understanding how side payments affect employee reactions to reward systems. They might want to reconsider costly efforts to monitor, police,or preclude such side payments. While our results do not substitute for a moral discussion of side payments, we hope that the formal structure for one common marketing situation provides valuable insight.
   The system we analyze is based on a practical managerial problem we have observed. The salesforce evaluates a sales support group with a real-valued rating. The sales support group is rewarded based on that rating, whereas the salesforce is rewarded based on outcomes, such as sales or customer satisfaction, that indicate incremental profits to the firm. The reward to the salesforce might also depend upon how it rates sales support. For example, the salesforce might be held to a higher standard whenever it rates sales support as ''excellent.'' (We argue in the paper that the firm will want this to happen.) In addition, the salesforce might ask for a side payment from the sales support group as compensation for high ratings.
   We cast the practical problem as a formal game and incorporate the following issues: (1) incremental actions taken by the salesforce and by sales support are perceived to be onerous, (2) the measure of incremental profit is a noisy measure, (3) both the salesforce and sales support are risk averse, (4) given the reward system Imposed by the firm, both the salesforce and sales support will maximize their well-being, and (5) given the structure of the reward system, the firm will seek to maximize expected profits.
   We first show that there are almost always incentives for side payments. Specifically, we demonstrate that sales support is better off with a side payment, while the salesforce is no worse off. This is not surprising because the reward to sales support is increasing in the rating, while in the absence of a side payment, the salesforce will select a rating such that its net marginal returns to increasing the rating are zero. The exception occurs when the rating is constrained by the firm to be less than this ''optimal'' racing, but even then there might be incentives for side payments.
   We next show that the firm can anticipate these side payments and design a reward system to factor them out at no loss of profit. The intuition is straightforward. The firm first adjusts the marginal returns in the reward functions for sales support and for the salesforce such that they will each take the ''optimal'' actions even though they engage in side payments. Then the firm adjusts their fixed compensation so that the firm extracts its full profit. The proof is difficult because we must show that adjusted reward systems exist and we must show that they allow the full profit to be extracted.
   Throughout the paper we discuss the practical implications of our results. We close by highlighting future research opportunities.

TI Will it ever fly? Modeling the takeoff of really new consumer durables
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A consistent pattern observed for really new household consumer durables is a takeoff or dramatic increase in sales early in their history. The takeoff tends to appear as an elbow-shaped discontinuity in the sales curve showing an average sales increase of over 400%. In contrast, most marketing textbooks as well as diffusion models generally depict the growth of new consumer durables as a smooth sales curve.
   Our discussions with managers indicate that they have little idea about the takeoff and its associated characteristics. Many managers did not even know that most successful new consumer durables had a distinct takeoff. Their sales forecasts tend to show linear growth. Yet, knowledge about the takeoff is crucial for managers to decide whether to maintain, increase, or withdraw support of new products. It is equally important for industry analysts who advise investors and manufacturers of complementary and substitute products.
   Although previous studies have urged researchers to examine the takeoff, no research has addressed this critical event. While diffusion models are commonly used to study new product sales growth, they do not explicitly consider a new product's takeoff in sales. Indeed, diffusion researchers frequently use data only from the point of takeoff. Therefore, nothing is known about the takeoff or models appropriate for this event. Our study provides the first analysis of the takeoff. In particular, we address three key questions: (i) How much time does a newly introduced product need to takeoff? (ii) Does the takeoff have any systematic patterns? (iii) Can we predict the takeoff?
   We begin our study by developing an operational measure to determine when the takeoff occurs. We found that when the base level of sales is small, a relatively large percentage increase could occur without signaling the takeoff. Conversely, when the base level of sales is large, the takeoff sometimes occurs with a relatively small percentage increase in sales. Therefore, we developed a ''threshold for takeoff.'' This is a plot of percentage sales growth relative to a base level of sales, common across all categories. We define the takeoff as the first year in which an individual category's growth rate relative to base sales crosses this threshold. The threshold measure correctly identifies the takeoff in over 90% of our categories.
   We model the takeoff with a hazard model because of its advantages for analyzing time-based events. We consider three primary independent variables: price, year of introduction, and market penetration, as well as several control variables. The hazard model fits the pattern of takeoffs very well, with price and market penetration being strong correlates of takeoff.
   Our results provide potential generalizations about the time to takeoff and the price reduction, nominal price, and penetration at takeoff. In particular, we found that:
   On average for 16 post-World War II categories:
   the price at takeoff is 63% of the introductory price;
   the time to takeoff from introduction is six years;
   the penetration at takeoff is 1.7%.
   The time to takeoff is decreasing for more recent categories. For example, the time to takeoff is 18 years for categories introduced before World War II, but only six years for those introduced after World War Tl.
   Many of the products in our sample had a takeoff near three specific price points (in nominal dollars): $1000, $500 and $100.
   In addition, we show how the hazard model can be used to predict the takeoff. The model predicts takeoff one year ahead with an expected average error of 1.2 years. It predicts takeoff at a product's introduction with an expected average error of 1.9 years. Even against the simple mean time to takeoff of six years for recent categories, the model's performance represents a tremendous improvement in prediction. It represents an immeasurable improvement in prediction for managers who currently have no idea about how long it takes for a new product to takeoff. The threshold rule for determining takeoff can be used to distinguish between a large increase in sales and a real takeoff.
   Some limitations of this study could provide fruitful areas for future research. Our independent variables suffer from endogeneity bias, so alternative variables or methods could address this Limitation. Also, the takeoff may be related to additional variables such as relative advantage over substitutes and the presence of complementary products. Finally, examination of sales from takeoff to their leveling off could be done with an integrated model of takeoff and sales growth or with the hazard model we propose. Generalizations about this period of sales growth could also be of tremendous importance to managers of new products.

TI Pioneers' marketing mix reactions to entry in different competitive game
   structures: Theoretical analysis and empirical illustration
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Pioneers' marketing mix reactions to new entries are recognized as important determinants of the outcome of pioneer-late mover competition, particularly in price-inelastic markets such as those for pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, and luxury goods. Managers in such markets are interested in better understanding when to accommodate (i.e., decrease marketing spending) or retaliate (i.e., increase spending) in nonprice marketing variables such as advertising and salesforce. In addition, the reallocation of marketing resources toward advertising (indicated by a pull strategy) or salesforce (indicated by a push strategy) upon entry is strategically important to managers.
   Previous theoretical research shows that pioneers should retaliate in both static and growing markets. Results from empirical research are mixed in that they support both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets. Empirical research also shows that a pioneer accommodates (retaliates) with its low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable.
   Contrary to prior research, however, some pioneers have successfully accommodated late movers in growing markets, and in some cases, have accommodated with their stronger marketing mix variables and also retaliated with their weaker marketing mix variables. For example, Bristol Myers Squibb's Capoten accommodated the entry of Merck's Vasotec in the growing ace-inhibitors market with its more powerful variable, salesforce, but also retaliated with its less potent variable, advertising. Moreover, not much is known about how the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should change (i.e., toward pull vs. push strategies) in response to new entries. We seek to better explain the pioneer's reactions and predict its shift in marketing mix allocation upon new entry.
   We note that prior research's predictions on the pioneer's reactions are based on a limited number of key factors such as product-market characteristics and the pioneer's elasticities prior to a new entry. In this paper, we extend previous research by adding two other critical factors, namely, the impact of new entry on the pioneer's elasticities and margin, and different competitive game structures to better predict and explain the pioneer's reactions.
   We develop analytical results on the pioneer's reactions in price, advertising, and salesforce in different competitive games (both Nash and different leader-follower games). In these results we identify the conditions under which the pioneer should accommodate, or retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift its marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies. We empirically illustrate some of the analytical results using data from a pharmaceutical category.
   We show that a pioneer who adopts a follower (leader) role with respect to a marketing mix variable in a static (growing) market, and witnesses a decrease (an increase) in own elasticity and margin upon a new entry, generally should accommodate (retaliate) in that variable. However, we are also able to show that there are casts where these general reactions don't hold. Thus, for example, it is possible for a pioneer to find it optimal to accommodate in a growing market or to retaliate even when its elasticity decreases upon entry, depending on the combination of competitive game, the impact of entry on elasticities and margin, and market growth. In this way, our results point to the fact that it is necessary to look not only at one factor at a time, but instead examine the combination of all the factors.
   We explain the empirical support for both accommodation and retaliation in growing markets by showing that the pioneer should accommodate (retaliate) a late mover with its competitively low (high) elasticity marketing mix variable. Competitively high (low) elasticity variables are not (are) Likely to be significantly reduced by a new entry in the anticipated competitive game; With regard to reallocation of the pioneer's marketing mix, we show that the change in the pioneer's marketing mix allocation should follow the change in the relative marketing mix effectiveness after new entry. This, in turn, depends on the structure of competition, the impact of the late mover on its elasticities and margins, and the competitor's marketing mix elasticities, in addition to own elasticities.
   The results can guide managers on how factors such as competitive structure, changes in elasticities and margin, and market growth impact the pioneer's marketing mix decisions, and on when to accommodate, retaliate, or not react to a late mover's entry, and shift marketing mix allocation toward pull versus push strategies.

TI The impact of waiting time guarantees on customers' waiting experiences
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Customers often have to wait during the process of acquiring and consuming many products and services. These waiting experiences are typically negative and have been known to affect customers' overall satisfaction with the product or service. To better manage these waiting experiences, many firms have instituted a variety of programs not only to reduce the actual duration of the wait but also to improve customers' perceptions of it.
   In this paper, we examine the impact of one such initiative, namely, the institution of a waiting time guarantee, on customers' waiting experiences. A waiting time guarantee is a commitment from a firm to serve its customers within a specified period of time. If the firm fails to meet this commitment for some customers then it compensates them for the delay. Today, a large number of firms in a variety of industries such as fast food, banking, industrial distribution, and healthcare offer such time guarantees to their customers.
   We develop a utility theory-based model of customers' satisfaction with waiting in Line. The model is based upon the assumption that when a customer joins a queue he or she has some prior beliefs about the distribution of service times at the firm. The customer estimates the likely duration of the waiting time on the basis of these beliefs about the service times and the observed queue length. We further assume that as the customer observes the service times for other customers who are ahead in the queue, he or she successively updates these beliefs about the distribution of service times in a Bayesian manner. We then posit that the customer's satisfaction both during as well as the end of the wait is determined by the difference between the customer's updated and the prior estimates of the total waiting time.
   We apply the model to derive select hypotheses pertaining to the impact of a waiting time guarantee on customers' waiting experiences. These hypotheses are based upon the assumption that an offer of a time guarantee is a signal of reliability from the firm and reduces customers' perceived variance around the expected service times. We empirically test these hypotheses using data from a series of interactive, computer-based laboratory experiments. In these experiments, we used the computer to create animations of real-life waiting experiences. The computer display consisted of a queue of customers waiting for service at a counter. One of the customers represented the participant in the experi ment. During the course of the experiment, each participant joined the queue, waited in line for service, and then exited the system. At several points during the wait, each participant reported his or her level of satisfaction with the waiting experience.
   Our results suggest that if customers observe the service times to be less than expected, their satisfaction increases monotonically during the wait. Further, under such circumstances, the explicit provision of a waiting time guarantee enhances satisfaction both during as well as at the end of the wait. However, if customers observe the service times to be more than expected, then their satisfaction typically declines at the beginning of the wait but increases toward the end of the wait. Further, under these circumstances, the initial positive impact of the provision of a waiting time guarantee declines over time. Moreover, at the end of the wait, customers in guaranteed environments are actually less satisfied than those in unguaranteed environments. Overall, we find that a time guarantee, if met, increases satisfaction at the end of a wait; however, if violated, then it decreases satisfaction at the end of the wait. We discuss the implications of these and other empirical findings for the management of customers' waiting experiences.

TI Creating micro-marketing pricing strategies using supermarket scanner
   data
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Micro-marketing refers to the customization of marketing mix variables to the store-level. This paper shows how prices can be profitably customized at the store-level, rather than adopting a uniform pricing policy across all stores. Historically, there has been a trend by retailers to consolidate independent stores into large national and regional chains. This move toward consolidation has been driven by the economies of scale associated with these larger operations. However, some of these large chains have lost the adaptability of independent neighborhood stores. Micro-marketing represents an interest on the part of managers to combine the advantages of these large operations with the flexibility of independent neighborhood stores.
   A basis for these customized pricing strategies is the result of differences in interbrand competition across stores. These changes in interbrand competition are measured using weekly store-level scanner data at the product level. Obviously, this presents a huge estimation problem, since we wish to measure substitution between each product at a store-level. For a chain with 100 stores and 10 products in a category we would need to estimate over 100,000 parameters. To reliably estimate these individual store differences we phrase our problem in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Essentially, each store-level parameter can be thought of as a combination of chain-level and random store-specific effects. The improvement in estimating this model comes from exploiting the common chain-level component. In addition, we relate these store-specific changes to demographic and competitive characteristics of the store's trading area, which helps explain why these differences are present.
   These estimated differences in price response are in turn used to set store-level prices. To simplify and focus the problem we limit our attention to everyday price changes (i.e., the prices of products that are not advertised). There are many marketing variables that can be adjusted at a store-level (e.g., promotions and product assortments); the reason we concentrate upon everyday pricing is driven by its importance in the marketing mix, that most profits are earned on products sold at their everyday price, and the amenability of everyday prices to store-level customizations. A limitation of this approach is that it yields only a partial solution to the retailer's global optimization problem.
   A challenge for the retailer in implementing micro-marketing pricing strategies is to retain a consistent image while altering prices that adapt to neighborhood differences in demand. Our approach is to search for price changes that leave image unchanged. We argue that a sufficient condition for holding the input to store image constant from everyday pricing is to hold average price and revenues at their current levels. We implement this condition by introducing constraints into the profit maximization problem. Future research into store choice may yield more efficient conditions. A benefit of holding the retailer's image constant is that it does not require costly new information about competitors and promotional activity. Instead, retailers are able to derive these store-level customizations based largely upon scanner data. This is very advantageous since this information is already being collected and is readily available.
   Our results indicate that micro-marketing pricing strategies would be profitable and could increase gross profit margins by 4 percent to 10 percent. When these gross profit gains are considered after administrative and operating costs are taken into account, they could increase operating profit margins by 33 percent to 83 percent. These gains come from encouraging consumers through everyday price changes to switch to more profitable bundles of products, and not through overall price changes at the chain-level. These results show that the information contained in the retailer's store-level scanner data is an under-utilized resource. By exploiting this information using newer and more powerful computational techniques managers can better appreciate its value. The implication is that profits could be increased and gains can be made by using this information as the basis for micro-marketing.

TI Bias and systematic change in the parameter estimates of macro-level
   diffusion models
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Studies estimating the Bass model and other macro-level diffusion models with an unknown ceiling feature three curious empirical regularities: (i) the estimated ceiling is often close to the cumulative number of adopters in the last observation period, (ii) the estimated coefficient of social contagion or imitation tends to decrease as one adds later observations to the data set, and (iii) the estimated coefficient of social contagion or imitation tends to decrease systematically as the estimated ceiling increases.
   We analyze these patterns in detail, focusing on the Bass model and the nonlinear Least squares (NLS) estimation method, Using both empirical and simulated diffusion data, we show that NLS estimates of the Bass model coefficients are biased and that they change systematically as one extends the number of observations used in the estimation. We also identify the lack of richness in the data compared to the complexity of the model (known as ill-conditioning) as the cause of these estimation problems.
   In an empirical analysis of twelve innovations, we assess how tho model parameter estimates change as one adds later observations to the data set. Our analysis shows that, on average, a 10% increase in the observed cumulative market penetration is associated with, roughly, a 5% increase in estimated market size m, a 10% decrease in the estimated coefficient of imitation q, and a 15% increase the estimated coefficient of innovation p.
   A simulation study shows that the NLS parameter estimates of the Bass model change systematically as one adds later observations to the data set, even in the absence of model misspecification, We find about-the same effect sizes as in the empirical analysis. The simulation also shows that the estimates are biased and that the amount of bias is a function of (i) the amount of noise in the data, (ii) the number of data points, and (iii) the difference between the cumulative penetration in the last observation period and the true penetration ceiling (i.e., the extent of right censoring). All three conditions affect the level of ill-conditioning in the estimation, which, in turn, affects bias in NLS regression. In situations consistent with marketing applications, m can be underestimated by 20%, p underestimated by the same amount, and q overestimated by 30%.
   The existence of a downward bias in the estimate of tn and an upward bias in the estimate of q, and the fact that these biases become smaller as the number of data points increases and the censoring decreases, can explain why systematic changes in the parameter estimates are observed in many applications. A reduced bias, though, is not the only possible explanation for the systematic change in parameter estimates observed in empirical studies, Not accounting for the growth in the population, for the effect of economic and marketing variables, or for population heterogeneity is likely to result In increasing (m) over cap and decreasing (q) over cap as well. In an analysis of six innovations, however, we find that attempts to address possible model misspecification problems by making the model more flexible and adding free parameters result in larger rather than smaller systematic changes in the estimates.
   The bias and systematic change problems we identify are sufficiently large to make long-term predictive, prescriptive and descriptive applications of Bass-type models problematic. Hence, our results should be of interest to diffusion researchers as well as to users of diffusion models, including market forecasters and strategic market planners.

TI Mixing behavior in cross-country diffusion
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Diffusion models represent one of the key successes in marketing science. We understand a great deal about what influences and shapes within-country diffusion patterns. However, we understand far less about what influences and shapes cross-country (or "inter-country") diffusion patterns, Clearly, for firms operating in a truly global environment, understanding to what extent prior adoption in one country affects current (and consequently future) adoption in another country can be an important consideration. Further, understanding how the pattern of interaction across countries impacts the diffusion process can have profound implications for product launch strategies for new durable products.
   In this paper, we address the extent to which prior adoption of a new product in one country affects adoption in other countries. In particular, we investigate the importance of the pattern of interaction (what we call "mixing") across countries in the context of a new product diffusion model, More specifically, mixing refers to the pattern of communication within and across countries. For example, do Italians communicate only with other Italians or do they influence consumers in other countries'! Understanding and empirically estimating how these mixing patterns across countries influence the subsequent diffusion process is the central research objective of this paper.
   While previous research in marketing addressing crosscountry diffusion has assumed very specific forms of crosscountry interaction, the present study develops and estimates a flexible form of mixing that allows for the simultaneous estimation of mixing patterns across multiple countries. In particular, we examine the effect of mixing behavior across populations on new product adoption, viewing mixing as occurring across a continuum with segregation (no mixing) at one end and random mixing at the other. Intermediate foams of mixing lie along this continuum and are called Bernoulli mixing.
   In order to produce generalizable results, we obtained sales data on four product categories in the European community (EC) nations: VCRs from 1977-1990, microwave ovens 1975-1490, compact disc players 1984-1993, and home computers 1981-1981, For each product, data were collected for 10 EC nations: Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, and Austria. A diffusion model that incorporates cross-country prior adoption, cross-country mixing patterns, and individual country covariates was estimated simultaneously across the 10 countries for each of the four products.
   On the basis of the empirical results, we conclude that mixing behavior across segments is an important consideration in new product diffusion. Specifically, the observed pattern of mixing and the strength of cross-segment influences are important considerations in allocating the marketing mix during product introduction stages. The practical implication of mixing behavior is that if one wishes to understand diffusion in Belgium (for example) it is important to not only know the diffusion parameters in Belgium, but also those in other EC nations. Accordingly, these results should be of interest to managers responsible for coordinating new product launches across countries and to researchers interested in investigating cross-country diffusion issues.
   As an example of the strategic implications of the results, we note that under Bernoulli mixing future country launches will benefit not only from prior adoption in countries with high overall contact rates, but in particular from countries with high rates of contact with other countries. Although there is some variance across products, in general, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain are the most "gregarious," as measured by the rate of contact. The results suggest that a strategy of first focusing on Germany, France, Italy, and Spain will maximize adoption in subsequent countries. Each of these countries tends to have a higher percentage of its contacts with individuals internal to its borders as well as with other countries. This suggests that these countries would have relatively quick adoption internally, while having a strong influence externally. Further, for countries such as Denmark, Netherlands, Austria, and Sweden, a higher percentage of their contacts are derived from outside their borders. Thus, "seeding" the diffusion process by introducing first in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain would benefit later adoption in countries such as Denmark, Netherlands, Austria, and Sweden. Although the strength of the individual country influence Varies from product to product, this result is generally consistent across the four products.

TI A comparative analysis of neural networks and statistical methods for
   predicting consumer choice
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper presents a definitive description of neural network methodology and provides an evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages relative to statistical procedures. The development of this rich class of models was inspired by the neural architecture of the human brain. These models mathematically emulate the neurophysical structure and decision making of the human brain, and, from a statistical perspective, are closely related to generalized linear models. Artificial neural networks are, however, nonlinear and use a different estimation procedure (feed forward and back propagation) than is used in traditional statistical models (least squares or maximum likelihood). Additionally, neural network models do not require the same restrictive assumptions about the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable(s). Consequently, these models have already been very successfully applied in many diverse disciplines, including biology, psychology, statistics, mathematics, business, insurance, and computer science.
   We propose that neural networks will prove to be a valuable tool for marketers concerned with predicting consumer choice. We will demonstrate that neural networks provide superior predictions regarding consumer decision processes. In the context of modeling consumer judgment and decision making, for example, neural network models can offer significant improvement over traditional statistical methods because of their ability to capture nonlinear relationships associated with the use of noncompensatory decision rules. Our analysis reveals that neural networks have great potential for improving model predictions in nonlinear decision contexts without sacrificing performance in linear decision contexts.
   This paper provides a detailed introduction to neural networks that is understandable to both the academic researcher and the practitioner. This exposition is intended to provide both the intuition and the rigorous mathematical models needed for successful applications. In particular, a step-by-step outline of: how to use the models is provided along with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the model. We also address the robustness of the neural network models and discuss how far wrong you might go using neural network models versus traditional statistical methods.
   Herein, we report the results of two studies. The first is a numerical simulation comparing the ability of neural networks with discriminant analysis and logistic regression at predicting choices made by decision rules that vary in complexity. This includes simulations involving two noncompensatory decision rules and one compensatory decision rule that involves attribute thresholds. In particular, we test a variant of the satisficing rule used by Johnson et al. (1989) that sets a lower bound threshold on all attribute values and a "latitude of acceptance" model that sets both a lower threshold and an upper threshold on attribute values, mimicking an "ideal point" model (Coombs and Avrunin 1977). We also test a compensatory rule that equally weights attributes and judges the acceptability of an alternative based on the sum of its attribute values. Thus, the simulations include both a linear environment, in which traditional statistical models might be deemed appropriate, as well as a nonlinear environment where statistical models might not be appropriate. The complexity of the decision rules was varied to test for any potential degradation in model performance. For these simulated data it is shown that, in general, the neural network model outperforms the commonly used statistical procedures in terms of explained variance and out-of-sample predictive accuracy.
   An empirical study bridging the behavioral and statistical lines of research was also conducted. Here we examine the predictive relationship between retail store image variables and consumer patronage behavior. A direct comparison between a neural network model and the more commonly encountered techniques of discriminant analysis and factor analysis followed by logistic regression is presented. Again the results reveal that the neural network model outperformed the statistical procedures in terms of explained variance and out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We conclude that neural network models offer superior predictive capabilities over traditional statistical methods in predicting consumer choice in nonlinear and linear settings.

TI The red and the black: Mental accounting of savings and debt
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In the standard economic account of consumer behavior the cost of a purchase takes the form of a reduction in future utility when expenditures that otherwise could have been made are forgone. The reality of consumer hedonics is different. When people make purchases, they often experience an immediate pain of paying, which can undermine the pleasure derived from consumption. The ticking of the taxi meter, for example, reduces one's pleasure from the ride. We propose a "double-entry" mental accounting theory that describes the nature of these reciprocal interactions between the pleasure of consumption and the pain of paring and draws out their implications for consumer behavior and hedonics. A central assumption of the model, which we call prospective accounting, is that consumption that has already been paid for can be enjoyed as if it were free and that the pain associated with payments made prior to consumption (but not after) is buffered by thoughts of the benefits that the payments will finance. Another important concept is coupling, which refers to the degree to which consumption calls to mind thoughts of payment, and vice versa. Some financing methods, such as credit cards, tend to weaken coupling, whereas others, such as cash payment, produce tight coupling.
   Our model makes a variety of predictions that are at variance with economic formulations. Contrary to the standard prediction that people will finance purchases to minimize the present value of payments, our model predicts strong debt aversion-that they should prefer to prepay for consumption or to get paid for work after it is performed. Such pay-before sequences confer hedonic benefits because consumption can be enjoyed without thinking about the need to pay for it in the future. Likewise, when paring beforehand, the pain of paying is mitigated by thoughts of future consumption benefits. Contrary to the economic prediction that consumers should prefer to pay, at the margin, for what they consume, our model predicts that consumers will find it less painful to pay for, and hence will prefer, flat-rate pricing schemes such as unlimited Internet access at a fixed monthly price, even if it involves paying more for the same usage. Other predictions concern spending patterns with cash, charge, or credit cards, and preferences for the earmarking of purchases.
   We test these predictions in a series of surveys and in a conjoint-like analysis that pitted our double-entry mental accounting model against a standard discounting formulation and another benchmark that did not incorporate hedonic interactions between consumption and payments. Our model provides a better fit of the data for 60% of the subjects; the discounting formulation provides a better fit for only 29% of the subjects (even when allowing for positive and negative discount rates).
   The pain of paying, we argue, plays an important role in consumer self-regulation, but is hedonically costly. From a hedonic perspective the ideal situation is one in which payments are tightly coupled to consumption (so that paying evokes thoughts about the benefits being financed) but consumption is decoupled from payments (so that consumption does not evoke thoughts about payment). From an efficiency perspective, however, it is important for consumers to be aware of what they are paying for consumption. This creates a tension between hedonic efficiency and what we call decision efficiency. Various institutional arrangements, such as financing of public parks through taxes or usage fees, play into this tradeoff. A producer developing a pricing structure for their product or sen iee should be aware of these two conflicting objectives, and should try to devise a structure that reconciles them.

TI A hierarchical Bayes model of primary and secondary demand
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Product design, pricing policies, and promotional activities influence the primary and secondary demand for goods and services. Brand managers need to develop an understanding of the relationships between marketing mix decisions and consumer decisions of whether to purchase in the product category, which brand to buy, and how much to consume. Knowledge about factors most effective in influencing primary and secondary demand of a product allows firms to grow by enhancing their market share as well their market size.
   The purpose of this paper is to develop an individual level model that allows an investigation of both the primary and secondary aspects of consumer demand. Unlike models of only primary demand or only secondary demand, this more comprehensive model offers the opportunity to identify changes in product features that will result in the greatest increase in demand. It also offers the opportunity to differentially target consumer segments depending upon whether consumers are most likely to enter the market, increase their consumption level, or switch brands.
   In the proposed hierarchical Bayes model, an integrative framework that jointly models the discrete choice and continuous quantity components of consumer decision is employed instead of treating the two as independent. The model includes parameters that capture individual specific reservation value, attribute preference, and expenditure sensitivity. The model development is based upon the microeconomic theory of utility maximization. Heterogeneity in model parameters across the sample is captured by using a random effects specification guided by the underlying microeconomic model. This requires that some of the effects are strictly positive. This is accommodated through the use of a gamma distribution of heterogeneity for some of the parameters. A normal distribution of heterogeneity is used for the remaining parameters. Gibbs sampling is used to estimate the model.
   The key methodological contribution of this paper is that we show how to specify a hierarchical Bayes continuous random effects model that integrates consumer choice and quantity decisions such that individual-level parameters can be estimated. Individual level estimates are desirable because insights into primary demand involve nonlinear functions of model parameters. For example, consumers not in the market are those whose utilities for the choice alternatives fall below some reservation value. The proposed methodology yields individual specific estimates of reservation values and expenditure sensitivity, which allow assessment of the origins of demand other than the switching behavior of consumers. The methodology can also be used to help identify changes in product features most likely to bring new customers into a market.
   Our work differs from previous research in this area as we lay the framework needed to obtain individual-level parameter estimates in a continuous random effects model that integrates choice and quantity. The methodology is demonstrated with survey data collected about consumer preferences and consumption for a food item. For the data available, a large response heterogeneity was observed across all model parameters. In spite of limited data available at the individual level, a majority of the individual level estimates were found to be significant. Predictive tests demonstrated the superiority of the proposed model over existing latent class and aggregate models. Particularly, significant gains in predictive accuracy were observed for the "no-buy" behavior of the respondents. These gains demonstrate that by structurally Linking the choice and quantity models results in a more accurate characterization of the market than existing finite mixture approaches that model choice and quantity independently. We show that our joint model makes more efficient use of the available data and results in better parameter estimates than those that assume independence.
   Finally, the individual level demand analysis is illustrated through a simple example involving a $1.00 price cut. We demonstrate practical usefulness of the model for targeting by developing the demographic, attitudinal, and behavioral profiles of consumer groups most likely to increase consumption, enter the market, or switch brands because of a price cut decision.

TI A dynamic model of the duration of the customer's relationship with a
   continuous service provider: The role of satisfaction
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Many service organizations have embraced relationship marketing with its focus on maximizing customer lifetime value. Recently, there has been considerable controversy about whether there is a link between customer satisfaction and retention. This research question is important to researchers who are attempting to understand how customers' assessments of services influence their subsequent behavior. However, it is equally vital to managers who require a better understanding of the relationship between satisfaction and the duration of the provider-customer relationship to identify specific actions that can increase retention and profitability in the long run. Since there is very little empirical evidence regarding this research question, this study develops and estimates a dynamic model of the duration of provider-customer relationship that focuses on the role of customer satisfaction.
   This article models the duration of the customer's relationship with an organization that delivers a continuously provided service, such as utilities, financial services, and telecommunications. In the model, the duration of the provider-customer relationship is postulated to depend on the customer's subjective expected value of the relationship, which he/she updates according to an anchoring and adjustment process. It is hypothesized that cumulative satisfaction serves as an anchor that is updated with new information obtained during service experiences. The model is estimated as a left-truncated, proportional hazards regression with cross-sectional and time series data describing cellular customers perceptions and behavior over a 22-month period.
   The results indicate that customer satisfaction ratings elicited prior to any decision to cancel or stay loyal to the provider are positively related to the duration of the relationship. The strength of the relationship between duration times and satisfaction levels depends on the length of customers' prior experience with the organization. Customers who have many months' experience with the organization weigh prior cumulative satisfaction more heavily and new information (relatively) less heavily. The duration of the service provider-customer relationship also depends on whether customers experienced service transactions or failures. The effects of perceived losses arising from transactions or service failures on duration times are directly weighed by prior satisfaction, creating contrast and assimilation effects.
   How can service organizations develop longer relationships with customers? Since customers weigh prior cumulative satisfaction heavily, organizations should focus on customers in the early stages of the relationship-if customers' experiences are not satisfactory, the relationship is likely to be very short. There is considerable heterogeneity across customers because some customers have a higher utility for the service than others. However, certain types of service encounters are potential relationship "landmines" because customers are highly sensitive to the costs/losses arising from interactions with service organizations and insensitive to the benefits/gains. Thus, incidence and quality of service encounters can be early indicators of whether an organization's relationship with a customer is flourishing or in jeopardy. Unfortunately, organizations with good prior service levels will suffer more when customers perceive that they have suffered a loss arising from a service encounter-due to the existence of contrast effects. However, experienced customers are less sensitive to such losses because they tend to weigh prior satisfaction levels heavily.
   By modeling the duration of the provider-customer relationship, it is possible to predict the revenue impact of service improvements in the same manner as other resource allocation decisions. The calculations in this article show that changes in customer satisfaction can have important financial implications for the organization because lifetime revenues from an individual customer depend on the duration of his/her relationship, as well as the dollar amount of his/her purchases across billing cycles.
   Satisfaction levels explain a substantial portion of explained variance in the durations of service provider-customer relationships across customers, comparable to the effect of price. Consequently, it is a popular misconception that organizations that focus on customer satisfaction are failing to manage customer retention. Rather, this article suggests that service organizations should be proactive and learn from customers before they defect by understanding their current satisfaction levels. Managers and researchers may have underestimated the importance of the link between customer satisfaction and retention because the relationship between satisfaction and duration times is very complex and difficult to detect without advanced statistical techniques.

TI Shopping behavior and consumer preference for store price format: Why
   "large basket" shoppers prefer EDLP
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In recent years, the supermarket industry has become increasingly competitive. One outcome has been the proliferation of a variety of pricing formats, and considerable debate among academics and practitioners about how these formats affect consumers' store choice behavior. This paper advances the idea that consumer shopping behavior (as defined by average size of the shopping basket and the frequency of store visits) is an important determinant of the store choice decision when stores offer different price formats. A recent Wall Street Journal article that summarized the result of Bruno's management switching the chain from EDLP to HILO illustrates the importance of this issue: "The company's price-conscious customers, used to shopping for a fixed basket of goods, stayed away in droves." Thus, the audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who wish to understand store choices or predict how a change in price format might affect store profitability and the mix of clientele that shop there.
   This paper attempts to understand the relationship between grocery shopping behavior, retail price format, and store choice by posing and answering the following questions. First, after controlling for other factors (e.g., distance to the store, prior experience in the store, advertised specials), do consumer expectations about prices for a basket of grocery products ("expected basket attractiveness") influence the store choice decision? This is a fairly straightforward test of the effect of price expectations on store choice. Second, are different pricing formats (EDLP or HILO) more or less attractive to different types of shoppers? To adequately answer the second question, we must link consumers' category purchase decisions, which collectively define the market basket, and the store choice decision.
   We study the research questions using two complementary approaches. First, we develop a stylized theory of consumer shopping behavior under price uncertainty. The principal features and results from the stylized model can be summarized as follows. Shoppers are defined (in a relative sense) as either large or small basket shoppers. Thus, we abstract from the vicissitudes of individual shopping trips and focus on meaningful differences across shoppers in terms of the expected basket size per trip. The shoppers make category purchase incidence decisions and can choose to shop in either an EDLP or a HILO store. Large basket shoppers are shoppers who have a relatively high probability of purchase for any given category, and as such they are more captive to prices across many different categories. The first two propositions summarize the price responsiveness of shoppers. In particular, the large basket shoppers are less responsive to price in their individual category purchase incidence decisions; this makes them ware responsive to the expected basket price in their store choice decisions. This key structural implication of the model highlights an asymmetry between response at the category level and response at the store level. The result is quite intuitive; a (large basket) shopper with less ability to respond to prices in individual product categories will be more sensitive to the expected cost of the overall portfolio (the market basket) when choosing a store. The final proposition derives the price at which a given shopper will be indifferent between an EDLP and a HILO store. The key insight is that as a shopper increases his or her tendency to become a large basket shopper, the EDLP stare can increase its (constant) price closer and closer to the average price in the HILO store. Conversely, as the shopper becomes more of small basket shopper, the EDLP store must lower its price closer to the deal price in the HILO store. Thus, we have the interesting result that small basket shoppers prefer HILO stores, even at higher average prices.
   The empirical testing mirrors the development of the consumer theory. We test the implications of the propositions using a market basket scanner panel database. The database includes two years of shopping data for 1,042 households in two separate market areas. We first use household-level grocery expenditures to model the probability that a household is a large or small basket shopper. Subsequently, we estimate purchase incidence and store choice models. We find that after controlling for important factors such as household distance to the store, previous experience in the store, and advertised specials, price expectations for the basket influence store choice. Furthermore, EDLP stores get a greater than expected share of business from large basket shoppers; HILO stores get a greater than expected share from small basket shoppers. Consistent with the implications of the propositions, large basket shoppers are relatively price inelastic in their category purchase incidence decisions and price elastic in their store choice decisions.

TI Similarities in choice behavior across product categories
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Differences between consumers in sensitivity to marketing mix variables have been extensively documented in the scanner panel data. All studies of consumer heterogeneity focus on a specific category of products and ignore the fact that the purchase behavior of panel households is often observed simultaneously in multiple categories. If sensitivity to marketing mix variables is a common consumer trait, then one should expect to see similarities in sensitivity across multiple categories. The goal in this paper is to measure the covariance of both observed (linked to measured characteristics of households) and unobserved heterogeneity in marketing mix sensitivity across multiple categories. Measurement of correlation in sensitivities across categories will serve to guide the interpretation of the literature on household heterogeneity. If there is a large correlation, one can be more confident that sensitivity to marketing variables is a fundamental household property and not simply a category-specific anomaly.
   Detection of correlation in sensitivities across categories requires an appropriate methodology that can handle the high dimensional covariance structures and properly account for uncertainty in estimation. For example, a simple approach might be to fit a brand choice model to each of the available categories in turn, ignoring the data in the other categories. For each category, household parameter estimates could be obtained for the parameters corresponding to price, display, and feature sensitivity. These parameter estimates could be viewed as data and the correlations across categories could be computed. Such a procedure could induce a downward bias in the estimation of correlation due to the independent sampling errors, which are present in each parameter estimate.
   We develop a hierarchical model structure that introduces an explicit correlation structure across categories and utilizes the data in multiple categories at the same time. To reduce the size of the covariance matrix, we use a variance components approach. We introduce household-specific demographic variables to decompose the correlation across categories into that which can be ascribed to observable and unobservable sources. Shopping behavior variables such as shopping frequency and market basket size as well as intensity of shopping in a category are also included in the model.
   Using data on five categories, we find substantial and statistically important correlations ranging from .32 for price sensitivities to .58 for feature sensitivity. These correlations are much larger than the correlations obtained with the state-of-the-art techniques available prior to our work. We attribute our ability to detect substantial correlations to our method, which involves the joint use of multiple category data in a parsimonious and efficient manner. Unlike previous studies with panel data, household demographic variables are found to be strongly related to price sensitivity. Higher income households are less price sensitive and large families are more price sensitive. Shopping behavior variables are also important in explaining price sensitivity. Households that visit the store often are more price sensitive. Households with larger market baskets are less price sensitive, confirming the view of Bell and Lattin (1998). Heavy user households tend to be both less price sensitive and less display sensitive.
   The evidence presented here of substantial correlations validates, in part, the notion that sensitivity to marketing mix variables is a consumer trait and is not unique to specific product categories. It also opens the possibility of using information across categories in making inferences about consumer brand preference and marketing mix sensitivity, providing a richer source of information for target marketing.

TI Monitoring and incentives in sales organizations: An agency-theoretic
   perspective
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Our primary objective in this paper is to analyze a framework that simultaneously examines the role of both monitoring and incentives in the design of sales force control systems. Previous research has focused exclusively on the role of incentives in directing salesforce effort.
   We build on the structure provided by the past work and analyze an agency-thoeretic model in which a salesperson generates wealth for the firm by expending effort across two dimensions, namely, internal and external. We assume that effort in the internal dimension can be monitored relatively cheaply whereas effort in the external dimension can be monitored only at infinite cost. We then analyze the following two scenarios: (i) a pure incentives world wherein both effort dimensions are governed through the use of incentive pay, and (ii) a monitoring and incentives world wherein the internal dimension is monitored and the external dimension is governed through the use of incentive pay. In addition to modeling the notion of partial monitoring in this manner, we also explicitly allow the firm to choose the level of risk aversion desired in its salesperson. Of course, salespeople who are relatively risk-tolerant command higher reservation wages; consequently, such salespeople are likely to be valuable only to those firms that emphasize incentive pay in their control systems.
   Our analysis across the two scenarios helps us to demonstrate the implications and value of introducing monitoring into the control structure. Specifically, we find that monitoring allows the firm to decrease the weight placed on incentives and hire a relatively risk-averse salesperson from the salesforce labor market. These actions, in turn, permit the firm to reduce the risk premium and the reservation wage offered to the salesperson. In direct contrast to these monetary savings, however, we find that an adverse side effect of monitoring is that it induces salespeople to overemphasize the effort devoted to the monitored dimension while under-emphasizing the effort devoted to the nonmonitored dimension. This adverse effect of monitoring notwithstanding, we find that the overall benefit of increased monitoring is that it allows the firm to lower the amount of total compensation paid to the salesperson. These analytical findings are consistent with the prescriptions found in the popular business press where it is often stated that compensation plans that emphasize incentive pay are characterized by independence in managing activities (lack of monitoring) as well as high income potential. These findings are also consistent with the popular wisdom that incentive-laden compensation plans are generally more appropriate for individuals who are risk takers and entrepreneurial in nature.
   We also delineate the conditions where monitoring can improve on the profits obtained in a pure incentives world. Specifically, we find that monitoring can prove to be most valuable when the importance of internal activities is high and the level of incentives is low. Finally, we conclude by conducting a sensitivity analysis to examine the robustness of our results to the specifications we utilize in our modeling efforts.
   Overall, we view the main contribution of our research efforts as one of explicitly delineating the tradeoffs associated with the use of monitoring and incentives in the design of salesforce control systems. As such, our paper should be of interest to academics and practitioners interested in the design of salesforce control systems.

TI To zap or not to zap: A study of the determinants of channel switching
   during commercials
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We present a conceptual framework to describe the commercial zapping phenomenon and use it to identify factors that influence channel switching during commercials. Drawing on previous research, published reports of practitioner gut feel, interventions used by advertisers to reduce channel switching, and proprietary studies reported in the published literature, we describe how these variables might potentially affect the decision to zap a commercial. We use a latent class approach to model the impact of the identified factors on two aspects of the switching decision-whether or not a commercial is zapped (modeled with a binary legit model) and, conditional on a zap having taken place, the number of seconds that the commercial was watched before being zapped (modeled within the proportional hazards framework). The model is estimated on telemeter data on commercial viewing in two categories (spaghetti sauce and window cleaners) obtained from a single-source, household scanner panel.
   The results from the empirical analysis show that households can be grouped into two segments. The first, which consists of about 35% of households in the sample, is more zap-prone than the second. For this "zapping segment," the probability of zapping a commercial is lower for households who make more purchases in the product category. Also, zapping shows a J-shaped response to previous exposures to the commercial, with the associated zapping elasticity reaching its minimum value at around 14 exposures and increasing rapidly thereafter. This finding suggests that advertisers should be cautious not to use media schedules that have excessive media weight or that emphasize frequency over reach.
   We found that zapping probabilities for ads aired around the hour and half-hour marks to be significantly higher than for other pod locations. Based on these results, we argue that prices for advertising pods located around the hour/half-hour marks should be between 5% to 33% lower than those in the remaining portion of the program.
   We explore the impact of advertising content on zapping and find that the presence of a brand differentiating message in a commercial causes a statistically significant decrease in zapping probabilities. While the magnitude of this effect is small, the finding suggests that it may be helpful to include qualitative variables in future models of advertising response.
   We propose the expected proportion of time that an ad is watched as a benchmark to compare 15-second and 30-second ad formats from a zapping standpoint. We found no significant differences between the two formats on this dimension. Our analysis also shows that, due to the impact of previous exposures on zapping, the use of 15-second ads runs a greater risk of reaching the threshold exposure level beyond which zapping probabilities start to increase. This implies that while managers must be cognizant of the risks of overexposure for any ad, it is especially important in the case of the shorter, 15-second ad format.

TI The role of sale signs
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Sale signs increase demand. The apparent effectiveness of this simple strategy is surprising; sale signs are inexpensive to produce and stores generally make no commitment when using them. As a result, they can be placed on any products, and as many products, as stores prefer. If stores can place sale signs on any or all of their products, why are they effective?
   We offer an explanation for the effectiveness of sale signs by arguing that they inform customers about which products have relatively low prices, thus helping customers decide whether to purchase now, visit another store, or perhaps return to the same store in the future. This explanation raises two additional issues. First, why do stores prefer to place sale signs on products that are truly low priced (stores could use sale signs to increase demand for any of their products)? Second, how many sale signs should a store use; should they limit sale signs to just their relatively low priced products or should they also place them on some of their higher priced products? The paper addresses each of these questions and in doing so investigates how much information sale signs reveal.
   Our arguments are illustrated using a formal game-theoretic model in which competing stores sell imperfect substitutes in two-period overlapping seasons. Stores choose price and sale sign strategies and new customers arrive each period and decide whether to purchase immediately or delay and return in the future (to the same store or a different store). Customers who delay purchasing risk that the product will not be available in the following period and incur an additional transportation cost when they return. Two factors balance these costs. First, customers correctly anticipate that the price will be lower if the product is available in the next period. Second, customers who return to a different store may find a product that better suits their needs. In deciding how to respond, customers use price and sale sign cues to update their expectations about which products will be available in the next period.
   Stores' sale sign and price strategies are entirely endogenous in the model, as is the impact of sale signs on demand. In our discussion we highlight the information revealed by sale signs, including the source of its credibility, its sensitivity to the number of sale signs that are used, and the resulting shift in customer demand.
   We point to two key results. First, we show that the underlying signal is self-fulfilling if customers believe that products with sale signs are more likely to be relatively low priced, then firms prefer to place sale signs on lower priced products. Second, we demonstrate that sale signs are self-regulating. Stores may introduce noise by placing sale signs on some more expensive products. However, if customers' price expectations are sensitive to the number of products that have sale signs, this strategy is not without cost. Using additional sale signs may reduce demand for other products that already have sale signs.
   Our model is unique in several respects. First, we describe how stores use multiple signals to communicate with customers and recognize that customers vary in how much they learn from each signal. Price alone resolves uncertainty for some customers, but other customers use both prices and sale signs to resolve their uncertainty. Second, although previous signaling models have recognized that signals may be noisy (not always accurate), noise in these signals is typically exogenous, resulting from uncontrolled environmental distortions. In our model, stores endogenously choose to introduce noise so that sale signs only partially reveal which products are discounted.
   Our explanations are supported by several examples. Although we focus on fashion products, our findings have application to any market in which customers are uncertain about relative price levels.

TI Product line design for a distribution channel
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB When designing a product line, a manufacturer is often aware that it does not control the ultimate targeting of the products in the line to the different consumer segments. While the manufacturers can attempt to influence the target customers through communications in appropriate media, product design, and the choice of channels of distribution, the ultimate targeting is made by a retailer, which might only care about its own interests, and is fully in control of interactions with customers, including how the product is sold and displayed. This occurrence is widespread in numerous markets, for example, frequently purchased consumer products, home appliances, personal computers, automobiles, etc. The audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who want to better understand how a manufacturer selling through an intermediary can better induce this intermediary to have a targeting strategy consistent with the manufacturer's intentions and be willing to carry the full product line.
   The paper attempts to find what are the main issues a manufacturer selling through a distribution channel has to worry about when designing the product line. The problem of the product line design for a distribution channel is modeled with the manufacturer, the retailer or several competing retailers, and the consumers. In this way all the three levels of the distribution system are included.
   The model can be summarized as follows. The manufacturer decides how many products to have in the line and the physical characteristics of each product, quality. Each product may or may not be targeted at a different market segment. The manufacturer decides as well how many market segments to try to target and the prices to charge the retailer for each type of product. Given the product line being offered by the manufacturer, the retailer (or competing retailers) decides which products to carry, the market segments that are going to be targeted, which product to target to each segment, and the prices being charged the consumers for each product.
   The consumer market is composed of different market segments that value quality differently: Some market segments are willing to pay more for quality than other market segments. The paper presents the results for two market segments, but a greater number of market segments can also be accounted for. We characterize the equilibrium targeting strategies of the manufacturer and retailer (or competing retailers) in terms of number of products in the line, the physical characteristics of each product, the prices charged by the manufacturer for each product, the consumer prices charged by the retailer for each product, and the product bought by each market segment. We compare the results with the coordinated channel outcome, where the manufacturer and the retailer work together to maximize the overall channel profits. The results are related to the other coordination problems previously studied in the literature (for example, the standard "double marginalization" effect of higher prices reducing demand) in the sense that the retailer makes decisions caring only about its own profits and not the overall channel profits.
   The paper shows that, if possible, the best strategy for the manufacturer is to increase the differences in the products being supplied (in comparison to the direct selling/coordinated channel case). If the manufacturer is not able to increase these differences, it then elects to price the product line such that some of the consumer segments end up not being served. The intuition for this result is that the manufacturer, by increasing the differences among the different products, is still making major profits on the high end segments, while getting some positive profits from the low end segments and guaranteeing that the retailer actually targets the different products to the consumer segments intended by the manufacturer. Were the manufacturer not to increase the differences among the different products being offered, the retailer would only target the higher end consumer segments, because also targeting the lower end segments would involve losing too many rents on the higher end segments. Another way of seeing the problem is that the channel pricing distortions increase the cannibalization forces across the product line. The manufacturer tries to compensate for this by increasing the product differentiation across the line. If increasing the differences among the different products being offered is not possible, the manufacturer then drops the low end consumer segments and concentrates on the high end of the market (which is more profitable). The unit margins of both the retailer and manufacturer are also shown to be increasing with the quality level of the product.

TI Direct estimation of Batsell and Polking's model
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Batsell and Polking (1985) developed one of the important choice models that address the problem of independence from irrelevant alternatives. In this note, we propose an estimation method that directly estimates Batsell and Polking's model. Compared to the indirect estimation method suggested by Batsell and Polking, the direct method is simpler, making the BP model more accessible to potential users.

TI Mail versus mall: A strategic analysis of competition between direct
   marketers and conventional retailers
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumers now purchase several offerings from direct sellers, including catalog and Internet marketers. These direct channels exist in parallel with the conventional retail stores. The availability of multiple channels has significant implications for the performance of consumer markets. The literature in marketing and economics has, however, been dominated by a focus on the conventional retail sector. This paper is an effort toward modeling competition in the multiple-channel environment from a strategic viewpoint.
   At the outset, a parsimonious model that accommodates the following consumer and market characteristics is introduced. First, the relative attractiveness of retail shopping varies across consumers. Second, the fit with the direct channel varies across product categories. Third, the strength of existing retail presence in local markets moderates competition. Fourth, in contrast with the fixed location of the retail store that anchors its localized market power, the location of the direct marketer is irrelevant to the competitive outcome.
   The model is first applied in a setting where consumers have complete knowledge of product availability and prices in all channels. In the resulting equilibrium, the direct marketer acts as a competitive wedge between retail stores. The direct presence is so strong that each retailer competes against the remotely located direct marketer, rather than against neighboring retailers. This outcome has implications for the marketing mix of retailers, which has traditionally been tuned to attract consumers choosing between retail stores. In the context of market entry, conditions under which a direct channel can access a local market in retail entry equilibrium are derived. Our analysis suggests that the traditional focus on retail entry equilibria may not yield informative or relevant findings when direct channels are a strong presence.
   Next, the role of information in multiple-channel markets is modeled. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of direct marketing where the seller can typically control the level of information in the marketplace, sometimes on a customer-by-customer basis (e.g., by deciding on the mailing list for a catalog campaign). When a certain fraction of consumers does not receive information from the direct marketer, the retailers compete with each other for that fraction of the market. The retailer's marketing mix has to be tuned, in this case, to jointly address direct and neighboring retail competition.
   The level of information disseminated by the direct marketer is shown to have strategic implications, and the use of market coverage as a lever to control competition is described. Even with zero information costs, providing information to all consumers may not be optimal under some circumstances. In particular, when the product is not well adapted to the direct channel, the level of market information about the direct option should ideally be lowered. The only way to compete with retailers on a larger scale with a poorly adapted product is by lowering direct prices, which lowers profits. Lowering market information levels and allowing retailers to compete more with each other facilitates a higher equilibrium retail price. In turn, this allows a higher direct price to be charged and improves overall direct profit. On the other hand, when the product is well adapted, increasing direct market presence and engaging in greater competition with the retail sector yields higher returns.
   The finding that high market coverage may depress profits raises some issues for further exploration. First, implementing the optimal coverage is straightforward when the seller controls the information mechanism, as in the case of catalog marketing. The Internet, in contrast, is an efficient mechanism to transmit information, but does not provide the sellers with such control over the level of market information. A key reason is that the initiative to gather information on the Internet lies largely with consumers. The design and implementation of mechanisms to control aggregate information levels in electronic markets can, therefore, be an important theme for research and managerial interest. Second, direct marketers have traditionally relied on the statistical analysis of customer records to decide on contact policies. The analysis in this paper reveals that these policies can have significant strategic implications as well. Research that integrates the statistical and strategic aspects could make a valuable contribution.
   The paper concludes with a discussion of issues for future research in multiple-channel markets, including avenues to model competition in settings with multiple direct marketers.

TI COSTA: Contribution optimizing sales territory alignment
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The alignment of sales territories has a considerable impact on profit and represents a major problem in salesforce management. Practitioners usually apply the balancing approach. This approach balances territories as well as possible with respect to one or more attributes such as potential or workload. Unfortunately, this approach does not necessarily guarantee maximizing profit contribution. Thus, it does not provide an evaluation of the profit implications of an alignment proposal in comparison with the existing one. In consequence, several authors proposed nonlinear integer optimization models in the 1970s. These models attempted to maximize profit directly by considering the problems of allocating selling time (calling plus travel time) across accounts as well as of assigning accounts to territories simultaneously. However, these models turned out to be too complex to be solvable. Therefore, the authors have either approximated the problem or proposed the application of heuristic solution procedures on the basis of the suboptimal principle of equating marginal profit of selling time across territories.
   To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach, COSTA, an acronym for "contribution optimizing sales territory alignment." In contrast to previously suggested profit maximizing approaches, COSTA operates with sales response functions of any given concave form at the level of sales coverage units (SCUs) that cover a group of geographically demarcated individual accounts. Thus, COSTA works with sales response functions at a more aggregated level that requires less data than other profit maximization approaches. COSTA models sales as a function of selling time, which includes calling time as well as travel time, assuming a constant ratio of travel to calling time. In addition, the formulation of the model shows that an optimal solution requires only equal marginal profits of selling time across sales coverage units per territory, but not across SCUs of different territories.
   Basically, COSTA consists of an allocation model and an assignment model, both of which are considered simultaneously. The allocation model optimally allocates the available selling time of a salesperson across the SCUs of his or her territory, whereas the assignment model assigns the SCUs to territories. Thus, COSTA predicts the corresponding profit contribution of every possible alignment solution, which enables one to perform "what-if"-analyses. The applicability of the model is supported by the development of a powerful heuristic solution procedure. A simulation study showed that COSTA provided solutions that are on average as close as 0.195% to an upper bound on the optimal solution. The proposed heuristic solution procedure enables one to solve large territory alignment problems because the computing time increases only quadratically with the number of SCUs and proportionally to the square root of the number of salespersons. In principle, we also show how COSTA might be expanded to solve the salesforce sizing as well as the salespersons' location problem.
   The usefulness of COSTA is illustrated by an application. The results of this application indicated substantial profit improvements and also outlined the weaknesses of almost balanced territories. It is quite apparent that balancing is only possible at the expense of profit improvements and also does not lead to equal income opportunities for the salespersons. This aspect should be dealt with separately from territory considerations by using territory-specific quotas and linking variable payment to the achievement of these quotas. Furthermore, the superiority of COSTA turned out to be stable in a simulation study on the effect of misspecified sales response functions.
   COSTA is of interest to researchers as well as practitioners in the salesforce area. It aims to revive the stream of research in the 1970s that already proposed sales territory alignment models aimed at maximizing profit. Such profit maximizing models are theoretically more appealing than approaches that strive to balance one or several attributes, such as potential or workload. COSTA's main advantage over previous profit maximizing approaches is that it is less complex. Consequently, COSTA demands less data so that even large problems can be solved close to optimality within reasonable computing times.

TI Planning media schedules in the presence of dynamic advertising quality
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A key task of advertising media planners is to determine the best media schedule of advertising exposures for a certain budget. Conceptually, the planner could choose to do continuous advertising (i.e., schedule ad exposures evenly over all weeks) or follow a strategy of pulsing (i.e., advertise in some weeks of the year and not at other times). Previous theoretical analyses have shown that continuous advertising is optimal for nearly all situations. However, pulsing schedules are very common in practice. Either the practice of pulsing is inappropriate or extant models have not adequately conceptualized the effects of advertising spending over time. This paper offers a model that shows pulsing strategies can generate greater total awareness than the continuous advertising when the effectiveness of advertisement (i.e., ad quality) varies over time. Specifically, ad quality declines because of advertising wearout during periods of continuous advertising and it restores, due to forgetting effects, during periods of no advertising. Such dynamics make it worthwhile for advertisers to stop advertising when ad quality becomes very low and wait for ad quality to restore before starting the next "burst" again, as is common in practice. Based on the extensive behavioral research on advertising repetition and advertising wearout, we extend the classical Nerlove and Arrow (3962) model by incorporating the notions of repetition wearout, copy wearout, and ad quality restoration. Repetition wearout is a result of excessive frequency because ad viewers perceive that there is nothing new to be gained from processing the ad, they withdraw their attention, or they become unmotivated to react to advertising information. Copy wearout refers to the decline in ad quality due to passage of time independent of the level of frequency. Ad quality restoration is the enhancement of ad quality during media hiatus as a consequence of viewers forgetting the details of the advertised messages, thus making ads appear "like new' when reintroduced later. The proposed model has the property that, when wearout effects are present, a strategy of pulsing is superior to continuous advertising even when the advertising response function is concave. This is illustrated by a numerical example that compares the total awareness generated by a single concentrated pulse of varying duration (blitz schedules) and continuous advertising (the even schedule). This property can be explained by the tension between the pressure to spend the fixed media budget quickly to avoid copy wearout and the opposing pressure to spread out the media spending over time to mitigate repetition wearout. The proposed model is empirically tested by using brand-level data from two advertising awareness tracking studies that also include the actual spending schedules. The first data set is for a major cereal brand, while the other is for a brand of milk chocolate. Such advertising tracking studies are now a common and popular means for evaluating advertising effectiveness in many markets (e.g., Millward Brown, MarketMind). In the empirical tests, the model parameters are estimated by using the Kalman filter procedure, which is eminently suited for dynamic models because it attends to the intertemporal dependencies in awareness build-up and decay via the use of conditional densities. The estimated parameters are statistically significant, have the expected signs, and are meaningful from both theoretical and managerial vie view-points.
   The proposed model fits both the data sets rather well and better than several well-known advertising models, namely, the Vidale-Wolfe, Brandaid, Litmus, and Tracker models, but not decisively better than the Nerlove-Arrow model. However, unlike the Nerlove-Arrow model, the proposed model yields different total awareness for different strategies of spending the same fixed budget, thus allowing media planners to discriminate among several media schedules. Given the empirical support for the model, the paper presents an implementable approach for utilizing it to evaluate large numbers of alternative media schedules and determine the best set of media schedules for consideration in media planning. This approach is based on an algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm with the Kalman filter procedure. The paper presents the results of applying this approach in the case studies of the cereal and milk chocolate brands. The form of the best advertising spending strategies in each case was a pulsing strategy, and there were many schedules that were an improvement over the media schedule actually used in each campaign.

TI Utility covariances and context effects in conjoint MNP models
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Experimental conjoint choice analysis is among the most frequently used methods for measuring and analyzing consumer preferences. The data from such experiments have been typically analyzed with the Multinomial Legit (MNL) model. However, there are several problems associated with the standard MNL model because it is based on the assumption that the error terms of the underlying random utilities are independent across alternatives, choice sets, and subjects. The Multinomial Probit model (MNP) is well known to alleviate this assumption of independence of the error terms. Accounting for covariances in utilities in modeling choice experiments with the MNP is important because variation of the coefficients in the choice model may occur due to context effects. Previous research has shown that subjects' utilities for alternatives depend on the choice context, that is, the particular set of alternatives evaluated. Simonson and Tversky's tradeoff contrast principle describes the effect of the choice context on attribute importance and patterns of choice. They distinguish local contrast effects, which are caused by the alternatives in the offered set only, and background contrast effects, which are due to the influence of alternatives previously considered in choice experiments. These effects are hypothesized to cause correlations in the utilities of alternatives within and across choice sets, respectively.
   The purpose of this study is to develop an MNP model for conjoint choice experiments. This model is important for a more detailed study of choice patterns in those experiments. Ln developing the MNP model for conjoint choice experiments, several hurdles need to be taken related to the identification of the model and to the prediction of holdout profiles. To overcome those problems, we propose a random coefficients (RC) model that assumes a multivariate normal distribution of the regression coefficients with a rank one factor structure on the covariance matrix of these regression coefficients. The parameters in this covariance matrix can be used to identify which attributes and levels of attributes are potentional sources of dependencies between the alternatives and choice sets in a conjoint choice experiment. We present several versions of this model. Moreover, for each of these models we allow utilities to be either correlated or independent across choice sets. The Independent Probit (IP) model is used as a benchmark. Given the dimensionality of the integrations involved in computing the choice probabilities, the models are estimated with simulated Likelihood, where simulations are used to approximate the integrals involved in the choice probabilities.
   We apply and compare the models in two conjoint choice experiments. In both applications, the random coefficients MNP model that allows choices in different choice sets to be correlated (RC) displays superior fit and predictive validity compared with all other models. We hypothesize that the difference in fit occurs because the RC model accommodates correlations among choice sets that are caused by background contrast effects, whereas the model that treats choice sets as independent (iRC) accounts for local contrast effects only. The iRC model shows superior model fit compared with the IP model, but its predictions are worse than those of the IP model. We find differences in the importance of local and background contrast effects for choice sets containing different numbers of alternatives: The background contrast effect may be stronger for smaller choice sets, whereas the local contrast effect may be stronger for bigger choice sets.
   We illustrate the differences in simulated market shares that are obtained from the RC, iRC, and IP models in three hypothetical situations: product modification, product Line extension, and the introduction of a me-too brand. In all of those situations, substantially different market shares are predicted by the three models, which illustrates the extent to which erroneous predictions may be obtained from the misspecified iRC and IP models.

TI Inertia and variety seeking in a model of brand-purchase timing
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Previous research on state dependence indicates that a brand's purchase probabilities vary over time and depend on the levels of inertia and variety seeking and on the identity of the previously purchased brand. Brand-choice probabilities obtained from models such as the legit and the probit are, however, fixed over time, conditional on the previous brand purchased and on the levels of marketing variables. Consequently, state dependence has largely been studied as a time-invariant phenomenon in brand-choice models, with the levels of inertia and variety seeking assumed to be constant over time. To account for the time-varying nature of state dependence would require a model in which brand-switching probabilities depend upon interpurchase times. One modeling framework that can account for this dependence is based on the hazard function approach.
   The proposed approach works as follows. All other factors being equal, an inertial household purchasing a brand on a particular occasion is most Likely to repurchase that brand on the next occasion. If the household switches, it will be to a brand located perceptually close, in attribute space, to the previously purchased brand. In other words, an inertial household has the highest switching hazard for the same origin and destination brands, with a progressively lower hazard rate for brands perceptually located farther and farther away from the origin brand. The amount by which the hazard is lowered depends upon the perceptual distance and the inertia level of the household. On the other hand, if the household is variety seeking, the most likely brand purchased would be a brand located farthest away from the previously purchased brand in attribute space. In other words, the hazard rate of repurchase is the lowest, with the rate increasing with the distance of the destination brand from the origin brand and the level of that household's variety-seeking tendency. The effects of inertia and variety seeking are, therefore, incorporated at the attribute level into a brand-purchase timing model. In doing so, we attempt to provide greater insight into the nature of state dependence in models of purchase timing.
   Our model and estimation procedure will enable us to distinguish between households that are inertial and those that are variety prone. In addition to accounting for state dependence the model also accounts for the effects of unobserved heterogeneity among households in their brand preferences and in their sensitivities to marketing activities. A majority of studies in marketing using the hazard function approach to investigate purchase timing have not accounted for heterogeneity in marketing-mix effects. The study integrates recent methods that incorporate the effects of inertia and variety seeking in brand-choice models with a semi-Markov model of purchase timing and brand switching. The proposed model enables us to (1) infer market structure via a perceptual map for the sample households, and (2) investigate implications for the introduction of a Line extension.
   We provide empirical applications of the proposed method using three different household-level scanner panel data sets. We find that differing levels of inertia and variety seeking characterize the three data sets. The findings are consistent with prior beliefs regarding these categories. In addition, our results indicate that the nature of interbrand pur chase timing behavior depends upon the extent of inertia or variety seeking in the data. We are also able to characterize the structure of the three product markets studied. This provides implications for interbrand rivalry in the market. Further, we demonstrate how the model and results can be used to predict the location of a line extension in the perceptual space of households. Finally, we obtain implications for the timing of brand promotions.

TI Does "bait and switch" really benefit consumers?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB While the field of marketing science has long been interested in the effects of promotional efforts, public policy issues involving illegal marketer fraud and deception have generally not been addressed in this body of work. One key exception to this generalization is a Marketing Science article suggesting that the practice of "bait and switch" may be beneficial to consumers and, furthermore, that the Federal Trade Commission should investigate revising its standards to legitimize this practice (Gerstner and Hess 1990). This finding and recommendation seemed so significant that it is surprising that the recommendation has not, to date, been explored in greater detail.
   In this paper we further explore the impact of the two components of bait and switch: out of stock and upselling. We do this by using Moorthy's (1993) theoretical modeling framework to systematically extend and assess the Gerstner and Hess model. We find that the previously reported increase in consumer welfare that arises from allowing out-of-stock conditions at retailers is actually due to the utility created by salespersons' explaining product features and benefits, not by the out of stock. Thus, the ramifications of both our legal and modeling analyses are that deceptive bait-and-switch practices result in harm to consumers and should not be legalized.
   Our paper concludes by proposing worthwhile modeling issues for further exploration. in addition, we suggest that our procedure for analyzing public policy issues (by exploring the confluence of law, consumer behavior, and marketing models) can serve as a useful exemplar for further contributions to public policy by marketing scientists.

TI Yes, "bait and switch" really benefits consumers
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In our 1990 Marketing Science payer we demonstrated that a law prohibiting bait and switch may have the surprising consequence of hurting the consumers it was designed to protect. Wilkie, Mela, and Gundlach (1998) postulate that this may be false if upselling is equally effective when the bait brand is available and when it is out of stock. We show here that our earlier conclusion is correct in a more general setting: A law prohibiting bait and switch in a competitive market can reduce consumer well-being but never improve it. When bait and switch occurs, it creates welfare gains, and when it would create welfare losses, it does not occur, regardless of a law prohibiting the practice.

TI Does "bait and switch" really benefit consumers? Advancing the
   discussion ...
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We applaud the advances in this colloquy and the areas of convergence that are emerging. However, this reply points out that the purported benefits of "bait and switch" found in Hess and Gerstner (1998) are predicated upon (i) only a single component (availability) within the broader domain of bait and switch; (ii) the assumption that one of the parameters in the consumer utility function differs with the availability of advertised brands; and (iii) a further assumption that no other parameters in the model will change when the availability condition changes. After assessing these developments, we conclude that i) the legal status of bait-and-switch schemes is fine as it stands; ii) when understood in their hue complexity, parameters in the consumer utility functions likely will not differ with regard to availability, thus obviating the finding of increased consumer welfare; and iii) even if it is believed that utility functions would differ, effects on other model parameters clearly suggest that consumers will be worse off with bait and switch. Despite these differences, however, we are pleased with the developments the dialogue has produced.

TI Process innovation, product differentiation, and channel structure:
   Strategic incentives in a duopoly
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In this paper we analyze the joint implications of two effects: (a) inserting independent profit-maximizing retailers into the channel system provides "buffering" to the manufacturers from price competition when their products are highly substitutable and intrachannel contracts are observable (as shown by McGuire and Staelin 1983 under the assumption of constant marginal production costs), and, (b) lack of channel coordination results in a reduction in manufacturer's incentives to invest in efforts to reduce production costs (as shown by Jeuland and Shugan 1983 for the case of bilateral monopoly). We show that both these results are robust in the sense that the first holds even in the presence of the vertical externality of manufacturer's effort reduction in a noncoordinated channel, and the second holds regardless of the degree of substitutability between the competing channel's products.
   Specifically, we analyze a four-stage game with two manufacturers and two retailers, where the intrachannel contracts are linear and observable and manufacturers make investments in process improvements to reduce their production costs. We find that the optimal channel structure decision depends on interactions between two parameters: the degree of substitutability between products and the level of investments required to achieve production cost reduction. These parameters represent what have been widely interpreted in the management literature as the two primary "generic strategies" that most organizations follow in order to gain competitive advantage: cost leadership and product differentiation (Porter 1980). Thus, our analysis brings out the strategic and interdisciplinary nature of the channel structure decision that can significantly affect firm profitability.
   Our main results are as follows. First, we find that decentralized, noncoordinated channels appear as more profitable equilibrium than integration (or perfectly coordinated channels) at high product substitutability even when process innovation dimension is accounted for, in agreement with the literature. However, the range of substitutability over which decentralization is an equilibrium strategy is smaller the easier it is to reduce production costs. Intuitively, the easier the cost reduction, the larger the cost penalty that the channel incurs as a result of not coordinating investment and pricing decisions between channel members, and thus smaller the range over which decentralization is an equilibrium. This implies that there is an explicit tradeoff between efficiency and strategic incentives in distribution channel design.
   Second, we show that decentralized manufacturers invest less in process innovation than integrated manufacturers do, regardless of the structure of the competing channel and the degree of substitutability between products. Consequently, a decentralized channel has higher costs, charges higher prices, and produces lower quantities than an integrated channel does. Moreover, these differences get larger the easier the cost reduction. The effect on manufacturer profits, however, is not that clear. Manufacturers make higher profits by decentralizing if products are highly substitutable, in agreement with McGuire and Staelin (1983) and Coughlan and Wernerfelt (1989). However, we also find that the relative profitability of decentralization at high substitutability (and of integration at low substitutability) increases the easier the cost reduction. Moreover, the range of substitutability over which decentralization is more profitable than integration is itself larger the easier the cost reduction (though decentralization is an equilibrium strategy over a smaller range). Thus, process innovation accentuates the profit difference between integrated and decentralized channels and makes the Prisoner's Dilemma situation worse in the choice of distribution channel structure.
   Finally, we analyze two examples of coordinated decision making in a channel: a divisional integrated system and franchising. In the first case, we find that decentralization can emerge as a unique (and more profitable) equilibrium at high product substitutability, in contrast to McGuire and Staelin (1983). In the second case, we find that decentralization is not always a unique equilibrium and it is not always more profitable than integration, in sharp contrast to the results by Coughlan and Wernerfelt (1989). Thus, franchising does not provide a sure way of achieving channel coordination when marginal production costs are not constant.
   In sum, this paper highlights the importance of simultaneously considering both the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of interorganizational relations on one hand and, on the other, paying attention to cross-functional interactions across marketing and operational decisions to better understand the underlying incentives that share firm and market structures; conventional focus of marketing on demand side effects and of operations on cost side effects can lead to suboptimal decisions.

TI Consumption self-control by rationing purchase quantities of virtue and
   vice
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumers' attempts to control their unwanted consumption impulses influence many everyday purchases with broad implications for marketers' pricing policies. Addressing theoreticians and practitioners alike, this paper uses multiple empirical methods to show that consumers voluntarily and strategically ration their purchase quantities of goods that are Likely to be consumed on impulse and that therefore may pose self-control problems. For example, many regular smokers buy their cigarettes by the pack, although they could easily afford to buy 10-pack cartons. These smokers knowingly forgo sizable per-unit savings from quantity discounts, which they could realize if they bought cartons; by rationing their purchase quantities, they also self-impose additional transactions costs on marginal consumption, which makes excessive smoking overly difficult and costly.
   Such strategic self-imposition of constraints is intuitively appealing yet theoretically problematic. The marketing literature lacks operationalizations and empirical tests of such consumption self-control strategies and of their managerial implications. This paper provides experimental evidence of the operation of consumer self-control and empirically illustrates its direct implications for the pricing of consumer goods. Moreover, the paper develops a conceptual framework for the design of empirical tests of such self-imposed constraints on consumption in consumer goods markets. Within matched pairs of products, we distinguish relative "virtue" and "vice" goods whose preference ordering changes with whether consumers evaluate immediate or delayed consumption consequences. For example, ignoring long-term health effects, many smokers prefer regular (relative vice) to Light (relative virtue) cigarettes, because they prefer the taste of the former. However, ignoring these shortterm taste differences, the same smokers prefer light to regular cigarettes when they consider the long-term health effects of smoking. These preference orders can lead to dynamically inconsistent consumption choices by consumers whose tradeoffs between the immediate and delayed consequences of consumption depend on the time lag between purchase and consumption. This creates a potential self-control problem, because these consumers will be tempted to overconsume the vices they have in stock at home. Purchase quantity rationing helps them solve the self-control problem by limiting their stock and hence their consumption opportunities. Such rationing implies that, per purchase occasion, vice consumers will be less likely than virtue consumers to buy larger quantities in response to unit price reductions such as quantity discounts,
   We first test this prediction in two laboratory experiments. We then examine the external validity of the results at the retail level with a field survey of quantity discounts and with a scanner data analysis of chain-wide store-level demand across a variety of different pairs of matched vice (regular) and virtue (reduced fat, calorie, or caffeine, etc.) product categories. The analyses of these experimental, field, and scanner data provide strong convergent evidence of a characteristic crossover in demand schedules for relative vices and virtues for categories as diverse as, among others, potato chips, chocolate chip cookies, cream cheese, beer, soft drinks, ice cream and frozen yogurt, chewing gum, coffee, and beef and turkey bologna. Vice consumers' demand increases less in response to price reductions than virtue consumers' demand, although their preferences are not generally weaker for vices than for virtues. Constraints on vice purchases are self-imposed and strategic rather than driven by simple preferences. We suggest that rationing their vice inventories at the point of purchase allows consumers to limit subsequent consumption. As a result of purchase quantity rationing, however, vice buyers forgo savings from price reductions through quantity discounts, effectively paying price premiums for the opportunity to engage in self-control. Thus, purchase quantity rationing vice consumers are relatively price insensitive.
   From a managerial and public policy perspective, our findings should offer marketing practitioners in many consumer goods industries new opportunities to increase profits through segmentation and price discrimination based on consumer self-control. They can charge premium prices for small sizes of vices, relative to the corresponding quantity discounts for virtues. Virtue consumers, on the other hand, will buy larger amounts even when quantity discounts are relatively shallow. A key conceptual contribution of this paper lies in showing how marketing researchers can investigate a whole class of strategic self-constraining consumer behaviors empirically. Moreover, this research is the first to extend previous, theoretical work on impulse control by empirically demonstrating its broader implications for marketing decision making.

TI Coordinating channels under price and nonprice competition
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper analyzes how manufacturers should coordinate distribution channels when retailers compete in price as well as important nonprice factors such as the provision of product information, free repair, faster check-out, or after-sales service. Differentiation among retailers in price and nonprice service factors is a central feature of markets ranging from automobiles and appliances to gasoline and is especially observed in the coexistence of high-service retailers and lower price discount retailers. Therefore, how a manufacturer should manage retail differentiation is an important channel management question. Yet, the approach in the existing literature has been to examine channel coordination under the standard "symmetric contracting" assumption that offering a uniform contract to all the retailers in a market will, be sufficient for coordination. I bring this assumption into question and ask when is it optimal for the manufacturer to use the channel contract to deliberately induce retail differentiation (even if the retailers were ex-ante identical in their cost and other characteristics). The paper identifies the type of channel contracts that can endogenously induce symmetry as opposed to differentiation among retailers.
   Next, the paper highlights a type of channel conflict that arises from the very nature of retail price-service competition. A manufacturer might find the retailers to be excessively biased towards price competition at the cost of service provision or vice-versa. The paper establishes when a manufacturer is likely to stimulate greater price as opposed to greater service competition among the retailers.
   The framework that I develop to address these issues highlights the role of two basic types of consumer heterogeneity. Consumers are heterogeneous in their locations (as in the spatial models of horizontal differentiation) and in their willingness to pay for retail services (as in the models of vertical differentiation). The model also uses a natural relationship in retail markets between the travel/time cost incurred by a consumer and her willingness to pay: The more affluent consumers who have a higher willingness to pay for retail services also have a higher cost for their personal time. Given these market features, the paper analyzes the problem faced by a manufacturer who sells to competing retailers.
   The paper shows that the standard notion in the literature of offering similar contracts to all the retailers is sufficient only in markets with substantial locational differentiation relative to the differences in the willingness to pay. Effective channel management in these markets simply requires mechanisms that ensure that retailer interests are aligned so that they compete by offering a mix of price and service that is desirable from the manufacturer's point of view. However, in markets with small locational differentiation and substantial diversity in consumer willingness to pay, the manufacturer's problem is not just to align retailer interests, but to also use the channel contract to induce the correct level of retail differentiation. This helps the manufacturer to better cater to the diversity in consumer willingness to pay and to prevent the cut-throat competition that the retailers would otherwise have indulged in. The manufacturer can achieve this through the use of menu-based contracts. Menu-based contracts induce differentiated retailer behavior despite the fact that the retailers are not "forced" into accepting different terms of trade. This aspect can be useful in shielding manufacturers from litigation under the Robinson-Patman act.
   The paper also shows that for relatively high-ticket items retailers tend to be excessively biased towards competing in the provision of retail services. The correlation between consumer willingness to pay for service and travel costs implies that for high-ticket products, the competing retailers will focus on the more service-sensitive customers at the cost of ignoring the price-sensitive consumers in the market. The manufacturer is therefore likely to encourage greater price competition among the retailers. In contrast, for low-ticket items the manufacturer prefers to reduce price competition and encourage greater provision of services. This provides an endogenous rationale for the use of price ceilings versus floors.
   The basic model is also extended to consider the effect of upstream competition between manufacturers. Under upstream competition, coordinating retail price and service decisions is not always optimal for an individual manufacturer. This extension to manufacturer competition provides a basis for understanding the role of retail price-service differentiation in the context of a channel duopoly. It also shows that a mixed distribution channel (a channel in which one manufacturer chooses to be coordinated while the other chooses to be noncoordinated) can be an equilibrium in markets with weak brand loyalty.

TI Brand equity and vertical product line extent
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper addresses the question of how the vertical structure of a product line relates to brand equity. Does the presence of "premium" or high-quality products in a product line enhance brand equity? Conversely, does the presence of "economy" or low-quality products in a product line diminish brand equity? Economists and marketing researchers refer to variation in quality levels of products within a category as "vertical" differentiation, whereas variation in the function or "category" of the products is referred to as "horizontal" differentiation. Much of the existing research on the relationship between product line structure and brand equity has focused on the horizontal structure of the product line and has been primarily concerned with brand extensions-what happens when the product line of a brand is extended horizontally into new categories? Researchers have been concerned primarily with how the extension fares, but the effect of the extension on the core products is also important. There is an analogous question of what happens when the product line of a brand is extended vertically, either "up market" or "down market." This question of vertical extensions is part of the more general issue of how the vertical structure of a product Line relates to brand equity.
   The specific research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) do "premium" or high-quality products enhance the brand equity associated with the other products in the line? (2) Conversely, do "economy" or low-quality products diminish the brand equity associated with the other products in the line? These research questions are relevant to three managerial issues in product-line strategy. First, what are the costs and benefits of including "down market" products within a brand? Second, what are the implications of including high-end models within a brand? Third, when should high-end and low-end products be offered under an existing brand umbrella and when should these products be offered under separate brands?
   We address these research questions empirically through an analysis of the models and brands within the U.S. mountain bicycle industry. We use price premium above that which can be explained by the physical characteristics of the bicycle as a metric for brand equity. We then test several hypotheses related to the relationship between extension of the product line upward and downward and the price premium commanded by the brand. We further support this analysis with a simple laboratory experiment. The analysis reveals that price premium, in the lower quality segments of the market, is significantly positively correlated with the quality of the lowest-quality model in the brand's product line; and, that for the upper quality segments of the market, price premium is also significantly positively correlated with the quality of the highest-quality model in the brand's product Line. The results of the analysis are supported by the outcome of an experiment in which 63 percent of the subjects preferred a product offered by a high-end brand to the equivalent product offered by a low-end competitor. These results imply that managers wishing only to maximize the equity of their brands would offer only high-quality products and avoid offering low-quality products. However, this result must be moderated by the overall objective of maximizing profits. Maximizing profits is likely to involve a tradeoff between preserving high brand equity (and therefore high margins) and pursuing the volume typically located in the lower end of the market. One of the most significant implications of this research is that product line managers need to be mindful not just of the incremental cannibalization or stimulation of sales of products that are immediate neighbors of an extension to the product line, but also the effect of such an extension on the brand equity in other, possibly quite different, parts of the product line.

TI Response to competitive entry: A rationale for delayed defensive
   reaction
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Empirical studies examining responses to new product entries come to the puzzling conclusion that, in general, an incumbent reacts to a new entrant after a significant delay. Even easy-to-implement price cuts are observed after significant lag following entry. These findings seem to contradict the existing literature that either implicitly assumes or strongly advocates immediate defensive responses to limit competitive encroachment. When a competing firm enters the market, consumers may be uncertain about the entering firm's product quality. The incumbent firm (through rigorous tests) may fully know the entrant's quality. Suppose the incumbent aggressively lowers price. This may cause the consumers to wonder if indeed the entrant's quality is high. In other words, an incumbent's reaction may cause the consumers to make inferences about the entrant's quality. Such strategic implications of the incumbent's reactions have to be carefully analyzed before determining the optimal response by the incumbent.
   In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for understanding differences in the magnitude and timing of incumbents' responses to competitive entries. We consider a model in which a monopolist incumbent firm faces competitive entry. The incumbent firm knows the true quality of the entrant with certainty. Although consumers are aware of the incumbent's product quality through their prior experience, they are initially uncertain of the entrant's product quality. In such a situation, a high-quality entrant has the incentive to signal her true quality through her strategic price choice. However, the uncertainty about the entrant's quality is favorable to the incumbent in the sense that consumers believe with a high probability that the entrant's quality is low. As a result, the strategic incentives facing the incumbent and the entrant oppose each other. While the entrant wants to signal her high quality, the incumbent wants to prevent her from doing so. We demonstrate that one way the incumbent can prevent the quality signaling is to select a higher than his optimal competitive (duopoly) price In other words, the incumbent can prevent or "jam" the entrant's quality signaling by choosing a price higher than his optimal competitive price when consumers are fully informed about the entrant's true quality. Though the signal-jamming price is lower than the monopoly price, the price is substantially higher than the competitive price. This marginal reduction in the incumbent's price from the pre-entry monopolistic price represents a muted or lack of response by the incumbent to the competitive entry. However, once the entrant's quality gets revealed in subsequent periods through consumer usage and word of mouth, the Entrant has no incentive to Engage in quality signaling and the incumbent has no incentive to jam it. Therefore, the market reverts to the complete-information competitive prices, and the incumbent lowers his price considerably. This temporal pattern of muted price reduction in the first period followed by a sharp price reduction in the second period corresponds to a delayed defensive reaction in our model. Although the empirical studies suggest that the delayed reaction may arise due to factors such as managerial inertia or indecision, we demonstrate that such a behavior is indeed an optimal strategy for a profit-maximizing firm. Thus, our model reconciles empirical results with the equilibrium outcome of a strategic analytical framework.
   Furthermore, in an experimental setting, we test the predictive power of our framework and establish that consumers indeed form conjectures about the entrant's quality based on the incumbent's reactions. In the first experimental study, we find strong support for the notion that the incumbent's price reaction may indicate entrant's quality. In a follow-up study, we observe that whenever the incumbent lowers prices, respondents judge the quality of the entrant to be higher as compared to the case when prices are the same or increased. The managerial implication of this payer is that well-established incumbent firms should be cautious in the implementation of their defensive responses to product introductions of uncertain quality by competitors. Of particular concern are situations where the reactions are easily observable by consumers. A strong reaction may suggest that the incumbent takes the competitive threat seriously, leading consumers to believe in the quality of the competitor's product.

TI Estimation of consumer demand with stock-out based substitution: An
   application to vending machine products
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The occurrence of temporary stock-outs at retail is common in frequently purchased product categories. Available empirical evidence suggests that when faced with stock-outs, consumers are often willing to buy substitute items. An important implication of this consumer behavior is that observed sales of an item no longer provide a good measure of its core demand rate. Sales of items that stock-out are sight-censored, while sales of other items are inflated because of substitutions. Knowledge of the true demand rates and substitution rates is important for the retailer for a variety of category management decisions such as the ideal assortment to carry, how much to stock of each item, and how often to replenish the stock. The estimated substitution rates can also be used to infer patterns of competition between items in the category. In this paper we propose methods to estimate demand rates and substitution rates in such contexts.
   We develop a model of customer arrivals and choice between goods that explicitly allows for possible product substitution and lost sales when a customer faces a stock-out. The model is developed in the context of retail vending, an industry that accounts for a sizable part of the retail sales of many consumer products. We consider the information set available from two kinds of inventory tracking systems. In the best case scenario of a perpetual inventory system in which times of stock-out occurrence and cumulative sales of all goods up to these times are observed, we derive Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs) of the demand parameters and show that they are especially simple and intuitive.
   However, state-of-the-art inventory systems in retail vending provide only periodic data, i.e., data in which times of stock-out occurrence are unobserved or "missing." For these data we show how the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be employed to obtain the MLEs of the demand parameters by treating the stock-out times as missing data. We show an application of the model to daily sales and stocking data pooled across multiple beverage vending machines in a midwestern U.S. city. The vending machines in the application carry identical assortments of six brands. Since the number of parameters to be estimated is too large given the available data, we discuss possible restrictions of the consumer choice model to accomplish the estimation. Our results indicate that demand rates estimated naively by using observed sales rates are biased, even for items that have very few occurrences of stock-outs. We also find significant differences among the substitution rates of the six brands.
   The methods proposed in our paper can be modified to apply to many nonvending retail settings in which consumer choices are observed, not their preferences, and choices are constrained because of unavailability of items in the choice set. One such context is in-store grocery retailing, where similar issues of information availability arise. In this context an important issue that would need to be dealt with is changes in the retail environment caused by retail promotions.

TI Managing advertising and promotion for long-run profitability
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In recent years, manufacturers have become increasingly disposed toward the use of sales promotions, often at the cost of advertising. Yet the long-term implications of these changes for brand profitability remain unclear. In this paper, we seek to offer insights into this important issue. We consider the questions of i) whether it is more desirable to advertise or promote, ii) whether it is better to use frequent, shallow promotions or infrequent, deep promotions, and iii) how changes in regular prices affect sales relative to increases in price promotions. Additional insights regarding brand equity, the relative magnitude of short- and long-term effects, and the decomposition of advertising and promotion elasticities across choice and quantity decisions are obtained.
   To address these points, we develop a heteroscedastic, varying-parameter joint probit choice and regression quantity model. Our approach allows consumers' responses to short-term marketing activities to change in response to changes in marketing actions over the long term. We also accommodate the possibility of competitive reactions to policy changes of a brand. The model is estimated for a consumer packaged good category by using over eight years of panel data. The resulting parameters enable us to assess the effects of changes in advertising and promotion policies on sales and profits.
   Our results show that, in the long term, advertising has a positive effect on "brand equity" while promotions have a negative effect. Furthermore, we find price promotion elasticities to be larger than regular price elasticities in the short term, but smaller than regular price elasticities when longterm effects are considered. Consistent with previous research, we also find that most of the effect of a price cut is manifested in consumers' brand choice decisions in the short term, but when long-term effects are again considered, this result no longer holds. Last, we estimate that the long-term effects of promotions on sales are negative overall, and about two-fifths the magnitude of the positive short-term effects,
   Finally, making reasonable cost and margin assumptions, we conduct simulations to assess the relative profit impact of long-term changes in pricing, advertising, or promotion policies. Our results show regular price decreases to have a generally negative effect on the long-term profits of brands, advertising to be profitable for two of the brands, and increases in price promotions to be uniformly unprofitable.

TI Asymmetric and neighborhood cross-price effects: Some empirical
   generalizations
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper provides some empirical generalizations regarding how the relative prices of competing brands affect the cross-price effects among them. Particular focus is on the asymmetric price effect and the neighborhood price effect. The asymmetric price effect states that a price promotion by a higher-priced brand affects the market share of a lower-priced brand more so than the reverse. The neighborhood price effect states that brands that are closer to each other in price have larger cross-price effects than brands that are priced farther apart. The main objective of this paper is to test if these two effects are generalizable across product categories, and to assess which of these two effects is stronger.
   While the neighborhood price effect has not been rigorously tested in past research, the asymmetric price effect has been validated by several researchers. However, these tests of asymmetric price effect have predominantly used elasticity as the measure of cross-price effect. The cross-price elasticity measures the percentage change in market share (or sales) of a brand for 1% change in price of a competing brand. We show that asymmetries in cross-price elasticities tend to favor the higher-priced brand simply because of scaling effects due to considering percentage changes. Furthermore, several researchers have used legit models to infer asymmetric patterns. We also show that inferring asymmetries from conventional legit models is incorrect.
   To account for potential scaling effects, we consider the absolute cross-price effect defined as the change in market share (percentage) points of a target brand when a competing brand's price changes by one percent of the product category price. The advantage of this measure is that it is dimensionless thence comparable across categories) and it avoids scaling effects. We show that in the legit model with arbitrary heterogeneity in brand preferences and price sensitivities, the absolute cross-price effect is symmetric.
   We develop an econometric model for simultaneously estimating the asymmetric and neighborhood price effects and assess their relative strengths. We also estimate two alternate models that address the following questions: (i) If I were managing the ith highest priced brand, which brand do I impact the most by discounting and which brand hurts me the most through price discounts? (ii) Who hurts whom in National Brand vs. Store Brand competition?
   Based on a meta-analysis of 1,060 cross-price effects on 280 brands from 19 different grocery product categories, we provide the following empirical generalizations:
   1. The asymmetric price effect holds with cross-price elasticities, but tends to disappear with absolute cross-price effects.
   2. The neighborhood price effect holds with both cross-price elasticities and absolute cross-price effects, and is significantly stronger than the asymmetric price effect on both measures of cross-price effects.
   3. A brand is affected the most by discounts of its immediately higher-priced brand, followed closely by discounts of its immediately lower-priced brand.
   4. National brands impact store brands more so than the reverse when the cross-effect is measured in elasticities, but the asymmetric effect does not hold with absolute effects. Store brands hurt and are, in turn, hurt the most by the lower-priced national brands that are adjacent in price to the store brands.
   5. Cross-price effects are greater when there are fewer competing brands in the product category, and among brands in nonfood household products than among brands in food products.
   The implications of these findings are discussed.

TI Competition in durable goods markets: The strategic consequences of
   leasing and selling
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In marketing durable goods, manufacturers use varying degrees of leasing and selling to consumers, e.g., cars, photocopiers, personal computers, airplanes, etc. The question that this raises is whether the distinction between leases and sales is simply one of price, or whether the proportion of leases and sales effects a firm's ability to compete in the market. In this paper we use two approaches to argue that leasing and selling: create strategic consequences that extend beyond prices. First, we develop a stylized theoretical model that shows that the optimal proportion of leases and sales depends on the competitiveness of the market and on the inherent reliability of the firm's product. And second, we find support for the implications of our theoretical model with data from the automobile industry.
   The U.S. automobile industry has seen a large increase in leasing over the last five years. However, the extent to which leasing has been embraced varies widely across manufacturers. For example, in 1993 the sport utility segment had the following lease percentages: Ford Explorer, 29%; Jeep Grand Cherokee, 24%; Toyota 4-Runner, 11%; and Chevrolet Blazer, 9%. In addition, manufacturers often vary lease percentages across models. For example, in 1993 Ford leased 22% of its Crown Victoria model, 35% of its Taurus model, and 42% of its Probe model. A popular argument for why we see these differences is that higher priced cars are leased more often because leasing makes them more "affordable." However, this rationale is not compelling in the face of our data. For example, the Ford Probe was priced significantly lower than the Crown Victoria and yet it was leased almost twice as often.
   To develop a better understanding of why we observe differences in the proportion of leasing, we develop a two-period model of a duopoly in which each manufacturer chooses its optimal quantity and the fraction of units it wants to lease. We find that in equilibrium neither firm leases all its units-either they use a mix of leasing and selling or they use only selling. Our analysis suggests that the fraction of leased cars decreases as the manufacturers' products become more similar and the competition between them increases. The intuition for this result is that a higher fraction of leases puts the firm at a competitive disadvantage in the future. This occurs because, unlike firms that sell their product, firms that lease are at a price disadvantage.
   Another important finding in this paper is that the extent of leasing chosen by a manufacturer depends on the reliability of its product. In particular, all else being equal, the lower a product's reliability, the lower its proportion of leases. Within the context of the automobile industry, this suggests that more expensive cars may be leased more often because they are of higher quality and not necessarily because they are more expensive.
   Finally, we test the implications of our theoretical model with data from the U.S, automobile market. In particular, for 1993 model year cars, we develop a measure of reliability using data from Consumer Reports. In addition, we develop a measure of the extent of competition in each segment of the automobile market. We support our hypotheses by finding that the extent to which a car model is leased depends strongly on its predicted reliability and on the competitive intensity within the segment.

TI Manufacturer allowances and retailer pass-through rates in a competitive
   environment
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A commonly held belief has grocery and mass merchandise retailers gaining power relative to the upstream consumer package goods manufacturers. One of the major justifications for this belief is that manufacturers are now giving retailers more side payments such as trade allowances, slotting allowances, etc. However, a number of researchers have shown that these concessions have not translated into increased profit for the retailer relative to the manufacturer.
   This paper explores, via an analytic model, why one might see retailers getting concessions from the manufacturer without being able to translate them into high profits. We do this by representing the interaction between the channel members as a one-period profit maximizing game where manufacturers decide on how large a side payment (i.e., a concession) to give to each retailer and retailers decide on how much of this side payment to use to promote the manufacturer's product.
   At the heart of our model is a demand function for each product offering (i.e., a specific brand sold by a specific retailer). This demand function is linear in own and other's prices, but based on empirical evidence is assumed to be nonlinear in the effects of merchandising activities (e.g., short term price discounts, better shelf space, advertising, etc.). Specifically, merchandising effects are modeled with a square root function that also acknowledges most short-term promotional effects result in brand or store switching versus increase category volume.
   The model is composed of six parameters. These are the inherent popularity of the brand at a particular outlet, own price sensitivity, cross (but within the store) price sensitivity, customer's sensitivity to within store promotion activities, customer's sensitivity to between store promotional activities, and the degree to which promotional activities yield incremental product category sales. We use our underlying demand formulation to find the equilibrium solution to the full information, Stackelberg leader game for different store and brand loyalty environments as captured by our six parameters. These parameters are chosen based on empirical evidence to span possible market conditions that each channel member might have.
   Our findings and modeling efforts should be of interest to analytic channel modelers and scholars interested in the mass merchandising and grocery store industries. For a theoretical point of view we build upon the Case 4 model of Lee and Staelin (1997) to allow for promotional activities. From a substantive point of view we show that manufacturers will freely give retailers side payments even though they know these retailers will pocket a substantial portion of this concession. Moreover, we identify conditions within our model that lead to larger allowances, lower pass through rates, and lower retail profits; outcomes that are compatible with recent industry trends. In addition, we highlight the difference in effect on profits, prices, etc, of changes in consumers sensitivity to inter-store differences in storewide merchandising activities. One of the more counter-intuitive results of these analyses is that it is in the manufacturer's best interest to help retailers increase their spatial monopoly by decreasing consumers' tendency to cross-store shop because of merchandising activities.

TI What you don't know about customer-perceived quality: The role of
   customer expectation distributions
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We show that some of the most common beliefs about customer-perceived quality are wrong. For example, 1) it is not necessary to exceed customer expectations to increase preference, 2) receiving an expected level of bad service does not reduce preference, 3) rational customers may rationally choose an option with lower expected quality, even if all non-quality attributes are equal, and 4) paying more attention to loyal, experienced customers can sometimes be counterproductive. These surprising findings make sense in retrospect, once customer expectations are viewed as distributions, rather than simple point expectations. That is, each customer has a probability density function that describes the relative likelihood that a particular quality outcome will be experienced. Customers form these expectation distributions based on their cumulative experience with the good or service. A customer's cumulative expectation distribution may be conceptualized as being a predictive density for the next transaction.
   When combined with a diminishing returns (i.e., concave) utility function, this Bayesian theoretical framework results in predictions of: (a) how consumers will behave over time, and (b) how their perceptions and evaluations will change. In managerial terms, we conclude that customers consider not only expected quality, but also risk. This may help explain why current measures of customer satisfaction (which is highly related to expected quality) only partially predict future behavior. We find that most of the predictions of our theoretical model are borne out by empirical evidence from two experiments. Thus, we conclude that our approach provides a useful simplification of reality that successfully predicts many aspects of the dynamics of consumer response to quality.
   These findings are relevant to both academics and managers. Academics in the area of customer satisfaction and service quality need to be aware that it may be insufficient to measure only the point expectation, as has always been the standard practice. Instead it may be necessary to measure the uncertainty that the customer has with respect to the level of service that will be received. Due to questionnaire length constraints, it may not be practical for managers to include uncertainty questions on customer satisfaction surveys. Nevertheless it is possible to build a proxy for uncertainty by measuring the extent of experience with the service/good, and this proxy can be used to partially control for uncertainty effects.
   The findings of the study were obtained using 1) an analytical model of customer expectation updating, based on a set of assumptions that are well-supported in the academic literature, and 2) two behavioral experiments using human subjects: a cross-sectional experiment, and a longitudinal experiment. Both the analytical model and the behavioral experiments were designed to investigate the effects that distributions of expectations might have, and especially the effects that might deviate from the predictions that would arise from a traditional point expectation model. The behavioral experiments largely confirmed the predictions of the analytical model. As it turned out, the analytical model correctly (in most cases) predicted behavioral effects that contradict some of the best-accepted "truisms" of customer satisfaction.
   It is now clear that a more sophisticated view of customer expectations is required-one that considers not only the point expectation but also the likelihood across the entire distribution of possible outcomes. This distinction is not "just academic," because it results in predictable behavior that deviates significantly from that which was traditionally expected based on simpler models.

TI The "shopping basket": A model for multicategory purchase incidence
   decisions
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumers make multicategory decisions in a variety of contexts such as choice of multiple categories during a shopping trip or mail-order purchasing. The choice of one category may affect the selection of another category due to the complementary nature (e.g., cake mix and cake frosting) of the two categories. Alternatively, two categories may co-occur in a shopping basket not because they are complementary but because of similar purchase cycles (e.g., beer and diapers) or because of a host of other unobserved factors. While complementarity gives managers some control over consumers' buying behavior (e.g., a change in the price of cake mix could change the purchase probability of cake frosting), cooccurrence or co-incidence is less controllable. Other factors that may affect multi-category choice may be (unobserved) household preferences or (observed) household demographics. We also argue that not accounting for these three factors simultaneously could lead to erroneous inferences. We then develop a conceptual framework that incorporates complementarity, co-incidence and heterogeneity (both observed and unobserved) as the factors that could lead to multicategory choice.
   We then translate this framework into a model of multicategory choice. Our model is based on random utility theory and allows for simultaneous, interdependent choice of many items. This model, the multivariate probit model, is implemented in a Hierarchical Bayes framework. The hierarchy consists of three levels. The first level captures the choice of items for the shopping basket during a shopping trip. The second level captures differences across households and the third level specifies the priors for the unknown parameters. We generalize some recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to estimate the model. Specifically, we use a substitution sampler which incorporates techniques such as the Metropolis Hit-and-Run algorithm and the Gibbs Sampler.
   The model is estimated on four categories (cake mix, cake frosting, fabric detergent and fabric softener) using multicategory panel data. The results disentangle the complementarity and co-incidence effects. The complementarity results show that pricing and promotional changes in one category affect purchase incidence in related product categories. In general, the cross-price and cross-promotion effects are smaller than the own-price and own-promotions effects. The cross-effects are also asymmetric across pairs of categories, i.e., related category pairs may be characterized as having a "primary" and a "secondary" category. Thus these results provide a more complete description of the effects of promotional changes by examining them both within and across categories. The co-incidence results show the extent of the relationship between categories that arises from uncontrollable and unobserved factors. These results are useful since they provide insights into a general structure of dependence relationships across categories. The heterogeneity results show that observed demographic factors such as family size influence the intrinsic category preference of households. Larger family sizes also tend to make households more price sensitive for both the primary and secondary categories. We find that price sensitivities across categories are not highly correlated at the household level. We also find some evidence that intrinsic preferences for cake mix and cake frosting are more closely related than preferences for fabric detergent and fabric softener.
   We compare our model with a series of null models using both estimation and holdout samples. We show that both complementarity and co-incidence play a significant role in predicting multicategory choice. We also show how many single-category models used in conjunction may not be good predictors of joint choice.
   Our results are likely to be of interest to retailers and manufacturers trying to optimize pricing and promotion strategies across many categories as well as in designing micro-marketing strategies. We illustrate some of these benefits by carrying out an analysis which shows that the "true" impact of complementarity and co-incidence on profitability is significant in a retail setting. Our model can also be applied to other domains. The combination of item interdependence and individual household level estimates may be of particular interest to database marketers in building customized "cross-selling" strategies in the direct mail and financial service industries.

TI A Bayesian model to forecast new product performance in domestic and
   international markets
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper attempts to shed light on the following research questions: When a firm introduces a new product (or service) how can it effectively use the different information sources available to generate reliable new product performance forecasts? How can the firm account for varying information availability at different stages of the new product launch and generate forecasts at each stage? We address these questions in the context of the sequential launches of motion pictures in international markets.
   Players in the motion picture industry require forecasts at different stages of the movie launch process to aid decisionmaking, and the information sets available to generate such forecasts vary at different stages. Despite the importance of such forecasts, the industry struggles to understand and predict sales of new movies in domestic and overseas markets.
   We develop a Bayesian modeling framework that predicts first-week viewership for new movies in both domestic and several international markets. We focus on the first week because industry players involved in international markets (studios, distributors, and exhibitors) are most interested in these predictions. We draw on existing literature on forecasting performance of new movies to formulate our model. Specifically, we model the number of viewers of a movie in a given week using a Poisson count data model. The number of screens, distribution strategy, movie attributes such as genre, and presence/absence of stars are among the factors modeled to influence viewership. We employ a hierarchical Bayes formulation of the Poisson model that allows the determinants of viewership to vary across countries. We adopt the Bayesian approach for two reasons: First, it provides a convenient framework to model varying assumptions of information availability; specifically, it allows us to make forecasts by combining different sources of information such as domestic and international market-specific data. Second, this methodology provides us with the entire distribution of the new movie's performance forecast. Such a predictive distribution is more informative than a point estimate and provides a measure of the uncertainty in the forecasts.
   We propose a Bayesian prediction procedure that provides viewership forecasts at different stages of the new movie release process. The methodology provides forecasts under a number of information availability scenarios. Thus, forecasts can be obtained with just information from a historical database containing data on previous new product launches in several international markets. As more information becomes available, the forecasting methodology allows us to combine historical information with data on the performance of the new product in the domestic market and thereby to make forecasts with less uncertainty and greater accuracy.
   Our results indicate that for all the countries in the data set the number of screens on which a movie is released is the most important influence on viewership. Furthermore, we find that local distribution improves movie sales internationally in contrast to the domestic market. We also find evidence of similar genre preferences in geographically disparate countries. We find that the proposed model provides accurate forecasts at the movie-country level. Further, the model outperforms all the extant models in the marketing literature that could potentially be used for making these forecasts. A comparison of root mean square and mean absolute errors for movies in a hold out sample shows that the model that combines information available from the different sources generates the lowest errors. A Bayesian predictive model selection criterion corroborates the superior performance of this model. We demonstrate that the Bayesian model can be combined with industry rules of thumb to generate cumulative box office forecasts.
   In summary, this research demonstrates a Bayesian modeling framework that allows the use of different information sources to make new product forecasts in domestic and international markets. Our results underscore the theme that each movie is unique as is each country-and viewership results from an interaction of the product and the market. Hence, the motion picture industry should use both product-specific and market-specific information to make new movie performance forecasts.

TI Product proliferation: An empirical analysis of product line
   determinants and market outcomes
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Considering the number of new product introductions and available product varieties today, the practice of product proliferation is visibly evident in many diverse industries. Given its prevalence in practice, understanding the determinants and implications of firm proliferation strategies clearly has important managerial relevance.
   Previous theoretical research has identified three primary effects of a proliferation strategy: (1) a broad product line can increase the overall demand faced by the firm, (2) a broad product line can affect supply by increasing costs, and (3) broad product lines can have strategic consequences (e.g., long product lines can deter entry, thereby allowing an incumbent firm to raise prices). However, despite the theoretical interest in this common business practice, there has been very little empirical research on this topic. Moreover, no empirical study has simultaneously considered all three of the possible effects associated with a proliferation strategy. Consequently, in this paper we propose a three-equation simultaneous system that captures both the determinants and market outcomes of a firm's product line decisions. In particular, we specify market share, price, and product line length equations, which are estimated by three stage least squares. Using this structure, we empirically study the personal computer industry over the period 1981-1992.
   Our empirical results demonstrate that proliferation strategies do not have a uni-dimensional explanation. We find that product proliferation decisions have both demand (market share) and supply (price) implications. Our empirical results also suggest that the firm-level net market share impact of product proliferation in the personal computer industry is negative (i.e., the cost increases associated with a broader product line dominate any potential demand increases). As expected, we find that structural competitive factors play an important role in the determinants and market outcomes of a firm's product line decisions. However, we do not find evidence of firms using proliferation strategies to deter entry in this industry. Finally, we also demonstrate that some of the empirical conclusions from previous research are reversed once product line length is specified as endogenous in the share and price specifications.

TI Modeling the effects of advertised price claims: Tensile versus precise
   claims?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Department store chains use advertised price reductions as a major promotional tool to attract consumers to their stores. In advertising discounts, retailers typically use price claims that vary on two key dimensions. First, discounts may be specified either precisely (e.g., 60% off) or with nonspecific (tensile) information as in a range of discounts (e.g., 50-70% off). Second, discounts may be offered on an entire group (e.g., Sale on "All" items) or on a subset of an advertised group of items (e.g., "Save 50-70% on items marked with a yellow dot''-only items marked with a yellow dot qualify for the discount).
   Our objective in this paper is to develop a conceptual framework to understand how consumers respond to tensile versus precise claims on a group of advertised items for different price image stores. Using a series of three experimental studies, we identify key variables that consumers use in forming an overall valuation of an advertised sale offer using a tensile versus a precise price claim. The studies also help us to link characteristics of the advertisement and the advertising store to the variables that affect a consumer's valuation of a sale offer using such claims. Consequently, we are not only able to obtain an understanding of a consumer's judgment process, but are also able to provide insights on how to design effective price claims by using variables that are under the retailer's control.
   We propose that consumers' valuation of an advertised sale offer depends on their subjective assessments about the probability with which they will find a desirable item at a discounted price (called subjective probability), the size of that discount (called subjective discount), and the probability of liking the sale item. In Experiment 1, we hold the probability of liking the sale item constant (all sale items are identical) and collect data from consumer responses to price how consumer assessments of subjective probability and subjective discount depend on the type of price claim (precise versus tensile) used, the advertised level of discount, and the fraction of stock specified to be on sale. Our results show that when the fraction of stock specified to be on sale is low (high), consumers responding to a tensile claim are optimistic (pessimistic) about the discount they believe they will get, expecting a subjective discount greater (smaller) than the midpoint of the tensile range. Correspondingly, in responding to a precise claim, consumers expect a subjective discount equal to the advertised discount. There is also no difference in the subjective probability assessed for tensile and precise claims. Consequently, when the fraction of stock on sale is low (high) advertised deals with tensile claims are perceived to be more (less) attractive than with precise claims.
   In Experiment 2 we examine the real-world case of consumer responses to price advertisements from two stores (that differ in price image) in which the fraction of items on sale is not specified but needs to be inferred ed and advertised sale items are comprised of three brands differing in duality. Our results show that the inferred fraction of stock is positively related to the store price image and negatively related to the advertised discount level. We find that the inferred fraction of stock on sale produces effects similar to the specified fraction of stock on sale. In addition, because we measure the perceived distribution of quality for sale items, we are able to examine its effects on consumers' overall valuation of an advertised sale offer. We predict and find that there is a "threshold discount" level for each store above which tensile claims are more effective and below which precise claims are more effective. We also find that the threshold discount is greater for a store with a higher price image.
   Finally, in Experiment 3 we apply our framework to sale offers where the entire advertised stock of items is on sale and show that consumer responses to precise versus tensile claims is a special case of our general analysis of consumer responses to advertisements in Experiment 2 in which a subset of the stock is on sale. Our work differs from previous research on tensile versus precise claims in both focus and substantive contexts. Our study also contributes to the literature studying the role of ambiguity in behavioral decision theory by examining the role of ambiguity in payoffs instead of probabilities.

TI The impact of heterogeneity in purchase timing and price responsiveness
   on estimates of sticker shock effects
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The notion that individuals have an internal reference price against which they compare observed prices is well supported by several psychological theories. Empirically, several papers in the marketing literature, employing scanner panel data, have modeled the impact of reference prices on brand choice via the sticker shock formulation, in which consumers evaluate choice alternatives using differences between shelf prices and reference prices. Most of the studies reported thus far have not accounted for heterogeneity in price response among consumers and have typically imputed reference prices from the shelf prices of brands that a consumer is supposed to have "observed" on previous purchases in the category. Since category marketing activity can differentially affect the purchase timing of households, we argue that this measure of reference price may follow certain systematic patterns across consumers and, when combined with unaccounted for price response heterogeneity, may result in a spurious sticker shock effect. Specifically, we show that estimates of sticker shock are biased upward if households that are price-sensitive in the brand choice decision are also more responsive to category promotion activity in their purchase timing decision.
   We discuss some general conditions under which the bias occurs and conduct a simulation experiment to confirm our specific hypotheses. Our simulation results show that changes in purchase timing are a critical determinant of the bias in the sticker shock effect. We also show that unaccounted for price response heterogeneity can in itself result in a biased sticker shock parameter; however, this requires very large differences in price sensitivities across consumers, far greater than what is normally observed.
   We develop a hierarchical Bayes version of the nested legit model, which models heterogeneity via individual-level parameters in a continuous random effects framework. We estimate the model on scanner panel data from the yogurt and ketchup categories. We find, in both categories, that the 95% probability interval of the posterior distribution of the mean sticker shock coefficient contains the value zero. Therefore, at least for the data used in this study, there is no evidence for the sticker shock effect at the aggregate level. In contrast, the corresponding coefficient from a standard model (which ignores this heterogeneity) is highly significant and supports the existence of a (possibly spurious) sticker shock effect. Consistent with our explanation of the underlying cause of the bias, households that are more price-sensitive in the choice decision are also found to be more responsive to category promotion activity in their decision to purchase in the category.
   The results highlight the measurement problems associated with imputing reference prices from past prices. Since the frequency, duration, and price level of a retailer's promotional program depend on its size and prevalence, accurate estimates of the sticker shock effect are essential for formulating optimal promotion strategies. An adequate accounting of consumer heterogeneity is critical to this effort.

TI Accounting profits versus marketing profits: A relevant metric for
   category management
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Retailers have long recognized that some categories are more important than others in consumers' store choice decisions. The overall profitability of a store requires careful category-level merchandising decisions to draw the most desirable consumers into the store. However, the traditional accounting measure of category profits offers imperfect help making these decisions since it does not take into account the effect of merchandising one category on the profits of other categories in the store. A profit measure which takes into account these important cross-effects is the most relevant performance metric for category management. We call this new construct marketing profits, as it focuses on consumers and their store choice behavior, and is particularly pertinent to the calculus of marketing decision making.
   Despite its practical importance, the total impact of merchandising a specific product category on a store's profitability is difficult to measure, and in practice managers can only rely on intuitive calibration of marketing profits in making many retailing decisions. The difficulty arises from the fact that to directly observe the marketing profits of a category, one has to know how consumer store shopping behavior would change and hence what a store's profit would be if the category were to disappear from the consumers' store choice decision. Furthermore, it is difficult to devise a demand structure that is rich enough to capture bundled purchases on the part of consumers in a reasonable manner, but is simple enough to allow estimation on the basis of commonly observed variables. These two technical difficulties explain the conspicuous lack of research that systematically examines how to quantify what we call marketing profits.
   This paper builds a formal model of marketing profits. We start by formalizing shopper types, and then establish the implied relationship between accounting profits and marketing profits by examining shelf space allocations by a retailer. On the consumer side, we assume that some consumers pay attention to the assortments offered by different retailers when making their store choice decisions. This assumption allows us to establish the demand-side linkage between accounting profits and marketing profits. Consumer store choice decisions put pressure on the retailer to carry wide assortments in categories which are particularly critical to the store choice decisions of the most desirable consumers. Thus, the allocation of shelf space gives rise to the supply-side linkage between accounting profits and marketing profits. By examining the outcome of the supermarket's shelf space decision, we can merge these two linkages and determine the exact relationship between the accounting and marketing profits.
   Central to our theoretical structure is our assumption on retailers' shelf space allocation decisions. Because of the well-documented pressure that retailers face in making shelf space allocation decisions, we assume that they are acting in a reasonably close-to-optimal fashion by using either an automated planogram or simply by trial-and-error. Optimization requires that returns on shelf space allocated to any category in the store must be identical on the margin and equate to the shadow price of shelf space. It is this outcome of shelf-space allocation that allows us to uncover the implied relationship between accounting and marketing profits.
   This theoretical structure allows us to construct a measure of marketing profits which can be estimated with data commonly available to retailers. We demonstrate this measurement technique by using publicly available data, provided by Marsh Supermarkets, and show how marketing profits can improve merchandising decisions. In our particular application, we find many categories where the marketing profits of a category are very different from the traditional accounting profits. Further, we find that using this new marketing profits metric to make category-level feature advertising space decisions significantly improves the profitability of the retailer. The paper concludes by discussing how our measure of marketing profits might be improved by additional research, particularly if the researcher has data across many stores.

TI "Do the right thing": Diverging effects of accountability in a
   managerial context
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The need to justify one's decisions is a signal characteristic of decision making in a managerial environment. Even chief executives must communicate reasons for their actions. Yet, despite a significant amount of laboratory research on the effects of accountability on decision making, few studies have attempted to assess what affects accountability might have outside the lab for actual managers. In this paper, we use as subjects actual members of the professional account, research, and creative staffs of several advertising agencies in an experimental simulation of an advertising copy meeting. We demonstrate that accountability effects in complex, managerial decision contexts diverge considerably from those found in the lab.
   In particular, we find that accountability does not always lead managers to emphasize the most "objectively" accurate information, but instead can also encourage emphasis on information which is socially acceptable to the manager's key "constituencies" (those to whom they feel accountable, see Tetlock 1991). The social constituencies of accountable managers within a single organization can differ significantly. For example, members of an advertising agency's account service or research departments are Likely to favor the quantitative, analytical. decision styles of their supervisors, while members of the same agency's creative department are likely to favor empathy and personal judgment. Requiring managers with different constituencies to justify their responses can cause "policy bolstering," the tendency to favor a process of decision making particular to one's own constituency. Thus accountability may sometimes make it more difficult for a diverse group to reach a consensus, and may not have the desired positive impact on decision quality.
   In an experiment simulating an advertising copy meeting, we first solicited managers' private judgments of 12 ads, then presented them with research data and asked each of them to make numerical predictions of how much consumers would like each ad. The experiment manipulated the diagnosticity of the available research and the degree to which managers expected to be held accountable for their predictions. We used hierarchical linear regression to analyze the results. Hierarchical linear regression allows us to estimate simultaneously a within-subjects model capturing individual weighting coefficients for private judgment and research, and a between-subjects model of the effects of department membership and experimental conditions on these judgment-policy weights. This analysis also controls for the varying degrees of precision in the within-subjects estimates, as well as for correlations between the within-subjects weighting coefficients.
   Key Findings. 1) Accountability had different impacts on the weighting schemes of members of account services and creative departments. Accountable research/account staff weighed research more in making their predictions than non-accountable research/account staff, Accountable creatives, on the other hand, actually weighed research less than did nonaccountable creatives.
   2) Because accountability caused subjects to attend assiduously to the research, the weight given private judgment reflected whether the data was diagnostic of the problem at hand. Accountable subjects presented with low-diagnosticity research reacted by emphasizing private judgment more heavily.
   3) Accountability increased confidence in predictions; this effect was not dependent on the accuracy of subjects' predictions.
   Managerial Implications. We provide several suggestions and observations regarding current managerial practices, which may improve the impact of individual accountability on decision making.

TI Commercial use of UPC scanner data: Industry and academic perspectives
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The authors report the findings from an exploratory investigation of the use of UPC scanner data in the consumer packaged goods industry in the U.S. The study examines the practitioner community's view of the use of scanner data and compares these views with academic research. Forty-one executives from ten data suppliers, packaged goods manufacturers, and consulting firms participated in wide-ranging, in-person, interviews conducted by the authors. The interviews sought to uncover key questions practitioners would like to answer with scanner data, how scanner data is applied to these questions, and the industry's perspective regarding the success that the use of scanner data has had in each area.
   The authors then compare and contrast practitioners' views regarding the resolution of each issue with academic research. This produces a 2 x 2 classification of each question as "resolved" or "unresolved" from the perspectives of industry and academia. Along the diagonal of the 2 x 2, issues viewed as unresolved by both groups are important topics for future research. Issues deemed resolved by both groups are, correspondingly, of lower priority. In the off-diagonal cells, industry and academics disagree. These topics should be given priority for discussion, information exchange, and possible further research.
   Practitioners reported that scanner data analysis has had the most success and been most widely adopted for decision making in consumer promotions (i.e., coupons), trade promotions, and pricing. For example, legit and regression models applied to scanner data have revealed very low average consumer response to coupons which has directly led to reduced couponing activity. Managers also reported high levels of comfort with and impact from analyses of trade promotions and price elasticities. While industry views most of the issues in these areas to be resolved, academic research raises concerns about a number of practices in common commercial use. These include price threshold analysis and trade promotion evaluation using baseline and incremental sales.
   In product strategy, advertising, and distribution management, practitioners reported that the use of scanner data has had more limited development, success, and impact. In the case of new product decisions, scanner data use has been slow to develop due to the inherent limitations of historical data for these decisions and a heavy reliance on traditional primary research methods. In advertising, scanner data is widely analyzed with models, but confusion among practitioners is very high due to controversies about methods (e.g., what level of data aggregation is best) and conflicting results. In distribution and retail management, scanner data use has tremendous potential but a mixed track record to date. Thus, practitioners view the use of scanner data as unresolved for most issues in product strategy, advertising, and distribution. This view is largely, though not entirely, consistent with academic research, which has only begun to address many of the key questions raised by practitioners.
   In Light of the large number of unresolved issues and mixed record of scanner data use to date, the authors offer a series of specific recommendations for immediate and longterm research priorities that are likely to have the greatest impact on commercial utilization of UPC scanner data. Topics of immediate priority include price thresholds and gaps, baseline and incremental sales, base price elasticity, competitive reactions, measurement of advertising effects, management of brand equity, rationalization of product assortments, and category management. Long-term priorities include a greater emphasis on profitability versus sales or market share, developing prescriptive models versus descriptive models, and the need for industry standards.

TI A decision support system for planning manufacturers' sales promotion
   calendars
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A common event in the consumer packaged goods industry is the negotiation between a manufacturer and a retailer of the sales promotion calendar. Determining the promotion calendar involves a large number of decisions regarding levels of temporary price reductions, feature ads, and in-store displays, each executed at the level of individual retail accounts and brand SKUs over several months or a year. Though manufacturers spend much of their marketing budget on trade promotions, they lack decision support systems to address the complexity and dynamics of promotion planning. Previous research has produced insights into how to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional events, but has not addressed the planning problem in a dynamic environment. This paper develops a disaggregate-level econometric model to capture the dynamics and heterogeneity of consumer response. By modeling the purchase incidence (timing), choice and quantity decisions of consumers we decompose total sales into incremental and nonincremental (baseline plus borrowed).
   The response model forms the basis of a market simulator that permits us to search for the manufacturer's optimal promotion calendar (subject to a set of constraints, some of them imposed by the retailer) via the simulated annealing algorithm. Calendar profits are the net result of the contribution from incremental sales minus the opportunity cost from giving away discounts to nonincremental sales and the fixed costs associated with implementing promotional events (e.g., retagging, features, displays). Incremental sales result from promotion-induced switching, the acceleration and quantity promotion effects on those switchers, increased consumption and the carryover effect from purchase event feedback.
   We applied our approach to the promotion-planning problem of a large consumer-packaged goods company in a nonperishable, staple product category suggested by company executives (canned tomato sauce). Subject to a retailer pass-through constant rate of 80%, provided to us by the collaborating firm, the optimal promotion calendar produced by the modeling system followed a pattern of frequent and shallow temporary price reductions with no feature or display activity. We also analyze how that result would change under different retailer pass-through scenarios.
   Our findings indicated that the manufacturer could substantially improve the profitability of its sales promotion activity and that there would be a concurrent positive effect on retailer profit and volume levels. Management reported to us that the insights from the use of the system were implemented in their promotion-planning process and produced positive results. A validation analysis on follow-up data for one market showed that promotion activity could be significantly reduced, as recommended, with no adverse effect on the brand's market share, as predicted.
   To generalize the model beyond the specific category where it was implemented, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the profile of the calendar (i.e., frequency, depth, and duration of deals) with respect to changes in market response, competitive activity, and retailer pass-through. First, we found that the optimal depth, frequency, and timing of discounts is stable for price elasticities ranging from near zero to around four (in absolute magnitude). We also found no systematic impact of competitive promotions on the profile of the optimal calendar. For example, variation in competitive activity did not affect the optimal depth or frequency of discounts. Lastly, we found changes in retailer pass-through to have a significant effect on the optimal depth and number of weeks of trade promotion that a manufacturer should offer. This emphasizes the importance to manufacturers of having accurate estimates of pass-through for purposes of promotion budgeting and planning.

TI PromoCast (TM): A new forecasting method for promotion planning
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This article describes the implementation of a promotion-event forecasting system, PromoCast(TM) and its performance in several pilot applications and validity studies. Pilot studies involved retail grocery chains with 95 to 185 stores per trading area. The goal was to provide short-term, tactical forecasts useful for planning promotions from a retailer's perspective. Thus, the forecast system must be able to handle any of the over 150,000 UPCs in each store's item master file, and must be scalable to produce approximately 800,000,000 forecasts per year across all the retailers served by efficient marketing services, inc. (ems, inc,). This is a much different task than one that confronts a manufacturer, even one with a broad product line. Manufacturers can benefit from custom modeling in a product Line or category. Retailers need a production system that generates forecasts that help promotion planning. Marketing scientists have typically approached promotion analysis from the manufacturer's perspective. One objective of this article is to encourage marketing scientists to rethink promotion analysis from a different perspective.
   From the retailer's point of view the "planning unit" is the promotion event. Neither weekly store-tracking data nor shopping-trip data from consumer panels are easily aggregated to reflect total sales during a promotion event. We describe the promotion-event databases and the statistical model developed using these databases. The data are the strategic asset. Our goal is to help retailers use their data to increase the profitability of promotions. We have data on the performance of each UPC in each store under a variety of promotion conditions, on each store's adeptness at executing various styles of promotions, as well as on chain-wide historical performance for each UPC. We use many historical averages from these databases to build a 67-variable, regression-style model. The forecast incorporates a simple bias correction needed when using a log-transformed dependent variable (the natural log of total unit sales). We argue that the historical averages matching the planned ad and display conditions provide a benchmark superior to the widely used "base-times-lift" method. When aggregated into case units (the natural unit for product ordering), 69% of the forecasts in our first validation study were within +/- one case compared to 39% within +/- one case using the appropriate historical averages. We report the results of two over-time validity studies that reflect the value of our model for retailers. The limitations and implications of this planning tool for managerial decision making concerning stocking levels are discussed.
   Whenever historical data are the strategic asset we face inherent limitations. Our model does not forecast new products. The forecast error increases when an existing product is promoted in a new way. Over 99.5% of the time, we have full data from which to create a forecast. However, with a database for a typical chain market containing over 20 million promotion events in the 30-month time frame we use, 100,000 events have less than ideal data. The breadth of the database (typically 150,000 UPS) makes it impractical to incorporate data on competitive offerings. We find that regression-style modeling is not adept at incorporating information on the 1,200 subcommodities managed in our pilot stores or the 1,000 manufacturers who supply those stores.
   Despite these limitations we show the value of using promotion-event data, how tactical forecasts based on these data can directly impact the bottom line of grocery retailers, and how store-by-store forecasts can help retailers with problems of running out of stock or overstocking.

TI The dynamic effect of discounting on sales: Empirical analysis and
   normative pricing implications
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Baseline sales measure what retail sales would be in the absence of a promotion (Abraham and Lodish 1993), and models that measure baseline sales are widely used by managers to assess the profitability of promotions (Bucklin and Gupta 1999-this issue). Estimates of baseline sales and promotional response are typically independent of past promotional activity, even though there is evidence to suggest that increased discounting reduces off-promotion sales and increases the percentage of purchases made on deal (e.g., Krishna 1994). As a result, models that do not consider dynamic promotional effects can mislead managers to overpromote. Given the widespread use of "static" models to evaluate the efficacy of promotions, it is particularly desirable to calibrate a dynamic brand sales model and use it to establish an optimal course of action.
   Accordingly, we develop a descriptive dynamic brand sales model and use it to determine normative price promotion strategies. Our descriptive approach consists of estimating a varying-parameter sales response model. Letting model parameters vary with past discounting activity accommodates the possibility that market response changes with firms' discounting policies. In the normative model, we use the estimates obtained in the descriptive model to determine optimal retailer and manufacturer prices over time.
   The results of the descriptive model indicate that promotions have positive contemporaneous effects on sales accompanied by negative future effects on baseline sales. The results of the normative model suggest that the higher-share brands in our data tend to overpromote while the lower-share brands do not promote frequently enough. We project that the use of our model could improve manufacturers' profits by as much as 7% to 31%.
   More generally, the normative results indicate that i) if deals become more effective in the current period, i.e., if consumers are more price sensitive, promotions should be used more frequently; and ii) as the negative dynamic effect of discounts on sales increases, the optimal level of discounting should go down. Without our approach, it would be difficult to make this trade-off exact. Finally, we demonstrate that these dynamic effects provide another perspective to the marketing literature regarding the existence of promotions.

TI The fundamental templates of quality ads
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Creative ideation is a highly complex process, which is difficult to formalize and control. Evidently, even in a complex thinking context certain patterns of creativity may emerge. Relying on such observed patterns may help in "organizing" the creative process by promoting routes that have been proven to lead to productive ideas and avoiding those that do not.
   The present research suggests that successful advertisements share and are characterized by such abstract patterns termed creativity templates. The theoretical rationale for the emergence of such templates and the empirical studies that detect the key creativity templates underlying quality ads indicate that the templates are identifiable, objectively verifiable, and generalizable across multiple categories. Studies 1 and 2 were designed to identify and describe the templates. Six major creativity templates were derived by inference from a sample of 200 highly evaluated print ads drawn from award-winning ad contests such as The One Show (Study 1). Judges found that 89% of the ads could be explained by the six creativity templates. Following a formal description of the templates and their versions, a study comparing 200 award-winning and 200 nonwinning ads (Study 2) is reported. It was found that the two groups differed systematically in the number and distribution of creativity templates: 50% of the award-winning ads as opposed to only 2.5% of the nonwinning ads could be explained by the templates. Further validation of the template approach was obtained by manipulating presence or absence of templates in an experimental setting. In Study 3 groups of individuals were trained in template-based idea generation, an association technique, or not trained at all, prior to an ad-ideation task. Another group subsequently rated the ideas. Findings indicate that a priori knowledge of the templates was associated with the generation of higher quality ads in terms of creativity, brand attitude judgments, and recall (Study 4), with some variation in terms of feeling responses which included humor, emotion, and annoyance.
   The findings of the reported studies and several real-life applications conducted in leading ad agencies, indicate that the template taxonomy is a trainable, resource-saving, and effective tool. It simplifies and improves the decision-making process involved in designing advertising strategies. It can be applied either by hiring trained personnel employed by consulting firms, or by training the agency's own personnel to routinely evaluate past and current ads, and engage in creative activity.
   The template approach represents a step forward in defining a comprehensive model of the antecedents of outcome reactions to advertising stimuli. Improved understanding of the wide spectrum of reactions connecting the basic templates with end-user reactions is likely to be beneficial both for academicians and for practitioners. Such a framework can serve as a basis for a synthesis between the activity of creative professionals whose focal interest is the generation of ads, managers, whose main responsibility is strategy formulation, and academic activity, which focuses mainly on the consumer reaction-end of the advertising process. Hence, in addition to academicians, the relevant target audience is Likely to include a wide array of communication-related personnel such as creative professionals and planners in advertising agencies, consultants, and brand managers.
   In addition, it is postulated that the template taxonomy provides the means to achieve "creativity expertise". Unlike the divergent thinking approaches, in which the required expertise is not necessarily related to the creativity process itself (e.g. individuals can be trained to be better moderators in brainstorming), the creativity template approach is trainable and has the capacity to measure and directly improve creativity outcomes. The template taxonomy facilitates the focused cognitive effort involved in generating new ideas, the capacity to access relevant information, and enables high memorability of the reduced set of information needed to perform the tasks.
   The fact that templates are less transient than the ideas produced does not mean that templates are permanent or that they are insensitive to changes over long term frameworks. Indeed, advertising reflects social norms and trends, and as such, long term social trends are expected to reshape the templates and provide conditions for the evolution of new templates. Nonetheless, the dynamics of template changes are expected to be much slower than the dynamics of changes in ad hoc idea generation.

TI SilverScreener: A modeling approach to movie screens management
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Managing the allocation of shelf space for new products is a problem of significant importance for retailers. The problem is particularly complex for exhibitors-the retailers in the motion picture supply chain-because they face dynamic challenges, given the short Life cycles of movies, the changing level of demand over time, the scarcity of shelf space, and the complex revenue sharing contract between the exhibitor and the distributor. In the face of this complexity, the aim of current research is to provide a structure for analyzing management problems of exhibitors in the movie industry. Using a mathematical programming approach and a fast, but readily accessible algorithm, we propose a decision support model, SilverScreener, whose aim is to help exhibitors make effective and timely decisions regarding theater screens management. The major objective is to help select and schedule movies for a multiple-screens theater over a fixed planning horizon in such a way that the exhibitor's cumulative profit is maximized.
   By treating the multiple screens as parallel machines and the movies as jobs, we provide an analogy of the current problem to the parallel machine scheduling problem. We formulate the resulting problem as an integer program. We depart from the typical parallel machine scheduling problems by introducing the time-indexed formulation that is particularly useful for solving the current problem. An important distinction between the current problem and typical machine scheduling problems is that the present approach allows for the choice of which movies to play; typically, in machine scheduling, all jobs have to be scheduled.
   We provide various analyses of normative versus actual decision making, based on publicly available data. The developed model is readily implementable and appears to lead to improved profitability in different comparative cases. Through sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that the above results are robust to variations in various parameters of the problem. The main findings and insights from the normative policy suggest the following:
   Based on SilverScreener's recommendations, the exhibitor can achieve substantially higher cumulative profit.
   The improvement over actual decisions in terms of profitability appears to result from a combination of better selection and scheduling of the movies.
   The general structure of the exhibitor's normative decision is: choose fewer "right" movies and ran them longer.
   We propose a two-tier integrated application of the model to show how the model can be applied to realistic decision making. The first tier involves development of a movie selection plan to help the manager plan an entire season and bid for movies before the start of that season. An ex ante revenue prediction scheme is developed, based intuitively on a matching of the forthcoming movies with similar movies played in this theater previously. If the forthcoming season's scheduling plan can be visualized as a two-dimensional (week-by-screen) matrix, then that matrix contains only "empty cells" before the first tier. After a bid plan is developed, the exhibitor can "fill" some of those empty cells. The remaining empty cells represent slots, which can be decided during the season by either extending movies the exhibitor booked before the season or by scheduling other movies which may become available later in the season, This motivates the second tier-adaptive scheduling approach-of the integrated approach. The second tier helps the exhibitor in weekly decision making during the season. This application involves "rolling," and updating data, from one time window to another. The approaches followed in the two tiers of the integrated application are quite general in that they can incorporate a sophisticated demand prediction model, managerial judgments, or a combination of both. We also propose an alternative behavioral decision rule (heuristic), which exemplifies relationship dilemmas in the movie industry. This heuristic shows that the exhibitors need to be selective in their choice of movies and may suffer a substantial loss in profitability if they place too much emphasis on accommodating distributors.

TI Development and implementation of a segment selection procedure for
   industrial product markets
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The purpose of this paper is to develop and illustrate a systematic segment selection procedure that models the tradeoffs among evaluation criteria and organizational resource constraints. The target audience for this paper is both managers and academic researchers. For managers, our segment selection procedure provides assistance in formulating new product strategy by creating a common structured framework for understanding and resolving tradeoffs among segment evaluation criteria. For researchers, the procedure addresses an important gap in past segmentation research. The state-of-the-art in segmentation methods provides sophisticated analytic techniques for identifying homogenous groups of customers based on their preferences and optimally allocating resources to any subset of these segments. However, the intermediate decisions, involving how to evaluate the attractiveness of each segment and how to select the appropriate segments to serve such that long-run profitability is maximized subject to firm constraints, continue to be treated in an ad hoc manner. Segment selection is the critical link between the segment formation and resource allocation processes.
   Organizations are made up of people who represent different functional areas that are measured against different goals and performance requirements. Thus, the real challenge in segment selection is developing a model that coordinates resource competitive goals across the functional areas of an organization. Effective segment selection requires integration of the various decision criteria that play interrelated roles in determining product profitability, marketability, and manufacturability. Our research objective is to develop and illustrate a structured segment selection procedure that balances multiple decision criteria, thereby managing organizational diversity of views among key decision makers.
   The segment selection procedure provides a more structured approach to eliciting and explicitly modeling the tradeoffs among the multiple decision criteria. The segment selection procedure is a system of methodologies that identifies and selects market segments and product portfolios such that customer preferences, organizational objectives, and resource constraints are simultaneously satisfied. We employ a multistage research methodology incorporating conjoint analysis, cluster analysis, a product design optimization simulation, and a multiobjective integer programming (MOIP) model. Development of the MOIP model requires balancing the science of mathematical optimization against the art of problem definition and the reality of the implementation context. Our procedure facilitates management involvement in model development and blends managerial intuition with the model solution so that the final solution is optimal for the organization's situation. The segment selection procedure provides a structured method for balancing divergent performance metrics and normatively allocating resources to serve selected segments. Overall, the segment selection procedure combines mathematical modeling methods and managerial wisdom to design a total marketing plan for segmentation.
   Through an illustration in the automotive supply industry, we show that our procedure is an effective approach for integrating marketing, manufacturing, and financial performance information in the segment selection decision process. The segment selection procedure provides a framework for extensive sensitivity analysis of tradeoffs among alternative decision criteria so management can resolve how best to balance its short and long-term goals. This procedure is a generalizable process for systematic planning and winnowing down market opportunities according to carefully defined criteria. Successful implementation of the procedure requires managerial involvement and a blend of science and art. In our illustration, the final solution was a blend that leveraged the structure of the modeling process against the subtlety of the implementation context.

TI Modeling the evolution of markets with indirect network externalities:
   An application to digital television
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The usefulness of a technology product for an end-user often depends on the availability of complementary software products and services. Computers require software, cameras require film, and DVD players require movie programming in order for customers to value the whole product. This phenomenon, where the demand for hardware products is mediated by the supply of complementary software products, is called an indirect network externality. Indirect network externalities create a two-way contingency between the demand for the hardware product and the supply of software products, and result in a strategic interdependence between the actions of hardware manufacturers and the actions of software providers. Indirect network externalities are gaining economic significance in technology markets, because hardware and software are typically provided by independent firms, and both sets of firms have an incentive to free-ride on each others' demand creation efforts. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, it has largely been ignored in the marketing science literature.
   We present a conceptual and operational model for the evolution of markets with indirect network externalities. The key feature of our framework is to model the market-mediated dependence between the actions of hardware manufacturers and software complementers, created by the direct dependence of consumer demand for the whole product on the actions of manufacturers as well as complementors. In addition, we incorporate marketing-mix effects on consumer response, as well as heterogeneity in consumer preferences for hardware and software attributes. We model consumer response using a latent-class choice model. To estimate the complementer response functions, we use a modified Delphi technique that allows us to convert qualitative response data into quantitative response functions. We integrate the consumer and complementer response models to create a simulation model that generates forecasts of market shares and sales volumes for competing technologies, as a function of marketing-mix effects and exogenously specified regulatory scenarios.
   The modeling framework is of interest to new product modelers interested in creating empirical models and decision-support systems for forecasting demand in technology markets characterized by indirect network externalities. The decision-support aspects of the modeling framework should appeal to managers interested in understanding and quantifying the complex interplay between hardware manufacturers and software complementers in the evolution of markets with indirect network externalities.
   We present an application of the modeling framework to the U.S. digital television industry, and use the framework to characterize the competition among analog and digital TV technologies. Our results suggest that complementer actions play an important role in the acceptance of digital TV technologies in general, and high definition television (HDTV) in particular. We find that forecasts that ignore the influence of indirect network externalities would be seriously biased in favor of HDTV. We illustrate how the modeling framework can be used to identify and profile customer segments in the digital TV market based on their utility for hardware-related features as well as programming-related features. We also illustrate the decision-support capabilities of the modeling framework by evaluating the sensitivity of the forecasts to varying marketing, regulatory, and complementer response scenarios. We derive implications for marketing and public affairs policies of the hardware manufacturers.
   The developments in the digital TV industry generally support our finding that HDTV will be a niche product, and will diffuse slower than originally expected due in part to the lack of programming. The delays in the introduction of digital TV to the marketplace also suggest that most forecasts for infrastructure-intensive technologies like digital TV may be too optimistic simply because they underestimate the delays in agreeing upon technology standards and resolving regulatory debates.

TI Risk behavior in response to quotas and contests
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Much of the salesforce compensation literature has focused on developing incentive schemes to maximize effort levels on the part of the salesforce. The amount of effort to expend in the selling task is considered to be the sole decision variable for a sales representative. In this paper, we introduce another key decision variable for a sales representative which is how much risk to undertake in the selling task. In other words, we consider the fact that for a sales representative "riskiness" of performance (e.g., the dispersion of the probability distribution for sales) is often a choice and not a given fate. For example, a sales representative, trying to increase sales, may have the choice of allocating a given amount of effort on the low-risk approach of pursuing a small set of existing customers or incur the same effort on the high-risk option of getting new larger customers to switch from competitors.
   This paper examines how decisions on risk behavior on the part of the sales representatives are influenced by compensation schemes. We show that such decisions are sensitive to the payoff structure when a quota-based or a rank-order contest-based compensation scheme is used. More specifically, we argue that a high quota level or a rank-order contest where only the top few win induce sales representatives to opt for high-risk prospects, whereas a low quota level or a rank-order contest where a high proportion win induce sales representatives to opt for low-risk prospects. This does not stem from any kind of violation of standard expected utility theory but arises from the specific structure of jumps in payoffs. It is not that the inherent risk attitudes of the sales representatives are being altered. Rather, under some quota and contest conditions, a more risky prospect may yield higher expected utility for an inherently risk-averse sales representative while under some other quota and contest conditions, a less risky prospect may lead to a higher expected utility for an inherently risk-seeking sales representative.
   The theoretical propositions are tested in a series of five experiments. The first two experiments test the theoretical results of quota-based compensation. The quota levels are manipulated. Subjects select between segment types where the mean expected sales are the same but the variance varies. The next two experiments test the risk behavior of subjects in contest-based incentive schemes when the proportion of winners in the contest is manipulated. The results provide strong support for our models, with only a few subjects departing from the theoretical predictions. A fifth experiment shows some cognitive response data to explain the behavior that is inconsistent with the theoretical predictions.
   This paper provides implications that are useful for managers who design compensation schemes. A common assumption in most normative models on salesforce compensation is that all sales representatives are either risk averse or risk neutral. This might often lead to the conclusion that sales representatives cannot be expected to engage in highrisk activities in the absence of a risk premium over and above the compensation scheme. While this may be true if sales representatives are facing only a piece-rate compensation plan, it need not be the case when quota-based or contest-based compensation schemes are used. Our results suggest that when the sales quotas are set "high" or if the proportion of winners in a sales contest is "low", sales representatives may engage in high-risk behavior. Alternatively, if the quotas are "low" or the proportion of winners in a sales contest is "high", sales representatives may engage in low-risk prospects. Hence, if a firm would like to dampen highrisk behavior on the part of the salesforce, lowering quota levels or increasing the proportion of winners in sales contests might do so. Similarly, in order to reduce conservatism towards risk, moving up the quota levels or reducing the proportion of winners in sales contests could be useful.
   Our results extend beyond just salesforce management, to any situation where payoffs are based on reaching a certain threshold level in performance or are based on relative performance. For example, similar implications hold in tournaments for promotion to a limited number of top management positions in an organization, influencing the portfolio of R&D managers, and so on.

TI Industrial pricing: Theory and managerial practice
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We organize the existing theoretical pricing research into a new two-level framework for industrial goods pricing. The first level consists of four pricing situations: New Product, Competitive, Product Line, and Cost-based. The second level consists of the pricing strategies appropriate for a given situation. For example, within the new product pricing situation, there are three alternative pricing strategies: Skim, Penetration, and Experience Curve pricing. There are a total of ten pricing strategies included in the framework.
   We then identified a set of cost, product, market, and information conditions which determine what pricing situation(s) a firm is facing as well as which strategies are appropriate within a given situation. Some of these determinant conditions are common to many pricing strategies (e.g., highly elastic demand) while others are unique to a given strategy within a particular pricing situation. For example, within the product line situation, the profitability of supplementary sales is a unique determinant of the Complementary Product pricing strategy (razor-and-blade pricing). Using this framework as a basis for an empirical study, we examined how well current industrial pricing practice matches the prescriptions from the existing research.
   Our sample consisted of 270 respondents (27% response rate). Of these, more than 50% indicated that they used more than one pricing strategy in formulating their most recent pricing decision for a high-value industrial product sold in the United States. As in previous research, Cost-Plus pricing was the most often cited pricing strategy (56% of the respondents).
   Since the respondents were able to indicate their use of more than one pricing strategy, the data are of the "pick k from n" variety. In order to model the managers' pricing strategy choices, we constructed a "stacked" binary legit with a separate observation for each strategy within a given pricing situation. The signs of the determinant variables were estimated as interaction terms.
   The new product pricing strategies (skim, penetration, experience curve) were used for new models in the market. Skim pricing was used in markets with high levels of product differentiation by firms at a cost disadvantage due to scale. penetration pricing was used by firms with a cost advantage due to scale in markets with high level of overall elasticity but low brand elasticity. Experience curve pricing was used for minor innovations by firms with low capacity utilization in markets with a high level of differentiation.
   The competitive pricing strategies (Leader, Parity, and Low-price Supplier) were used in mature markets. Parity pricing was used by firms in a poor competitive situation, i.e., high costs, low market share, low product differentiation. These firms were also unable to take advantage of high levels of elasticity since their capacity utilization was high. In contrast, the low-price supplier strategy was used by firms with low costs due to scale advantages. Since they have low utilization, these firms can take advantage of elastic brand demand. None of the determinants were significantly related to the choice of leader pricing.
   Product line pricing strategies (Bundling, Complementary Product, and Customer Value pricing) were more likely to be used by firms which sell substitute or complementary products. Bundle pricing was used for per-sale/contract pricing in markets with high levels of brand elasticity. Complementary product pricing (razor-and-blade) was used by firms that enjoyed high profitability on its supplementary sales. Using customer value pricing, a firm offers a stripped down version of its current products to appeal to more price sensitive segments or to leverage new distribution channels. This strategy was used to target a narrow segment in high growth markets where price changes are difficult to detect.
   Cost-based pricing was more likely to be used in markets where demand is very difficult to estimate. In such a situation, cost-based pricing makes a great deal of sense.
   In general, the results show that the managers' pricing strategy choices are consistent with normative pricing research. However, questions about how managers combine their strategies to arrive at a final price as well as the organizational influences on pricing strategies remain important areas for future research.

TI Commentary on "Industrial pricing: Theory and managerial practice"
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Noble and Gruca (1999, this issue) provide useful insights into the pricing practices managers employ. Their findings indicate managerial pricing practices are heavily dominated by internal, cost-based approaches. Particularly relevant is the absence of value-based pricing practices.
   Noble and Gruca's findings indicate that the emerging market orientation work has not connected to pricing practice. This work poses a significant challenge for marketing theoreticians and educators: How can managers be helped to move beyond internally focused to externally-customer-focused pricing practice?.

TI The quality double whammy
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This research focuses on how consumers perceive the quality level of a complex stimulus (in our case, a service encounter) and how this perception affects consumers' overall assessment of the quality level of the firm. As such, it should be of interest to consumer behavior theorists as well as to those involved in marketing management issues. We start our presentation by developing a normative Bayesian data integration and updating model somewhat similar to that put forth by Rust et al. (1999). The major constructs of interest in this model are the person's belief about the overall service quality level of a firm and what will happen on the next service encounter. Two major results following from this baseline normative model are that the updated means of these two beliefs are identical to the dynamic updating equations put forth by Boulding et al. (1993), and that an underlying assumption of this model is that consumers form unbiased perceptions of the complex stimulus. Next, based on substantial empirical evidence from the behavioral literature, we incorporate into this baseline model a process by which consumers form nonrandom perceptions. Specifically, we postulate that a person's perception of a complex service encounter is a blend of the objective dimensions of the service encounter and the person's prior overall belief about the quality level of the firm. The relative weights placed on these two factors are determined at least in part by the experience level of the customer and the complexity of the service encounter. We then use this expanded model to compare and test different models of service quality and provide deeper insights into the process by which consumers form perceptions of both the service transaction and the overall service quality level of a firm.
   We test this model using data from two different experiments. In each experiment we manipulate the service provided and the person's initial will and should expectations. Using both obtrusive and unobtrusive measures of the underlying constructs of our model, we employ multiple tests to determine the veracity of our expanded model relative to the baseline model. These tests support the expanded model specification. As found previously, and as predicted by a Bayesian updating process, consumers' prior beliefs influence their cumulative overall opinion of service quality (e.g., Anderson and Sullivan 1993, Bolton and Drew 1991, Boulding et al. 1993, Rust et al. 1999). Perhaps more importantly, these prior beliefs also influence their perceptions of the data themselves, which in turn affect their new (updated) overall opinion. These two different influences of prior beliefs on cumulative evaluations of quality constitute the "double whammy" referred to in the title.
   This double whammy effect has major managerial significance. Specifically, we see from our model development that all activities of a firm will be perceived in light of a person's prior beliefs and that these priors will be double counted relative to our baseline model. Thus, any marketing action taken by a firm will be perceived more positively or negatively depending on the person's prior belief about the quality level of the firm. As such, our model provides a formal explanation for the notion of brand equity as "differential leverage" in marketing activities as proposed by Keller (1993).

TI When and how is the Internet likely to decrease price competition?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Conventional wisdom seems to claim that, by lowering the cost of distribution and by making search easier for consumer, the introduction of the Internet is likely to intensify price competition. This paper intends to challenge this view by asking: When and how is the Internet likely to decrease the level of price competition between firms? To answer this question, we develop an analytic model with the following characteristics. On the demand side, consumers need to gather information on two types of product attributes: digital attributes (which can be communicated on the Web at very low cost) and nondigital attributes (for which physical inspection of the product is necessary). Consumers choose between two brands but are familiar with the nondigital attributes of only the brand purchased on the last purchase occasion. On the supply side, firms use traditional stores and the Internet to inform consumers about their products' attributes and to sell their products. In this setup, we show that the impact of the Internet on competition will be radically different depending on the relative importance of parameters describing the relevant shopping and distribution context. Specifically, we find that the introduction of the Internet might lead to monopoly pricing when (1) the proportion of Internet users is high enough, (2) when nondigital attributes are relevant but not overwhelming, (3) when consumers have a more favorable prior about the brand they currently own, and (4) when the purchase situation can be characterized by "destination shopping". More surprising, we also show that in such cases, the use of the Internet not only leads to higher prices but can also discourage consumers from engaging in search. As such, an important message of the paper is that under some conditions the Internet might represent an opportunity for firms to leverage their brand loyalty and increase their profits.
   The intuition behind our results is the following. The Internet allows consumers to evaluate digital attributes easily, i.e., without visiting the stores. However, nondigital attributes can only be evaluated through physical presence. As such, for goods where both types of attributes are important, the introduction of the Net changes the effective cost of search for consumers. Without the Internet the cost of search is the cost of visiting more than one store. With the introduction of the Net however, nonsearching consumers do not have to undertake the shopping trip at all because they can order products on the Net. Thus, in the presence of the Internet the cost of search is related to the cost of undertaking the entire shopping trip. In the case of destination shopping (i.e. when the fixed cost of undertaking the shopping trip is higher than the cost of visiting an additional store), the presence of the Internet creates higher effective search costs for consumers. Given this shift of paradigm in search costs due to the Internet, consumers may not take the risk of searching for products with better nondigital attributes, but instead, remain with the product they are familiar with. This results in increased consumer loyalty, which induces firms to increase their prices.
   Our results have important managerial implications. First, they provide guidelines for firms on when (i.e. for which product categories) they should consider expanding their distribution network to the Internet. In this respect, an important additional insight of the paper is that the Internet can lower price competition and lead to reduced consumer search even if it is more expensive than the traditional distribution channel. This can easily be the case if distribution through the Internet represents additional costs such as the costs associated with shipping and handling and return policies. Second, the paper also provides guidelines on how to plan the firm's Internet strategy. Interestingly, the results suggest that with the general availability of the Internet the role of stores might actually become more important. While we do not explicitly model a dynamic market, our findings together with Klemperer's (1987) results suggest that stores might have a key role in consumer acquisition, while the Internet can help leverage the acquired customer base through demand fulfillment. This might imply that for certain product categories, firms should actually allocate additional resources to improve their in-store environment when considering the Internet as a complementary distribution channel.

TI The decomposition of promotional response: An empirical generalization
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Price promotions are used extensively in marketing for one simple reason-consumers respond. The sales increase for a brand on promotion could be due to consumers accelerating their purchases (i.e., buying earlier than usual and/or buying more than usual) and/or consumers switching their choice from other brands. Purchase acceleration and brand Switching relate to the primary demand and secondary demand effects of a promotion. Gupta (1988) captures these effects in a single model and decomposes a brand's total price elasticity into these components. He reports, for the coffee product category, that the main impact of a price promotion is on brand choice (84%), and that there is a smaller impact on purchase incidence (14%) and stockpiling (2%). In other words, the majority of the effect of a promotion is at the secondary level (84%) and there is a relatively small primary demand effect (16%).
   This paper reports the decomposition of total price elasticity for 173 brands across 13 different product categories. On average, we find that 25% of the elasticity is due to primary demand expansion (i.e., purchase acceleration) and 75% to secondary demand effects or brand switching. Thus, while Gupta's finding that the majority of promotional response stems from brand switching is supported, the average magnitude of the effect appears to be smaller than first thought. More important, there is ample evidence that promotions have a significant primary demand effect.
   The relative emphasis on purchase acceleration and brand switching varies systematically across categories, and the second goal of the paper is to explain this variation as a function of exogeneous covariates. In doing this, we recognize that promotional response is the consumer's reaction to a price promotion, and therefore develop a framework for understanding variability in promotional response that is based on the consumer's perspective of the benefits from a price promotion. These benefits are posited to be a function of: (i) category-specific factors, (ii) brand-specific factors, and (iii) consumer characteristics. The framework is formalized as a generalized least squares meta-analysis in which the brand's price elasticity is the dependent variable. Several interesting results emerge from this analysis.
   Category-specific factors, brand-specific factors, and consumer demographics explain a significant amount of the variance in promotional response for a brand at both the primary and secondary demand levels.
   Category-specific factors have greater influence on variability in promotional response and its decomposition than do brand-specific factors.
   There are several instances where exogenous variables do not affect total elasticities yet significantly affect individual components of total elasticity. In fact, the lack of a significant relationship between the variables and total elasticity is often due to offsetting effects within two or more of the three behavioral components of elasticity. This is particularly hue for brand-specific factors, which typically have no effect on total elasticity, yet have important effects on the individual behaviors.
   There is some evidence to suggest that not all promotion-related increases in primary demand are due to forward-buying-in some cases promotions appear to increase consumption.
   We use these results to illustrate how category- and brand-specific factors work to drive primary and secondary demand elasticities in different directions.
   In short, this paper offers an empirical generalization of a key finding on promotional response-how elasticities decompose across brand choice, purchase incidence, and stock-piling-and new insights into factors that explain variance in promotional response. These findings are likely to be of interest to researchers who are concerned with theory development and the generalizability of marketing phenomena, and to managers who plan promotion campaigns.

TI The variety of an assortment
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumers rank variety of assortment right behind location and price when naming reasons why they patronize their favorite stores. Consumers care about variety because they are more likely to find what they want when going to a store that offers more varied assortments. When tastes are not well formed or are dynamic, perceived variety matters even more because of the desire to become educated about what is available while maintaining flexibility. Variety perception also matters when the variety-seeking motive operates. Retailers care about variety because customers value variety. Therefore, it is important to understand how people perceive the variety contained in an assortment and how these perceptions influence satisfaction and store choice. Remarkably, except for a recent study by Broniarczyk et al. (1998), there has been no research aimed at understanding the variety perception process itself.
   We offer a general mathematical model of variety based on the complete information structure of an assortment, defined both by the multiattribute structure of the objects and their spatial locations. We impose a psychologically plausible set of restrictions on the general model and obtain a class of simpler estimable models of perceived variety. We utilize the model to develop assortments that vary widely in terms of their information structure and study the influence of three factors on variety perceptions: (a) information structure of each assortment (i.e., the attribute level differences between objects); (b) level of organization of the objects and hence their relative spatial positions; and (c) task orientations, promoting either analytic or holistic processing. We also investigate the influence of variety perception and organization on stated satisfaction and store choice. To summarize our major findings:
   1. Information structure has a big impact on variety perceptions, though diminishing returns accompany increases in the number of attributes on which object pairs differ.
   2. People are more influenced by local information structure (adjacent objects) than nonlocal information structure. Proximity matters.
   3. Organization of the display can either increase or decrease variety perceptions. When people engage in analytic processing, organized displays appear to offer more variety. When processing is holistic, random displays are seen as more varied.
   4. Both variety perceptions and organization drive stated satisfaction and store choice. People are more satisfied with and likely to choose stores carrying those assortments that are perceived as offering high variety and that are displayed in an organized rather than random manner.
   Our work provides a basic framework for thinking about variety. By helping retailers to understand the factors that drive variety perception, it may be possible to design more efficient, lower cost assortments without reducing variety perceptions and the probability of future store visits.

TI Success in high-technology markets: Is marketing capability critical?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We propose a conceptual framework-with the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm as its theoretical underpinning-to explain interfirm differences in firms' profitability in high-technology markets in terms of differences in their functional capabilities. Specifically, we suggest that marketing, R&D, and operations capabilities, along with interactions among these capabilities, are important determinants of relative financial performance within the industry. This paper contributes to the REV literature by proposing the input-output perspective to conceptualize the notion of capabilities. Specifically, this approach entails modeling a firm's functional activities-viz., marketing, R&D and operations-as transformation functions that relate the productive factors/resources to its functional objectives, if the firm were to deploy these resources most efficiently. Any underattainment of the functional objective, then, is attributable to functional inefficiency, or equivalently, to a lower functional capability of the firm. The input-output conceptualization of a firm's capabilities is then estimated using the stochastic frontier estimation (SFE) methodology. SFE provides the appropriate econometric technique to empirically estimate the efficient frontier and hence the level of efficiency achieved by the various firms.
   Our study contributes to a number of Literatures, both methodologically and substantively. First, it contributes both conceptually and methodologically to the REV Literature. Conceptually, our study suggests that firm capabilities can be viewed in an input-output framework. Methodologically, the study suggests the use of stochastic frontier estimation to operationalize and estimate firm capabilities. This methodology is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to allow the researcher/manager to infer capabilities from archival data. Substantively, our study contributes to the literature on market orientation by suggesting that a stronger market orientation of a firm should be reflected in a higher marketing capability. It also adds to the literature on "design for man ufacturability" by explicating the complementarity among the various functional capabilities and offering empirical evidence on their relative importance in influencing a firm's performance. Finally, our study builds on prior literature that has highlighted the importance of marketing-R&D coordination as important determinants of new product development and success. We highlight below some of our main findings.
   A strong base of innovative technologies enhances a firm's sales by favorably influencing consumers' expectations about the externality benefits associated with its product. This suggests that a past track record of consistent innovation is a credible signal to current and potential customers of the firm's continued excellence in a technologically evolving market. Given the importance of influencing customers, managers need to tailor their marketing activities around the need to inform customers of the technological excellence of their firm. Thus, customers need to be informed of the innovative technologies that the firm possesses and of the future R&D initiatives undertaken by it. Similarly, any potential applications of innovative technology developed by the firm, and of technologies under development, should be emphasized.
   Marketing capability has its greatest impact on the (quality-adjusted) innovative output for firms that have a strong technological base. In other words, firms with a strong R&D base are the ones with the most to gain from a strong marketing capability.
   Marketing capability strongly influences the width of applicability of innovations, i.e., a firm's marketing capability enhances its ability to generate innovative technologies that have applications across a range of industries. This result carries a strong message for managers: A strong market orientation is one of the most fertile sources of ideas for innovation. Thus, marketing needs to be involved from the beginning of the innovation process-namely, right at the stage when technological ideas are being generated.
   The most important determinant of a firm's performance is the interaction of marketing and R&D capabilities. This supports the assertion that firms in high-technology markets need to excel at two things: the ability to come up with innovations constantly, and the ability to commercialize these innovations into the kinds of products that capture consumer needs and preferences. This finding offers further evidence on the importance of coordination between R&D and marketing, as suggested in the extant marketing Literature.
   Finally, using archival data, our methodology can be used to benchmark a firm's capabilities, with other firms in the industry, along various functional dimensions. This would be an important step in making more informed resource-allocation decisions. Thus, the firm can spend more money on those capabilities where it most lags the competition, or on those capabilities that are shown to have the maximum impact on firm performance.

TI Why analyst overconfidence about the functional form of demand models
   can lead to overpricing
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Generally, profit predictions are made conditional upon a particular functional form. The typical caveat offered is that this is not the "true" demand model, but is instead some reasonable approximation. We show how the notion of an approximation can be explicitly represented using a random coefficient model. Our model nests the usual situation of complete model certainty as a special case. We go on to show how ignoring the uncertainty in functional form induced by approximation will lead to erroneous pricing decisions that may frequently lead to overpricing.
   For example, an inelastic, double-log demand model implies infinite optimal prices. This is clearly a nonsensical, analyst recommendation. We propose a more general form of the double-log model that allows for high confidence in the observed price range, but incorporates increased uncertainty about the adequacy of the double-log approximation as prices move beyond the observed range. The optimal pricing solutions for this new model are lower than those for the usual case with complete certainty. In fact, we find well-defined optimal pricing solutions even for inelastic double-log demand models. This is a finding of great practical importance, given that aggregate demand models tend to be inelastic for grocery categories, and that log demand models are frequently used (Hoch et al. 1995). We argue that the lack of recognizing uncertainty in the modeling process may partially account for why there is a seeming disparity between observed retail prices and the optimal prices implied by maximizing total category profits using estimated demand models (Little and Shapiro 1980).
   The problems of making optimal pricing decisions using double-log demand models calibrated with store-level scanner data have been recognized. Previous solutions are to constrain the results to achieve reasonable solutions (Reibstein and Gatignon 1984, Montgomery 1997) or to avoid these models altogether in favor of household choice models aggregated to the store-level (Vilcassim and Chintagunta 1995). Our assessment of the problem is that it is not necessarily an issue of model specification, but one of inference. In other words, double-log models fit well, but optimization leads to out-of-range predictions. Our suggestion is that inferences from an estimated demand model need to be approached with some caution. Specifically, uncertainty about predictions will always exist. If this uncertainty is incorporated into models such as the double-log form, then much better inferences can be made. It is our hope that this research will encourage others to think not only about model specification and estimation, but also inference.

TI MDS maps for product attributes and market response: An application to
   scanner panel data
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB There is theoretical and empirical evidence that consumers have limited cognitive resources and thus cannot maintain direct preferences for each choice alternative on the store shelves. Instead, they likely form their overall preferences for choice alternatives by evaluating the attributes describing each item. Rather than mapping the locations of and preferences for all choice alternatives in a multidimensional space, as is the current practice in marketing research, it is insightful to map the locations of and preferences for the attributes consumers use to evaluate the choice alternatives. The model proposed in this study unifies latent class preference models (choice models or conjoint models) with latent class multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis. Dimensional restrictions are imposed on latent class preference models such that the locations of attribute levels and market response parameters can be mapped in reduced-dimension spaces. Interactions between attributes can be graphically examined, which is not feasible with the traditional MDS approach. Also, the effects of price reductions and promotions on the locations of attribute levels can be graphically examined. An empirical application with scanner panel data shows the capabilities and limitations of the proposed model. In addition to the managerial insights provided by the model, it is also much more parsimonious than existing methods, and it forecasts holdout choices significantly better. In the empirical application, a model with two-dimensional attribute maps has 50 fewer parameters than the best unrestricted latent class choice model, yet the fit is comparable. The predictive performance of our model is shown to be superior to that of latent class MDS approaches and latent class conjoint approaches.

TI Research note: Overselling with opportunistic cancellations
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In many business sectors such as airlines, hotels, trucking, and media advertising, customers' arrivals and willingness to pay are uncertain. Managers must decide whether to quote a price low enough to guarantee early sales, or to quote a higher price and risk that some units remain unsold. In allocating capacity, they face a trade-off between two types of potential losses; (1) Yield loss-selling at a low price, and losing a better price later, and (2) Spoilage loss-waiting in vain to sell at a high price, and losing the opportunity of an earlier low price offer. Yield loss means that consumers who value the product most do not get to use it, and spoilage loss means that valuable products are wasted because no consumers get to use them. Sellers typically hedge against the risk of spoilage loss by selling some units early at low prices, and against the risk of yield loss by blocking some units in hope of selling them later at a high price.
   In this paper we show that the use of overselling with opportunistic cancellations can increase expected profits and improve allocation efficiency. Under this strategy, the seller deliberately oversells capacity if high-paying consumers show up, even when capacity is already fully booked. The seller then cancels the sale to some low-paying customers while providing them with appropriate compensation.
   We derive a new rule to optimally allocate capacity to consumers when overselling is used, and show that overselling helps limit the potential yield and spoilage losses. Yield loss is reduced because the seller can capture more high-paying customers by compensating low-paying customers who give up their right to the product. Spoilage loss is reduced because the compensation decreases the price spread perceived by the seller, and as a result, the seller is less anxious to speculate and "block" units. Overselling with opportunistic cancellations assures that the product will be sold to consumers who value it most. This means that "everybody wins", and resources are allocated more efficiently than in conventional selling.

TI Collaborating to compete
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In collaborating to compete, firms forge different types of strategic alliances: same-function alliances, parallel development of new products, and cross-functional alliances. A major challenge in the management of these alliances is how to control the resource commitment of partners to the collaboration. In this research we examine both theoretically and experimentally how the type of an alliance and the prescribed profit-sharing arrangement affect the resource commitments of partners. We model the interaction within an alliance as a noncooperative variable-sum game, in which each firm invests part of its resources to increase the utility of a new product offering. Different types of alliances are modeled by varying how the resources committed by partners in an alliance determine the utility of the jointly-developed new product. We then model the interalliance competition by nesting two independent intra-alliance games in a supergame in which the groups compete for a market. The partners of the winning alliance share the profits in one of two ways: equally or proportionally to their investments. The Nash equilibrium solutions for the resulting games are examined.
   In the case of same-function alliances, when the market is large the predicted investment patterns under both profit-sharing rules are comparable. Partners developing new products in parallel, unlike the partners in a same-function alliance, commit fewer resources to their alliance. Further, the profit-sharing arrangement matters in such alliances-partners commit more resources when profits are shared proportionally rather than equally.
   We test the predictions of the model in two laboratory experiments. We find that the aggregate behavior of the subjects is accounted for remarkably well by the equilibrium solution. As predicted, profit-sharing arrangement did not affect the investment pattern of subjects in same-function alliances when they were in the high-reward condition. Subjects developing products in parallel invested less than subjects in same-function alliance, irrespective of the reward condition. We notice that theory seems to underpredict investments in low-reward conditions. A plausible explanation for this departure from the normative benchmark is that subjects in the low-reward condition were influenced by altruistic regard for their partners. These experiments also clarify the support for the mixed strategy equilibrium: aggregate behavior conforms to the equilibrium solution, though the behavior of individual subjects varies substantially from the norm. Individual-level analysis suggests that subjects employ mixed strategies, but not as fully as the theory demands. This inertia in choice of strategies is consistent with learning trends observed in the investment pattern.
   A new analysis of Robertson and Gatignon's (1998) held survey data on the conduct of corporate partners in technology alliances is also consistent with our model of same-function alliances.
   We extend the model to consider asymmetric distribution of endowments among partners in a same-function alliance. Then we examine the implication of extending the strategy space to include more levels of investment. Finally, we outline an extension of the model to consider cross-functional alliances.

TI Manufacturer-retailer channel interactions and implications for channel
   power: An empirical investigation of pricing in a local market
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The issue of "power" in the marketing channels for consumer products has received considerable attention in both academic and practitioner journals as well as in the popular press. Our objective in this payer is to provide an empirical method to measure the power of channel members and to understand the reasons (demand factors, cost factors, nature of channel interactions) for this power. We confine our analysis to pricing power in channels. We use methods from the game-theory literature in marketing on channel interactions to obtain the theoretical framework for our empirical model This literature provides us a definition of power-one that is based on the proportion (or percentage) of channel profits that accrue to each of the channel members.
   There can be a variety of possible channel interactions between manufacturers and retailers in channels. The theoretical literature has examined some of these games. For example, Choi (1991) examines how channel profits for manufacturers and retailer vary if channel interactions are either vertical Nash, or if they are Stackelberg leader-follower with tither the manufacturer or the retailer being the price leader. Each of these three channel interaction games has different implications for profits made by manufacturers and retailers, and consequently for the relative power of the channel members.
   In contrast to the previous literature that has focused largely on the above three channel interaction games, our model Extends the game-theoretic literature by allowing for a continuum of possible channel interactions between manufacturers and a retailer. Furthermore, for a given product market, we empirically estimate from the data where the channel interactions lie in this continuum. More critically, we obtain measures of how channel profits are divided between manufacturers and the retailer in the product market, where a higher share of channel profit is associated with higher channel power. We then examine how channel power is related to demand conditions facing various brands and cost parameters of various manufacturers.
   In going from game-theory-based theoretical models of channel interactions to empirical estimation, we use the "new empirical industrial organization" framework (Bresnahan 1988). As part of this structural modeling framework, we build retail-level demand functions for the various brands (manufacturer and private label) in a given product category. Given these demand functions, we obtain optimal pricing rules for manufacturers and the retailer. In determining their optimal prices, manufacturers and the retailer account for how all the players in the channel choose their optimal prices. That is, we account for dependencies in decision making across channel members. These dependencies are characterized by a set of "conduct parameters," which are estimated from market data. The conduct parameters enable us to identify the nature of channel interactions between manufacturers and the retailer (along the continuum mentioned previously). In addition to the demand and conduct parameters, manufacturers' marginal costs are also estimated in the model. These marginal cost estimates, along with the manufacturer prices and retail prices available in our dataset, enable us to compute the division of channel profits among the channel members. Hence, we are able to obtain insights into who has pricing power in the channel.
   In the empirical application of the model, we analyze a local market for two product categories: refrigerated juice and tuna. In both categories, there are three major brands. The difference between them is that the private label has an insignificant market share in the tuna category. Our main empirical results show that the usual games examined in the marketing literature do not hold for the given data. We also find that the retailer's market power is very significant in both these product categories, and that the estimated demand and cost parameters are consistent with the estimated pattern of conduct between the manufacturers and the retailer. Given the evidence from the trade press of intense manufacturer competition in these categories, as well as the "commodity" nature of these products, the result of retailer power appears intuitive.

TI A nonparametric approach to identifying latent relationships in
   hierarchical models
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper provides a method for nonparametrically modeling the relationship between consumer preference for product features, such as reliability or durability, and covariates that describe consumers and how they use the product. This relationship is of interest to firms designing and delivering products to a market because the extent to which consumers are sensitive to Particular features determines the potential profitability of product offerings, and affects decisions relating to appropriate distribution outlets and advertising strategies. The successful identification of these relationships also aids in Efficiently targeting marketing activities to specific segments of the consumer population.
   The relationship between consumer preference for product features and observable covariates is important but is typically unknown. In addition, these relationships are often deeply embedded in a model hierarchy and are not observed directly. For example, in models of household choice, the observed outcomes are multinomial with probabilities driven by latent utilities or values that consumers place on the choice alternatives. These utilities are in turn a function of characteristics, such as price and product features, which are differentially valued. Of primary interest is the relationship between consumer sensitivity to product characteristics and readily observed covariates such as household demographics or aspects of product usage. Because the relationships of interest are not directly observed, it is difficult to draw inferences about them without formal statistical models.
   This paper presents a three-level hierarchical Bayes model for modeling binary consumer preferences as a function of observable covariates. The hierarchical model nonparametrically estimates the relationships between consumer preferences for product features and the covariates without assuming a specific functional form. A nonparametric model is particularly useful in the exploratory analysis of consumer data in which the primary purpose of the analysis is to generate further questions rather than provide specific answers to well-posed questions. This type of analysis is frequently encountered in marketing where a series of studies are commissioned to better understand the nature of demand. The first level of the hierarchy in the Bayesian model relates the binary consumer choice to the sensitivities of the consumer to product attributes such as brand name, price, reliability, and durability. The second level of the hierarchy models the heterogeneity across consumers using functions that relate attribute sensitivities to observable covariates. This level of the hierarchy also allows each respondent to have unique demand coefficients by introducing random effect components. The third level of the hierarchy specifies a smoothness prior for each of the unknown functions used in the second level. The approach is flexible and works well both when the unknown function can be closely approximated by a linear function and when it cannot be. A Bayesian model selection technique is used to determine which functions can be modeled using a linear function and which ones should be modeled nonparametrically to provide the necessary flexibility to estimate the function accurately.
   The proposed methodology is illustrated using data from a survey of consumer preferences for features of marine outboard engines that was collected as part of a consulting project. Our analysis focuses on measuring consumer preferences for engine features and their relationships to two variables related to boat length and engine size. Consumer preferences for engine features were obtained through a national survey conducted over the telephone. Preferences were elicited by means of a pairwise evaluation in which respondents chose between two engines that were identical in every respect except for two engine features. The methodology can be modified to allow for more complex comparisons such as conjoint data collected in full profiles.
   The application of a Bayesian model selection procedure indicates that 4 of the 28 covariate relationships in the model are nonlinear, while the other 24 are Linear. The preferences associated with these four functions are involved in 56% of the pairwise comparisons in the study. Therefore, in practice, if the nonlinear functions are not properly estimated there is the potential to draw misleading inferences regarding 56% of the pairwise choices. Firms can use the estimates of the functions relating preferences to covariates in a number of ways. First, they can use the covariates to determine the total number of consumers who have high demand for a particular product feature, and then they can target communication efforts to those individuals. Alternatively, the empirical results can be used as a basis of subsequent analysis to obtain a more complete characterization of a market segment.

TI Price and margin negotiations in marketing channels: An experimental
   study of sequential bargaining under one-sided uncertainty and
   opportunity cost of delay
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Manufacturers and distributors in marketing channels commonly establish prices, margins, and other trade terms through negotiations. These negotiations have significant impact on channel members' profit streams over the duration of the business relationship. We consider a situation where a manufacturer and an exclusive, independent distributor are negotiating the transfer (wholesale) price of a new product. The transfer price should lie between the manufacturer's production cost and the maximum resale price that the distributor can charge end consumers (consumers' reservation price). We assume that the negotiations occur in an incomplete and asymmetric information environment such that the manufacturer is uncertain about the consumers' reservation price, whereas the distributor knows it precisely because of proximity to the consumer. The negotiation is time-sensitive because of the threat of potential competitive entry. Both parties have identical opportunity costs of delay in reaching agreement.
   In this incomplete and asymmetric information environment, the negotiators must learn before they can reach agreement. However, each negotiator has an incentive to convince the other that the available surplus is smaller than it really is. Hence, a high (low) offer (counteroffer) has little credibility without opportunity costs of delay. For any given manufacturer offer, a distributor facing a low consumer reservation price has a small available surplus and therefore more incentive to delay agreement than if the price is high. Willingness to delay agreement and incur delay costs lends credibility to the price signal in an offer (counteroffer), providing a means for communicating credibly and facilitating agreement. Thus, with incomplete, asymmetric information and opportunity costs of delay, a signaling formulation with alternating offers and counteroffers captures key strategic characteristics of marketing channel negotiations.
   We adapt a game-theoretic model (Grossman and Ferry 1986a, 1986b) to predict bargaining behavior and outcomes in this channel negotiation scenario. We derive both point predictions and directional implications from this sequential equilibrium (SE) bargaining model regarding how manufacturer uncertainty about distributor value (consumers' reservation price), opportunity cost of delay, and the actual reservation price (total surplus) should influence bargaining outcomes. The predictions are tested in two experiments. The point predictions serve as benchmarks against which we evaluate the observed bargaining outcomes, as we focus on testing the model's directional implications. We also explore the underlying bargaining process to assess the extent to which subjects conform to the SE signaling rationale in optimizing channel profits.
   Both experiments show that the point predictions of the SE model fall considerably short in describing bargaining behavior and outcomes. The players bargained suboptimally, took longer to agree, and could not extract the total available surplus. Nevertheless, the data are consistent with several directional predictions of the SE model. There is consistent support for the predicted directional effects of manufacturer uncertainty and consumer reservation prices. As expected, high uncertainty impeded efficient negotiation, eliciting high first offers from manufacturers and increasing bargaining duration. Also, higher reservation prices (higher surplus) lowered bargaining duration, increased bargaining efficiency, and raised profits for both parties. However, support for the predicted directional effects of opportunity cost of delay is mixed. Higher delay costs produced quicker agreements, but distributors did not benefit from their informational advantage.
   Although the directional results suggest that the SE model is a good representation of bargaining behavior, a closer analysis shows that the bargaining process data did not correspond to the specific signaling rationale of the SE model. Rather, these data suggest that the bargainers created simplified representations of the price negotiation and used heuristics to develop their offers and counteroffers. We observe two systematic patterns of deviations from the SE model. Some manufacturers may have used the counteroffer levels to infer the distributors' competitive stance and factored this into their responses. Thus, even though the distributor counteroffers carried signals of the consumer reservation price, the manufacturers delayed agreement because they either did not recognize the signal or thought it was unreliable. In other cases, the data are consistent with a simple, nonstrategic model (EMP) in which the manufacturer and the distributor divide the monetary payoff (surplus) equally. The results show that the effectiveness of signaling mechanisms depends not only on the economic characteristics of the bargaining situation, but also on shared individual and social contexts that influence how signals are transmitted and interpreted.

TI Looking for loss aversion in scanner panel data: The confounding effect
   of price response heterogeneity
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Recent work in marketing has drawn on behavioral decision theory to advance the notion that consumers evaluate attributes (and therefore choice alternatives) not only in absolute terms, but as deviations from a reference point. The theory has important substantive and practical implications for the timing and execution of price promotions and other marketing activities.
   Choice modelers using scanner panel data have tested for the presence of these "reference effects" in consumer response to an attribute such as price. In applications of the theory of reference-dependent choice (Tversky and Kahneman 1991), some modelers report empirical evidence of loss aversion: When a consumer encounters a price above his or her Established reference point (a "loss"), the response is greater than for a price below the reference point (a "gain"). Researchers have gone so far as to suggest that evidence for the so-called reference effect make it an empirical generalization in marketing (e.g., Kalyanaram and Winer 1995, Meyer and Johnson 1995). I
   It is our contention that the measurement of loss aversion in empirical applications of the reference-dependent choice model is confounded by the presence of unaccounted-for heterogeneity in consumer price responsiveness. Our reasoning is that the kinked price response curve implied by loss aversion is confounded with the slopes of the response curves across segments that are differentially responsive to price. A more price-responsive consumer (with a steeper response function) tends to have a lower price level as a reference point. This consumer faces a larger proportion of prices above his reference point, thus the response curve is steeper in the domain of losses. Similarly, the less price-responsive consumer sees a greater proportion of prices below his reference point, so the response curve is less steep within the domain of gains. As a result, any cross-sectional estimate of loss aversion that does not take this into account will be biased upward-researchers who do not control for heterogeneity in price responsiveness may arrive at incorrect substantive conclusions about the phenomenon. It is interesting to note that in this instance, failure to control for heterogeneity induces a bias in favor of finding an effect, rather than the more typical ease of attenuation of the effect toward zero.
   We first test our assertion regarding the reference-dependent model using scanner panel data on refrigerated orange juice and subsequently extend this analysis to 11 additional product categories. In all cases we find, as predicted, that accounting for price-response heterogeneity leads to lower and frequently nonsignificant estimates of loss aversion. We do, however, find some categories in which the effect does not disappear altogether. We also estimate loss aversion using a "sticker shock" model of brand choice in which the reference prices are brand-specific. In line with the results of the majority of prior literature, we find smaller and insignificant estimates of loss aversion in this model. We show that this is because in the sticker shock model, there is no apparent correlation between the price responsiveness of the consumer and the representation of reference effects as losses or gains. Our findings strongly suggest that loss aversion may not in fact be a universal phenomenon, at least in the context of frequently purchased grocery products.

TI Markets for product modification information
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB An important product strategy for firms in mature markets is value-adding modifications to existing products. Marketing information that reveals consumers' preferences, buying habits, and lifestyle is critical for the identification of such product modifications. We consider two types of value-adding modifications that are often facilitated by marketing information: retention-type modifications that increase the attractiveness of a product to a firm's loyal customers, and conquesting-type modifications that allow a firm to increase the appeal of its product to a competitor's loyal customers. We examine two aspects of the markets for product modification information: (1) the manner in which retention and conquesting modifications affect competition between downstream firms, and (2) the optimal selling and pricing policies for a vendor who markets product modification information. We consider several aspects of the vendor's contracting problem, including how a vendor should package and target the information to the downstream firms and whether the vendor should limit the type of information that is sold. This research also examines when a vendor can gain by offering exclusivity to a firm.
   We address these issues in a model consisting of an information vendor facing two downstream firms that sell differentiated products. The model analyzes how information contracting is affected by differentiation in the downstream market and the quality of the information (in terms of how "impactful" the resulting modifications are). We analyze two possible scenarios. In the first, the information facilitates modifications that increase the appeal of products to the loyal customers of only one of the two downstream firms (i.e., one-sided information). In the second scenario, the information facilitates modifications that are attractive to the loyal consumers of both the firms (i.e., two-sided information).
   The effect of modifications on downstream competition depends on whether they are of the retention or the conquesting type. A retention-type modification increases the "effective" differentiation between the firms and softens price competition. Conquesting modifications, however, have benefits as well as associated costs. A conquesting modification of low impact reduces the "effective" differentiation between competing products and leads to increased price competition. However, when conquesting modifications are of sufficiently high impact, they also have the benefit of helping a firm to capture the customers of the competitor.
   The vendor's strategy for one-sided information always involves selling to one firm, the firm for which the modifications are of the retention type. When the identified modifications are of low impact, this result is expected because conquesting modifications are profit-reducing for downstream firms. However, even when the information identifies high-impact modifications (and positive profits are generated by selling the information as conquesting information), the vendor is strictly better off by targeting his information to the firm for which the modification is the retention type. With two-sided information, the equilibrium strategy is for the vendor to sell the complete packet of information (information on both retention and conquesting modifications) to both downstream firms. However, in equilibrium, both firms only implement retention-type modifications. The information on conquesting modifications is "passive" in the sense that it is never used by downstream firms. Yet the vendor makes strictly greater profit by including it in the packet. This obtains because the price charged for information depends critically on the situation an individual firm encounters by not buying the information. The presence of conquesting information in the packet puts a nonbuyer in a worse situation, and this underlines the "passive power of information." The vendor gains by including the conquesting information even though it is not used in equilibrium.

TI MOVIEMOD: An implementable decision-support system for prerelease market
   evaluation of motion pictures
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In spite of the high financial stakes involved in marketing new motion pictures, marketing science models have not been applied to the prerelease market evaluation of motion pictures. The motion picture industry poses some unique challenges. For example, the consumer adoption process for movies is very sensitive to word-of-mouth interactions, which are difficult to measure and predict before the movie has been released. In this article, we undertake the challenge to develop and implement MOVIEMOD-a prerelease market evaluation model for the motion picture industry. MOVIEMOD is designed to generate box-office forecasts and to support marketing decisions for a new movie after the movie has been produced (or when it is available in a rough cut) but before it has been released. Unlike other forecasting models for motion pictures, the calibration of MOVIEMOD does not require any actual sales data. Also, the data collection time for a product with a limited lifetime such as a movie should not take too long. For MOVIEMOD it takes only three hours in a "consumer clinic" to collect the data needed for the prediction of box-office sales and the evaluation of alternative marketing plans.
   The model is based on a behavioral representation of the consumer adoption process for movies as a macroflow process. The heart of MOVIEMOD is an interactive Markov chain model describing the macro-flow process. According to this model, at any point in time with respect to the movie under study, a consumer can be found in one of the following behavioral states: undecided, considerer, rejecter, positive spreader, negative spreader, and inactive. The progression of consumers through the behavioral states depends on a set of movie-specific factors that are related to the marketing mix, as well as on a set of more general behavioral factors that characterize the movie-going behavior in the population of interest. This interactive Markov chain model allows us to account for word-of-mouth interactions among potential adopters and several types of word-of-mouth spreaders in the population. Marketing variables that influence the transitions among the states are movie theme acceptability, promotion strategy, distribution strategy, and the movie experience. The model is calibrated in a consumer clinic experiment. Respondents fill out a questionnaire with general items related to their movie-going and movie communication behavior, they are exposed to different sets of information stimuli, they are actually shown the movie, and finally, they fill out postmovie evaluations, including word-of-mouth intentions. These measures are used to estimate the word-of-mouth parameters and other behavioral factors, as well as the movie-specific parameters of the model.
   MOVIEMOD produces forecasts of the awareness, adoption intention, and cumulative penetration for a new movie within the population of interest for a given base marketing plan. It also provides diagnostic information on the likely impact of alternative marketing plans on the commercial performance of a new movie. We describe two applications of MOVIEMOD: One is a pilot study conducted without studio cooperation in the United States, and the other is a full-fledged implementation conducted with cooperation of the movie's distributor and exhibitor in the Netherlands. The implementations suggest that MOVIEMOD produces reasonably accurate forecasts of box-office performance. More importantly, the model offers the opportunity to simulate the effects of alternative marketing plans. In the Dutch application, the effects of extra advertising, extra magazine articles, extra TV commercials, and higher trailer intensity (compared to the base marketing plan of the distributor) were analyzed. We demonstrate the value of these decision-support capabilities of MOVIEMOD in assisting managers to identify a final plan that resulted in an almost 50% increase in the Lest movie's revenue performance, compared to the marketing plan initially contemplated. Management implemented this recommended plan, which resulted in bur-office sales that were within 5% of the MOVIEMOD prediction. MOVIEMOD was also tested against several benchmark models, and its prediction was better in all cases.
   An evaluation of MOVIEMOD jointly by the Dutch exhibitor and the distributor showed that both parties were positive about and appreciated its performance as a decision-support tool. In particular, the distributor, who has more stakes in the domestic performance of its movies, showed a great interest in using MOYIEMOD for subsequent evaluations of new movies prior to their release. Based on such evaluations and thr initial validation results, MOVIEMOD can fruitfully (and inexpensively) be used to provide researchers and managers with a deeper understanding of the factors that drive audience response to new motion pictures, and it can be instrumental in developing other decision-support systems that can improve the odds of commercial success of new experiential products.

TI The impact of discrete bidding and bidder aggressiveness on sellers'
   strategies in open English auctions: Reserves and covert shilling
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In practice, the rules in most open English auctions require participants to raise bids by a sizeable, discrete amount. Furthermore, some bidders are typically more aggressive in seeking to become the "current bidder" during competitive bidding. Most auction theory, however, has assumed bidders can place any tiny "continuous" bid increase, and recommend as optimal the tiniest possible increase.
   This article examines how incorporating discrete bidding and bidder aggressiveness affect optimal strategies for an important decision for auction sellers, which is setting the lowest acceptable bid at which to sell the property. We investigate two alternative methods sellers often use to enforce this decision. These are setting an irrevocable reserve before the auction, and covert shilling, where the seller or confederates pose as bona fide bidders and raise bona fide bids, unsuspected by bidders. These optimal strategies interest auction participants, especially sellers who must recognize the bidding rules and bidder aggressiveness they will encounter in actual auctions. We also examine how these strategies change with the auction context, such as the number of bidders, and how they differ from corresponding strategies already identified for continuous bidding. Our model examines open English auctions where bidders have independent, private valuations. We find that discrete bidding does affect these strategies, as does the aggressiveness of the bidder with the highest valuation, relative to the average aggressiveness of all other remaining bidders.
   We identify the seller's optimal discrete reserve, and show that if the highest valuator is relatively more (less) aggressive, this increases (decreases) from the optimal continuous reserve, and also increases (decreases) as the number of bidders increases. With continuous bidding, by contrast, this reserve is invariant to the number of bidders. As this bidder becomes relatively more aggressive, for a given number of bidders, the optimal discrete reserve increases, while as he or she becomes less aggressive, the seller's expected auction utility increases, which increases the set of auctions where discrete bidding generates higher seller welfare than continuous.
   We propose a covert shilling model that requires shilling sellers, and any confederates and auctioneers, to outwardly act no differently than with reserves, to avoid detection. We identify cases where the seller optimally shills once the bona fide bidding has stopped, and identify the corresponding optimal point to stop shilling and accept the next bona fide bid, if offered. This stopping point does not depend on where bona fide bidding stops, or aggressiveness, or the number of bidders, or on whether shill bids alternate with bona fide bids or are consecutively entered. We also find that the optimal lowest acceptable bid with shilling can be higher (lower) than that with reserves if the highest valuator is sufficiently un-aggressive (aggressive). By comparison, in continuous bidding shilling and reserves yield identical lowest acceptable bids.
   Sometimes the seller using a shilling strategy optimally should not shill at all, and instead accept the bid where buna fide bidding stops. This can occur when that bid, or the number of bidders, is sufficiently high, or when the highest valuator is as, or less, aggressive than other bidders. Optimal shilling can be as practical to implement as reserves, because it does not require sellers to have any information beyond that needed in a reserve auction.
   If sellers shill optimally, they can never be worse off compared to using a reserve, and can be better off. Shilling can make bidders worse off, but can also make them better off when the seller using a shilling strategy optimally accepts bids below the optimal reserve, in these latter cases, shilling Pareto dominates reserves, ex ante.
   We provide numerical examples to illustrate these results. We discuss how our results might be affected if shilling is not covert, or bidders' valuations have a common value component rather than being independent, or by the rules used in many discrete bid Internet auctions.

TI Accurate retail testing of fashion merchandise: Methodology and
   application
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In a merchandise depth test, a retail chain introduces new products at a small sample of selected stores for a short period prior to the primary selling season and uses the observed sales to forecast demand for the entire chain. We describe a method for resolving two key questions in merchandise testing: (1) which stores to use for the test and (2) how to extrapolate from test sales to create a forecast of total season demand for each product for the chain. Our method uses sales history of products sold in a prior season, similar to those to be tested, to devise a testing program that would have been optimal if it had been applied to this historical sample. Optimality is defined as minimizing the cost of conducting the test, plus the cost of over- and understocking of the products whose supply is to be guided by the test.
   To determine the best set of test stores, we apply a k-median model to cluster the stores of the chain based on a store similarity measure defined by sales history, and then choose one test store from each cluster. A linear programming model is used to fit a formula that is then used to predict total sales from test sales.
   We applied our method at a large retailer that specializes in women's apparel and at two major shoe retailers, comparing results in each case to the existing process used by the apparel retailer and to some standard statistical approaches such as forward selection and backward elimination. We also tested a version of our method in which clustering was based on a combination of several store descriptors such as location, type of store, ethnicity of the neighborhood of location, total store sales, and average temperature of the store location. We found that relative to these other methods, our approach could significantly improve forecasts and reduce markdowns that result from excessive inventory, and lost margins resulting from stockouts. At the apparel retailer the improvement was enough to increase profits by more than 100%.
   We believe that one reason our method outperforms the forward selection and backward elimination methods is that these methods seek to minimize squared errors, while our method optimizes the true cost of forecast errors. In addition, our approach, which is based purely on sales, outperforms descriptor variables because it is not always clear which are the best store descriptors and how best to combine them. However, the sales-based process is completely objective and directly corresponds to the retailer's objective of minimizing the understock and overstock costs of forecast error. We examined the stores within each of the clusters formed by our method to identify common factors that might explain their similar sales patterns. The main factor was the similarity in climate within a cluster. This was followed by the ethnicity of the neighborhood where the store is located, and the type of store. We also found that, contrary to popular belief, store size and location had little impact on sales patterns.
   In addition, this technique could also be used to determine the inventory allocation to individual stores within a cluster and to minimize lost demand resulting from inaccurate distribution across size. Finally, our method provides a logical framework for implementing micromerchandising, a practice followed by a significant number of retailers in which a unique assortment of merchandise is offered in each store (or a group of similar stores) tuned to maximize the appeal to customers of that store. Each cluster formed by our algorithm could be treated as a "virtual chain" within the larger chain, which is managed separately and in a consistent manner in terms of product mix, timing of delivery, advertising message, and store layout.

TI Parallel imports: Challenges from unauthorized distribution channels
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We examine the problem of parallel imports: unauthorized flows of products across countries, which compete with authorized distribution channels. The traditional economics model of a discriminating monopolist that has different prices for the same good in different markets requires the markets to be separated in some way, usually geographically. The profits from price discrimination can be threatened by parallel imports that allow consumers in the high-priced region some access to the low-priced marketplace. However, as this article shows, there is a very real possibility that parallel imports may actually increase profits.
   The basic intuition is that parallel importation becomes another channel for the authentic goods and creates a new product version that allows the manufacturer to price discriminate. We propose a two-country, three-stage model to quantitatively study the effects and strategies. In the third stage, and in the higher priced country where parallel imports have entered, we characterize the resulting market seg mentation. One segment of consumers stays with the authorized version as they place more value on the warranty and services that come with the authorized version. Another segment switches to parallel imports because a lower price is offered due to lack of country-specific features or warranties. Parallel imports also generate a third and new segment that would not have bought this product before. Unlike counterfeits that are fabricated by imitators, all parallel imports are genuine and sourced from the manufacturer in the lower-priced country through authorized dealers. Therefore, the manufacturer's global sales quantity should increase, but profit may rise or fall depending on the relative sizes and profitability of the segments. A profit-maximizing parallel importer should set price and quantity in the second stage after observing the manufacturer's prices in both countries. There will be a threshold of across-country price gap above which parallel imports would occur. In the first stage, the manufacturer can anticipate the possible occurrence of a parallel import, its price and quantity, and its effect on authorized sales in each country to make a coordinated pricing decision to maximize the global supply chain profit. Under some circumstances the manufacturer should allow parallel imports and under others should prevent them. Through a Stackelberg game we solve for the optimal pricing strategy in each scenario. We then find in one extension that when the number of parallel importers increases, the optimal authorized price gap should narrow, but the prices and quantities of parallel imports may rise or fall. In another extension, we find that when the manufacturer has other means-such as monitoring dealers, differentiating designs, and unbundling warranties-to contain parallel imports, the authorized price gap can widen as a function of the effectiveness of non-pricing controls.
   In summary, parallel imports may help the manufacturer to extend the global reach of its product and even boost its global profit. If the manufacturer offers a discount version through its authorized dealers, it is running a high risk of confusing customers and tarnishing brand images. Parallel imports may cause similar concerns for the manufacturer, but unauthorized dealers are perceived as further removed from the manufacturer. Therefore, there is less risk of confusing consumers when parallel imports are channeled through unauthorized dealers. Furthermore, they are more nimble in diverting the product whenever their transshipment and marketing costs are small enough not to offset the authorized price gap and the valuation discount. This may explain why some manufacturers fiercely fight parallel imports, while others knowingly use this alternative channel.

TI Eye fixations on advertisements and memory for brands: A model and
   findings
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The number of brands in the marketplace has vastly increased in the 1980s and 1990s, and the amount of money spent on advertising has run parallel. Print advertising is a major communication instrument for advertisers, but print media have become cluttered with advertisements for brands. Therefore, it has become difficult to attract and keep consumers' attention. Advertisements that fail to gain and retain consumers' attention cannot be effective, but attention is not sufficient: Advertising needs to leave durable traces of brands in memory. Eye movements are eminent indicators of visual attention. However, what is currently missing in eye movement research is a serious account of the processing that takes place to store information in long-term memory. We attempt to provide such an account through the development of a formal model. We model the process by which eye fixations on print advertisements lead to memory for the advertised brands, using a hierarchical Bayesian model, but, rather than postulating such a model as a mere data-analysis tool, we derive it from substantive theory on attention and memory. The model is calibrated to eye-movement data that are collected during exposure of subjects to ads in magazines, and subsequent recognition of the brand in a perceptual memory task. During exposure to the ads we record the frequencies of fixations on three ad elements; brand, pictorial and text and, during the memory task, the accuracy and latency of memory. Thus, the available data for each subject consist of the frequency of fixations on the ad elements and the accuracy and the latency of memory. The model that we develop is grounded in attention and memory theory and describes information extraction and accumulation during ad exposure and their effect on the accuracy and latency of brand memory. In formulating it, we assume that subjects have different eye-fixation rates for the different ad elements, because of which a negative binomial model of fixation frequency arises, and we specify the influence of the size of the ad elements. It is assumed that the number of fixations, not their duration, is related to the amount of information a consumer extracts from an ad. The information chunks extracted at each fixation are assumed to be random, varying across ads and consumers, and are estimated from the observed data. The accumulation of information across multiple fixations to the ad elements in long-term memory is assumed to be additive. The total amount of accumulated information that is not directly observed but estimated using our model influences both the accuracy and latency of subsequent brand memory. Accurate memory is assumed to occur when the accumulated information exceeds a threshold that Varies randomly across ads and consumers in a binary probit-type of model component. The effect of two media-planning variables, the ad's serial position in a magazine and the ad's location on the double page, on the brand memory threshold are specified. We formulate hypotheses on the effects of ad element surface, serial position, and location.
   The model is applied in a study involving a sample of 88 consumers who were exposed to 65 print ads appearing in their natural context in two magazines. The frequency of eye fixations was recorded for each consumer and advertisement with infrared eye-tracking methodology. In a subsequent indirect memory task, consumers identified the brands from pixelated images of the ads. Across the two magazines, fixations to the pictorial and the brand systematically promote accurate brand memory, but text fixations do not. Brand surface has a particularly prominent effect. The more information is extracted from an ad during fixations, the shorter the latency of brand memory is. We find a systematic recency effect: When subjects are exposed to an ad later, they tend to identify it better. In addition, there is a small primacy effect. The effect of the ad's location on the right or left of the page depends on the advertising context. We show how the model supports advertising planning and testing and offer recommendations for further research on the effectiveness of brand communication. In future research the model may be extended to accommodate the effects of repeated exposure to ads, to further detail the representation of strength and association of memory, and to include the effects of creative tactics and media planning variables beyond the ones we included in the present study.

TI Market entry strategy under firm heterogeneity and asymmetric payoffs
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB How should a firm decide whether or not to enter an untested market when a competing firm is vying for the same market? Should a firm always speed to the market in an effort to capitalize on pioneering advantages? We address those questions by developing a simple game-theoretical model that captures the most essential factors ina firm's market entry decision, such as market uncertainty, firm heterogeneity, competition, cannibalization, and order-of-entry effects.
   Our analysis shows that in a competitive context, both pioneering advantages and laggard's disadvantages can motivate a firm to speed to an untested market. Therefore, pioneering advantages alone are not an adequate guide for a firm to formulate its market entry strategy. The optimal decision may call for a firm to be a prudent laggard when pioneering advantages to the firm are substantial, or to become a market pioneer when facing pioneering disadvantages. We characterize different patterns of market entry as equilibrium outcomes for different configurations of the market reward structure and offer a conceptual framework for formulating market entry strategies that go beyond the conventional dichotomy: speed or wait. We show that the paradoxical phenomenon of "disadvantaged pioneers" can arise in a competitive context as the outcome of rational firms making rational choices.
   To show that pioneering advantages alone are not the right litmus test for market entry decisions, we apply our general framework to a concrete case where consumer preference or the premium that consumers are willing to pay for the pioneering brand gives rise to pioneering advantages and laggard's disadvantages. We conclude that the firm with a larger pioneering premium may choose to wait, while a firm with a smaller pioneering premium speeds to the market.
   Our analysis also sheds light on empirical research on pioneering advantages. Because firms may race into a market solely to avoid laggard's disadvantages rather than to capture pioneering advantages, pioneers are not necessarily the firms best positioned to establish, exploit, and maintain pioneering advantages. Therefore, it is not surprising that a significant percentage of pioneers fail, as documented by recent empirical research. Our normative investigation further suggests that this predicament in empirical research will not disappear even if we have complete data, use the right measurements, and employ perfect statistical techniques. Therefore, it is perhaps more fruitful to redirect our research effort in the search for pioneering advantages.
   Finally, we extend our analysis to incorporate the effect of cannibalization on an incumbent firm's market entry strategy. We conclude that cannibalization can motivate an incumbent firm to wait, as the conventional wisdom suggests, but it can also be an impetus for a firm to become a market pioneer. We offer supporting evidence for our analysis and discuss managerial implications of our conclusions.

TI A hierarchical Bayesian methodology for treating heterogeneity in
   structural equation models
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Structural equation models are widely used in marketing and psychometric literature to model relationships between unobserved constructs and manifest variables and to control for measurement error. Most applications of structural equation models assume that data come from a homogeneous population. This assumption may be unrealistic, as individuals are likely to be heterogeneous in their perceptions and evaluations of unobserved constructs. In addition, individuals may exhibit different measurement reliabilities. It is well-known in statistical literature that failure to account for unobserved sources of individual differences can result in misleading inferences and incorrect conclusions.
   We develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for modeling general forms of heterogeneity in partially recursive structural equation models. Our framework elucidates the motivations for accommodating heterogeneity and illustrates theoretically the types of misleading inferences that can result when unobserved heterogeneity is ignored. We describe in detail the choices that researchers can make in incorporating different forms of measurement and structural heterogeneity. Current random-coefficient models in psychometric literature can accommodate heterogeneity solely in mean structures. We extend these models by allowing for heterogeneity both in mean and covariance structures. Specifically, in addition to heterogeneity in measurement intercepts and factor means, we account for heterogeneity in factor covariance structure, measurement error, and structural parameters. Models such as random-coefficient factor analysis, random-coefficient second-order factor analysis, and random-coefficient, partially recursive simultaneous equation models are special cases of our proposed framework. We also develop Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures to perform Bayesian inference in partially recursive, random-coefficient structural equation models. These procedures provide individual-specific estimates of the factor scores, structural coefficients, and other model parameters.
   We illustrate our approach using two applications. The first application illustrates our methods on synthetic data, whereas the second application uses consumer satisfaction data involving measurements on satisfaction, expectation disconfirmation, and performance variables obtained from a panel of subjects. Our results from the synthetic data application show that our Bayesian procedures perform well in recovering the true parameters. More importantly, we find that models that ignore heterogeneity can yield a severely distorted picture of the nature of associations among variables and can therefore generate misleading inferences. Specifically, we find that ignoring heterogeneity can result in inflated estimates of measurement reliability, wrong signs of factor covariances, and can yield attenuated model fit and standard errors. The results from the consumer satisfaction study show that individuals vary both in means and covariances and indicate that conventional psychometric methods are not appropriate for our data. In addition, we find that heterogeneous models outperform the standard structural equation model in predictive ability. Managerially, we show how one can use the individual-level factor scores and structural parameter estimates from the Bayesian approach to perform quadrant analysis and refine marketing policy (e.g., develop a one-on-one marketing policy).
   The framework introduced in this paper and the inference procedures we describe should be of interest to researchers in a wide range of disciplines in which measurement error and unobserved heterogeneity are problematic. In particular, our approach is suitable for studies in which panel data or multiple observations are available for a given set of respondents or objects (e.g., firms, organizations, markets). At a practical level, our procedures can be used by managers and other policymakers to customize marketing activities or policies.
   Future research should extend our procedures to deal with the general nonrecursive structural equation model and to handle binary and ordinal data situations.

TI Experimental evidence for agency models of salesforce compensation
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Academic work on sales compensation plans features agency models prominently, and these models have also been used to build decision aids for managers. However, empirical support remains sketchy. We conducted three experiments to investigate three unresolved predictions involving the incentive-insurance trade-off posited in the model. First, compensation should be less incentive loaded with greater effort-output uncertainty so as to provide additional insurance to a risk-averse agent. Second, flat wages should be used for verifiable effort so as to avoid unnecessary incentives. Third, less incentive-loaded plans should be used with more risk-averse agents so as to provide additional insurance.
   Our design implemented explicit solutions from a specific agency model, which offers greater internal validity, compared to extant laboratory designs that either did not implement explicit solutions or excluded certain parameters. In Experiment I, data from working manager subjects supported the first prediction but only when risk-averse agents undertook nonverifiable effort. We interpret this as disclosing the model's "core" circumstance, wherein it orders the data when the incentive-insurance trade-off is relevant. Thus, when verifiable effort made incentives moot, as is the case for the second prediction, the model failed to order the data.
   Building on these results, we reasoned that the third prediction should find support among risk-averse agents but not among risk-neutral agents, because insurance is a moot point with the latter agents. To this end, we added risk-neutral utility functions for agents in Experiment II. Data from MBA-candidate student subjects supported the predictions, but only when risk-averse agents undertook nonverifiable effort. In those cells in which the incentive-insurance trade-off was moot (either because of risk-neutrality or else verifiability), the data did not support the predictions.
   We confronted several validity threats to these results. To begin, Experiment I used the standard agency solution, which equalizes an agent's expected utility from the predicted plan with his expected utility from rejecting it. Subjects might have broken these ties on such grounds as fairness. To assess whether this confounded the results, we derived new solutions in Experiment II that broke ties in favor of the predicted plan (by a 10% margin in the expected utility). Our results were robust to this change.
   Second, our agents' behavior in Experiments I and II was much more consistent with predictions, compared to the principals' behavior, which brought up task comprehension as a validity threat because our principals faced a more complex experimental task than the agents. To address this threat, we used three decision rounds in Experiment III to reduce the principals' task comprehension problems. A related validity threat arose from the relatively small gap in some cells between a principal's predicted expected utility and the principal's next best choice. To address this threat, we derived new solutions with larger gaps to make the principal's choices "easier." The results were again robust to these changes, which removes these validity threats.
   We also addressed two alternative explanations. Might principals be predisposed to pick salary plus commission plans regardless of the model's predictions? If so, we should find such plans chosen uniformly across different experimental conditions. Pooling the data from our three experiments, we rejected this predisposition explanation by finding variation that was more consistent with treatment differences across cells. Second, might agents choose higher effort levels because of a demand bias? If so, we should find agents picking high effort regardless of the plan actually offered to them.
   Using pooled data, we rejected this explanation by finding variation that was more consistent with a utility-maximizing reaction to the plan actually offered to them. Finally, we included manipulation checks to assess whether principals and agents perceived experimental stimuli identically, as per the "common knowledge" assumption in game theory. These data showed no differences between agents' and principals' perceptions of stimuli.
   Our experiments move the literature from simply asking whether the model works to pinpointing the circumstances in which it orders behavior. The primary stylized fact we uncovered is the persistent and striking lack of support for the agency model outside of the circumstance in which risk-averse agents undertake nonverifiable effort. The model's failure when there is no material insurance-incentive tradeoff deserves scrutiny in future work.

TI New product diffusion acceleration: Measurement and analysis
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB It is a popular contention that products launched today diffuse faster than products launched in the past. However, the evidence of diffusion acceleration is rather scant, and the methodology used in previous studies has several weaknesses. Also, little is known about why such acceleration would have occurred. This study investigates changes in diffusion speed in the United States over a period of 74 years (1923-1996) using data on 31 electrical household durables. This study defines diffusion speed as the time it takes to go from one penetration level to a higher level, and it measures speed using the slope coefficient of the logistic diffusion model. This metric relates unambiguously both to speed as just defined and to the empirical growth rate, a measure of instantaneous penetration growth. The data are analyzed using a single-stage hierarchical modeling approach for all products simultaneously in which parameters capturing the adoption ceilings are estimated jointly with diffusion speed parameters. The variance in diffusion speed across and within products is represented separately but analyzed simultaneously.
   The focus of this study is on description and explanation rather than forecasting or normative prescription. There are three main findings.
   1. On average, there has been an increase in diffusion speed that is statistically significant and rather sizable. For the set of 31 consumer durables, the average value of the slope parameter in the logistic model's hazard function was roughly 0.48, increasing with 0.09 about every 10 years. It took an innovation reaching 5% household penetration in 1946 an estimated 13.8 years to go from 10% to 90% of its estimated maximum adoption ceiling. For an innovation reaching 5% penetration in 1980, that time would have been halved to 6.9 years. This corresponds to a compound growth rate in diffusion speed of roughly 2% between 1946 and 1980.
   2. Economic conditions and demographic change are related to diffusion speed. Whether the innovation is an expensive item also has a sizable effect. Finally, products that required large investments in complementary infrastructure (radio, black and white television, color television, cellular telephone) and products for which multiple competing standards were available early on (PCs and VCRs) diffused faster than other products once 5% household penetration had been achieved.
   3. Almost all the variance in diffusion speed among the products in this study can be explained by (1) the systematic increase in purchasing power and variations in the business cycle (unemployment), (2) demographic changes, and (3) the changing nature of the products studied (e.g., products with competing standards appear only late in the data set). After controlling for these factors, no systematic trend in diffusion speed remains unaccounted for.
   These findings are of interest to researchers attempting to identify patterns of difference and similarity among the diffusion paths of many innovations, either by jointly modeling the diffusion of multiple products (as in this study) or by retrospective meta-analysis. The finding that purchasing power, demographics, and the nature of the products capture nearly all the variance is of particular interest. Specifically, one does not need to invoke unobserved changes in tastes and values, as some researchers have done, to account for long-term changes in the speed at which households adopt new products. The findings also suggest that new product diffusion modelers should attempt to control not only for marketing mix variables but also for broader environmental factors. The hierarchical model structure and the findings on the systematic variance in diffusion speed across products are also of interest to forecasting applications when very little or no data are available.

TI Multiple messages to retain retailers: Signaling new product demand
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB With the increase in new product introductions in consumer packaged goods categories, supermarkets are reluctant to accept new products. Therefore, it is very important for manufacturers to convince retailers of the high-demand potential of their products. We study how a high-demand manufacturer can use advertising, slotting allowances, and wholesale prices to signal its high demand to retailers.
   Specifically, we examine the relative importance of advertising and slotting allowance in signaling demand. That is, when is it optimal for the manufacturer to use high advertising support, and when is it optimal for it to offer slotting allowance as a signal of its demand? We show that when a high-demand manufacturer is trying to signal its demand to retailers, advertising and slotting allowance are partial substitutes of one another in the sense that the manufacturer can increase one in order to compensate for a reduction in the other. We find that the high-demand manufacturer's signaling strategy depends on three factors: the retailer's stocking costs, the intensity of retail competition, and the advertising response rate in the given product market.
   We begin with a model of one manufacturer dealing with one retailer. The manufacturer has private information about the potential demand for its new product. The retailer is uncertain about the likely demand of the new product and is willing to accept the product only if it is convinced that the demand is high. We characterize the high-demand manufacturer's separating equilibrium strategies. We find that the slotting allowance plays an important role in signaling when the retailer's stocking costs are high and the advertising effectiveness is low. On the other hand, the manufacturer does not offer any slotting allowance, and advertising plays a big ger role when the stocking costs are low or the advertising effectiveness is high.
   We then examine the effects of retail competition on the manufacturer strategy. We find that the slotting allowance plays a more important role when the retail level competition is very intense. The manufacturer may have to offer a positive slotting allowance even in the absence of retailers' demand uncertainty when the retail competition is sufficiently intense. This result shows that the slotting allowance may have an important role to play even in the absence of signaling or screening considerations. Thus, our analysis of competitive setting provides an alternative explanation for slotting allowances. It also offers support to the views of many retailers who believe that slotting allowances can help retailers recover high stocking costs in highly competitive retail markets. In the presence of retailers' demand uncertainty, the manufacturer offers a higher slotting allowance in order to signal its high demand.
   We also investigate the effect of retailer's uncertainty about the effectiveness of the manufacturer's advertising. We show that if the high-demand manufacturer also has a higher advertising response rate, the manufacturer provides even higher advertising support to alleviate the retailer's advertising-related uncertainty. By increasing the advertising support, the manufacturer credibly tells the retailer; that it would not be optimal for the manufacturer to provide such high advertising support unless it had high enough advertising effectiveness.

TI Raising awareness and signaling quality to uninformed consumers: A price
   advertising model
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The objective of this paper is to investigate the firm's optimal advertising and pricing strategies when introducing a new product. We extend the existing signaling literature on advertising spending and price by constructing a model in which advertising is used both to raise awareness about the product and to signal its quality. By comparing the complete information game and the incomplete information game, we find that the high-quality firm will reduce advertising spending and increase price from their respective complete information levels. In the separating equilibrium, the high-quality firm will actually spend less on advertising than the low-quality firm, resulting in a negative correlation between product quality and advertising spending.
   What sets our analysis apart from previous studies is that we consider advertising spending not only as a signaling device but also as an informational device. When advertising spending is just a signaling device, it is purely a dissipative expense. It can be an effective signal of quality because only the high-quality firm can afford it; thus, consumers can infer the product's quality by its advertising spending. In this case, advertising spending and product quality are positively correlated. However, when advertising also serves the purpose of raising awareness, it endogenizes the size of the market for the firm, so it is not just a dissipative expense any more.
   Consider the low-quality firm's mimicking strategy in this case. When the low-quality firm is believed to be a high-quality one, it can charge a much higher price than if its true quality were known. Given that its marginal cost is lower than the high-quality firm's, its profit margin will be much larger in mimicry than in revealing its true quality. Indeed, its profit margin will be even greater than the high-quality firm's. Therefore, the low-quality firm in mimicry has a strong incentive to increase its advertising spending from its optimal level when its true quality is known. To deter the low-quality firm's mimicking tendency, the high-quality firm should decrease its advertising spending so that mimicry is not as appealing to the low-quality firm as revealing its true quality. Indeed, the high-quality firm should reduce its advertising spending so much that it advertises less than the low-quality firm in equilibrium.
   Many have interpreted signaling as "burning money" or "throwing money down the drain." In the case of advertising, the claim is that its purpose is simply to show consumers that the firm can afford to squander money on advertising to signal its quality. Hence, the advertising content need not be informative. However, our results show that simply "burning money" is not enough to signal quality. How the money is burned is also important. When advertising raises awareness as well as signals quality, "saving money" rather than "burning money" is the correct signaling approach, although ultimately the high-quality firm will sacrifice some profit by reducing its market size. The intuition behind this result is that when information is incomplete, the high-quality firm cannot fully exploit its advantages. Whenever its advantages in quality and/or marginal costs are lessened, a firm will want to spend less on advertising.

TI Consumer decision making in online shopping environments: The effects of
   interactive decision aids
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Despite the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media (such as the World Wide Web) for prepurchase information search and online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make purchase decisions in such settings. A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aims for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments.
   While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store.
   The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives x attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute.
   Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making In particular, rye focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment.
   A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality.
   In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality RA the efficiency of purchase decisions-shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort, This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.

TI Measuring the customer experience in online environments: A structural
   modeling approach
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Intuition and previous research suggest that creating a compelling online environment for Web consumers will have numerous positive consequences for commercial Web providers. Online executives note that creating a compelling online experience for cyber customers is critical to creating competitive advantage on the Internet. Yet, very little is known about the factors that make using the Web a compelling experience for its users, and of the key consumer behavior outcomes of this compelling experience.
   Recently, the flow construct has been proposed as important for understanding consumer behavior on the World Wide Web, and as a way of defining the nature of compelling online experience. Although widely studied over the past 20 years, quantitative modeling efforts of the flow construct have been neither systematic nor comprehensive. In large parts, these efforts have been hampered by considerable confusion regarding the exact conceptual definition of flow. Lacking precise definition, it has been difficult to measure flow empirically, let alone apply the concept in practice.
   Following the conceptual model of flow proposed by Hoffman and Novak (1996), we conceptualize flow an the Web as a cognitive state experienced during navigation that is determined by (1) high levels of skill and control; (2) high levels of challenge and arousal; and (3) focused attention; and (4) is enhanced by interactivity and telepresence, Consumers who achieve flow on the Web are so acutely involved in the act of online navigation that thoughts and perceptions not relevant to navigation are screened out, and the consumer focuses entirely on the interaction. Concentration on the navigation experience is so intense that there is little attention left to consider anything else, and consequently, other events occurring in the consumer's surrounding physical environment lose significance Self-consciousness disappears, the consumer's sense of time becomes distorted, and the state of mind arising as a result of achieving flow on the Web is extremely gratifying.
   In a quantitative modeling framework, we develop a structural model based on our previous conceptual model of flow that embodies the components of what makes for a compelling online experience We use data collected from a large-sample, Web-based consumer survey to measure these constructs, and we fit a series of structural equation models that test related prior theory. The conceptual model is largely supported, and the improved fit offered by the revised model provides additional insights into the direct and indirect influences of flow, as well as into the relationship of flow to key consumer behavior and Web usage variables.
   Our formulation provides marketing scientists with operational definitions of key model constructs and establishes reliability and validity in a comprehensive measurement framework. A key insight from the paper is that the degree to which the online experience is compelling can be defined, measured, and related well to important marketing variables. Our model constructs relate in significant ways to key consumer behavior variables, including online shopping and Web use applications such as the extent to which consumers search for product information and participate in chat rooms. As such, our model may be useful both theoretically and in practice as marketers strive to decipher the secrets of commercial success in interactive online environments.

TI The little engines that could: Modeling the performance of World Wide
   Web search engines
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This research examines the ability of six popular Web search engines, individually and collectively, to locate Web pages containing common marketing/management phrases. We propose and validate a model for search engine performance that is able to represent key patterns of coverage and overlap among the engines.
   The model enables us to estimate the typical additional benefit of using multiple search engines, depending on the particular set of engines being considered. It also provides an estimate of the number of relevant Web pages not found by any of the engines. For a typical marketing/management phrase we estimate that the "best" search engine locates about 50% of the pages, and all six engines together find about 90% of the total.
   The model is also used to examine how properties of a Web page and characteristics of a phrase affect the probability that a given search engine will find a given page. For example, we find that the number of Web page links increases the prospect that each of the six search engines will find it. Finally, we summarize the relationship between major structural characteristics of a search engine and its performance in locating relevant Web pages.

TI Bundling and competition on the Internet
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The Internet has significantly reduced the marginal cost of producing and distributing digital information goods. It also coincides with the emergence of new competitive strategies such as large-scale bundling. In this paper, we show that bundling can create "economies of aggregation" for information goods if their marginal costs are very low, even in the absence of network externalities or economies of scale or scope.
   We extend the Bakos-Brynjolfsson bundling model (1999) to settings with several different types of competition, including both upstream and downstream, as well as competition between a bundler and single good and competition between two bundlers. Our key results are based on the "predictive value of bundling," the fact that it is easier for a seller to predict how a consumer will value a collection of goods than it is to value any good individually. Using a model with fully rational and informed consumers, we use the Law of Large Numbers to show that this will be true as long as the goods are not perfectly correlated and do not affect each other's valuations significantly. As a result, a seller typically can extract more value from each information good when it is part of a bundle than when it is sold separately. Moreover, at the optimal price, more consumers will find the bundle worth buying than would have bought the same goods sold separately. Because of the predictive value of bundling, large aggregators will often be more profitable than small aggregators, including sellers of single goods.
   We find that these economies of aggregation have several important competitive implications:
   1. When competing for upstream content, larger bundlers are able to outbid smaller ones, all else being equal. This is because the predictive value of bundling enables bundlers to extract more value from any given good.
   2. When competing for downstream consumers, the act of bundling information goods makes an incumbent seem "tougher" to single-product competitors selling similar goods. The resulting equilibrium is less profitable for potential entrants and can discourage entry in the bundler's markets, even when the entrants have a superior cost structure or quality.
   3. Conversely, by simply adding an information good to an existing bundle, a bundler may be able to profitably enter a new market and dislodge an incumbent who does not bundle, capturing most of the market share from the incumbent firm and even driving the incumbent out of business.
   4. Because a bundler can potentially capture a large share of profits in new markets, single-product firms may have lower incentives to innovate and create such markets. At the same time, bundlers may have higher incentives to innovate.
   For most physical goods, which have nontrivial marginal costs, the potential impact of large-scale aggregation is limited. However, we find that these effects can be decisive for the success or failure of information goods. Our results have particular empirical relevance to the markets for software and Internet content and suggest that aggregation strategies may take on particular relevance in these markets.

TI Wine online: Search costs affect competition on price, quality, and
   distribution
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A fundamental dilemma confronts retailers with stand-alone sites on the World Wide Web and those attempting to build electronic malls for delivery via the Internet, online services, or interactive television (Alba et al. 1997). For consumers, the main potential advantage of electronic shopping over other channels is a reduction in search costs for products and product-related information. Retailers, however, fear that such lowering of consumers' search costs will intensify competition and lower margins by expanding the scope of competition from local to national and international. Some retailers' electronic offerings have been constructed to thwart comparison shopping and to ward off price competition, dimming the appeal of many initial electronic shopping services. Ceteris paribus, if electronic shopping lowers the cost of acquiring price information, it should increase price sensitivity, just as is the case for price advertising. In a similar vein, though, electronic shopping can lower the cost of search for quality information. Most analyses ignore the offsetting potential of the latter effect to lower price sensitivity in the current period. They also ignore the potential of maximally transparent shopping systems to produce welfare gains that give consumers a long-term reason to give repeat business to electronic merchants (cf. Alba et al. 1997 Bakes 1997).
   We test conditions under which lowered search costs should increase or decrease price sensitivity. We conducted an experiment in which we varied independently three different search costs via electronic shopping: search cost for price information, search cost for quality information within a given store, and search cost for comparing across two competing electronic wine stores. Consumers spent their own money purchasing wines from two competing electronic merchants selling some overlapping and some unique wines.
   We show four primary empirical results. First, for differentiated products like wines, lowering the cost of search for quality information reduced price sensitivity. Second, price sensitivity for wines common to both stores increased when cross-store comparison was made easy, as many analysts have assumed. However, easy cross;store comparison had no effect on price sensitivity for unique wines. Third, making information environments more transparent by lowering all three search costs produced welfare gains for consumers. They liked the shopping experience more, selected wines they liked more in subsequent tasting, and their retention probability was higher when they were contacted two months later and invited to continue using the electronic shopping service from home. Fourth, we examined the implications of these results for manufacturers and examined how market shares of wines sold by two stores or one were affected by search costs. When store comparison was difficult, results showed that the market share of common wines was proportional to share of distribution; but when store comparison was made easy, the market share returns to distribution decreased significantly. All these results suggest incentives for retailers carrying differentiated goods to make information environments maximally transparent, but to avoid price competition by carrying more unique merchandise.

TI Reward programs and tacit collusion
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Reward programs, a promotional tool to develop customer loyalty, offer incentives to consumers on the basis of cumulative purchases of a given product or service from a firm. Reward programs have become increasingly common in many industries. The best-known examples include frequent-flier programs offered by airlines, frequent-guest programs offered by hotels, and frequent-shopper programs offered by supermarkets. Despite the widespread business practice of reward programs, research efforts on reward programs, particularly in marketing, have been scarce. Our paper takes an important step towards understanding the design of reward programs and its implications on pricing strategies.
   We study a market that consists of two segments: heavy- and light-user segments. The key distinction between the two segments is that the heavy-user segment purchases in each period and thus is a candidate for the reward programs. In contrast, the Light-user segment exits the market after one purchase and is not in a position to exploit reward programs. An important feature of our model is that we allow for different price sensitivity between heavy-user and light-user segments. Our model closely examines the type of rewards. A reward worth a dollar to the consumer might have different cost implications for the offering firm, depending on the type of reward. For example, cash rewards have higher unit reward cost (inefficient reward) for the firm than a free product of the firm, such as an airline ticket or long-distance minutes (efficient reward). Specifically, we examine an interesting puzzle observed in the marketplace. Several firms offer a cash reward or a product not made by the firm, such as jackets, electronic items, etc. These firms could offer their own product as rewards and significantly lower their cost. We examine whether there is any reason for such a seemingly suboptimal practice.
   Our analysis shows that reward programs weaken price competition. By offering the incentives for repeat purchases, reward programs increase a firm's cost to attract competing firms' current customers. Because firms gain less from undercutting their prices, equilibrium prices go up. Moreover, as consumers become unwilling to switch because of potential rewards, the firm with a larger market share in the heavy-user segment charges higher prices. Therefore, a low price in the first period, which leads to a larger market share in the heavy-user segment, will always be followed by a high price in the second period. In our model, consumers are rational and can correctly anticipate firms' incentive to offer lower prices initially to enroll them into the reward programs.
   Our paper offers an explanation as to why the type and amount of reward may vary across the programs. We identify two determining factors for the selection of rewards: size and relative price sensitivity of the heavy-user segment. We find that in a market with a small heavy-user segment that is also much more price sensitive than the light-user segment, it is optimal for firms to offer the most inefficient rewards. The intuition is based on the firms' incentive to exploit the price-insensitive light-user segment. By offering inefficient rewards, firms are able to commit to weaker competition and, therefore, higher prices.
   When the heavy-user segment is large or not very price sensitive, when compared to the light-user segment, competing firms should adopt the most efficient rewards to maximize their profit. This may well be the case in a number of real-world situations in which efficient rewards are quite prevalent. We also find that optimal reward amount has a negative relationship with unit reward cost. Because both firms use rewards to attract the heavy users, they tend to offer more when they adopt the more efficient rewards.
   Finally, our paper identifies the relationship between market characteristics and the impact of reward programs on firms' profits and consumers' benefits. We find that firms gain from the adoption of reward programs as long as light users are not too price sensitive. When light users are very price sensitive, firms engage in intense price competition, thus benefiting little from the loyalty of heavy users created through rewards. Because reward programs increase market prices, light users, who do not get the reward, earn strictly lower benefit. In contrast, heavy users often stand to gain more from the reward program. In most cases, firms and the heavy users are better off at the expense of light users.

TI Are sale signs less effective when more products have them?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We analyze data from a variety of sources, including historical data from a women's clothing catalog, a field study in that catalog, survey responses to catalog stimuli, and grocery store data for frozen juice, toothpaste, and tuna. The analysis yields three conclusions. First, sale signs are less effective at increasing demand when more items have them. Second, total category sales are maximized when some but not all products have sale signs. Third, placing a sale sign on a product reduces the perceived Likelihood that the product will be available at a lower price in the future, but the effect is smaller when more products have sale signs. By ruling out alternative hypotheses, the findings suggest that moderation of the sale sign effect is in part due to reduced credibility when they are used on more products.
   The credibility argument is motivated in part by a recent paper that presented an equilibrium model predicting that customers who lack knowledge of market prices rely on point-of-purchase sale signs to help evaluate posted prices (Anderson and Simester 1998). The model predicts that sale signs increase demand but that the increase is smaller when more products have them. This moderating effect regulates how many sale signs stores use and makes customer reliance on these cues an equilibrium strategy.
   To evaluate whether the number of sale signs moderates their effectiveness we compare demand for items with sale signs when varying the number of sale signs on other products. For this comparison we use two datasets describing demand for products in a women's clothing catalog. The first dataset describes customer orders for the same set of items across three sequential issues of the catalog. The second dataset is a field test conducted by mailing different versions of the catalog to randomly selected customer samples. Reassuringly, although the datasets do not share the same limitations, the findings are consistent and indicate that sale signs are less effective when more products have them.
   In addition to the credibility explanation there are at least two alternative explanations for this result. First, using a sale sign to make a product more attractive may lead to substitution of demand from other sale items within a store, and so demand may vary even if there is no change in the credibility of the sale signs. To discriminate between the substitution and credibility explanations, we evaluate whether total category demand is maximized when some but not all products in the category have sale signs. The credibility explanation implies that adding another sale sign will eventually decrease total category sales when many items already have sale signs. In contrast, if adding a sale sign to an item leads solely to substitution from other products within (or outside) the category we will not observe a decrease in total category demand. We test the total category sales prediction using grocery store scan data describing total category demand for frozen juice, toothpaste, and canned tuna. The findings reveal that in all three categories there is a significant reduction in aggregate demand.
   A second alternative explanation is that sale signs focus customer attention on products with these cues. Distinguishing between the attention and credibility explanations is a difficult task. They both imply that sale signs deliver less information when there are too many sale signs. The credibility argument predicts that this occurs because the signs are noticed but not believed. The attention explanation predicts that the signs are less likely to be noticed when attention is diluted by a large number of sale signs. To discriminate between the credibility explanation and this attention effect we use survey measures to evaluate a third hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts both that placing a sale sign on a product reduces the perceived likelihood that the product will be available at a lower price in the next period, and that this effect is smaller when more items have them. In an attempt to control for the attention effect we focus subjects' attention on a set of focal items. Under these conditions it is unlikely that subjects overlook sale signs on these items. More important, the Likelihood of overlooking sale signs on the focal items is unlikely to depend on how many other items also have sale signs. The results confirm both that the presence of a sale sign reduced subjects' expectations that an item would be available at a lower price in the future and that this effect is smaller when more items have sale signs.

TI Delegating pricing decisions
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB An outstanding problem in marketing is why some firms in a competitive market delegate pricing decisions to agents and other firms do not. This payer analyzes the impact of competition on the delegation decision and, in turn, the impact of delegation on prices and incentives. The theory builds on the simplest framework of competition in two dimensions: prices and (sales agents') effort. Specifically, we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) Does competition affect the price-delegation decision and, if yes, why? (2) How do prices vary under price-delegation and no-price-delegation scenarios? (3) Do the incentives to the sales representatives vary under the delegation and no-delegation scenarios?
   To address these issues, we build a game-theoretic model that consists of two firms selling through their sales representatives. These representatives are company employees. Sales are a function of prices and selling efforts. The risk-neutral firms decide whether or not to delegate the pricing decision to risk-averse sales representatives. The wages to the sales representatives consist of salary plus a commission on gross margins. The commission on gross margins can be adjusted, either through communicated marginal cost of production, which we call "virtual" marginal cost, or directly. The firm and the sales representative are assumed to hat e the same information about the market, that is, there is no information asymmetry.
   With competition in two dimensions, the strategic nature of decision variable price depends on the relative intensity of competition. With unobservable contracts and risk-averse sales representatives, firms delegate the pricing decision when price competition is intense. Part of the uncertainty in demand is absorbed by the firm by keeping "virtual" marginal cost greater than the marginal cost of production. The competing firm infers this through the risk aversion of the sales representatives. Under price delegation the sales representatives' wages are higher, and they set a price that is higher than what the firms would have set themselves. This leads to softening of price competition that is to the advantage of both firms. When the effort competition is dominant, however, the firms prefer to make the pricing decision themselves, because this reduces the intensity of effort competition among agents.
   A single-instrument commission structure in which the firms adjust the "virtual" marginal cost is compared to a two-instrument commission structure in which the firms can adjust the commission rate, as well the "virtual" marginal cost. Under no price delegation, the two incentive schemes are the same. However, under price delegation the risk premium with the two-instrument scheme is lower. However, the prices and efforts are higher with the single-instrument scheme. When price competition is intense, the increase in risk premium with the single instrument scheme is more than compensated for by the increase in profits. This is the benefit of softening price competition through higher prices.

TI Designing optimal sales contests: A theoretical perspective
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Sales contests are commonly used by firms as a short-term motivational device to increase salespeople's efforts. Conceptually sales contests and piece-rate schemes, such as salary, commission, or quotas, differ in that in sales contests payment to salespeople is based on relative rather than absolute sales levels. Using the agency theoretic framework where the firm is risk neutral and the salespeople are risk averse, we examine how a firm should design an optimal contest to maximize its profit through stimulating salespeople's efforts. Specifically we investigate how many salespeople should be given awards and how the reward should be allocated between the winners. Three commonly used sales contest formats are studied. In the first format, termed as Rank-Order Tournament, there are many winners and the amount of reward is based on relative rank achieved, with larger amounts awarded to higher ranks. We also examine two special cases of Rank-Ordered Tournament: a Multiple-Winners format, where the reward is shared equally, and a Winner-Take-All format, where a single winner gets the entire reward.
   We model salespeople's behavior by considering utility of the reward from achieving one of the winning ranks in the contest and assessing incremental chances of winning by exerting mole effort. The analysis was done for two situations based on whether the total reward is large enough for salespeople to participate in the effort-maximizing sales contest or not. The analysis shows that factors impacting contest design include the salespeople's degree of risk aversion,number of salespeople competing in the contest, and degree of sales uncertainty (which reflects strength of the sales-effort relationship). The results show that salespeople exert lower effort when there are larger numbers of participants or when sales uncertainty is high. We find that the Rank-Order Tournament is superior to the Multiple-Winners contest format. In a Multiple-Winners format, the salesperson whose performance is just sufficient to win is better off than any of the other winners as he exerts the least effort to win but obtains as high a reward as any other winners.
   Specific recommendations on contest designs are obtained assuming that sales follow either a logistic or uniform distribution. Assuming that sales outcome is logistically distributed and the contest budget is high enough to ensure participation, our analysis shows that the total number of winners in a sales contest should not exceed half the number of the contestants. This result is due to the symmetric nature of the logistic distribution. Our analysis also indicates that the total number of winners should be increased and the spread decreased when salespeople are more risk averse. When salespeople are more risk averse, their marginal values for higher rewards become smaller The spread should increase with ranks when rate of risk tolerance is high and decrease with ranks when the rate of risk tolerance is lower. in the extreme case of risk-neutral salespeople, the optimal design is a Winner-Take-All format. We also conclude that since the probability of winning the contest decreases with number of contestants, the optimal number of winners should increase and interrank spread decrease when there are a larger number of participants, if the firm does not allocate a large enough budget for salespeople to participate in the effort-maximizing sales contest, then the firm may increase the number of winners to more than half the sales-force, increasing the number of winners and decreasing the spread are required to encourage the salespeople to participate, particularly when there are many participants who are risk averse. A counterintuitive result is that the number of winners should be reduced and the spread increased when sales uncertainty is high. Increasing sales uncertainty leads to lower equilibrium effort levels while keeping the expected utility of the contest rewards the same. Therefore, increased uncertainty results in higher participation incentive. The firm should thus relatively reduce the number of winners in high-uncertainty situations.
   Under the assumption of uniformly distributed sales, the recommendation is that a Winner-Take-All contest induces maximum efforts regardless of the level of risk aversion, number of players, or the degree of uncertainty. When the Winner-Take-All format does not meet the participation constraint, our analysis recommends offering a big reward to the top salesperson and a small reward to many other salespeople. The small reward should be just sufficient to ensure that all salespeople participate. Consistent with logistic distribution, the spread should decrease when salespeople are more risk averse or there are more players but should increase when sales uncertainty is larger These results highlight that some of the conclusions drawn may be sensitive to distributional assumptions.

TI Evaluating promotions in shopping environments: Decomposing sales
   response into attraction, conversion, and spending effects
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Retailers' marketing objectives can be classified into three broad categories: attraction effects that focus on consumers' store-entry decisions,conversion effects that relate to consumers' decisions about whether or not to make a purchase at a store they are visiting, and spending effects that represent both dollar value and composition of their transactions. This paper proposes a framework that incorporates all three of these effect categories and examines their influence; on store performance. Specifically, store sales are broken down into four components: front traffic, store-entry ratio, closing ratio, and average spending. Using inexpensive and readily available infrared and video imaging technology it is possible to measure these four components in a wide variety of retail environments, allowing retailers to obtain a richer understanding of the effectiveness of promotional activities on store sales.
   A set of twelve hypotheses based on the economics of information and promotion Literatures is proposed. These hypotheses relate the presence of various promotions (price, clearance and new product), promotion scope, and the type of out-of-store communication vehicle used by retailers to each of the four store sales components. The proposed approach is then applied in two different empirical settings, both to test formally the hypotheses and to demonstrate more generally the richness of the information the approach can provide. The first application involves a Canadian apparel store that sells ladies' casual wear. The second application is: based on a U.S. sporting-goods retail chain that sells a variety of sporting goods, including sportswear, sports shoes, and sports equipment.
   A joint model of four simultaneous equations using front traffic, store traffic, number of store transactions, and store sales as the endogenous variables is then formulated for the applications. Promotional factors are used as explanatory variables, along with a number of additional control variables (including length of operation, day of week, holidays, seasonality, and weather). Seemingly unrelated regression is used to estimate the model efficiently. A comparison model that includes only store sales as the endogenous variable is estimated for comparison with the joint model.
   Results from these applications indicate that the proposed framework provides more detailed information about promotional effectiveness than more traditional models of store performance; The effects of specific promotional decisions on store performance are described. Specifically, price promotions have little impact on front traffic, but positively affect store entry and likelihood that a consumer will make a purchase The effect of price promotion on consumers' spending in a store is also significant, but varies in sign with the type of promotion employed. Second, while greater promotional scope enhances store entry, promotions with narrow scope seem to have negative impact on store traffic. The effects of promotion scope on store performance also seem to be moderated by the scope of merchandise carried by the retailer Increased promotional scope appears to have a greater effect on store traffic and consumers' spending for a multicategory retailer than for a more focused seller. Third, clearance promotions have a weaker effect on store entry when compared to other multiple-category promotions, while new-product promotions have a positive impact on conversion. Finally, newspaper advertisements, when compared to targeted coupons, have a stronger effect on store attraction but a weaker effect on spending.
   In addition to understanding the key drivers of store sales, retailers are also interested in determining whether or not their promotions affect store profitability. An assessment of the profit impact cannot be based on the change in overall store sales because promotions may affect various items or product categories inside a store differentially, and gross margins may not be the same for all items or categories. Although gross margin and item- or category-specific sales were not available for the two applications studied, the paper describes how such information can be integrated with the output of the proposed joint model to arrive at a richer understanding of how promotions affect overall store profitability.
   Finally, managerial and academic implications of this work are described, and potential extensions of the joint model are suggested.

TI Electronic tickets, smart cards, and online prepayments: When and how to
   advance sell
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Advance selling occurs when sellers allow buyers to purchase at a time preceding consumption (Shugan and Xie 2000). Electronic tickets, smart cards, online prepayments, and other technological advances make advance selling possible for many, if not all, service providers. These technologies lower the cost of making complex transactions at a greater distance from the seller's site. They also give sellers more control over advance selling by decreasing arbitrage. As technology enhances the capability to advance sell, more academic attention is vital. This paper strives to exploit these technologies by developing advance-selling strategies.
   Until recently, advance-selling research focused on the airline industry and specific characteristics of that industry. These characteristics included the price insensitivity of late arrivals (e.g., business travelers) compared with early arrivals (e.g., leisure travelers), demand uncertainty across flights on the same day, and capacity constraints. Recent findings by Shugan and Me (2000) show that advance selling is a far more general marketing tool than previously thought. It does not require these industry-specific characteristics. It only requires the existence of buyer uncertainty about future valuations. Moreover, sellers without the ability to price discriminate can use advance selling to improve profits to the level of first-degree price discrimination. This finding is important because buyers are nearly always uncertain about their future valuations for most services (e.g.; the utility of next year's vacation or a future college education).
   In this paper, we take the next step from Shugan and Xie (2000). We show that advance-selling profits do not come from buyer surplus, but from more buyers being able to purchase. We determine when and how to advance sell in a variety of situations, including situations with limited capacity, second-period arrivals, refunds, buyer risk aversion, exogenous credibility, continuous preference distributions, and premium pricing. We determine when advance selling improves profits and, when it does, how to set advance prices. We ask and answer seven questions.
   First, when should sellers advance sell? Second, how much can advance selling improve profits compared with only spot selling? Third, what factors impact the profitability of advance selling and how? Fourth, should advance prices be higher or lower or the same as spot prices? Fifth, how do capacity constraints impact advance-selling strategies? Sixth, should sellers limit the number of advance sales? Finally, what is the possible impact of buyer risk aversion? First, we provide precise conditions when sellers should advance sell. For example, without capacity constraints, we show that sellers should advance sell when marginal costs are sufficiently low to make it profitable to sell to buyers with low valuations and sufficiently high to convince buyers that the spot price will be higher than the advance price.
   Second, we find that advance selling can almost double the profits from optimal spot selling to early arrivals. We also show that advance selling has no impact on consumer surplus in markets with homogenous consumers and no capacity constraints. Therefore, advance selling can increase social welfare because seller profits increase.
   Third, we find that two very important factors impacting the profitability of advance selling are seller credibility and marginal costs. Buyers only advance buy when they expect an advantage from advance buying over spot buying. Without capacity constraints, sellers must credibly convince buyers that the advance price is at a discount to the spot price. We show that this condition is met under different circumstances. For example, large marginal costs can create credibility because buyers believe that these costs will lead to high spot prices.
   Fourth, we find(although optimal advance prices can be at a discount to the spot price) that sometimes a premium is optimal. Premiums are optimal when capacity is large (but limited) and marginal costs are not too large. Buyers advance purchase at a premium to spot prices when capacity is limited and spot prices are low. (Note that this is not a risk premium, and risk aversion is not required.) No prior research has suggested this strategy because that research relies on the assumption that early arrivals are more price sensitive than later ones. Without that assumption, premium advance pricing is sometimes optimal.
   Fifth, we find that binding capacity constraints can impact the profitability of advance selling in opposite ways: On one hand, capacity constraints create seller credibility. Buyers believe that spot prices will be high when they know spot capacity is limited (and, perhaps, more limited by advance sales). On the other hand, when capacity is limited, the need to increase sales from discounted advance prices diminishes.
   Sixth, consistent with Desiraju and Shugan (1999) we find that limiting advance sales can be profitable, but only under restrictive conditions. These conditions are: (1) selling to all early arrivals would leave insufficient capacity in the spot period to sell to all second-period arrivals with high valuations, (2) the optimal spot price is high and (3) marginal costs are sufficiently small to make advance selling profitable.
   Finally, we find that buyer risk aversion can sometimes increase the profitability of advance selling. Our findings provide precise guidelines for a large number of service providers that will have the technical capability to advance sell. For those service providers, advance selling provides a creative pricing strategy that can potentially provide substantial improvements in profits.

TI Structural analysis, of manufacturer pricing in the presence of a
   strategic retailer
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumer goods manufacturers usually sell their brands, to, consumers through common independent retailers. Theoretical research on such channel structures, has analyzed the optimal behavior of channel members under alternative assumptions of manufacturer-retailer interaction (Vertical Strategic Interaction). Research in Empirical Industrial Organization has focused on analyzing the competitive interactions between manufacturers (Horizontal Strategic Interaction). Decision support systems have made various assumptions about retailer-pricing rules (eg, constant markup category-profit maximization). The appropriateness of such assumptions about strategic behavior for any specific market, however, is an empirical question. This paper therefore empirically infers (1) the Vertical Strategic Interaction (VSI) between manufacturers and retailer, (2) the Horizontal Strategic Interaction (HSI) between manufacturers simultaneously with the VSI, and (3) the pricing rule used by a retailer.
   The approach is particularly appealing because it can be used with widely available scanner data, where there is no information on wholesale prices. Researchers usually have no access to wholesale prices. Even manufacturers, who have access to their own wholesale prices, usually have limited information on competitors` wholesale prices. In the absence of wholesale prices, we derive formulae for wholesale prices using game-theoretic solution techniques under the specific assumptions of vertical and horizontal strategic interaction and retailer-pricing rules. We then embed the formulae for wholesale prices into the estimation equations. While our empirical illustration is using scanner data without wholesale prices, the model itself can be applied when wholesale prices are available.
   Early research on the inference of HSI among manufacturers in setting wholesale prices using scanner data (e.g, Kadiyali et al. 1996, 1999) made the simplifying assumption that retailers charge a constant margin. This assumption enabled them to infer wholesale prices and analyze competitive interactions between manufacturers. In this paper, we show that this model is econometrically identical to a model that measures retail-price coordination across brands. Hence, the inferred cooperation among manufacturers could be exaggerated by the coordinated pricing (category management) done by the retailer. We find empirical support for this argument. This highlights the need to properly model and infer VSI simultaneously to accurately estimate. the HSI when using data at the retail level.
   Functional forms of demand have been evaluated in terms of the fit of the model to sales data. But recent theoretical research on channels (Lee and Staelin 1997, Tyagi 1999) has shown that the functional form has serious implications for strategic behavior such as retail passthrough. While the logit and linear model implies equilibrium passthrough of less than 100% (Lee and Staelin call this Vertical Strategic Substitute (VSS)), the multiplicative model implies optimal passthrough of greater than 100% (Vertical Strategic Complement (VSC)). Because passthrough rates on promotions have been found to be below or above 100% (Chevalier and Curhan 1976, Armstrong 1991), we empirically test the appropriateness of the logit (VSS) and the multiplicative (VSC) functional form for the data.
   We perform our analysis in the yogurt and peanut butter categories for the two biggest stores in a local market. We found that the VSS implications of the logit fit the data better than the multiplicative model. We also find that for both categories, the best-fitting model is one in which (1) the retailer maximizes category profits, (2) the VSI is Manufacturer-Stackelberg, and (3) manufacturer pricing (HSI) is tacitly collusive. The fact that the retailer maximizes category profits is consistent with theoretical expectations. The inference that the VSI is Manufacturer-Stackelberg reflects the institutional reality of the timing of the game. Retailers set their retail prices after manufacturers set their wholesale prices. Note that in the stores and product categories that we analyze, the two manufacturers own the dominant brands with combined market shares of about 82% in the yogurt market and 65% in the peanut butter market. The, result is also consistent with a balance of power argument the literature. The finding that manufacturer pricing is tacitly collusive is consistent with the argument that firms involved in long-term competition in concentrated markets can achieve tacit collusion.
   Managers use decision support systems for promotion planning that routinely make assumptions about VSI, HSI, and the functional form. The results from our analysis are of substantive import in judging the appropriateness of assumptions made in such decision support systems.

TI Quality segmentation in spatial markets: When does cannibalization
   affect product line design?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Durable goods manufacturers often design product lines by segmenting their markets on quality attributes-attributes that exhibit a "more is better" property for all consumers. Since products within a product line are partial substitutes, and consumers can self-select the products they want to purchase, multiproduct firms have to carefully consider the cannibalization problem in designing their product lines. Existing research has analyzed the cannibalization problem for a monopolist who faces consumers who differ in their quality valuations. If lower-quality products are sufficiently attractive, higher-valuation consumers may find it beneficial to buy lower-quality products rather than the higher-quality products targeted to them. That is, lower-quality products can potentially cannibalize higher-quality products. The cannibalization problem forces the firm to provide only the highest-valuation segment with its preferred (efficient) quality. All other segments get qualities lower than their preferred (efficient) qualities. When the cannibalization problem is very severe, the firm may not serve some of the lowest-valuation segments.
   However, not much is known about how and when the cannibalization problem affects product line design in an oligopoly. Also, consumers may differ not only in their quality valuations but also in their taste preferences. The objective of this paper is to fill these gaps by examining whether the cannibalization problem affects a firm's price and quality decisions in a model with consumer differences in quality valuations, as well as in their taste preferences, in both monopoly and duopoly settings. The paper addresses questions such as the following. With both types of consumer differences, should a firm, even a monopolist, provide efficient quality only to the top segment? Are there conditions under which other segments can also get their preferred quality levels? If so, how do consumer and firm characteristics affect the likelihood of different segments getting their preferred qualities? How does competition affect the firm's choice of qualities?
   I develop a model in which the market is made up of two segments, with one segment valuing quality more than the other. Consumers within each segment are distributed over Hotelling's (1929) linear city. Consumers in the two segments can have different taste preferences (transportation costs). Firm locations in the two segments may also be different.
   The paper begins with an analysis of the monopoly case. I find that when both segments are fully covered, the standard self-selection results of the high-valuation segment getting its preferred quality and the low-valuation segment getting less than preferred quality do hold. Interestingly, when both segments are incompletely covered, under some conditions, the monopolist's price and quality choices are not determined by the cannibalization problem. In these cases, the monopolist finds it optimal to provide each segment with its preferred quality. Thus, the equilibrium quality levels in a second-degree price discrimination situation resemble the third-degree price discrimination solution. I characterize the relevant conditions in terms of consumer characteristics.
   I then consider the case of two firms competing in the market, each offering two products-one for the high-valuation segment and the other for the low-valuation segment. Here also both types of outcomes are possible, depending on consumers and firm characteristics. Under some conditions, the cannibalization problem does not affect the firms' price and quality choices, and each firm provides each segment with that segment's preferred quality. Each firm finds it optimal to serve both segments. When these conditions do not hold, only the high-valuation segment gets its preferred quality. I interpret the conditions necessary for these results to exist in terms of characteristics of the consumers and the firms.
   An interesting insight from the analysis is that as the taste preferences of the low-valuation segment become weaker (their "transportation cost" becomes lower), the more intense competition in the low-valuation segment makes it more attractive for the high-valuation consumers to buy the products meant for the low-valuation segment. This worsens the cannibalization problem, and the low-valuation segment may not get its preferred quality. On the other hand, when the taste preferences of the high-valuation segments are sufficiently weak, more intense competition in the high-valuation segment reduces that segment's incentives to buy the product meant for the low-valuation segment. This mitigates the cannibalization problem and makes it more likely for the low-valuation segment to get its preferred quality.
   Similarly, when firms are less differentiated in the low-valuation segment, stronger competition between the firms makes the cannibalization problem worse, and the low-valuation segment may not get its preferred quality. When the differentiation between the firms is sufficiently weak in the high-valuation segment, the high-valuation segment is more likely to be better off buying the product meant for it. As the high-valuation segment's incentives to buy the lower-quality product are reduced, the low-valuation segment is more likely to get its preferred quality.

TI Unobserved retailer behavior in multimarket data: Joint spatial
   dependence in market shares and promotion variables
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Marketing scholars and practitioners frequently infer market responses from cross-sectional or pooled cross-section by time data. Such cases occur especially when historical data are either absent or are not representative of the current market situation. We argue that inferring market responses using cross-sections of multimarket data nay in some cases be misleading because these data also reflect unobserved actions by retailers. For example, because the (opportunity) costs of doing so do not outweigh the gains; retailers are predisposed against promoting small share brands: As a consequence, local prices and promotion variables depend on local market shares-the higher the local share; the higher the local observed promotion intensity. We refer to this reverse causation as an endogeneity. Ignoring it will inflate response estimates, because both the promotion effects on share as well as the reverse effects are in the same direction. In this paper, we propose a solution to this inference problem using the fact that retailers have trade territories consisting of multiple contiguous markets. This implies that the unobserved actions of retailers cause a measurable spatial dependence among the marketing variables. The intuition behind our approach is that by accounting for, this spatial dependence, we account for the effects of the retailer's behavior: In this context, our study hopes to make the following contributions at the core of which lies the above intuition.
   First, we separate the market response effect from the reverse retailer effect by computing responses to price and promotion net of any spatial-and therefore retailer-influence.
   Second, underlying this approach is a new variance-decomposition model for data with a panel structure. This model allows to test for endogeneity of prices and promotion variables in the cross-sectional dimension of the data. This test aims to complement the one developed by Villas-Boas and Winer (1999), who test for endogeneity along the temporal dimension.
   Third, to illustrate the approach, we use Information Resources Inc. (IRI) market share data for brands in two mature and relatively undifferentiated product categories across 64 IRI markets. Whereas we only use data with very short time horizons to estimate price and promotion responses with the spatial model, we do have data over long time windows. We use the latter to validate the approach. Specifically, within-market estimates of price and promotion response are not subject to the same endogeneity because we hold the set of retailers constant. Therefore, comparing within- and across-market estimates of price and promotion responses is a natural way to validate the approach. Consistent with our argument, ignoring the reverse causation in the cross-sectional data leads to inferences of price and promotion elasticities that are farther away from zero than the elasticities obtained from within-market analysis. In constrast cross-sectional spatial estimates and time-series estimates show convergent validity.
   From a practical point of view, this means it is possible to obtain reasonable within-market estimates of price and promotion elasticities from (predominantly) cross-sectional data. This may benefit marketing managers. The manager who would act on the inflated elasticities will over-allocate marketing resources to promotions because she ignores retailers' censorship of promotions on the basis of already existing high share. We explore other approaches to correct for the inference bias, and discuss further. managerial issues and future research.

TI Research note: Consumer heterogeneity and competitive price-matching
   guarantees
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Price-matching guarantees are widely used in consumer and industrial markets. Previous studies argue that they are a marketing tactic that facilitates implicit price collusion. This is because once a store adopts this marketing tactic, its rivals can no longer steal its customers by undercutting its price, and hence they have little incentive to initiate price cuts. While a store with price-matching guarantees has no fear of losing customers to rivals' price cuts, it has every incentive to raise its own price to charge a higher, price to its loyal consumers. A growing body of legal literature uses this argument today to justify calls for antitrust actions against stores employing this marketing tactic.
   However, this theoretical conclusion baffles practitioners and industry experts. In practice, sellers typically embrace this marketing tactic in response to heavier competition and a growing bargain consciousness among shoppers. The introduction of price-matching guarantees by a store is frequently interpreted by industry observers as the initiation of a price war rather than a signal of price collusion. This assertion is supported in many instances by the fact that stores that introduce price-matching guarantees also roll back their prices and typically suffer subsequent loss of profits. Most ironically, the favorite examples used by researchers to illustrate how price-matching guarantees can enforce price collusion, Crazy Eddie and "Nobody Beats the Wiz," have subsequently either gone bankrupt or filed for federal bankruptcy protection.
   In this study we show that price-matching guarantees can indeed facilitate competition: The expected prices and profits can be strictly lower when all stores adopt price-matching guarantees than when they are not allowed to. This is because the adoption of price-matching guarantees generates not only a competition-dampening effect, which has been recognized in the literature, but also a competition-enhancing effect. This latter effect comes from the fact that price-matching guarantees encourage price search by those consumers who prefer to shop at a particular store but are mindful of saving opportunities. These consumers will have incentives to obtain the rival store's price when their favorite store offers price-matching guarantees to avail themselves of the lowest possible price at their favorite store. As a result, price-matching guarantees reduce the number of purchases at the store from those consumers who would have paid the full price and thus prompt a store to price more aggressively to bid for more incremental sales. This competition-enhancing effect can more than offset the competition-dampening effect in. markets where consumers differ in their price search costs and store loyalty. Thus, our study casts doubt on the advisability of blanket prohibition on price-matching guarantees.
   Our argument relies only on consumer segmentation and on the phenomenon of periodic sales, both of which are common in retail markets. We arrive at our conclusion by incorporating bargain shoppers and opportunistic loyals into the standard sales-promotion models. In contrast, the past literature on price-matching guarantees ignores the ubiquitous phenomenon of sales in retail markets and overlooks those consumers who prefer to shop at a particular store, but are alert to saving opportunities. As a result, it is troubled by two awkward conclusions. On the one hand, price-matching guarantees simply remove rivals' incentives to undercut in price and, hence, also their incentives to run sales. This implies that the adoption of price-matching guarantees in a market will eliminate the phenomenon of sales, which is obviously counterfactual. On the other hand, in equilibrium no consumer actually invokes price-matching guarantees, as each player has incentives to close any price gap in the market. This is obviously false, based on our casual observations and our conversations with store managers.
   Theoretical research on the subject thus far has been overwhelmingly one-sided, and empirical or experimental studies are conspicuously lacking. We hope that our conclusion will spark further research in both directions. A healthy debate will broaden our perspective on an issue of great importance in formulating public policies and in managerial decision making.

TI Research note: Price discrimination as an adverse signal: Why an offer
   to spread payments may hurt demand
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Firms often search enthusiastically for distinguishing traits that they may use to price discriminate between segments. Yet there are occasions in which firms forgo the opportunity to price discriminate and instead charge a single price Traditional explanations for why retailers forgo the opportunity to price discriminate focus on the cost of discriminating, including operational costs, explicit discrimination costs, and implicit discrimination costs. In this paper we identify an additional reason for why firms may forgo an opportunity to price discriminate By revealing that a product is being sold to a broad range of segments, a retailer implicitly claims that the product is suitable for each segment. However, claiming that a premium-quality product is suitable for price-sensitive consumers undermines the credibility of a retailer's quality claim.
   The signaling explanation was motivated by extensive discussions over more than a year with a major catalog retailer that sells premium-quality jewelry and gifts. Discussions with managers revealed that they were reluctant to use any price-discrimination mechanism that signals their products are targeted at price-sensitive customers. For example, the catalog does not include sale or clearance sections and does not target more price-sensitive customers by using separate items. However, management was under some pressure to consider installment-billing offers, which allow customers to pay over a series of periods rather than in a lump sum. Management feared that offering installment billing may adversely affect customers' quality perceptions and demand.
   To investigate this issue, we develop a general game-theoretic model, illustrate how fine model extends to installment billing, and conduct a large-scale field test. The general model illustrates how selling to multiple segments may lead to an adverse quality signal. We illustrate how the model extends to installment-billing offers in a direct-mail catalog. Installment-billing offers allow customers to spread the total payment over a series of payments. All customers have the option of using installment billing, and customers who use the plan receive an economic benefit (an interest-free loan). We would normally expect this type of offer to increase demand or, at a minimum, leave demand unchanged. However, because installment-billing offers target credit-constrained customers, we predicted that the introduction of installment billing would prompt an unfavorable quality inference and reduce demand among quality-sensitive customers.
   We empirically investigated this prediction in a large-scale field test with a catalog that offers premium-quality jewelry and gifts. Two versions of the catalog were created: a test version that contained an installment-billing offer, and a control version in which installment billing was not offered. Importantly, the prices in both the test version and control version were identical. Approximately 240,000 catalogs were mailed, and customers were randomly assigned to either the test version or control version. Results show that the installment-billing offer (test version) was associated with both a reduction in the number of orders received and a reduction in aggregate revenue. Offering installment billing resulted in approximately $15,000 in lost revenue. The only plausible explanation for this counterintuitive finding appears to be the signaling theory.
   To investigate the long-term effects, the catalog agreed to survey their customers to measure how an offer of installment billing affects their customers' quality perceptions. Similar to the field test, two versions of a catalog were created, and customers were randomly mailed a catalog, along with a short survey. Respondents were asked to browse through the catalog and return their responses in a reply-paid envelope. The findings are consistent with customer beliefs in the signaling model: Offering installment billing lowers the perceived quality of the items in the catalog.
   The field test and survey findings were both statistically significant and managerially relevant. Together, the results convinced the catalog not to include installment-billing offers in future catalogs.

TI Management science in marketing: Prehistory, origin, and early years of
   the INFORMS Marketing College
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB It is now nearly 50 years since the Institute of Management Science was founded and the prestigious journal, Management Science, began publication in October of 1954. While I was still a junior in high school in 1954 and several years from discovering Management Science, I was privileged to be present at and participate in the exciting days of intellectual ferment in the mid 1960s when management science emerged in marketing and ultimately spawned marketing science. This paper is an attempt to record something of what it was like before the INFORMS Marketing College (thus setting the context in which the College emerged), how the Marketing College was formed, and the early years of both the College and management science in marketing. It is probably not too soon to record these recollections while the principals are still alive and have most of their faculties (an assumption lacking in empirical support).

TI Market measurement and analysis: The first "Marketing Science"
   conference
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A few years after I had joined the faculty at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business in 1975, I received a call from Frank Bass. During the conversation, which may have focused on our response to a comment on a paper we had published in the journal of Marketing Research, he suggested that I consider organizing a conference on applied econometrics in marketing. Frank had been my thesis advisor at Purdue University, and he knew of my interest in this topic. However, I also had concerns about the extent to which data limitations prevented econometric model results from having much impact on marketing decisions. In the 1970s, researchers used Nielsen's bimonthly store audit data (aggregated to represent geographic areas) or SAMI's four-weekly warehouse withdrawal data to model how sales or market share depends on a few marketing variables. Each of these data sources was subject to severe limitations, especially compared with the scanner data we now have available.

TI Founding Marketing Science
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB By 1978 the shear quantity of high level marketing science research had exceeded the space available in the Marketing Department of Management Science and the Journal of Marketing Research. In addition, JMR was (and is) more oriented to statistical methodology. We envisioned more of an engineering/operations research flavor to any new journal. At one of the TIMS/ORSA meeting Frank Bass and John Little asked me to chair a committee to look into the feasibility of starting a new marketing journal under TIMS/ORSA sponsorship. I agreed to do so. The other members of the committee were Bob Cooper, Joe Dodson, Irv Gross, John Hauser, Mike Rothkopf, Subrata Sen, and Dick Wittink.

TI The history of the Marketing College is a work in progress
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This essay examines the relations between the College on Marketing and its parent societies-first TIMS, then ORSA as well, and, after the two societies merged, INFORMS.
   There are stories to tell, but also questions to answer. Historians say that a good history has a theme or cluster of questions at its core. If we are to evaluate the institutional relationships, we should ask: Has the College been successful? If so, why? Did the parent organizations help or hinder? College members started a conference and later a journal. Were these acts cooperative or competitive with the parent societies? After all, TIMS and ORSA were running meetings and journals in which marketing people could participate. And, if the College has been successful, where does it go from here? Is success stable? Or, in today's dynamic world, is stability really decline in disguise? Our analysis suggests that TIMS provided a hospitable environment for the birth of marketing science as a field. However, organizational problems did appear, and we shall see that small changes in events or people could have dramatically altered outcomes. We find good evidence of success but also centrifugal challenges for the College today.

TI Effectiveness of trade promotions: Analyzing the determinants of retail
   pass through
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Trade promotions are temporary price cuts that manufacturers offer retailers to encourage them to reduce retail prices. While trade promotion spending as a percentage of marketing budget has increased dramatically, the inefficiency of trade promotion represents the "number-one concern" among manufacturers, as indicated by recent trade surveys. At the heart of this dissatisfaction lies manufacturers' concern regarding widespread retailer opportunism with low retail pass through.
   Our objective is to develop a simple game-theoretic framework to examine the strategic considerations that underlie a retailer's decision to pass through a trade deal. In particular, we are interested in answering the following questions:
   (i) What and how do product-market characteristics impact the extent of retail opportunism?
   (ii) How can the manufacturer alleviate the retail pass-through problem by strategically supplementing trade promotions with advertising trade deals directly to consumers?
   To address these issues, we consider a stylized channel with a single manufacturer who serves two customer segments through a single (focal) retailer. We implicitly capture the essence of retail competition by allowing customers to have an outside option: other retailers that customers might search if they deem the price at the focal retailers to be "too high." Customers differ in their valuation for the manufacturer's product and in the costs they incur when searching for a better price at other retailers. While customers are unaware of the existence of a trade deal in any particular time period, through prior experience they know the frequency of such deals and, furthermore, they update their beliefs about the occurrence of a deal by observing the posted retail price. The retailer decides whether to pass through a deal or not, recognizing the impact of his pass-through policy on customers' search propensity, and hence, their willingness to pay.
   The main message of the paper is that in an environment where manufacturer offers trade promotions, a retailer may not have the incentive to pass a low wholesale price onto consumers because consumers do not have perfect information about ongoing trade promotions. When consumers observe a high price at the focal retailer and yet are not sure if a trade promotion is on, they may not look around for a low price. Therefore, the retailer can price opportunistically to gain a higher margin by not passing a low price to consumers. However, if the retailer never passes savings on, consumers can infer opportunistic pricing based on prior knowledge of trade promotion frequency and have a higher tendency to shop elsewhere, thus reducing sales volume. The retailer resolves the conflicting incentives by occasionally charging a low price when a trade promotion is on, while posting a high price on other occasions. We find that the extent of retail opportunism depends on product-market characteristics, such as the retailer's clientele and the heterogeneity in consumer search costs, as well as on the characteristics of the manufacturer, trade promotion policy, such as the frequency of trade promotion and the depth of discount offered. When the low-valuation consumers have search costs that make them exit the market when the focal retailer posts a high price, the manufacturer will intervene by advertising his trade promotion directly to consumers, thus performing a channel coordination function.
   We consider several extensions of the base model-explicit retail competition, differentiated retailers, and heterogeneity in consumers' knowledge about the frequency of trade deals-and show that our results still hold.Trade promotions are temporary price cuts that manufacturers offer retailers to encourage them to reduce retail prices. While trade promotion spending as a percentage of marketing budget has increased dramatically, the inefficiency of trade promotion represents the "number-one concern" among manufacturers, as indicated by recent trade surveys. At the heart of this dissatisfaction lies manufacturers' concern regarding widespread retailer opportunism with low retail pass through.

TI Pizzas: pi or square? Psychophysical biases in area comparisons
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Many product categories, from pizzas to real estate, present buyers with purchase decisions involving complex area judgments. Does a square look larger or smaller than a circle? How much smaller does a circle of 8-inch diameter look when compared to one with a 10-inch diameter? In this paper, we propose a psychophysical model of how consumers make area comparison judgments. The model involves consumers making effort-accuracy trade-offs that lead to heuristic processing of area judgments and systematic shape-and size-related biases.
   The model is based on four propositions: P1. Consumers make an initial comparison between two figures based on a single dimension; P2. The dimension of initial comparison-the primary dimension-is the one that is most salient to consumers, where salience is figure and context dependent; P3. Consumers insufficiently adjust an initial comparison using a secondary dimension, which we assume to be orthogonal to the primary dimension used for the initial comparison; and P4. The magnitude by which the initial comparison is adjusted is directly related to the relative salience of the secondary dimension versus the primary dimension.
   The model predicts that a single linear dimension inappropriately dominates the two-dimensional area comparison task and that contextual factors affect which linear dimension dominates the task. The relative use of the second dimension depends on its relative salience, which can be influenced in a variety of ways. The model extends the area estimation literature in cognitive psychology by exploring new biases in area estimation and is able to resolve controversial effects regarding which shape is perceived to be "bigger," the square or the circle, by incorporating contextual factors into model specifications.
   A set of six studies-five laboratory experiments and one field experiment-systematically test model predictions. Study 1 is a process study that shows that when two dimensions are available to make an area comparison judgment, people choose one of those to be the primary dimension, with the other being the secondary dimension. Furthermore, it shows that the choice of the primary dimension is dependent on its relative salience that can be contextually manipulated via manner of visual presentation.
   Studies 2 and 3 show how the use of a diagonal versus the side of a square (contextually determined) can affect whether a square is perceived to be smaller or larger than a circle of the same area. Study 3 extends the investigation to the domain of the price people are willing to pay for "pizzas" of different shapes, presented differently.
   Study 4, a field study, demonstrates external validity by showing that purchase quantities are greater when a circular package is expected to contain less than a rectangular package of the same volume in a domain where consumption goal is constant (cream cheese with a bagel).
   Studies 5 and 6 examine ways in which one can increase the salience of the secondary dimension, in a size estimation task, i.e., judging the rate of increase of area. While Study 5 does so via contextual visual cues (incorporating lines that draw one's attention to the underused dimension), Study 6 does the same using semantic cues that direct attention to a single dimension (e.g., diameter) or the total area and comparing these with a visual presentation of the figure.
   Overall, results suggest that the manner in which information is presented affects the relative salience of dimensions used to judge areas, and can influence the price consumers are willing to pay. Underlining the external validity of these findings, container shape can significantly affect quantity purchased and overall sales. The paper highlights biases in area comparison judgments as a function of area shape and size. The model is parsimonious, demonstrates good predictive ability, and explains seemingly contradictory results in the cognitive psychology literature. Implications for pricing, product design, packaging, and retailing are suggested.

TI The spatial representation of market information
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB To be used effectively, market knowledge and information must be structured and represented in ways that are parsimonious and conducive to efficient managerial decision making. This manuscript proposes a new latent structure spatial model for the representation of market information that meets this requirement. When applied to a priori defined (e.g., socioeconomic) segments, our proposed methodology provides a new way to display marketing data parsimoniously via dimension reduction through a factor-analytic specification. In post hoc studies, we simultaneously derive market segments from the data and represent the structure of market information within each of the unobserved, derived groups/segments. We summarize all relevant information concerning derived market segments via a series of maps that prove conducive to the quick and accurate dissemination of customer and competitor market information. The associations between the variables are captured in a reduced space, where each variable is represented by a vector that emanates from the origin and terminates on a hypersphere of unit (the vector length is arbitrary) radius (e.g., a unit circle in a two-dimensional space). The angles between the variable vectors capture the correlation structure in the reduced space. The method is very general and can be utilized to identify latent structures in a wide range of marketing applications. We present an actual commercial marketing application involving the (normalized) prescription shares (of specialists) of ethical drugs to demonstrate the effectiveness of representing market information in this manner and to reveal the advantage of the proposed methodology over a more general finite mixture-based method. The proposed methodology derives three segments that tend to group specialists with respect to the stage of adoption of innovation in this therapeutic category. The specialists in the first group appear to be laggards because they prescribe more of the older class of brands. However, they also have a higher-than-average preference for a newer and somewhat cheaper brand. This suggests that some of the specialists belonging to this segment may be price sensitive, while others may exhibit a slower adoption cycle, replacing the older class with the newer brands, and thus, skip one stage in the cycle of innovation. The specialists in the second segment are heavy users of the newer class of brands but are not particularly fast to adopt the latest brands. Finally, the last segment clearly consists of innovators. Traditionally, pharmaceutical marketers have viewed specialists in one of two extremes-all specialists are the same (i.e., the market has only one segment) or all specialists are very different (i.e., the market consists of 10,000+ segments of one physician each). Not surprisingly, this analysis suggests a more moderate perspective: specialists adopt new products at different rates.

TI Endogeneity and heterogeneity in a probit demand model: Estimation using
   aggregate data
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Two issues that have become increasingly important while estimating the parameters of aggregate demand functions to study firm behavior are the endogeneity of marketing activities (typically, price) and heterogeneity across consumers in the market under consideration. Ignoring these issues in the estimation of the demand function parameters can lead to biased and inconsistent estimates for the effects of marketing activities. Endogeneity and heterogeneity have achieved prominence in large measure because of the increasing popularity of logit models to characterize demand functions using aggregate data. The logit model accounts for purchase incidence and brand choice by including a "no-purchase" alternative in the consumer's choice set. This allows for category sales to change as a function of the marketing activities of brands in the category.
   There are three issues with using the logit model with the no-purchase option to characterize demand when studying competitive interactions among firms. (1) The marketing literature dealing with brand choice behavior at the consumer level has found that the IIA restriction is not appropriate, as each brand in the choice set is more similar to some brands than it is to others. (2) Studies have found that the purchase incidence decision is distinct from the brand choice decision. Hence, it may not be appropriate to model the no-purchase decision as just another alternative in the choice set with the IIA restriction holding across all brands and the no-purchase option. (3) Even if the distinction between the purchase incidence and brand choice decisions is accounted for via, for example, a nested logit specification, accounting for the purchase incidence decision with aggregate data requires assumptions for computing the share of the no-purchase alternative which is otherwise unobserved.
   In this paper, we propose a probit model as an alternative to the logit model to specify the aggregate demand functions of firms competing in oligopoly markets. The probit model avoids the IIA property that affects the logit model at the individual consumer level. Furthermore, the probit model can naturally account for the distinction between the purchase incidence and brand choice decisions due to the general covariance structure assumed for the utilities of the alternatives. We demonstrate how the parameters of the proposed model can be estimated using aggregate time series data from a product market. In the estimation, we account for the endogeneity of marketing variables as well as for heterogeneity across consumers.
   Our results indicate that both endogeneity as well as heterogeneity need to be accounted for even after allowing for a non-IIA specification at the individual consumer level. Specific to our data, we also find that ignoring endogeneity has a bigger impact on the estimated price elasticities than ignoring the effects of heterogeneity. A comparison of the elasticities obtained from the probit model with those from the corresponding logit specification indicates that the range of elasticities obtained from the probit model across brands is larger than that obtained from the logit. The results have implications for issues such as firm-level pricing.
   In addition to specifying a probit model and providing comparisons with the logit model, the paper also addresses the third issue raised above. We propose a simple alternative to the purchase incidence/brand choice specification by decomposing the demand for a brand into a category demand equation and a conditional brand choice share equation. We provide a comparison of results from this specification to those from the specification that includes the no-purchase alternative and find that estimated elasticities are sensitive to the specification used. We also estimate the demand function parameters using a traditional specification such as the double-logarithmic model. Here, we find that the estimated elasticities could be signed in such a manner as to be not useful for firm-level pricing decisions.
   One of the key limitations of the proposed model is that while it accounts for the purchase incidence and brand choice decisions of households, it does not account for differences across consumers in their purchase quantities. The model and analysis are best Suited for product categories in which consumers typically make single-unit purchases, Another limitation is more practical in nature. While recent advances have been made in computing probit probabilities, it could nevertheless be a challenge to do so when the number of alternatives is large.

TI The category-demand effects of price promotions
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Although price promotions have increased in both commercial use and quantity of academic research over the last decade, most of the attention has been focused on their effects on brand choice and brand sales. By contrast, little is known about the conditions under which price promotions expand short-run and long-run category demand, even though the benefits of category expansion can be substantial to manufacturers and retailers alike.
   This paper studies the category-demand effects of consumer price promotions across 560 consumer product categories over a 4-year period. The data describe national sales in Dutch supermarkets and cover virtually the entire marketing mix, i.e., prices, promotions, advertising, distribution, and new-product activity. We focus on the estimation of main effects (i.e., the dynamic category expansive impact of price promotions) as well as the moderating effects of marketing intensity and competition (both conduct and structure) on short- and long-run promotional effectiveness.
   The research design uses modern multivariate time-series analysis to disentangle short-run and long-run effects. First, we conduct a series of unit-root tests to determine whether or not category demand is stationary or evolving over time. The results are incorporated in the specification of vector-autoregressive models with exogenous variables (VARX models). The impulse-response functions derived from these VARX models provide estimates of the short- and long-term effects of price promotions on category demand. These estimates, in turn, are used as dependent variables in a series of second-stage regressions that assess the explanatory power of marketing intensity and competition. Several model validation tests support the robustness of the empirical findings.
   We present our results in the form of empirical generalizations on the main effects of price promotions on category demand in the short and the long run and through statistical tests on how these effects change with marketing intensity and competition. The findings generate an overall picture of the power and limitations of consumer price promotions in expanding category demand, as follows.
   Category demand is found to be predominantly stationary, either around a fixed mean or a deterministic trend. Although the total net short-term effects of price promotions are generally strong, with an average elasticity of 2.21 and a more conservative median elasticity of 1.75, they rarely exhibit persistent effects. Instead, the effects dissipate over a time period lasting approximately 10 weeks on average, and their long-term impact is essentially zero. By contrast the successful introduction of new products into a category is more frequently associated with a permanent category-demand increase.
   Several moderating effects on price-promotion effectiveness exist. More frequent promotions increase their effectiveness, but only in the short run. The use of nonprice advertising reduces the category-demand effects of price promotions, both in the short run and in the long run. Competitive structure matters as well: The less oligopolistic the category, the smaller the short-run effectiveness of price promotions. At the same time, we find that the dominant form of competitive reaction, either in price promotion or in advertising, is no reaction. Short-run category-demand effectiveness of price promotions is lower in categories experiencing major new-product introductions. Finally, both the short- and long-run price promotion effectiveness is higher in perishable product categories.
   The paper discusses several managerial implications of these empirical findings and suggests various avenues for future research. Overall, we conclude that the power of price promotions lies primarily in the preservation of the status quo in the category.

TI Individual marketing with imperfect targetability
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Our research investigates the competitive ramifications of individual marketing and information management in today's information-intensive marketing environments. The specific managerial issues we address are as follows. First, what kinds of incentive environments do competing firms face when they can only target individual customers imperfectly? Second, does the improvement in an industry's targetability intensify price competition in the industry such that all competing firms become worse off? Third, should a firm share its customer knowledge so as to improve its rival's targetability? Fourth, how should an information vendor sell its information that can improve a firm's targetability? Finally, do competing firms have the same incentives to invest in their own targetability?
   To answer those questions, we develop a simple model a la Narasimhan (1988), in which each of the two competing firms have their own loyal customers and compete for common switchers. We assume that each firm can classify its own loyal customers and switchers correctly only with a less-than-perfect probability. This means that each firm's perceived customer segmentation differs from the actual customer segmentation. Based on their perceived reality, these two competing firms engage in price competition. As an extension, we also allow the competing firms to make their investment decisions to acquire targetability.
   We show that when individual marketing is feasible, but imperfect, improvements in targetability by either or both competing firms can lead to win-win competition for both even if both players behave noncooperatively and the market does not expand. Win-win competition results from the fact that as a firm becomes better at distinguishing its price-insensitive loyal customers from the switchers, it is motivated to charge a higher price to the former. However, due to imperfect targetability, each firm mistakenly perceives some price-sensitive switchers as price-insensitive loyal customers and charges them all a higher price. These misperceptions thus allow its competitors to acquire those mistargeted customers without lowering their prices and,hence, reduce the rival firm's incentive to cut prices. This effect softens price competition in the market and qualitatively changes the incentive environment for competing firms engaged in individual marketing. A "prisoner's dilemma" occurs only when targetability in a market reaches a sufficiently high level.
   This win-win perspective on individual marketing has many managerial implications. First, we show that superior knowledge of individual customers can be a competitive advantage. However, this does not mean that a firm should always protect its customer information from its competitors. To the contrary, we find that competing firms can all benefit from exchanging individual customer information with each other at the nascent stage of individual marketing, when firms' targetability is low. Indeed, under certain circumstances, a firm may even find it profitable to give away this information unilaterally. However, as individual marketing matures (as firms' targetability becomes sufficiently high), further improvements in targetability will intensify price competition and lead to prisoner's dilemma. Therefore, it is not only prudent politics but also a business imperative for an industry to seize the initiative on the issue of protecting customer privacy so as to ensure win-win competition in the industry.
   Second, we show that the firm with a larger number of loyal customers tends to invest more in targetability when the cost of acquiring targetability is high. However, the firm with a smaller loyal base can, through information investment, acquire a higher level of targetability than the firm with a larger loyal base as long as the cost of acquiring targetability is not too high. As the cost further decreases, competing firms will all have more incentives to increase their investments in targetability until they achieve the highest feasible level.
   Third, an information vendor should make its information available nonexclusively (exclusively) when its information is associated with a low (high) level of targetability. When the vendor does sell its information exclusively, it should target a firm with a small loyal following if it can impart a high level of targetability to that firm.
   Finally, our analysis shows that an information-intensive environment does not doom small firms. In fact, individual marketing may provide a good opportunity for a small firm to leapfrog a large firm. The key to leapfrogging is a high level of targetability or customer knowledge.

TI Competitive pricing behavior in the auto market: A structural analysis
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In a competitive marketplace, the effectiveness of any element of the marketing mix is determined not only by its absolute value, but also by its relative value with respect to the competition. For example, the effectiveness of a price cut in increasing demand is critically related to competitors' reaction to the price change. Managers therefore need to know the nature of competitive interactions among firms.
   In this paper, we take a theory-driven empirical approach to gain a deeper understanding of the competitive pricing behavior in the U.S. auto market. The ability-motivation paradigm posits that a firm needs both the ability and the motivation to succeed in implementing a strategy (Boulding and Staelin 1995). We use arguments from the game-theoretic literature to understand firm motivation and abilities in different segments of the auto market. We then combine these insights from the game-theoretic literature and the ability-motivation paradigm to develop hypotheses about competition in different segments of the U.S. auto market. To test our hypotheses of competitive behavior, we estimate a structural model that disentangles the competition effect from the demand and cost effects on prices.
   The theory of repeated games predicts that firms with a long-run profitability objective will try to sustain cooperative pricing behavior as a stable equilibrium when conditions permit. For example, markets with high concentration and stable market environments are favorable for sustaining cooperative behavior and therefore provide firms with the ability to cooperate. The theory of switching costs suggests that in markets in which a firm's current customers tend to be loyal, firms have a motivation to compete very aggressively for new customers, recognizing the positive benefits of loyalty from the customer base in the long run. As consumer loyalty in the market increases, the gains from increasing market share by means of aggressive competitive behavior are more than offset by losses in profit margins. Firms therefore have the motivation to price cooperatively.
   Empirically, we find aggressive behavior in the minicompact and subcompact segments, cooperative behavior in the compact and midsize segments, and Bertrand behavior in the full-size segment. These findings are consistent with our theory-based hypotheses about competition in different segments.
   In estimating a structural model of the auto market, we address several methodological issues. A particular difficulty is the large number of car models in the U.S. auto market. Existing studies have inferred competitive behavior only in markets with two to four products. They also use relatively simple functional forms of demand to facilitate easy estimation. Functional forms of demand, however, impose structure on cross-elasticities between products. Such structure, when inappropriate, can bias the estimates of competitive interaction. We therefore use the random coefficients logit demand model to allow flexibility in cross-elasticities. We also use recent advances in New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) to extend structural estimation of competitive behavior to markets with a large number of products. We use the simulation-based estimation approach developed by Berry et al. (1995) to estimate our model.
   A frequent criticism of the NEIO approach is that its focus on industry-specific studies limits the generalizability of its findings. In this study, we retain the advantages of NEIO methods but partially address the issue of generalizability by analyzing competitive behavior in multiple segments within the auto industry to see whether there is a consistent pattern that can be explained by theory. Theoretical modelers can use our results to judge the appropriateness of their models in predicting competitive outcomes for the markets that they analyze.
   A by-product of our analysis is that we also get estimates of demand and cost apart from competitive interactions for the market. Managers can use these estimates to perform "what-if" analysis. They can answer questions about what prices to charge when a new product is introduced or when an existing product's characteristics are changed.

TI Equilibrium price communication and unadvertised specials by competing
   supermarkets
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper is concerned with how retailers, supermarkets in particular, communicate price discounts and use unadvertised specials. A common practice for supermarkets is to communicate price deals on some products through newspaper advertisements, while communicating discounts on other products through in-store mechanisms such as shelf-talkers. This raises the question: So far as store choice is concerned, how might consumers take into account not only advertised prices at competing stores, but also expected prices of unadvertised goods? It also begs the question of why stores have unadvertised specials since their effect on store choice is not quite the same as the advertised discounts. Further, competing supermarkets advertise the same products part of the time, and different products at other times. They also tend to sometimes advertise a product in consecutive weeks, but sometimes not. Can these actions be part of a strategy? We formulate a game-theoretic model of retail competition by first extending the work of La1 and Matutes (1994) and then developing an alternative framework to answer these questions. Our model has two retailers, each of whom carries two goods. To simplify exposition, we assume that the stores are symmetric, the two goods are symmetric in their reservation prices, and are neither substitutes nor complements. Consumers are identical in their preferences and consumer heterogeneity is in the convenience that each store presents to a representative consumer. The stores may advertise the price of one good, reflecting the reality that stores do not advertise their whole assortment. They compete through advertising and prices to maximize profits. We thus recognize the strategic role of advertised prices and furthermore, we investigate the strategic role of unadvertised prices in retail competition. For this model, we derive a Rational Expectations Nash equilibrium in which each store randomly advertises the price of one good following a mixed strategy. Consumer expectations of the prices of the unadvertised goods are rational. We obtain three kinds of results. First, unadvertised specials occur in equilibrium, and induce temporal and cross-sectional variation in the identity of advertised goods, consistent with casual observation. In this equilibrium, the two stores advertise the same good part of the time and different goods at other times. When they advertise the same good they do not offer any unadvertised discount on the other good. However, when they advertise different goods, they offer an unadvertised discount on the good that they do not advertise. Intuitively, unadvertised discounts come about because stores randomize the identity of the advertised good in the mixed strategy equilibrium. If retailers were to advertise the same good at all times, they would have to compete intensely for store traffic and therefore discount the advertised good very deeply. And, having done so, they would find it optimal to set the unadvertised good at the reservation price and offer no discount on it. However, if stores randomize the advertised good as shown in this paper, both stores advertise the same good some of the time and at other times they advertise different goods. Because they advertise different goods some of the time, they do not fight intensely for store traffic on just one good, but rather they find it optimal to offer a discount on the unadvertised good also.
   As a result, an implication of our equilibrium for consumer choice is that unadvertised discounts affect store choice, and in equilibrium some consumers may shop around. Second, we obtain managerial insights into the role of unadvertised specials. They affect store choice, prevent consumer shopping around either fully or partly, and reduce head-to-head competition on the price of the advertised good. The most salient strategic implication of retailers' offering unadvertised discounts is to reduce competition among stores, and this is again due to the randomization strategy of the stores. In fact, stores can reduce head-to-head competition further by increasing the number of products in their assortment and randomizing on the advertised good from this assortment. Third, we provide a resolution of the Diamond (1971) paradox, which says that prices at competing stores approach the monopoly price. In our equilibrium, expected prices of both advertised and unadvertised goods are always below the monopoly price.

TI Customer referral management: Optimal reward programs
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Sellers who plan to capitalize on the lifetime value of customers need to manage the sales potential from customer referrals proactively. To encourage existing customers to generate referrals, a seller can offer exceptional value to current customers through either excellent quality or a very attractive price. Rewards to customers for referring other customers can also encourage referrals. We investigate when referral rewards should be offered to motivate referrals and derive the optimal combination of reward and price that will lead to the most profitable referrals.
   We define a delighted customer as one who obtains a positive level of surplus above a threshold level and, consequently, recommends the product to another customer. We show that the use of referral rewards depends on how demanding consumers are before they are willing to recommend (i.e., on the delight threshold level). The optimal mix of price and referral reward falls into three regions: (1) When customers are easy to delight, the optimal strategy is to lower the price below that of a seller who ignores the referral effect but not to offer rewards. (2) In an intermediate level of customer delight threshold, a seller should use a reward to complement a low-price strategy. As the delight threshold gets higher in this region, price should be higher and the rewards should be raised. (3) When the delight threshold is even higher, the seller should forsake the referral strategy all together. No rewards should be given, and price reverts back to that of a seller who ignores referrals. These results are consistent with the fact that referral rewards are not offered in all markets.
   Our analysis highlights the differences between lowering price and offering rewards as tools to motivate referrals. Lowering price is attractive because the seller "kills two birds with one stone": a lower price increases the probability of an initial purchase and the likelihood of referral. Unfortunately, a low price also creates a "free-riding" problem, because some customers benefit from the low price but do not refer other customers. Free riding becomes more severe with an increasing delight threshold; therefore, motivating referrals through low price is less attractive at high threshold levels. A referral reward helps to alleviate this problem, because of its "pay for performance" incentive (only actual referrals are rewarded.) Unfortunately, rewards can sometimes be given to customers who would have recommended anyway, causing a waste of company resources. The lower the delight threshold level, the bigger the waste and, therefore, motivating referrals through rewards loses attractiveness.
   Our theory highlights the advantage of using referral rewards in addition to lowering price to motivate referrals. It explains why referral programs are offered sometimes but not always and provides guidelines to managers on how to set the price and reward optimally.

TI Optimal pricing of new subscription services: Analysis of a market
   experiment
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB There are now available a number of new subscription services that comprise a dual pricing system of a monthly access fee (rental) and a per-minute usage charge. Examples include cellular phones, the Internet, and pay TV. The usage and retention of such services depend on the absolute and relative prices of this dual system. For instance, a moderate access fee but a low-usage charge might initially appeal to customers, but later a low-usage customer might find the monthly fee unjustified and thereby relinquish the service. Providers of such services, therefore, usually offer several pricing packages to cater to differing customer needs.
   The purpose of this study is to derive a revenue-maximizing strategy for subscription services, that is, the combination of access and usage price that maximizes revenue over a specified time period. An additional objective is to determine access and usage price elasticities because they have historically played an important role in theoretical pricing models. The application area is the cellular phone market, but for a new rather than an existing product. To help gauge the likely usage rates and customer retention, a field experiment is conducted in which several alternative price combinations are used. Specifically, a sample of potential residential customers (most of whom did not have an existing cell phone) were divided into four treatment groups. The first group were not charged an access fee but did have to pay a small per-minute usage charge. The second group also paid a small usage charge but in addition had three access price increases over the duration of the trial. The third group paid no access fee but had usage charge increases, while the fourth group had both access fee and usage charge increases. Usage levels for each respondent are recorded, as is their month of dropout if they discontinue the service.
   An initial examination of the data shows that higher access fees result in higher customer attrition, and higher usage cost results in lower usage. Furthermore, usage and retention are related in that declining usage levels over time often signal impending customer attrition. Hence, two phenomena need to be modeled: usage of the service and customer retention conditional on usage. Some seasonal effects are also observed and are allowed for in the model. Mod- eling customer attrition simultaneously with usage is important because ignoring customer attrition will likely result In an underestimate of price sensitivity. This results from a censoring effect, whereby respondents who remain in the trial tend to be wealthier, and hence, less price sensitive.
   Given the known problems of ignoring customer attrition, we develop a theoretical model of usage, which explicitly incorporates attrition by extending a time-series model introduced by Hausman and Wise (1979). We make two extensions of the Hausman and Wise model. The first is to generalize it from two to many time periods and the second is to allow for respondent heterogeneity by incorporating latent classes. We fit the model by maximum likelihood and find that a two-segment model is best. In addition, we examine the predictive validity of our model and find it to be reasonably good.
   In general, the results show that access and usage prices have different relative effects on demand and retention. There are five key results. First, access price has some effect on usage but a much stronger effect on retention. Second, usage price has a strong effect on usage and a moderate effect on retention, in that if usage price increases so much that usage declines, then lower usage levels results in higher attrition. Third, access price elasticity is about half that of usage price, with both elasticities generally being much smaller than 1, indicating relative inelasticity for this particular service. Fourth, customer attrition rate (churn) is much more sensitive to access than usage price and, last, if just observed usage is examined and customer attrition is ignored, then price sensitivity is very likely to be substantially underestimated (on the order of 45% in our case).
   Finally, when developing the revenue-maximizing price combination we allow for the cost of customer acquisition by using some typical advertising-to-sales ratios for the telecommunications industry. We find that the revenue maximizing price is $27.70 per month for the access fee and $0.81 per minute for the airtime charge. These values are in line with current access fees and usage costs in the given market.

TI Pricing access services
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Many established industries, such as the online service industry, the telecommunication industry, or the fitness club industry, are access service industries. When using services in these industries, consumers pay for the privilege of accessing the firm's facilities but do not acquire any right to the facility itself. A firm's pricing decisions in access industries frequently come down to a simple choice among flat fee pricing, usage pricing, or two-part tariff pricing. However, it is not so simple for firms in those industries to make this choice. Access service firms typically face a mix of consumers who have intrinsically different usage rates. A key characteristic of access service firms, however, is that the cost of providing an additional minute of usage is typically negligible, as long as the firm has the necessary capacity to serve its customers. Service capacity, which corresponds to the total available time on a firm's system, is often limited.
   In this paper, we show that service capacity and consumer usage heterogeneity are two important factors that determine a firm's optimal choice. We develop a model that incorporates these two salient characteristics shared by access industries and study what determines a firm's choice among the three alternative pricing structures (flat fee pricing, usage pricing, or two-part tariff pricing). Our analysis shows that, in the presence of consumer usage heterogeneity, service capacity mediates a firm's optimal choice in a complex, yet predictable way. A firm's choice also hinges on whether heavy or light users are more valuable in terms of their willingness-to-pay on a per-unit-capacity basis. The presence of both consumer usage heterogeneity and capacity constraints prompts a firm to choose its pricing structure to attract a desired customer mix and to price discriminate. As a result, two-part tariff pricing is not always optimal in access industries, and a firm's pricing structure can vary in a complex way with the interaction of those two factors.
   Specifically, we show that when light users are more valuable, a firm may use a two-part tariff or a flat fee, depending on whether the firm is constrained by its service capacity, but never charge a usage price alone or offer any signing bonus (a negative flat fee or a flat payment to customers). When heavy users are more valuable, a firm may choose to set a usage price, a signing bonus plus a usage price, or a flat fee. Interestingly, regardless of whether heavy or light users are more valuable in an access service industry, only flat rate pricing is a sustainable pricing structure once the industry has developed sufficient excess capacity.
   We also show that the optimal pricing strategy in access industries can have some intriguing, nonintuitive implications that have not been explored elsewhere. For instance, when the industry capacity is unevenly distributed between competing firms, the large-capacity firm may well be advised to increase, rather than to decrease, its price to accommodate the small firm. It would be too costly and too tactless for the large firm to do otherwise. In fact, the strategy of accommodation calls on the larger firm to retreat in both light and heavy user markets and leave more of its capacity idle and more of the market demand unmet when the small firm's capacity (hence, the industry capacity) increases. This implies that incremental policy measures that encourage the growth of smaller companies in the presence of a large company can be welfare-decreasing because the growth of a smaller firm can force the retreat of a large company at the expense of market coverage.
   Today, services account for two-thirds to three-quarters of the GNP, not only in the United States but also in many industrial countries. Access industries are growing rapidly to exert profound impact on today's economy. However, service pricing in general and pricing access services in particular have not received adequate attention in the literature. In this paper, we take the first step in understanding how capacity constraints and consumer usage heterogeneity mediate the choice of pricing structures in both monopolistic and competitive contexts.

TI Identifying spatial segments in international markets
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The identification of geographic target markets is critical to the success of companies that are expanding internationally. Country borders have traditionally been used to delineate such target markets, resulting in accessible segments and cost efficient entry strategies. However, at present such "countries-as-segments" strategies may no longer be valid. In response to the accelerating trend toward global market convergence and within-country fragmentation of consumer needs, cross-national consumer segmentation is increasingly used, in which consumers in different countries are grouped based on the similarities in their needs, ignoring the country borders.
   In this paper, we propose new methodology that helps to improve the identification of spatial segments by using information on the location of consumers. Our methodology identifies spatial segments based on consumer needs and at the same time uses spatial information at the subcountry level. We suggest that segments of consumers are likely to demonstrate spatial patterns and develop a hierarchical Bayes approach specifying several types of spatial dependence. Rather than assigning consumers to segments, we identify spatial segments consisting of predefined regions. We develop four models specifying different types of spatial dependence. Two models characterize situations of spatial independence and countries-as-segments, which represent existing approaches to international segmentation. The other two models accommodate spatial association within and spatial contiguity of segments and are new to the segmentation literature. The models account for within-segment heterogeneity in multiattribute-based segmentation, covering numerous applications in response-based market segmentation. We show that the models can be estimated using Gibbs sampling, where for the spatial contiguity model, a rejection sampling procedure is proposed.
   We conduct an analysis of synthetic data to assess the performance of the most restrictive spatial segmentation model in situations where spatial patterns do or do not underlie the data-generating process. Data for which the true properties are known were analyzed with models of spatial contiguity and spatial independence of segments. The results indicate that a substantial improvement in parameter recovery may be realized if a spatial pattern underlies the data-generating process, but that the spatial-independence model may provide a better alternative when this is not the case.
   We empirically illustrate our approach in the setting of international retailing, using survey data collected among consumers in seven countries of the European Union. A store image measurement instrument was used. This instrument is based on the multiattribute model of store image formation, with overall evaluations of stores as a dependent variable and image perceptions as predictor variables. The segmentation basis consists of (latent) importances of store image attributes, i.e., product quality, service quality, assortment, pricing, store atmosphere, and location. We argue that store image attribute importances are likely to display spatial variation and expect spatial concentration of segments, or even contiguity, to occur.
   We apply and compare the four spatial segmentation models to the store image data. The countries-as-segments model receives lowest support from the data, less than that of the spatially independence model, which is in line with the current notion that consumer preferences cut across national borders. However, the spatially contiguity model and spatial-association model demonstrate the best fit. Although the differences between the various models are not very large, we find support, consistent across the two fit indices, for the spatial models.
   Substantive results are presented for the spatial contiguity model. We identified five spatial segments that cut across borders. The segments give rise to different retail positioning strategies, and their importance estimates and location demonstrate face validity.

TI Close encounters of two kinds: False alarms and dashed hopes
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB People are frequently exposed to potentially attractive events that are subsequently and unexpectedly reversed and to potentially painful events, which are also unexpectedly reversed. In the process of being returned to the initial asset position, does the sequence in which the positive and negative events occur matter? This issue of the combined effect of pleasurable and painful stimuli has received scant theoretical or empirical attention. We attempt to fill this lacuna in the literature by studying the retrospective evaluation of surprises that return individuals to their original economic state. Although such surprises do not change an individual's original economic state, we argue that the individual's psychological state changes, and the final affective state is, among other things, a function of the sequence in which the events occur.
   From a theoretical standpoint, several perspectives can be brought to bear on the issue. For instance, one reading of mental accounting, based on prospect theory's value function, would predict that losses should dominate gains, and therefore, regardless of sequence, people should be unhappy when exposed to two economically equivalent outcomes of different signs. Conversely, the literature on intertemporal choice would suggest that a series that ends on an up note is preferred to a series that ends on a down note, because people like to defer gratification so that they may savor positive outcomes. Similarly, people apparently have a preference for "happy endings." Finally, the extant literature on "recency effects" would predict that the last event in a series should have a disproportionate influence on overall affect.
   Our model relies on a shift in the reference point to explain how a surprising reversal of an event will lead to a nonzero evaluation of the sequence. We suggest that people's reference points shift immediately but imperfectly after a stimulus is presented. Intuitively, this implies that the first stimulus will shift the reference point in its direction, as a result of which the evaluation of a sequence of events in which an initial event is unexpectedly reversed will be more favorable if the first event is a loss than if it is a gain. This model captures the unanticipated nature of the second event (i.e., the surprise element) by allowing the first event to move the reference point. Consequently, by the time the next event occurs the reference point has been updated, as a result of which the zero economic outcome of the sequence yields nonzero utility. We further posit that the magnitude of the reference point shift should be affected by the time elapsed between the two stimuli. Specifically, the reference point shifts gradually with time, until it is fully updated. Consequently, the final affective state of the sequence is also a function of the temporal distance between the two events.
   The main predictions of the model were empirically supported first in a Survey using a mall-intercept sample. Subsequently, we conducted a study of student subjects involving a coin-tossing game in which real money was at stake and in which subjects in one condition experienced the second outcome after a two-day delay. Our results from this second study supported the model's prediction regarding the impact of the elapsed time between the events. The experimental tasks involved surprising reversals of initial outcomes, thus ensuring that "savoring/dread" types of explanations (which require that subjects anticipate the second event) could not be operating. Finally, in a series of three follow-up studies, we tested the claim that the magnitude of outcomes would have an impact on observed affect, and consistent with our theory and contrary to recency predictions, we observed similar results across different magnitudes.
   While theoretically interesting, we should also note that our research is of potential pragmatic significance. People's reactions to a series of events is of considerable interest to marketers desirous of generating enhanced attitude, affect, purchase intention, and the like without offering economic inducements such as rebates, coupons, or other costly discounts. Additionally, public policy officials may be interested in protecting people from being manipulated into purchasing a product simply because of changes in the sequence in which a series of offers is made by the merchant.

TI Research note consumer addressability and customized pricing
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The increasing availability of customer information is giving many firms the ability to reach and customize price and other marketing efforts to the tastes of the individual consumer. This ability is labeled as consumer addressability. Consumer addressability through sophisticated databases is particularly important for direct-marketing firms, catalog retailers such as L.L Bean and Land's End, credit card-issuing banks, and firms in the long-distance telephone market. We examine the strategic implications of consumer addressability on competition between database/direct marketing firms. We address questions such as: In a competitive environment, how should firms invest in addressability? Will future improvements in the degree of addressability increase or mitigate the intensity of competition between the firms? Will greater addressability always be beneficial for firms?
   We model competition between two firms in a market where consumers differ on a horizontal attribute of product differentiation. The market comprises consumers located on a linear attribute space and firms located at the ends of the line. We represent the degree of addressability (or the reach of a firm's database) as the proportion of consumers at each point in the market who are in the firm's database. Consequently, the firm can offer these consumers customized prices.
   Consumer addressability creates two effects that govern the competition between firms: a "surplus extraction" effect because a firm might address a consumer who is not reached by its competitor and a "competitive" effect that is created by the set of consumers who can be addressed by both firms. The key results of the paper pertain to when the addressability decision is endogenous. When the extent of market differentiation (or consumer heterogeneity in preferences for a product/brand attribute), as well as the incremental cost of addressability, are sufficiently large, firms make symmetric investments in equilibrium. Given high costs, firms choose sufficiently low levels of addressability. Low addressability and high levels of market differentiation both help reduce price competition, which facilitates symmetric choice of addressability by the firms in equilibrium. However, when market differentiation and the cost of incremental addressability become small, firms face the prospect of destructive competition. As a result, they strategically differentiate in their choice of addressability to mitigate this competition. Interestingly, even in the extreme case when incremental addressability is costless, not every firm chooses full addressability in equilibrium. This has useful implications for direct marketing. Given that the advances in information technology should improve the ability of firms to address their consumers, it might indeed not be desirable for all direct marketing firms to indefinitely pursue greater addressability as costs of doing so decline. The analysis also shows an interesting effect of market differentiation in addressable markets: Equilibrium profits can decrease with an increase in market differentiation when the marginal cost of addressability is sufficiently high. Finally, we discuss the competitive outcome that would result when firms compete with addressable as well as uniform posted prices.

TI Research note the impact of heterogeneity and ill-conditioning on
   diffusion model parameter estimates
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Assessment of accurate market size and early adoption patterns is essential to strategic decision making of managers involved in new-product launches. This article proposes methodology that explains changes in parameter estimates of the Bass model, p (coefficient of innovation), q (coefficient of imitation), and c (market penetration rate) by direction of "extra-Bass" skew in the data, or equivalently, by underlying heterogeneity of the population. This research shows significantly opposite patterns of these parameter estimates, depending on skew of the diffusion curve detected by a generalized model, i.e., the gamma/shifted Gompertz (G/SG) model, which embeds the Bass model as a special case. The G/SG model originally presented in Bemmaor (1994) is based on two assumptions: (1) Individual-level times to first purchase are distributed shifted Gompertz and (2) individual-level propensity to buy follows a gamma distribution across the population. We assume that the scale parameter of the shifted Gompertz distribution is constant across consumers. The advantage the G/SG model has over alternative diffusion models such as the nonuniform influence model is that its cumulative distribution function takes a closed-form expression.
   In line with Van den Bulte and Lilien (1997), we analyze these opposite patterns from simulated data using the G/SG model as the true model and 12 real adoption data sets. The patterns am (1) as the level of censoring decreases, the estimates of p and c decrease and those of q increase when data exhibit more right skew than the Bass model and (2) the estimates of p and c-increase and those of q decrease when data exhibit more left skew than the Bass model. For the simulated data, we manipulated four dimensions: (1) "extra-Bass" skew-in the-data, (2) ratio q/p, (3) speed of diffusion, and (4) error variance. Both results of the simulated data and the real-adoption data sets confirm the existence of two opposite patterns of parameter estimates of the Bass model depending on "extra-Bass" skew.
   When the model is correctly specified with simulated data, estimates of c increase and those of q decrease for both the Bass and the G/SG models. The estimates of p increase as one adds data points only for the G/SG model. No significant tendency in parameter estimates of p was detected for the Bass model. As for ill-conditioning issues, systematic changes in the parameter estimates of the G/SG model can be substantially larger in some cases than those obtained with the Bass model, even though the data were generated by taking the G/SG model as the true one. Therefore, model complexity can aggravate the tendency for parameters to change systematically as one adds data points.
   The forecasting results from the simulated data show the supremacy of the G/SG model. It provides more accurate results than the Bass model in the one-step ahead, two-step ahead, and three-step ahead forecasts. With the real data set, the G/SG model provides more accurate one-step ahead forecasts than the Bass model, but the model's forecasting performance deteriorates more rapidly than the Bass model when one shifts to two-step ahead and three-step ahead forecasts. The systematic changes in parameter estimates are larger for the more complex model.
   Our research shows that the G/SG model is a flexible model used to analyze the systematic changes in parameter estimates when specification error and ill-conditioning occur. As our findings incorporate two possible types of parameter estimate bias, compared to the previous single-direction view, they can provide essential information to enhance forecasting accuracy of products and services using new technological innovations. Our forecasting results of simulated and real adoption data raise a question about the optimal horizon of forecasting in applying flexible models of diffusion. The G/SG model also provides grounds to investigate jointly "the speed of takeoff" and "the diffusion speed after takeoff".

TI Modeling consumer demand for variety
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumers are often observed to purchase more than one variety of a product on a given shopping trip. The simultaneous demand for varieties is observed not only for packaged goods such as yogurt or soft drinks, but in many other product categories such as movies, music compact disks, and apparel. Multinomial (MN) choice models cannot be applied to data exhibiting the simultaneous choice of more than one variety. The random utility interpretation of either the MN logit or probit model uses a linear utility specification that cannot accommodate interior solutions with more than one variety (alternative) chosen.
   To analyze data with multiple varieties chosen requires a nonstandard utility specification. Standard demand models in the economics literature exhibit only interior solutions. We propose a demand model based on a translated additive utility structure. The model nests the linear utility structure, while allowing for the possibility of a mixture of corner and interior solutions where more than one but not all varieties are selected. We use a random utility specification in which the unobservable portion of marginal utility follows a log-normal distribution. The distribution of quantity demanded (the basis of the likelihood function) is derived from these log-normal random utility errors. The likelihood function for this class of models with mixtures of corner and interior solutions is a mixed distribution with both a continuous density portion and probability mass points for the corners. The probability mass points must be calculated by integrals of the log-normal errors over rectangular regions. We evaluate these high-dimensional integrals using the GHK approximation. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical model, allowing household-specific utility parameters.
   Our utility specification related to the approach of Wales and Woodland (1983) who employ a translated quadratic utility function. Wales and Woodland were only able to study, at the most, three varieties because there was no practical way to evaluate the utility function at that time. In addition, the quadratic utility specification is not a globally valid utility function, making welfare computations and policy experiments questionable. Hendel (1999) and Dube (1999) present an alternative approach in the utility function which is constructed by summing up over unobservable consumption occasions. While only one variety is consumed on each occasion, the marginal utilities of varieties change over the consumption occasions, giving rise to a simultaneous purchase of multiple varieties.
   Our Bayesian inference approach allows us to obtain individual household estimates of utility parameters. Household utility estimates are used to compute the value of each variety. We compute a compensating value for the removal of each flavor; that is, we compute the monetary equivalent of the household's loss in utility from removal of a flavor. These calculations show that households highly value popular flavors and would incur substantial utility losses from removal of these flavors from the yogurt assortment.
   Next we consider the implications of our model for retailer assortment and pricing policies. Given limited shelf space, only a subset of the possible varieties can be displayed for purchase at any one time. If consumers value variety, then a retailer with lower variety must compensate the consumers in some way, such as a lower price level. We see this trade-off between price and variety across different retailing formats. Discount or warehouse format retailers often have both lower variety and lower prices. To measure this trade-off, we explore the utility loss from reduction in variety and find the reductions in price that will compensate for this utility loss. These price reduction calculations must be based on a valid utility structure.
   Heterogeneity in tastes is critical in these utility computations and policy experiments. We find that a relatively small fraction of households with extreme preferences dominate the compensating value computations. That is, some households are observed to purchase mostly or exclusively one variety. These households must be heavily compensated for the removal of this variety from the assortment. In some retailing contexts, customization of the assortment is possible at the customer level. We show that such customization virtually eliminates any utility loss from reduction in variety.

TI Reputation in marketing channels: Repeated-transactions bargaining with
   two-sided uncertainty
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Marketing channel interactions typically feature three characteristics that have not been incorporated together in an analytic study: (1) the parties can do business repeatedly over time, often under different terms of trade (e.g., prices may vary), (2) the terms that the seller offers one buyer may be different from those she offers another, giving each interaction the flavor of bilateral monopoly bargaining, and (3) the buyer and seller come to the interaction uncertain about the valuations each holds for the good, but they do know each other's reputation for valuation. The seller might, for example, come to the bargaining table aware that the buyer has a strong reputation for being willing to pay only low prices, and the buyer might come aware that the seller is strongly reputed for high cost and is, therefore, willing to offer only high prices.
   The latter characteristic raises an interesting question: When engaged in a marketing channel interaction, what type of reputation is best for a buyer or seller to take to the bargaining table? In this paper, we answer that question by incorporating each of the characteristics that typify channel interactions in a formal game-theoretic bargaining model. We determine how the reputations that buyers and sellers bring to the bargaining table affect their equilibrium strategies and payoffs.
   Our analysis shows that, in general, the best reputation for the seller to take to the bargaining table is one that makes the buyer nearly certain in his belief that the seller's cost is high, a result that matches intuition. The best reputation for the buyer, however, is counterintuitive. We show that an increase in the buyer's reputed willingness to pay can actually cause the seller to offer a lower price. The best reputation for the buyer to take to the bargaining table is, therefore, one that makes the seller believe that there is a significant chance that he is willing to pay a high price. This result is new to the literature and brings with it immediate managerial implications that we discuss. Our analysis also shows that modeling the buyer as a forward-looking strategic player yields different results than does following the normal convention of modeling the buyer as a nonstrategic price-taker. We discuss why future research on channels and on reference-dependent utility theory should consider these differences.

TI When good news about your rival is good for you: The effect of
   third-party information on the division of channel profits
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The Internet has led to a large number of third-party sources that offer high-quality information about firms's products at little or no cost to consumers. As a result, many of these sources have grown in popularity, extending well-beyond the usual reach of traditional third parties such as Consumer Reports and Kelly's Blue Book. For example, the online version of Edmunds offers, at no cost to consumers, information about new products, existing products, long-term tests, and buyers' guides, all relating to the automotive industry. AvWeb.com delivers weekly aviation news and new product reviews to its readers, and a large number of websites follow developments on computer platforms such as the Apple Macintosh.
   In this paper we analyze how the provision of third-party information affects the division of profits in a multiproduct distribution channel. To illustrate, consider the competition between Microsoft and Apple in the operating systems (OS) market and their channel relationship to CompUSA, a retailer that sells both Macs and Windows-based PCs. Consider two pieces of third-party information. First, suppose that CNET, an Internet technology site, reviews the newest upgrade of the MacOS and writes that the new user interface is even easier to use than previously. Second, suppose that an article in the technology section of the Wall Street journal notes that changes in Apple's networking support now enable Macs to be better integrated into PC networks. These two pieces of information are similar in the sense that they both express good news about the MacOS and thus they both can be expected to benefit Apple by increasing consumer demand for Macs. One might also expect that in both cases CompUSA will capture some of the gains that come from the increased demand for Macs and that Microsoft will lose because the good news about the MacOS will induce some consumers to choose Macs over Windows-based PCs. However, we will show that this intuition is incorrect. The two reviews can have surprisingly different implications for the profits of Microsoft and CompUSA.
   The reason is that the two reviews differ on one crucial dimension: the group of customers for whom they are primarily relevant. The CNET review talks about improvements in the customer interface-precisely what Apple's core consumers care about. The Wall Street journal review talks about compatibility with prevailing PC standards-important to consumers who care relatively more about compatibility and who are thus more likely to prefer Windows (Apple's noncore consumers). We show that good news about the MacOS that is more relevant to Apple's core consumers (the CNET review) benefits Microsoft but harms CompUSA, while good news about the MacOS that is more relevant to Apple's noncore consumers (the Wall Street journal review) has the opposite effect. It harms Microsoft but benefits CompUSA.
   Stated more generally, our main result is that when third-party information affects consumers' product valuations, the type of information that induces the change is critical to understanding which firms gain and which firms lose. In particular, depending on the type of third-party information, we find that (1) a retailer can be harmed by good news about a product that it carries; (2) a manufacturer can gain from good news about a rival's product; and (3) good news about a product category need not benefit all the manufacturers in that category.
   There are three novel features of the analysis. First, we derive the equilibrium division of profit among firms when a retailer sells the products of competing manufacturers, and we have done so while placing few restrictions on the feasible set of contracts. Second, we show how this equilibrium division of profit lends itself to a simple graphical interpretation that depicts which firms gain and which firms lose from third-party information. Third, we provide a taxonomy of information types and identify the key features of each type that cause profit incentives to vary. In particular, we conceptualize information as having three components, namely (1) the products to which the information pertains, (2) whether the information is positive or negative, and (3) the consumers to whom the information is relevant. We show that all three information components play a role in determining the change in each firm's profit.
   Our framework can also be used to analyze a variety of other settings of interest; for example, it can be used to analyze profit incentives when the retailer has bargaining power, when there is downstream competition, and when there are non-information-based changes in consumers' valuations. In addition, our framework may be used both to analyze the effects on profits of persuasive advertising and to predict advertising content.

TI Assessing the service-profit chain
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The service-profit chain (SPC) is a framework for linking service operations, employee assessments, and customer assessments to a firm's profitability (Heskett et al. 1994). The SPC provides an integrative framework for understanding how a firm's operational investments into service operations are related to customer perceptions and behaviors, and how these translate into profits. For a firm, it provides much needed guidance about the complex interrelationships among operational investments, customer perceptions, and the bottom line.
   Implementing the SPC is a pervasive problem among most service firms, and several attempts have been made to model various aspects of the SPC. However, comprehensive approaches to model the SPC are lacking, as most studies have only focused on discrete aspects of the SPC. There is a need for approaches that combine data such as measures of operational inputs, customer perceptions and behaviors, and financial outcomes from multiple sources, providing the firm with not only comprehensive diagnosis and assessment but also with implementation guidelines. Importantly, an approach that is sensitive to and can accommodate the strengths and weaknesses of such data sets is required. We outline and illustrate such an approach in this paper. Our approach has the potential to both identify and quantify the benefits of implementing a service strategy, especially for firms having multiple units (e.g., banks with branches, retail outlets, and so forth).
   The implementation approach is illustrated using data from a national bank in Brazil. We used customer surveys from more than 500 branches of the bank. Each individual customer's marketing survey data was linked to a number of operational metrics. First, behavioral measures of retention, such as the length of the customer's relation with the bank, the deposit amount, and number of transactions with the bank, were obtained and merged with the survey data. Second, the main branch used by each customer was identified and operational inputs (e.g., number of employees, number of available automated teller machines (ATMs)) used at that branch were obtained and merged with the data set. This data set was used to model the SPC at a strategic and operational level.
   The strategic analysis consisted of a structural-equation model that identified the critical conceptual relationships that parsimoniously articulate the SPC for this bank. For instance, from among a variety of attribute-level perceptions, the bank was able to identify those perceptions that were critical determinants of behavioral intentions. Similarly, from a variety of available behavioral metrics, the bank was able to identify those behaviors most relevant to profitability. The operational analysis utilized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and provides customized feedback to each branch in implementing the strategic model. It provides each branch with a metric of its relative efficiency in translating inputs such as employees and ATMs into relevant strategic outcomes such as customer intentions and behaviors. Our illustration shows how top management can use the strategic and operational analysis in tandem. Whereas the strategic model provides the key relationships and metrics that are needed to ensure that all subunits of the firm follow a consistent strategy, the operational analysis enables each branch to benchmark its unique position so that the branch can implement the strategic model in the most efficient way. Thus, simultaneously implementing the strategic and operational model enables a firm to have a centralized focus with decentralized implementation. For this bank, the operational analysis shows that for a branch to achieve superior profitability, it is important that the branch manager not only be efficient in achieving superior satisfaction (as indicated in positive behavioral intentions) but also be efficient in translating such attitudes and intentions into relevant behaviors. In other words, superior satisfaction alone is not an unconditional guarantee of profitability.

TI Multinational diffusion models: An alternative framework
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The literature on cross-national diffusion models is gaining increased importance today due to the needs of present day managers. New product sales growth in a given nation or society is affected by many factors (Rogers 1995), and of these, sociocontagion (or word of mouth) has been found to be the most important factor that characterizes the diffusion process (Bass 1969, Moore 1995). Hence, it is interesting and perhaps challenging to analyze what would happen if a new product diffuses in parallel in two neighboring but culturally different countries. Not only will we expect the diffusion process in the two countries to be different, but we will also expect some interaction among them, especially if the two societies mingle with each other. There are two streams of research in cross-national diffusion. The first type focuses on exploring the differences between diffusion processes in two countries and finding out whether those differences can be attributed to social and cultural differences between the countries involved. Examples of this type of research are found in Takada and Jain (1991), Gatignon et al. (1989), Helsen et al. (1993), and Kumar et al. (1998). These studies did find some relationship between the cultural differences of the countries studied and the differences in the diffusion process. The second stream of research focuses on modeling explicitly the interaction between the diffusion processes in two countries. The interaction is typically captured through lead-lag effect (Eliashberg and Helsen 1996, Kalish et al. 1995), where the sales process in the lead country (i.e., the country where the product was first introduced) is modeled to affect the sales process in the lag country (i.e., the country where the product was introduced a few years later).
   Another method to study the interaction among the diffusion processes in two countries was suggested by Putsis et al. (1997), who used a "mixing model" to empirically explore the existence of such interactions. These studies basically observed that, when a new product is introduced early in one country and with a time lag in subsequent countries, the consumers in the lag countries learn about the product from the lead country adopters, resulting in a faster diffusion rate in the lag countries. Ganesh and Kumar (1996) formulized this effect as the learning effect and, subsequently, Ganesh et al. (1997) found this learning effect to be influenced by country-specific factors (cultural similarity, economic similarity, and time lag elapsed between the lead and the lag countries) and product-specific factors (continuous vs. discontinuous innovation and the presence or absence of a standardized technology). A careful analysis of the extant literature on the second stream of research would reveal that neither the learning effect model nor the mixing model can be modified to accommodate the other model. Our contribution to the literature exactly addresses this point.
   In this paper, an alternative framework is proposed that has two unique features. First, the framework is flexible enough to not only account for the lead country affecting the lag countries and vice versa, but also to accommodate the simultaneous interaction among countries in explaining the diffusion processes in the countries concerned. Using multiple product categories and a variety of new product introduction situations, we empirically demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of our proposed framework. We found strong evidence of all types of interactions, namely, lead lag, lag lead, and simultaneous, which evidence suggests that one cannot afford to omit any of the interactions. The second unique feature of our paper is the estimation procedure that we used. Because statistical estimation of a dynamic process that includes lead-lag, lag-lead, and simultaneous types of causality within a single framework is not straightforward, we suggest an iterative estimation procedure for the estimation. This new procedure not only proved to be flexible in accommodating different types of interaction, but also converged rather quickly in all of the cases that we empirically tested. Noting that the statistical properties of these estimators are not generally available, we carried out a simulation exercise that clearly revealed the efficiency of the proposed estimation procedure. After analyzing the interaction, we went further and showed that the magnitude of the cross-national influences is affected by certain country-specific and product-specific factors. The flexibility of the proposed method over the existing methods is demonstrated through obtaining superior forecasts with the proposed method. Several interesting insights for managers concerned with formulating international marketing strategies are offered.

TI The variety of an assortment: An extension to the attribute-based
   approach
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In recent years, interest in category management has surged, and as a consequence, large retailers now systematically review their product assortments. Variety is a key property of assortments. Assortment variety can determine consumers' store choice and is only gaining in importance with today's increasing numbers of product offerings. To support retailers in managing their assortments, insight is needed into the influence of assortment composition on consumers' variety perceptions, and appropriate measures of assortment variety are required. This paper aims to extend the assortment variety model recently proposed by Hoch et al. (1999) in Marketing Science. It conceptualizes assortment variety from an attribute-based perspective and compares this with the product-based approach of Hoch, Bradlow, and Wansink (HBW). The attribute-based approach offers an alternative viewpoint for assortment variety. Attribute- and product-based approaches reflect basic conceptualizations of assortment variety that assume substantially different perception processes: a consumer comparing products one-by-one versus a consumer examining attributes across products in the assortment. While the product-based approach focuses on the dissimilarity between product pairs in an assortment, the attribute-based approach that we propose focuses on the marginal and joint distributions of the attributes. We conjecture and aim to show that an attribute-based approach suffices to predict consumers' perceptions of assortment variety.
   In operationalizing the attribute-based approach, two measures of assortment variety are described and compared to product-based measures. These two measures relate to the dispersion of attribute levels, e.g., if all products have the same color or different colors, and the dissociation between attributes, e.g., if product color and size are unrelated. The ability of product-based and attributed-based measures to predict consumers' perceptions of assortment variety is assessed. The product-based measures (Hamming) tap the dissimilarity of products in an assortment across attributes. The attribute-based measures tap the dispersion of attribute levels across products (Entropy) and the dissociation between product attributes (1-Lambda) in an assortment. In two studies, we examine the correlations between these measures in a well-behaved environment (study 1) and the predictive validity of the measures for perceived variety in a consumer experiment.(study 2).
   Study 1, using synthetic data, shows that the attribute-based measures tap specific aspects of assortment variety and that the attribute-based measures are less sensitive to the size of assortments than product-based measures are. Whereas HBW focus on assortments of equal size, study I indicates that an extension to assortments of unequal size results in summed Hamming measures that correlate highly with assortment size. The latter is important when assortments of different size are compared. Next, we examine how well the measures capture consumers' perception of variety.
   Study 2, a consumer experiment, shows that the attribute-based measures account best for consumers' perceptions of variety. Attribute-based measures significantly add to the prediction of consumers' perceptions of variety, over and above the product-based measures, while the reverse is not the case. Interestingly, this study also indicates that assortment size may not be a good proxy for perceived assortment variety.
   The findings illustrate the value of an attribute-based conceptualization of assortment variety, since these measures (1) correlate only moderately with assortment size and (2) suffice to predict consumers' perceptions of assortment variety. In the final section we briefly discuss how attribute-based and product-based measures can be used in assortment management, and when product-and attribute-based approaches may predict consumers' variety perceptions. We discuss how an attribute-based approach can identify which attribute levels and attribute combinations influence consumers' perceptions of variety most, while a product-based approach can identify influential products. Both approaches have applications in specific situations. For instance, an attribute-based approach can identify influential attributes in an ordered, simultaneous presentation of products, while a product-based approach can assess the impact of sequential presentations of products better. In addition, we indicate how the random-intercept model estimated in study 2 can be further extended to capture the influence of, e.g., consumer characteristics.

TI Using advance purchase orders to forecast new product sales
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Marketers have long struggled with developing forecasts for new products before their launch. We focus on one data source-advance purchase orders-that has been available to retailers for many years but has rarely been tied together with postlaunch sales data. We put forth a duration model that incorporates the basic concepts of new product diffusion, using a mixture of two distributions: one representing the behavior of innovators (i.e., those who place advance orders) and one representing the behavior of followers (i.e., those who wait for the mass market to emerge). The resulting mixed-Weibull model specification can accommodate a wide variety of possible sales patterns. This flexibility is what makes the model well-suited for an experiential product category (e.g., movies, music, etc.) in which we frequently observe very different sales diffusion patterns, ranging from a rapid exponential decline (which is most typical) to a gradual buildup characteristic of "sleeper" products. We incorporate product-specific covariates and use hierarchical Bayes methods to link the two customer segments together while accommodating heterogeneity across products. We find that this model fits a variety of sales patterns far better than do a pair of benchmark models. More importantly, we demonstrate the ability to forecast new album sales before the actual launch of the album, based only on the pattern of advance orders.

TI Positioning of store brands
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We examine the retailer's store brand positioning problem. Our game-theoretic model helps us identify a set of conditions under which the optimal strategy for the retailer is to position the store brand as close as possible to the stronger national brand. In three empirical studies, we examined whether market data are consistent with some of the implications of our model. In the first study, using observational data from two US supermarket chains, we found that store brands are more likely to target stronger national brands. Our second study estimated cross-price effects in 19 product categories, and found that only in categories with high-quality store brands, store brand and the leading national brand compete more intensely with each other than with the secondary national brand. In a third product perception study, we found that although explicit targeting by store brands influenced consumer perceptions of physical similarity, it had no influence on consumers' perceptions of overall or product quality similarity. While it appears that retailers do follow a positioning. strategy consistent with our model, it changes buying behavior in the intended fashion only if the store brand offers quality comparable to the leading national brands.

TI How much does the market value an improvement in a product attribute?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A firm contemplating improvements to its product attributes would be interested in the dollar value the market attaches to any potential product modification. In this paper, we derive a measure of market value such that the comparison of the measure against the incremental unit cost of the attribute improvement is key in deciding whether or not the attribute improvement is profitable. Competition from other brands, the potential for market expansion, and heterogeneity in customer preference structures are explicitly modeled using the multinomial logit framework. The analysis yields a closed form expression for the market's value for an attribute improvement (MVAI). A key result we obtain is that customers should be differentially weighted based on their probability of purchasing the firm's product. In particular, customers who exhibit a very high or very low probability of choosing the firm's product should receive less weight in detemining MVAI. Because the probability of choice varies across products, the answer to the question of how much the market values an improvement depends on which firm is asking the question. It is shown that customers whose utilities have a greater random component should be weighted less. Furthermore, the measure developed is robust to the influence of outliers in the sample. An empirical illustration of the MVAI measure in the context of a new product development study is provided. The study illustrates the advantages of the proposed measure over currently used approaches and explores the possibility of competitive price reactions.

TI Referral infomediaries
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB An interesting phenomenon has been the emergence of "infomediaries" in the form of Internet referral services in many markets. These services offer consumers the opportunity to get price quotes from enrolled brick-and-mortar retailers and direct consumer traffic to particular retailers who join them. This paper analyzes the effect of referral infomediaries on retail markets and examines the contractual arrangements that they should use in selling their services. We identify the conditions necessary for the infomediary to exist and explain how they would evolve with the growth of the Internet. The role of an infomediary as a price discrimination mechanism leads to lower online prices. Perhaps the most interesting result is that the referral infomediary can unravel (i.e., no retailer can get any net profit gain from joining) when its reach becomes too large. The analysis also shows why referral infomediaries would prefer to offer geographical exclusivity to joining retailers.

TI The asymmetric information model of state dependence
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Marketing researchers and practitioners are interested in consumer loyalty because of its managerial consequences. Previous empirical studies find that consumers are loyal not only to a brand, but also to a firm (umbrella brand). That is, even when firms offer new products, consumers tend to continue to purchase from the same firm.
   This repeat-purchase behavior might result from state dependence or from heterogeneity. The meaning of state dependence is that the current choice behaviorally depends on the previous one. The traditional model of state dependence assumes that the previous choice affects the current utility. This study suggests another source of state dependence: The previous choice affects the current information set. Specifically, the model assumes that the consumer (a) knows the attributes of the new product offered by the firm from which he/she purchased in the previous period, (b) is uncertain about the attributes of the new products offered by the other firms, (c) can obtain full information about the attributes of all the products through a costly search, and (d) if the consumer decides not to search, he/ she purchases the new product offered by the firm from which he/she purchases in the previous period.
   It is shown that state dependence can result either from the effect of previous choices on the current utility or from its effect on the current information set. This theoretical result raises the following question: What kind of data does a researcher need in order-to distinguish between the two sources of state dependence? This study shows that the two sources can be distinguished with a standard panel data set. In other words, although the new source of state dependence is based on the search activity of consumers, there is an identifying factor that enables a researcher to detect such activity even without direct data on search. The empirical distinction is possible because the behavioral implications of the two sources of state dependence are different. They differ in the effect of product attributes on the repeat-purchase probability.
   The following example partially illustrates this result: There are two firms A and B; the consumer purchased a product from firm A in period t - 1; the only product attribute is x; and the utility is a linear function of x. One aspect of our findings is that in the traditional model of state dependence a change in both x(A) and x(B) that leaves the difference between them, (x(A) - x(B)), unchanged (neutral change, hereinafter) has no effect on the repeat-purchase probability. However, such a change does affect the repeat-purchase probability in the asymmetric information model of state dependence. This is only one aspect of the finding-the implications of the models differ in a more general fashion.
   The intuition of this result is the following. A neutral change has no effect on the repeat-purchase probability in the traditional model of state dependence, because it does not affect the difference between the utilities from both alternatives. In the asymmetric model of state dependence the consumer's decision process consists of two stages. First, he decides whether to search for information about the other alternative or not. Then, if he searches for information, he chooses the alternative that maximizes his utility. In the second stage, a neutral change has no effect on choices, since such a change does not affect the difference between the utilities from the two alternatives. In the first stage, the consumer knows x(A), but does not know x(B). It turns out that in this stage a neutral change does affect the search decision. When, for example, both x's decrease and the utility is a positive function of x, the probability of search increases, and thus the repeat-purchase probability decreases.
   The proposed source of state dependence is examined using structural estimation and panel data on television viewing choices in the United States. Controlling for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity, it is found that the suggested source is more important in creating repeat-pur chase than the traditional one for most of the population (71%). This indicates that what was considered by previous studies to result from the dependence of consumer utility on their previous choices is at least partially due to the effect of the previous choices on consumers' information set.
   The distinction between the two sources of repeat-purchase is important because ignoring the informational explanation may lead to incorrect theoretical and empirical conclusions. For example, price discounts to induce trial are more important for consumers whose utility depends on previous choices, while advertising is more effective for those whose information set depends on previous choices.

TI Profile construction in experimental choice designs for mixed logit
   models
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB A computationally attractive model for the analysis of conjoint choice experiments is the mixed multinomial logit model, a multinomial logit model in which it is assumed that the coefficients follow a (normal) distribution across subjects. This model offers the advantage over the standard multinomial logit model of accommodating heterogeneity in the coefficients of the choice model across subjects, a topic that has received considerable interest recently in the marketing literature. With the advent of such powerful models, the conjoint choice design deserves increased attention as well. Unfortunately, if one wants to apply the mixed logit model to the analysis of conjoint choice experiments, the problem arises - that nothing is known about the efficiency of designs based on the standard logit for parameters of the mixed logit. The development of designs that are optimal for mixed logit models or other random effects models has not been previously addressed and is the topic of this paper.
   The development of efficient designs requires the evaluation of the information matrix of the mixed multinomial logit model. We derive an expression for the information matrix for that purpose. The information matrix of the mixed logit model does not have closed form, since it involves integration over the distribution of the random coefficients. In evaluating it we approximate the integrals through repeated samples from the multivariate normal distribution of the coefficients. Since the information matrix is not a scalar we use the determinant scaled by its dimension as a measure of design efficiency. This enables us to apply heuristic search algorithms to explore the design space for highly efficient designs. We build on previously published heuristics based on relabeling, swapping, and cycling of the attribute levels in the design.
   Designs with a base alternative are commonly used and considered to be important in conjoint choice analysis, since they provide a way to compare the utilities of profiles in different choice sets. A base alternative is a product profile that is included in all choice sets of a design. There are several types of base alternatives, examples being a so-called outside alternative or an alternative constructed from the attribute levels in the design itself. We extend our design construction procedures for mixed logit models to include designs with a base alternative and investigate and compare four design classes: designs with two alternatives, with two alternatives plus a base alternative, and designs with three and with four alternatives.
   Our study provides compelling evidence that each of these mixed logit designs provide more efficient parameter estimates for the mixed logit model than their standard logit counterparts and yield higher predictive validity. As compared to designs with two alternatives, designs that include a base alternative are more robust to deviations from the parameter values assumed in the designs, while that robustness is even higher for designs with three and four alternatives, even if those have 33% and 50% less choice sets, respectively Those designs yield higher efficiency and better predictive validity at lower burden to the respondent. It is noteworthy that our "best" choice designs, the 3- and 4-alternative designs, resulted not only in a substantial improvement in efficiency over the standard logit design but also in an expected predictive validity that is over 50% higher in most cases, a number that pales the increases in predictive validity achieved by refined model specifications.

TI Modeling variation in brand preference: The roles of objective
   environment and motivating conditions
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB People consume products in a variety of environments. They drink beer, for example, by themselves, with close friends, on the beach, when playing cards, at tailgate parties, and while having dinner with their boss. Within these environments, an individual may prefer Schaefer beer when drinking alone, Budweiser when having a party, Corona when lying on the beach, and Heineken when dining out. Preferences change across environments because the benefits sought by the consumer change, Consumers may feel thirsty while lying on the beach, and they may want to display refined tastes while dining out. Moreover the effect of environment may not be homogeneous, as some people enjoy meeting new people in social gatherings while others may prefer to visit with those who are more familiar Even though consumers face the same objective environment, different motivating conditions and brand preferences may arise.
   It is important for marketing managers to understand how brand preferences change across people, environments, and motivating conditions and, more importantly, which product attributes are associated with these changes. Communication and positioning decisions are more likely to be effective if the relationships among objective environment, motivating conditions, and preferences for brand attributes are known. If motivating conditions are uniquely associated with individuals across environments, or with environments across individuals, then the basis of marketing analysis is at the individual or environmental level. If. however, motivating conditions arise from the intersection of individuals and their environments, then analysis conducted at the individual or environmental level will be insufficient to understand human behavior. In such a case, firms may want to view different environments as distinct markets, each with its own pattern of heterogeneous wants and competitive environment.
   In this paper, the influence of objective environments and motivating conditions on brand preference is investigated. The mathematical model is based on the economic framework of utility maximization and discrete choice, and it accommodates three challenges that arise in modeling variation in brand preference. First, consumer consideration sets and purchase histories can vary widely across individuals in a relevant universe. Because brand preferences are the dependent variables in our analysis, our method must be able to accommodate a large number of brands to avoid restricting its measured variation as the objective environment and motivating conditions change. We propose a method using partial ranking data, combined with pairwise trade-off data, to obtain estimates of brand preference for all brands in our study. Second, the model must allow for multiple effects, leading to both within-person and across-person heterogeneity in preferences. Variation in brand preference is investigated within a hierarchical Bayes model in which motivating conditions are related to brand preference through a regression model in the random effects specification. Third, it is often counterintuitive for respondents to express preferences for attribute combinations that do not actually exist. A statistical method model is proposed for decomposing aggregate brand preferences into preferences for core and extended product attributes.
   Data are collected from a national survey of consumer off-premises beer consumption. A total of 842 respondents from six different geographic markets participated, Data include preferred brand sets under different objective environments, brand choice rankings, product attributes, and motivating conditions. Effect sizes for respondent and objective environment are both large. We found that the level of explained variance in brand and attribute preference attributable to motivating conditions is greater than that accounted for by a simple interaction of respondent and environmental effects, suggesting that motivations provide a more sensitive description of variation in brand preference. Our findings indicate that 1) across individuals the objective environment is associated with heterogeneous, not homogeneous, motivating conditions,; 2) within an individual, motivating conditions may change with variation in the objective environment; and 3) motivating conditions are related to preferences for specific attributes.
   Our results imply that the unit of analysis for marketing is properly a person-activity occasion. Brands, for example, arc used in individual instances of behavior-a brand perforin, well or poorly on individual occasions of use The relevant universe is enumerated in person-activity occasions rather than in respondents. For some activities, such as doing the laundry the occasions may typically occur in relatively unchanging environments, and it may be appropriate to allow respondents, to summarize over occasions of die activity. For other activities, such, as snacking or drinking beer, the activity may occur in distinct kinds of environment. In the case of Such activities, it is appropriate to allow for the effect of changing environments to manifest themselves, if present. Doing so may require sampling from the relevant universe of person-activity occasions over an appropriate time frame. The design must be such as to record intraindividual variability clue to changes in the environment for action.

TI The effect of credit on spending decisions: The role of the credit limit
   and credibility
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The objective of the present research is to study consumer decisions to utilize a line of credit. The life-cycle hypothesis from economics argues that consumers should intertemporally reallocate their incomes over their life stream to maximize lifetime utility. One form of intertemporal allocation is to use past income (in the form of savings) in the future. A second form is the use of future income in the present. This can only be done if consumers have access to a temporary pool of money that they can draw from and replenish in the future-a function performed by consumer credit. However, our research reinforces prior findings that consumers are unable to correctly value their future incomes, and that they lack the cognitive capability to solve the intertemporal optimization problem required by the life-cycle hypothesis. Instead, we argue that consumers use information such as the credit Emit as a signal of their future earnings potential Specifically, if consumers have access to large amounts of credit, they, are likely to infer that their Lifetime income will be high and hence their willingness to use credit (and their spending) will also be high. Conversely, consumers who are granted lower amounts of credit are likely to infer that their lifetime income will be low and hence their spending will be lower.
   However, based on research in the area of consumer skepticism and inference making, we also argue for a moderating role of the credibility associated with the credit limit. Specifically, we argue that the above effect of credit availability would be particularly strong for consumers who believe that the credit limit credibly signals their future earnings potential (i.e., a naive consumer who has limited experience with consumer credit). However, as consumers gain experience with credit, they start discounting credit availability as a predictor of their future and start questioning the validity of the process used to set the credit limit. Hence, with experience the effect of credit limit on the willingness to use credit should be attenuated.
   We test these predictions in five separate studies. In the first experimental study, we manipulate credit limit and credibility and pose subjects with a hypothetical purchase opportunity. Consistent with our prediction, credit limit impacted the propensity to spend, but only when the credibility was high. In the second experimental study, we replicate these findings even when subjects were given information about their expected future salaries, and also show that the credit limit influences their expectation of future earnings potential. In the third study, we show that the mere availability (and increase) of current liquidity cannot explain our findings. In the fourth study, we conduct a survey of consumers in which we measure a number of demographic characteristics and also ask them for their propensity to spend in a given purchase situation, L-L the fifth study we use the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) dataset, a triennial survey of U.S. families that is designed to provide detailed information on the use of financial services, spending behaviors, and selected demographic characteristics. Results from both studies 4 and 5 provide further support for our proposed framework-credit limits influence spending to a greater extent for consumers with lower credibility: younger consumers and less-educated consumers. Across all studies we achieved triangulation by using a variety of approaches (surveys and experiments), subjects, types (young students and older consumers), nature of predictor variables (manipulated and measured), dependent measures (purchase likelihood, credit card balance, new charges), and methods of analysis (ANOVA and regression), and consistently found that increasing credit limits on a credit card increases spending, especially when the credibility of the limit is high.
   This paper joins a growing body of literature in marketing and behavioral decision theory that goes beyond the traditional domains of inquiry (e.g., product choice, effects Of marketing mix variables) and focuses on consumer decisions relating to the appropriate use of income to finance consumption. Our framework differs from prior research on the effect of payment mechanisms on spending in two significant ways. first, we are interested in the effects of the availability of credit on spending, and not necessarily in the effect of the transaction format that is associated with each payment mechanism. Second, while prior research has studied the point-of-purchase and historic (i.e., prepurchase) effects of credit, the present research is concerned with the availability of credit in the future. Specifically, our framework is invariant to the current and prior usage of credit by the consumer.

TI Consistent assortment provision and service provision in a retail
   environment
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In a recent article, Broniarczyk et al. (1998) report an interesting finding that the availability of consumers' most preferred alternative in an assortment positively influences their perceptions of assortment size. This finding points to the impact of a hitherto unexplored retail strategic dimension, what we call, commitment to assortment consistency. So far, researchers have been examining retail strategies that pertain to assortment width and depth. The consistency factor featuring in the assortments offered by some retailers has largely gone unnoticed or ignored in the extant literature. We seek to address this dimension in our research.
   By consistency in assortment we me-an the tacit promise made by a retailer to carry a given set of brands, sizes, flavors, colors, etc. from one period to next, so that a consumer who looks for his preferred brand (or size, flavor, etc.) will be able to find that brand for sure at that retail store. Of course, not all retailers commit themselves to carrying a consistent assortment. For example, if someone walks into a warehouse club such as Sam's Choice, he may be able to buy a branded product at a lower price but not the brand or the size (or color, flavor, etc.) he looks for. One reason for this inconsistency is that these stores make a bulk of their purchases during trade deals that are offered by the branded manufacturers and he-ace have less say on what they can carry in a given period. In the apparel market, an example of a store that does not carry a consistent assortment is Ross Dress for Less. If we draw a continuum from a point of no commitment (to assortment contents) to a point of full commitment, it is rather obvious that one can locate retailers such as Sam's Choice at its low end and retailers such as Macy's at its top end.
   While it is obvious that the mere existence of the consumer segment that looks for consistent assortments, will drive some retailers to adopt such commitments to consistent assortments (C2C for short), what is less obvious is that this strategy is affected (negatively) by supply side factors such as the availability of trade deals. This is because while opportunistic buying helps a retailer to reduce his acquisition costs, it introduces inconsistency in the assortment. It is also important to note that although consumers may seek particular brands, their final choice of a retailer is affected also by price and location of the retailers, Thus, it is not clear how a retailer would react in a competitive environment even if a sizable segment of the market seeks consistent assortment. Apart from adopting C2C strategy, offering a service oriented shopping environment (such as having more knowledgeable store personnel and a well-lit parking lot) is another way by which a retailer can increase the store traffic, Our research question is: In a market served by two retailers, what supply and demand conditions would enable one or both retailers to adopt C2C and/or offer service?
   Out of the various retail market structures possible, one particular structure is of importance to us, This is the market where only one retailer adopts C2C and offers service as well, Our focus on this market structure is motivated by two factors: prevalence of this retail structure in many markets, and availability of enough data from one such market, the Dutch flower market which we use to validate our theoretical productions. By using a three-stage game theoretic formulation, we show that in equilibrium only one retailer would adopt C2C and offer service as well if the other retailer does not have a high acquisition cost advantage in the supplier market, and if the cost of offering service is neither too high nor too low. Another interesting result we got is that even when a large section of the market seeks a consistent assortment, it will not be profitable for both the retailers to adopt C21C. This is because a retailer not adopting C2C can still attract customers by passing on his supply side savings to them through low prices and engaging in less price-based competition with the C2C retailer, while adopting C2C in retaliation would bring down the profits of both the retailers, We actually measure the model parameters in the Dutch flower retail market and show that with these values the model predicts the equilibrium outcome (i.e., one retailer alone offering both C2C and service) that characterizes the structure of this market. We cam out sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the robustness of the model prediction.

TI Asymmetric store positioning and promotional advertising strategies:
   Theory and evidence
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Asymmetrically positioned retailers, who vary in the quality/in-store service offered, are increasingly using promotional advertising-the practice of advertising sale prices on familiar merchandise lines-to compete for customers who are willing to comparison shop. The objective of this paper is to examine the role of promotional advertising for stores that vary in their quality positioning in competing for customers using a game-theoretic model. Our focus is on two key retail promotional advertising decisions: the frequency with which to advertise price reductions and the accompanying depth of discount.
   We consider a stylized duopolistic retail market with the two stores that differ in their service positioning. We assume that each store enjoys a relative advantage in serving a subset or segment of customers who regularly visit it and whom we call "patrons" of the store. We assume that it costs more to shop at the less-frequented store. We further assume that consumers are only partially informed about the prevailing retail prices-while they perfectly know the posted price at the store that they patronize, they are uncertain about the price at the other store and have rational expectations about these prices. Consumers in this market differ on three dimensions: preference for service, shopping costs, and store switching costs. We explicitly consider two consumer segments differing in their willingness to pay for service. Furthermore, we assume store switching is more costly for the high-valuation segment. We allow for within-segment heterogeneity by assuming that consumers differ in their shopping costs.
   Our analysis shows that if promotional advertising is not "too costly," the equilibrium strategies of the competing retailers entail occasionally posting its "regular" price but not advertising that price and on other occasions posting its "sale' price and advertising that price. The analysis also suggests that promotional advertising is driven by "offensive" (traffic-building) as well as "defensive" (consumer-retention) considerations. Furthermore, the relative importance of offensive and defensive considerations is influenced by the service positioning of the stores. Specifically, relative to the low-service store, promotional advertising by the high-service store is driven more by offensive consideration than defensive consideration, Finally, a store's service positioning impacts its frequency of promotional advertising and the depth of discount that it offers during "sale." Specifically, relative to the low-service store, the high-service store offers advertised sales more frequently but with shallower discounts.
   These results follow from the fact that differences in service positioning lead to a natural consumer " self-selection." Specifically, the consumer-mix of the high-service store comprises a higher fraction of the high-valuation consumers who are less sensitive to promotional advertising due to their higher store switching costs. Thus, if the low-service retailer were to build store traffic by targeting the customer mix of the high-service retailer (motivated by offensive consideration), it has to offer deeper discounts; yet the demand enhancement is lower. Thus, relative to the high-service store, promotional advertising is not that attractive for the low-service store. However, the low-service store still relies on offering discounted prices occasionally to retain its customer base. Thus when using promotional advertising to attract and retain customers, the high-service store should rely more on the "frequency cue," while the low-quality store should rely more on the "magnitude cue."
   We provide empirical support for the key predictions of our analytical model by collecting and analyzing retail promotional advertisements for that vary in their level of in-store service, published in major newspapers in a large U.S. metropolitan city. We collected data from 813 advertisements across 14 different product groups in the mens and women's categories. The data are consistent with the model's predictions. Our theory and empirical analysis should be of interest to both academics and practitioners, particularly those in the area of channel management and promotional advertising.

TI Investigating new product diffusion across products and countries
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB As firms jockey to position themselves in emerging markets, firms need to evaluate the relative attractiveness of market expansion in different countries. Since the attractiveness of a market is a function of the eventual market potential and the speed at which the product diffuses through the market, a better understanding of the determinants of market potential and diffusion speed across different countries is of particular relevance to firms deliberating their market expansion strategies. Despite a recent spurt in research on multinational diffusion, there exist significant gaps in the literature. First, existing studies tend to limit their analysis to industrialized countries, thus reducing the ability to generalize the insights to many emerging markets. Second, these studies tend to focus on the coefficients of external and internal influence in the Bass diffusion model but do not analyze the determinants of market potential. Third, the choice of variables that affect the parameters of the Bass diffusion model has been rather limited.
   In this paper, we seek to address these gaps in the literature. To address the scope issue, we assembled a novel dataset that captures the diffusion of 6 products in 31 developed and developing countries from Europe, Asia, and North and South America. The set of countries in our dataset encompasses 60% of the world population and includes such emerging economies as China, India, Brazil, and Thailand. This should provide us with a stronger basis to make empirical generalizations about the diffusion process.
   For firms seeking to expand into emerging international markets, our findings about penetration potential have considerable significance. For example, we find that for the set of products that we analyze the average penetration potential for developing countries is about one-third (0.17 versus 0.52) of that for developed countries. We also find that it takes developing countries on average 17.9% (19.25 versus 16.33 years) longer to achieve peak sales. Thus, despite the well-known positive effect of product introduction delays on diffusion speed, we find that developing countries still continue to experience a slower adoption rate, compared to that of developed countries.
   Our study also investigated the impact of several new macroenvironmental variables on penetration potential and speed. For example, our findings indicate that a 1% Change in international trade or urbanization level can potentially change the penetration potential by about 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. These are some of the key variables projected to change significantly over the coming years for developing countries. While business managers have relatively little influence on such variables, our findings can still serve as a valuable empirical guide for the variables that they should consider in evaluating diverse international markets and in performing sensitivity analysis with respect to their projected trends.
   Finally, our study also holds implications for managers seeking to combine information about past diffusion patterns across products and countries for better prediction. We pool information efficiently across multiple products and countries using a Hierarchical Bayes estimation methodology. By sharing information across countries and products in a single, coherent framework, we find that this pooling approach leads to substantial improvements in prediction accuracy. Our technique is particularly superior in predicting sales and BDM parameter values in the early years of a new product introduction in a new country, when forecast estimates are managerially most useful. We also decompose the variance in the BDM model parameters into product, country, and product-country components. These results give guidelines to managers about which market experience they should weigh more to arrive at forecasts of market potential and diffusion speed. We find that while past experiences of other products in a country (country effects) are relatively more useful to explain penetration level (cumulative sales), past experiences in other countries where a product was earlier introduced (product effects) are more useful to explain the coefficients of external and internal influence (and thus the speed with which the product will attain peak sales).

TI Compartmentalized reviews and other initiatives: Should marketing
   scientists review manuscripts in consumer behavior?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Effectively solving problems requires proper organization. Like other academic disciplines, our discipline must organize around our fundamental problems rather than around our procedures (i.e., tools, approaches, methods). Only that organization ensures healthy debate and constructive communication on relevant research questions.
   Three initiatives might help foster a transition from a procedure-based to a problem-based organization. One initiative is compartmentalized reviews. Rather than only assigning reviews based on the technical procedures used in a manuscript (e.g., experiments), we assign at least one reviewer, whose expertise is in the problem domain (e.g., advertising), to review only that part of the manuscript (e.g., relevancy to advertisers). Another initiative is to avoid dichotomous certification (i.e., correct or incorrect) for procedures. All procedures yield evidence that forms a multidimensional continuum from circumstantial to overwhelming. Sometimes, precision in stating the conclusion is more important than precision in the procedure. Finally, research streams on marketing questions are essential-no one article is definitive. To foster these streams, Marketing Science must encourage (to some degree) articles that expand on research previously published in Marketing Science. When Marketing Science publishes an article, it has some obligation to give some priority to manuscripts that build on the same topic (i.e., not to label them as "incremental").

TI In the eye of the beholder: An analysis of the relative value of a top
   sales rep across firms and products
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB W e ask the question, "when should the most highly skilled salespeople sell the best products?" Our main result is that the highly skilled reps should sell better products when the task is very complex and worse products when the task is very simple. This is shown using a general analytical model of selling in which sales are a joint function of the salesperson's skill and the complexity of the selling task. Complexity varies across products and industries. Intuitively, when the selling task is complex, few salespeople of any level of ability will be successful with a low-quality product. Therefore, the high-skill rep's value is higher on the better product. Conversely, when the task is simple, salespeople of any ability can sell the better product fairly easily so the high-skill rep's impact is more pronounced on the worse product. This general result offers insight into many key problems: Which salespeople should we hire? How should we organize our salespeople? How should we allocate training funds? We show that the insights hold for salespeople that either create value or simply persuade the customer about the product's value. Finally, we contrast this set of questions with the question of how many salespeople the firm should hire. We find that the firm that has the biggest sales force does not always have the best.

TI The international takeoff of new products: The role of economics,
   culture, and country innovativeness
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Sales takeoff is vitally important for the management of new products. Limited prior research on this phenomenon covers only the United States. This study addresses the following questions about takeoff in Europe:
   1) Does takeoff occur as distinctly in other countries, as it does in the United States?
   2) Do different categories and countries have consistently different times-to-takeoff?
   3) What economic and cultural factors explain the intercountry differences?
   4) Should managers use a sprinkler or waterfall strategy for the introduction of new products across countries?
   We gathered data on 137 new products across 10 categories and 16 European countries.
   We adapted the threshold rule for identifying takeoff (Golder and Tellis 1997) to this multinational context. We specify a parametric hazard model to answer the questions above. The major results are as follows:
   1) Sales of most new products display a distinct takeoff in various European countries, at an average of six years after introduction.
   2) The time-to-takeoff varies substantially across countries and categories. It is four times shorter for entertainment products than for kitchen and laundry appliances. It is almost half as long in Scandinavian countries as in Mediterranean countries.
   3) While culture partially explains intercountry differences,in time-to-takeoff, economic factors are neither strong nor robust explanatory factors.
   4) These results suggest distinct advantages to a waterfall strategy for introducing products in international markets.

TI Indirect network externality effects on product attributes
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Indirect network externality (INE) effect exists when the utility of a product increases with the greater availability of compatible complementary products. We demonstrate that INE effects can vary by product attributes, with externality-sensitive attributes gaining more from increased availability of complementary products than other attributes. Past research has assumed that the benefit of increased availability of complementary products (e.g., software) accrues to the entire product (e.g., hardware). Utilizing data covering a period from 1985 to 1995 on compact disc player prices, attributes, and CD titles releases, and using a hedonic price approach, we find significant positive interactions between CD title availability and two attributes of the CD player, namely, changer capacity and its oversampling rate. In addition to INE-attribute interactions, increased availability of CD titles is found to have a significant positive impact on the overall price of CD players, which is consistent with past research. Collectively, these effects of INE have helped reduce the yearly decline in the price of CD players. The finding that INE effects differentially affect different attributes can help managers in decisions such as pricing, timing of introduction, and changing the levels of INE-sensitive attributes.

TI Negotiations and exclusivity contracts for advertising
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Exclusive advertising on a given media outlet is usually profitable for an advertiser because consumers are less aware of competing products. However, for such arrangements to exist, media must benefit as well. We examine conditions under which such exclusive advertising contracts benefit both advertisers and media outlets (referred to as stations) by illustrating that exclusive equilibria arise in a theoretical model of the media, advertisers, and consumers who participate in both the product and media markets. In the model, stations sell advertising space to advertisers and broadcast advertising messages to consumers.
   Conditions leading to higher equilibrium levels of advertising can be unprofitable for advertisers because high levels of advertising make consumers better informed and thus lead to fiercer product price competition. As a result, media stations may be less profitable as well because their payoff is determined as a fraction of the advertiser surplus generated in the product market.
   Stations mitigate this effect by offering advertisers exclusive advertising contracts. With such contracts, consumers are less informed about competing products, yielding higher producer surplus. It is profitable for stations to offer exclusivity when commercial advertising is an important means for advertisers to inform consumers about their products.

TI The price of launching a new product: Empirical evidence on factors
   affecting the relative magnitude of slotting allowances
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Slotting allowances are a relatively recent trend, particular to the retail food industry. These allowances are lump-sum, up-front transfer payments from manufacturer to retailer when the manufacturer launches a new product. The practice has attracted some scrutiny because of uncertainty about its purposes and consequences. We draw from the extant literature to identify factors that potentially influence the relative magnitude of slotting allowances. Based on analysis of primary survey data from retailers and manufacturers, we observe that charging and paying of slotting allowances are affected by the relative strength of the players. Among retailers, the relative magnitude of slotting fees increases with retailers' informational advantage over the manufacturer about the likely success of the new product, even when retailers recognize that the product is likely to be successful. Additionally, and consistent with the first finding, retailers with lower costs (i.e., potentially more efficient and powerful retailers) received higher slotting allowances. Furthermore, retailers charge higher slotting fees, even when concerns about manufacturers' fulfilling postlaunch advertising commitments are minimal, implying that relatively powerless manufacturers are asked to provide credible commitments regarding postlaunch activities and are asked to pay relatively high slotting fees. Among manufacturers, the relative magnitude of slotting fees paid is lower for those who have a strong market share position. We discuss the theoretical, managerial, and public policy implications of our findings.

TI Internet shopping agents: Virtual co-location and competition (vol 22,
   pg 85, 2003)
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Internet Shopping Agents (ISAs) allow consumers to costlessly search many online retailers and buy at the lowest price. One would expect these ISAs to subject sellers to intense price competition that results in uniform low prices. Yet, Internet retailers have joined these ISAs. Furthermore, the prices charged by inside retailers can vary substantially. We examine the impact of ISAs on market competition. An ISA creates differentiation in the pricing strategies of ex-ante identical retailers: Some retailers join the ISA due to mass of consumers that they will potentially win, while others stay out and extract surplus from their loyal consumers. The equilibrium inside pricing is such that the average price charged can increase or decrease when more retailers join, depending on whether or not the reach of the ISA is independent of the number of joining retailers. When the reach is endogenous, there exists a unique number of inside retailers.

TI Fast polyhedral adaptive conjoint estimation
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB W e propose and test new adaptive question design and estimation algorithms for partial-profile conjoint analysis. Polyhedral question design focuses questions to reduce a feasible set of parameters as rapidly as possible. Analytic center estimation uses a centrality criterion based on consistency with respondents' answers. Both algorithms run with no noticeable delay between questions.
   We evaluate the proposed methods relative to established benchmarks for question design (random selection, D-efficient designs, adaptive conjoint analysis) and estimation (hierarchical Bayes). Monte Carlo simulations vary respondent heterogeneity and response errors. For low numbers of questions, polyhedral question design does best (or is tied for best) for all tested domains. For high numbers of questions, efficient fixed designs do better in some domains. Analytic center estimation shows promise for high heterogeneity and for low response errors; hierarchical Bayes for low heterogeneity and high response errors. Other simulations evaluate hybrid methods, which include self-explicated data.
   A field test (330 respondents) compared methods on both internal validity (holdout tasks) and external validity (actual choice of a laptop bag worth approximately $100). The field test is consistent with the simulation results and offers strong support for polyhedral question design. In addition, marketplace sales were consistent with conjoint-analysis predictions.

While the appeal of the Bayesian approach has long been noted by researchers, recent developments in computational methods and expanded availability of detailed marketplace data has fueled the growth in application of Bayesian methods in marketing. We emphasize the modularity and flexibility of modern Bayesian approaches. The usefulness of Bayesian methods in situations in which there is limited information about a large number of units or where the information comes from different sources is noted. We include an extensive discussion of open issues and directions for future research.

TI Demand and supply dynamics for sequentially released products in
   international markets: The case of motion pictures
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We develop an econometric model to study a setting in which a new product is launched first in its domestic market and only at a later stage in foreign markets, and where the product's performance ("demand") and availability ("supply") are highly interdependent over time within and across markets. Integrating literature on international diffusion, "success-breeds-success" trends, and the theatrical motion picture industry-the focus of the empirical analysis-we develop a dynamic simultanenous-equations model of the drivers and interrelationship of the behavior of consumers ("audiences") and retailers ("exhibitors"). Our findings emphasize the importance of considering the endogeneity and simultaneity of audience and exhibitor behavior, and challenge conventional wisdom on the determinants of box office performance (which is predominantly based on modeling frameworks that fail to account for the interdependence of performance and availability). Specifically, we find that variables such as movie attributes and advertising expenditures, which are usually assumed to influence audiences directly, mostly influence revenues indirectly, namely through their impact on exhibitors' screen allocations. In addition, consistent with the idea that the "buzz" for a movie is perishable, we find that the longer is the time lag between releases, the weaker is the relationship between domestic and foreign market performance-an effect mostly driven by foreign exhibitors' screen allocations.

TI R&D, marketing, and the success of next-generation products
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper studies dynamic competition in markets characterized by the introduction of technologically advanced next-generation products. Firms invest in new product effort in an attempt to attain industry leadership, thus securing high profits and benefiting from advantages relevant for the success of future product generations. The analysis reveals that when the current leader possesses higher research and development (R&D) competence, it tends to invest more in R&D than rivals and to retain its lead position. The leader's investment exhibits an inverse-U pattern as this advantage increases. In contrast, when the leader enjoys an advantage that originates from the persistence of reputation, it invests less than its followers. Now, followers' investment exhibits an inverse-U pattern as reputation advantage increases. Depending on the extent of leader reputation, industry structure can either exhibit frequent leadership shifts or prolonged incumbent dominance. The basic framework is extended to allow investments in additional marketing variables (e.g., advertising). Interestingly, the leader takes advantage of strong demand for its current product by focusing more on advertising, whereas the follower expends more on R&D. By shedding light on the implications of industry position for investment incentives and market evolution, the analysis provides valuable insights for formulating marketing strategy in fast-paced, high-tech business environments.

TI Sustainable pioneering advantage? Profit implications of market entry
   order
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB There is strong theoretical and empirical evidence supporting the idea that "first-to-market" leads to an enduring market share advantage. In sharp contrast to these findings, we find that at the business unit level being first-to-market leads, on average, to a long-term profit disadvantage. This result holds for a sample of consumer goods as well as a sample of industrial goods and leads to questions about the validity of first mover advantage, in and of itself, as a strategy to achieve superior performance. We replicate the typical demand-side pioneering advantage but find an even greater average cost disadvantage, which is the source of the pioneering profit disadvantage. In an extended analysis, we show that first-to-market leads to an initial profit advantage, which, depending on the sample or profit measure, lasts for about 12 to 14 years before turning into a disadvantage. Moreover, we show that pioneers differentially benefit from a lack of consumer learning, a strong market position and patent protection. These three moderating factors together can actually help pioneers achieve a sustainable profit advantage over later entrants. Finally, we find strong support for the theoretical argument that the entry order decision should be treated as endogenous in empirical estimation.

TI Understanding high-stakes consumer decisions: Mammography adherence
   following false-alarm test results
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumers often have to decide whether to acquire information in high-stakes decision domains. We study women in mammography waiting rooms to test how a "false-alarm" result (i.e., an indication that a malady is present when a "more accurate" follow-up test reveals it is not) affects willingness to get retested. In Study 1 we show that, given a false-alarm result, life-threatening test consequences are associated with more disutility for future testing than when test consequences are less significant; this does not hold for normal test results. In Study 2 in the mammography context, we show that patients receiving a false-alarm result experienced more stress, were less likely to believe that a positive mammography result indicated cancer, and more likely to delay mammography than patients receiving normal results unless they were also told that they may be vulnerable to breast cancer in the future. We show that delays in planned adherence following a false-alarm result can be mitigated by an information intervention. Finally, we have preliminary evidence that a previous history of false-positive results can cause a consumer to both react more negatively to emotional stress and respond more positively to coping information.

TI A fuzzy set model of search and consideration with an application to an
   online market
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Several two-stage choice models (consideration stage plus choice stage) have been proposed in the marketing literature. We extend this literature by developing a more general model that incorporates how consumer search influences the degree to which they consider various brands. To test the validity and value of our model, we operationalized it with data obtained from Peapod, an online grocer, where we tracked consumers' search processes. We demonstrate that our model performs better than competing models on all the key criteria. New choice models, such as the ones proposed here, are necessary for deriving managerially relevant understanding of choice behavior in online markets. Our empirical results suggest that consumers search both their internal memory and external information at the store to determine the degree to which they consider various brands. Consumers are also heterogeneous with respect to their capability to process external information. For some consumers, external information search dramatically increases the degree to which they consider various brands; but, for others, it has little impact on their consideration. We also find that certain features (e.g., personal lists) reduce consideration set sizes, whereas other features (e.g., sort) increase consideration set sizes.

TI Enriching scanner panel models with choice experiments
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This research examines the methods, viability, and benefits of pooling scanner panel choice data with compatible preference data from designed choice experiments. The fact that different choice data sources have diverse strengths and weaknesses suggests it might be possible to pool multiple sources to achieve improved models, due to offsetting advantages and disadvantages. For example, new attributes and attribute levels not included in the scanner panel data can be introduced via the choice experiment, while the scanner panel data captures preference dynamics, which is, at best, difficult with experimental data. Our application, involving liquid laundry detergent, establishes the feasibility and desirability of doing such augmentations of scanner panel data: The joint scanner panel/choice experiment model has significantly better prediction performance on a holdout data set than does a pure scanner panel model. Thus, we extend the concept of choice data enrichment into another domain and demonstrate that data enrichment can add significantly to one's understanding of preferences reflected in scanner panel data.

TI A comparison of Online and offline consumer brand loyalty
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In this study we compare consumer brand loyalty in online and traditional shopping environments for over 100 brands in 19 grocery product categories. The online purchase data come from a large traditional grocery retailer that also operates an online store for its products. The offline data corresponds to the exact same brands and categories bought in traditional stores by a panel of homes operated by ACNielsen for purchases made in the same city and over the same time period. We compare the observed loyalty with a baseline model, a new segmented Dirichlet model, which has latent classes for brand choice and provides a very accurate model for purchase behavior. The results show that observed brand loyalty for high market share brands bought online is significantly greater than expected, with the reverse result for small share brands. In contrast, in the traditional shopping environment, the difference between observed and predicted brand loyalty is not related to brand share.

TI The effects of effort and intrinsic motivation on risky choice
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB People often need to trade off between the probability and magnitude of the rewards that they could earn for investing effort. The present paper proposes that the conjunction of two simple assumptions (relating effort-induced reward expectations to prospect theory's value function) provides a parsimonious theory that predicts that the nature of the required effort will have a systematic effect on such trade-offs. Using the case of frequency (or loyalty) programs, a series of five studies involving both real and hypothetical choices demonstrated that (a) the presence (as opposed to absence) of effort requirements enhances the preference for sure-small rewards over large-uncertain rewards; (b) the preference for reward certainty is attenuated when the effort activity is intrinsically motivating; and (c) continuously increasing the effort level leads to an inverted-U effect on the preference for sure-small over large-uncertain rewards. The studies also employ process measures and examine the mechanisms underlying the impact of the effort stream on the trade-off between the certainty and magnitude of rewards. The final section discusses the theoretical implications of this research as well as the practical implications with respect to frequency programs and other types of incentive systems.

TI Consumer sequential search: Not enough or too much?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB W e study sequential search behavior in a generalized "secretary problem" in which a single object is to be selected from a set of n alternatives. Alternatives are inspected in a random order, one at a time, and only the rank order of the current alternative relative to the ones that have already been observed can be ascertained. At each period, the consumer may either accept the current alternative, continue to search and pay a fixed cost, or recall an alternative that has already been inspected. A recalled alternative is assumed to be available with a known probability. The consumer's goal is to select the overall best alternative from the fixed set.
   We describe the results of an experiment designed to test the optimal model and compare it to a behavioral decision model that incorporates local patterns of the observed sequence. Both set size and search cost are manipulated experimentally in a 2x2 factorial design. Our results show that cost and set size affect the amount of search in the predicted direction. However, in the two no-cost conditions subjects search too little in comparison to the optimal model, whereas in the two cost conditions they search too much. The behavioral decision rule that we propose provides a possible account for the observed pattern of the behavioral regularities.

TI Modeling the clickstream: Implications for Web-based advertising efforts
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB In this paper, we develop an analytical approach to modeling consumer response to banner ad exposures at a sponsored content Web site that reveals significant heterogeneity in (unobservable) click proneness across consumers. The effect of repeated exposures to banner ads is negative and nonlinear, and the differential effect of each successive ad exposure is initially negative, though nonlinear, and levels off at higher levels of passive ad exposures. Further, significant correlations between session and consumer click proneness and banner exposure sensitivity suggest gains from repeated banner exposures when consumers are less click prone. For a particular number of sessions, more clicks are generated from consumers who revisit over a longer period of time, than for those with the same number of sessions in a relatively shorter timeframe. We also find that consumers are equally likely to click on banner ads placed early or late in navigation path and that exposures have a positive cumulative effect in inducing click-through in future sessions. Our results have implications for online advertising response measurement and dynamic ad placement, and may help guide advertising media placement decisions.

TI Defining interesting research problems
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We argue that research problems are only interesting relative to some external audience. Interesting academic research should impact, at least, that external audience. Hence, we should target our research toward specific external audiences. Several foreboding trends that exacerbate the urgency of this targeting are discussed. To facilitate the targeting task, a partial list of fifteen possible audiences for academic research in marketing is identified. We discuss some of them, including practitioners, in detail. For example, we conclude that, for our research to be interesting to practitioners, practitioners must have the ability to improve and to make better decisions with enhanced understanding. Finally, we strongly suggest that we focus our research on fundamental problems in marketing. These are problems with the property that external audiences would first look to the marketing literature for answers.

TI Creating win-win trade promotions: Theory and empirical analysis of
   scan-back trade deals
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Manufacturer trade promotion spending is second only to cost of goods sold as a profit-and-loss item, yet manufacturers often lose money on these deals as a result of forward-buying by retailers. The search for more effective forms of trade promotion and the availability of scanners at cash registers has led to the emergence of a new type of trade deal-the scan-back-that gives retailers a discount on units sold during the promotion rather than on units bought.
   We develop a theory to compare retailer pricing decisions and profitability under scan-back and traditional off-invoice trade deals. We show that, when the terms of the trade deal are identical, retailers prefer off-invoice trade deals and manufacturers prefer scan-backs. Manufacturers can, however, redesign the scan-back to leave the retailer weakly better off and leave themselves strictly better off. Using proprietary data from the beverage category, we conduct an empirical analysis and find that during the promotion period scan-back trade deals, relative to off-invoice deals: (1) Do not cause excess ordering and (2) generate higher retail sales through lower retail prices. Implications for researchers and managers are discussed.

TI Massively categorical variables: Revealing the information in zip codes
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB W e introduce the idea of a massively categorical variable, a variable such as zip code that takes on too many values to treat in the standard manner. We show how to use a massively categorical variable directly as an explanatory variable.
   As an application of this concept, we explore several of the issues that analysts confront when trying to develop a direct marketing campaign. We begin by pointing out that the data contained in many of the common sources are masked through aggregation in order to protect consumer privacy. This creates some difficulty when trying to construct models of individual level behavior.
   We show how to take full advantage of such data through a hierarchical Bayesian variance components (HBVC) model. The flexibility of our approach allows us to combine several sources of information, some of which may not be aggregated, in a coherent manner. We show that the conventional modeling practice understates the uncertainty with regard to its parameter values.
   We explore an array of financial considerations, including ones in which the marginal benefit is non-linear, to make robust model comparisons. To implement the decision rules that determine the optimal number of prospects to contact, we develop an algorithm based on the Monte Carlo Markov chain output from parameter estimation. We conclude the analysis by demonstrating how to determine an organization's willingness to pay for additional data.

TI Price uncertainty and consumer search: A structural model of
   consideration set formation
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We offer an econometric framework that models consumer's consideration set formation as an outcome of her costly information search behavior. Because frequently purchased products are characterized by frequent price promotions of varying depths of discounts, a consumer faces significant uncertainty about the prices of the brands. The consumers engage in a fixed-sample search strategy that results in their discovering the posted prices of a subset of the available brands. This subset is referred to as the consumer's "consideration set." The proposed model is estimated using the scanner data set for liquid detergents. Our key empirical results are: (i) consumers zincur significant search costs to discover the posted prices of the brands; (ii) whereas in-store displays and feature ads do not influence consumers' quality perceptions of the brands, they significantly reduce search costs for observing the prices of the brands; (iii) per capita income of consumer's household significantly increases her search costs; and (iv) the consumers' price sensitivity is seriously underestimated if we were to assume that consumers get to know all the posted prices at zero cost. The proposed model is also estimated for the ketchup category to enable us to do cross-category comparisons of consumers' price search behavior.

TI Internet shopping agents: Virtual co-location and competition
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Internet Shopping Agents (ISAs) allow consumers to costlessly search many online retailers and buy at the lowest price. One would expect these ISAs to subject sellers to intense price competition that results in uniform low prices. Yet, Internet retailers have joined these ISAs. Furthermore, the prices charged by inside retailers can vary substantially. We examine the impact of ISAs on market competition. An ISA creates differentiation in the pricing strategies of ex-ante identical retailers: Some retailers join the ISA due to mass of consumers that they will potentially win, while others stay out and extract surplus from their loyal consumers. The equilibrium inside pricing is such that the average price charged can increase or decrease when more retailers join, depending on whether or not the reach of the ISA is independent of the number of joining retailers. When the reach is endogenous, there exists a unique number of inside retailers.

TI Measuring heterogeneous reservation prices for product bundles
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper develops a model for capturing continuous heterogeneity in the joint distribution of reservation prices for products and bundles. Our model is derived from utility theory and captures both within- and among-subject variability. Furthermore, it provides dollarmetric reservation prices and individual-level estimates that allow the firm to target customers and develop customized and nonlinear pricing policies.
   Our experiments show that, regardless of whether the products are durables or nondurables, the model captures heterogeneity and predicts well. Models that assume homogeneity perform poorly, especially in predicting choice of the bundle. Furthermore, the methodology is robust even when respondents evaluate few profiles.
   Self-stated reservation prices do not have any informational content beyond that contained in the basic model. The direct elicitation method appears to understate (overstate) the variation in reservation prices across consumers for low-priced (high-priced) products and bundles. Hence this method yields biased demand estimates and leads to suboptimal product-line pricing policy.
   The optimization results show that the product-line pricing policy depends on the degree of heterogeneity in the reservation prices of the individual products and the bundle. A uniformly high-price strategy for all products and bundles is optimal when heterogeneity is high. Otherwise, a hybrid strategy is optimal.

TI Advertising competition under consumer inertia
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We construct a multistage game-theoretic model of advertising and price competition in a differentiated products duopoly, in which proportions of consumers exhibit latent inertia in favor of repeat purchase. Advertising simultaneously plays the dual role in reducing such inertia through awareness and enhancing perceived brand value (persuasion). We derive the advertising price cross-effects and provide a theoretical reconciliation of the longstanding debate in the marketing literature regarding the impact of advertising on price sensitivity. We characterize the nature of equilibria under symmetry and show that when a large proportion of consumers exhibit inertial tendencies, then a multiplicity of equilibria exists. Marketing implications and comparative statics are discussed.
   Numerical simulations for asymmetric firms are presented, wherein we show that advertising is not a useful competitive tool for small firms. However, advertising spending by the large firm provides a halo effect for the average prices in the category, which has a positive externality on the small firm's profits. In the absence of the small brand advertising, larger brand shares encourage firms to allocate higher expenditures on advertising to enhance the perceived value of their brand, which in turn shore up the average prices in the industry from which all firms benefit.

TI Consulting, research, and consulting research
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consulting and scholarly research often have very different objectives with respect to advancements in practice, theory, and observation (e.g., data collections). For example, consulting often emphasizes immediate benefits, specialized applications, and a focus on only the key variables. Scholarly research often emphasizes replicability generalizability, and introducing previously uninvestigated variables. However, these activities complement each other, and each activity is important for the advancement of the other. Benefiting from that complementarity requires the literature to bridge knowledge gained from each activity. It is unnecessary for every researcher to try to bridge theory and practice by working on the interface between academics and practice. However, it is critical that some researchers do so. This issue of Marketing Science examines several excellent applications of Marketing Science that provide detailed microexaminations of the fundamental marketing practices that we seek to understand and improve.
   Beyond demonstrating how to solve specific problems in practice, in my opinion, the articles and commentaries in this issue also illustrate at least the following ideas: Short-term tactics can produce significant short-term advantages. Existing models in the literature can be useful with proper implementation. State-of-the-art research is most useful for infrequent decisions. Finally, knowing the decision-making context is essential for determining which variables to include in the analysis.

TI Predicting sales takeoff for Whirlpool's new Personal Valet
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The introduction of really new products creates many dilemmas for managers. Initially, they must develop a launch strategy in the face of great uncertainty about the product's potential. After launch, they need guidance about whether to pull the plug on a new product with lackluster sales (prior to takeoff) or persist with a product that could ultimately be a failure. Our results and model of the takeoff in sales of new products provide some guidance on these complex managerial decisions.
   Prior to our study on sales takeoff, a manager's only recourse to analyzing new product growth would have been diffusion models. However, these models have typically used new product sales beginning at or around the takeoff, have assumed takeoff, and have not explicitly modeled it. In contrast, our model addresses the time from commercialization until takeoff, thus providing insights during the period of greatest uncertainty.
   Whirlpool Corporation used our model to guide their decision making in the testing and launch of a completely new consumer durable, the Personal Valet.

TI Implementing a prelaunch diffusion model: Measurement and management
   challenges of the Telstra switching study
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper describes the challenge of applying a marketing science model in practice and the benefits from doing so. There have been many tools developed in marketing science, but their use and impact have often been disappointing (e.g., see Steenkamp 2000). One major reason for this is the difficulty of adapting our models to the managerial context at which they are targeted (including ensuring completeness, providing timeliness, and calibrating total effects). Another is achieving organizational adoption of the model findings and translating analytical insights into marketing actions. In this paper the context in which actions need to be focused is the preparation of a defensive strategy prior to the launch of a new entrant. While the two major problems of managers are growth and defense, use of marketing science models for the latter is less prevalent than for growth (with, for example, choice-based conjoint analysis and diffusion modeling. (See Dick R. Wittink and Trond Bergestuen. 2001. Forecasting with conjoint analysis. J. S. Armstrong, ed. Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook for Researchers and Practitioners.

TI The 2003 ISMS Practice Prize Winner - Optimizing Rhenania's direct
   marketing business through Dynamic Multilevel Modeling (DMLM) in a
   multicatalog-brand environment
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We introduce Dynamic Multilevel Modeling (DMLM) to a multicatalog-brand environment to determine the optimal frequency, size, and customer segmentation of direct marketing activities. This optimization method leverages multicatalog-brand effects including the utilization of prior customer ordering behavior, maximization of customer value and customer share, and economies of scale and scope in printing and mailing. This enhancement of the original DMLM-approach is called Dynamic Multidimensional Marketing (DMDM). With DMLM alone, Rhenania, a German direct mail order company, turned its catalog mailing practices around and consequently rose from the number 5 to the number 2 market position. The DMLM approach was so effective that two major competitors could be bought out. Improvements provided by DMDM were threefold: more efficient resource allocation across all catalog brands, more accurate customer microsegmentation, and more effective reactivation. Presently, the company's target is to transform single-brand customer relationships into two- or three-brand relationships with higher revenue per customer. As a consequence, the Rhenania group's performance was decoupled from the overall market trend.

TI Growing, growing, gone: Cascades, diffusion, and turning points in the
   product life cycle
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Research on the product life cycle (PLC) has focused primarily on the role of diffusion. This study takes a broader theoretical perspective on the PLC by incorporating informational cascades and developing and testing many new hypotheses based on this theory. On average, across 30 product categories, the authors find that: (i) New consumer durables have a typical pattern of rapid growth of 45% per year over 8 years. (ii) This period of growth is followed by a slowdown when sales decline by 15% and stay below those of the previous peak for 5 years. (iii) Slowdown occurs at 34% population penetration and about 50% of ultimate market penetration. (iv) Products with large sales increases at takeoff tend to have larger sales declines at slowdown. (v) Leisure-enhancing products tend to have higher growth rates and shorter growth stages than nonleisure-enhancing products. Time-saving products tend to have lower growth rates and longer growth stages than nontime-saving products. (vi) Lower probability of slowdown is associated with steeper price reductions, lower penetration, and higher economic growth. (vii) A hazard model can provide reasonable predictions of the slowdown as early as the takeoff.
   The authors discuss the implications of these findings.

TI "Let me talk to my manager": Haggling in a competitive environment
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Although negotiating over prices with sellers is common in many markets such as automobiles, furniture, services, consumer electronics, etc., it is not clear how a haggling price policy can help a firm gain a strategic advantage or whether it is even sustainable in a competitive market. In this paper, we explore the implications of haggling and fixed prices as pricing policies in a competitive market. We develop a model in which two competing retailers choose between offering either a fixed price or haggling over prices with customers. There are two consumer segments in our analysis. One segment, the hagglers, has a lower opportunity cost of time and a lower haggling cost than the other segment, the nonhagglers. When both retailers follow the same pricing policy, then a haggling policy is more profitable than a fixed-price policy only when the proportion of nonhagglers is sufficiently high. We find two kinds of prisoners' dilemma: under some conditions, a more profitable haggling policy can be broken by a fixed-price policy, and under other conditions, a fixed-price policy can be broken by a haggling policy. Surprisingly; we show that under some conditions, an asymmetric outcome with one retailer haggling and the other offering a fixed price is also an equilibrium.

TI The additive risk model for purchase timing
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper proposes the Additive Risk Model (ARM), first used by Aalen (1980), to explain households' interpurchase times. Unlike the Proportional Hazard Model (PHM), first proposed by Cox (1972), the ARM incorporates the effects of covariates on the individual hazard function in an additive (as opposed to multiplicative) manner. While a large number of previous studies on interpurchase timing have dealt with the question of correctly specifying the parametric distribution for interpurchase times, no study has explicitly investigated the question of correctly specifying the effects of covariates in the model. This study looks at this issue.
   We propose an ARM that is suitable for purchase-timing data, and compare its empirical performance to that of the PHM and the Accelerated Failure Time Model (AFTM) using scanner panel data on laundry detergents, paper towels, and toilet tissue. We find that the ARM not only estimates and validates the observed interpurchase times better than existing models, but also recovers a time-varying price elasticity and shows a high degree of robustness in the estimated covariate effects to alternative parametric specifications of the baseline hazard. The estimates of covariate parameters under the PHM, on the other hand, are highly sensitive to alternative parametric specifications of the baseline hazard.

TI Product strategy for innovators in markets with network effects
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper examines four alternative product strategies available to an innovating firm in markets with network effects: single-product monopoly, technology licensing, product-line extension, and a combination of licensing and product-line extension. We address three questions. First, what factors affect the attractiveness of each of the four product strategies? Second, under what conditions will any particular strategy dominate the others? Third, what is the impact of licensing fees on the profitability of a licensing strategy? We show that offering a product line utilizes consumer heterogeneity to increase the total user base and is superior to free licensing when the innovator's cost of producing a low-quality product is low and network effects are weak. However, because of the advantage of licensing in generating a larger installed base, free licensing can dominate line extension when network effects are strong, even if the innovator suffers no cost disadvantage compared to the competitor. We also show that paid licensing trumps free licensing when the clone product has a high quality or a low cost, regardless of network effect. Finally, strong network effects make a lump-sum fee more profitable than a royalty fee (or a combination of both) because a royalty fee reduces the licensee's production.

TI Implications of reduced search cost and free riding in e-commerce
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB This paper examines a market where the provision of information service is costly, but information service has the characteristics of a public good. Consumers, on the other hand, can use the information service to make an informed purchase decision and derive higher utility from consuming their ideal product. However, after receiving the information service from an information service provider, consumers can easily free ride by purchasing at low-price sellers who do not provide any information service. The paper examines the competition where sellers compete by providing information service for horizontally differentiated products and where technology reduces consumers' search cost. It is found that in this market a seller needs to establish itself as an information service provider in order to make positive profits, even when there is free riding. A seller, however, cannot make positive profits by free riding all the time. Also, with an increase in competition in the information service market, sellers have reduced incentives to provide information service. It is also found that in this market a decrease in search cost may increase or decrease social welfare.

TI Modeling multiple sources of state dependence in random utility models:
   A distributed lag approach
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB We propose a utility-theoretic brand-choice model that accounts for four different sources of state dependence: 1. effects of lagged choices (structural state dependence), 2. effects of serially correlated error terms in the random utility function (habit persistence type 1), 3. effects of serial correlations between utility-maximizing, alternatives on successive purchase occasions of a household (habit persistence type 2), and 4. effects of lagged marketing variables (carryover effects). Our proposed model also allows habit persistence to be a function of lagged marketing variables, while accommodating the effects of unobserved heterogeneity in household choice parameters. This model is more flexible than existing state-dependence models in marketing and labor econometrics. Using scanner panel data, we find structural state dependence to be the most important source of state dependence. Marketing-mix elasticities are systematically understated if state-dependence effects are incompletely accounted for. The Seetharaman and Chintagunta (1998) model is shown to recover spurious variety-seeking effects while overstating habit-persistence effects. Ignoring habit persistence type I leads to an underestimation, while ignoring habit persistence type 2 leads to an overestimation of structural state-dependence effects. We find lagged promotions to have carryover effects on habit persistence. Ignoring one or more sources of state dependence underestimates the total incremental impact of a sales promotion. We draw implications for manufacturer pricing.

TI Modeling browsing behavior at multiple websites
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB While there is a growing literature on investigating the Internet clickstream data collected for a single site, such datasets are inherently incomplete because they generally do not capture shopping behavior across multiple websites. A customer's visit patterns at one or more other sites may provide relevant information about the timing and frequency of his or her future visit patterns at the site of interest.
   We develop a stochastic timing model of cross-site visit behavior to understand how to leverage information from one site to help explain customer behavior at another. To this end, we incorporate two sources of association in browsing patterns: one for the observable outcomes (i.e., arrival times) of two timing processes and the other for the latent visit propensities across a set of competing sites. This proposed multivariate timing mixture model can be viewed as a generalization of the univariate exponential-gamma model.
   In our empirical analysis, we show that a failure to account for both sources of association not only leads to poor fit and forecasts, but also generates systematically biased parameter estimates. We highlight the model's ability to make accurate statements about the future behavior of the "zero class" (i.e., previous nonvisitors to a given site) using summary information (i.e., recency and frequency) from past visit patterns at a competing site.

TI Communication strategies and product line design
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB When selling a product line, a firm has to consider the costs of communicating about the different products to the consumers. This may affect the product line design in general, and which products or services are offered in particular. The problem is that firms have to communicate to consumers, possibly through advertising, to make them consider buying the products that firms are selling. This results in the firm offering a smaller number of products than is optimal when advertising has no costs. This effect is greater the extent of consumer confusion about the advertising messages, and is reduced by a greater ability to target advertising. When offering vertically differentiated products (second-degree price discrimination), under general conditions it is optimal to advertise so that one has a greater proportion of sales of a lower-quality product than if advertising had no cost. This situation also allows the firm to charge a lower price for the high-quality product and offer a higher quality of the low-quality product than it would if advertising were without cost.

TI Decomposing the sales promotion bump with store data
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Sales promotions generate substantial short-term sales increases. To determine whether the sales promotion bump is truly beneficial from a managerial perspective, we propose a system of store-level regression models that decomposes the sales promotion bump into three parts: cross-brand effects (secondary demand), cross-period effects (primary demand borrowed from other time periods), and category-expansion effects (remaining primary demand). Across four store-level scanner datasets, we find that each of these three parts contribute about one third on average. One extension we propose is the separation of the category-expansion effect into cross-store and market-expansion effects. Another one is to split the cross-item effect (total across all other items) into cannibalization and between-brand effects. We also allow for a flexible decomposition by allowing all effects to depend on the feature/display support condition and on the magnitude of the price discount. The latter dependence is achieved by local polynomial regression. We find that feature-supported price discounts are strongly associated with cross-period effects while display-only supported price discounts have especially strong category-expansion effects. While the role of the category-expansion effect tends to increase with higher price discounts, the roles of cross-brand and cross-period effects both tend to decrease.

TI Technological advances, transaction costs, and consumer welfare
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Consumers incur many transaction costs in purchasing and using most products. This paper examines the effects of a reduction in such consumer transaction costs caused by market-level technological advances. Using a model in which consumers are simultaneously heterogeneous in their transaction costs and in their marginal valuations of product quality, this paper highlights two mechanisms that can cause such reductions in consumer transaction costs to lower consumer surplus and reduce consumer share of the total social surplus. Specifically, market-level technological advances reduce different consumers' transaction costs by different amounts and increase their reservation prices by different amounts, which can lead to: (i) product design changes that many current consumers do not like and (ii) homogenization in consumer reservation prices that allows a seller to extract more surplus through its pricing policy. This paper also shows that consumers may be better off with seller-induced higher consumer transaction costs. Finally, the paper shows how, depending on the nature of the quality production process, such reductions in consumer transaction costs can either lower or raise product qualities and consumer prices.

TI The effects of free sample promotions on incremental brand sales
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The authors present a model of free sample effects and evidence from two field experiments on free samples. The model incorporates three potential effects of free samples on sales: (1) an acceleration effect, whereby consumers begin repeat purchasing of the sampled brand earlier than they otherwise would; (2) a cannibalization effect, which reduces the number of paid trial purchases of the brand; and (3) an expansion effect, which induces purchasing by consumers who would not consider buying the brand without a free sample. The empirical findings suggest that, unlike other consumer promotions such as coupons, free samples can produce measurable long-term effects on sales that can be observed as much as 12 months after the promotion. The data also show that the effectiveness of free sample promotions can vary widely, even between brands in the same product category.
   Application of the model to the data from the two experiments reveals that the magnitude of acceleration, cannibalization, and expansion effects varies substantially across the two free sample promotions. These and other findings suggest that the model can be a useful tool for obtaining insights into the nature of free sample promotions.

TI Who benefits from store brand entry?
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Store brand entry has become a key issue in marketing as it may structurally change the performance of and the interactions among all market players. Based on their multivariate time-series analysis, the authors demonstrate permanent performance effects of store brand entry, typically benefiting the retailer, the consumers, and premium-brand manufacturers, while harming second-tier brand manufacturers. For the retailer, they consistently find two beneficial effects of store brand entry: high unit margins on the store brand itself and higher unit margins on the national brands. This increase in unit margins implies that the retailer strengthens its bargaining position vis-a-vis national brand manufacturers. However, store brand entry only rarely yields category expansion and does not create store traffic or revenue benefits. Second, consumers do not obtain lower prices on all national brands, only on some second-tier brands. However, they benefit from enlarged product assortment and intensified promotional activity that lowers average price paid for two out of four categories. For the manufacturers, store brand entry is typically beneficial for premium-price national brands, but not for second-tier national brands. Often, premium brands experience lower long-term price sensitivity and higher revenues, whereas second-tier brands experience higher long-term price sensitivity and lower revenues.
