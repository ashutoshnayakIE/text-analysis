AB Interactions between consumers and humanoid service robots (HSRs; i.e.,
   robots with a human-like morphology such as a face, arms, and legs) will
   soon be part of routine marketplace experiences. It is unclear, however,
   whether these humanoid robots (compared with human employees) will
   trigger positive or negative consequences for consumers and companies.
   Seven experimental studies reveal that consumers display compensatory
   responses when they interact with an HSR rather than a human employee
   (e.g., they favor purchasing status goods, seek social affiliation, and
   order and eat more food). The authors investigate the underlying process
   driving these effects, and they find that HSRs elicit greater consumer
   discomfort (i.e., eeriness and a threat to human identity), which in
   turn results in the enhancement of compensatory consumption. Moreover,
   this research identifies boundary conditions of the effects such that
   the compensatory responses that HSRs elicit are (1) mitigated when
   consumer-perceived social belongingness is high, (2) attenuated when
   food is perceived as more healthful, and (3) buffered when the robot is
   machinized (rather than anthropomorphized).

   data for a dense consumer panel, and they show that it increases the
   accuracy of conjoint predictions for actual purchases observed months
   later. The key innovation lies in combining conjoint data with a long
   and detailed panel of actual choices for a random sample of the target
   population. By linking the actual purchase and conjoint data,
   researchers can estimate preferences for attributes not yet present in
   the marketplace, while also addressing many of the key limitations of
   conjoint analysis, including sample selection and contextual
   differences. Counterfactual product and pricing exercises illustrate the
   managerial relevance of the approach.

AB The authors study how faster delivery in the online channel affects
   sales within and across channels in omnichannel retailing. The authors
   leverage a quasi-experiment involving the opening of a new distribution
   center by a U.S. apparel retailer, which resulted in unannounced faster
   deliveries to western U.S. states through its online channel. Using a
   difference-in-differences approach, the authors show that online store
   sales increased, on average, by 1.45% per business-day reduction in
   delivery time, from a baseline of seven business days. The authors also
   find a positive spillover effect to the retailer's offline stores. These
   effects increase gradually in the short-to-medium run as the result of
   higher order count. The authors identify two main drivers of the
   observed effect: (I) customer learning through service interactions with
   the retailer and (2) existing brand presence in terms of online store
   penetration rate and offline store presence. Customers with less online
   store experience are more responsive to faster deliveries in the short
   run, whereas experienced online store customers are more responsive in
   the long run.

AB At many firms, incentivized salespeople with private information about
   customers are responsible for customer relationship management. Although
   incentives motivate sales performance, private information can induce
   moral hazard by salespeople to gain compensation at the expense of the
   firm. The authors investigate the sales performance-moral hazard
   trade-off in response to multidimensional performance (acquisition and
   maintenance) incentives in the presence of private information. Using
   unique panel data on customer loan acquisition and repayments linked to
   salespeople from a microfinance bank, the authors detect evidence of
   salesperson private information. Acquisition incentives induce
   salesperson moral hazard, leading to adverse customer selection, but
   maintenance incentives moderate it as salespeople recognize the negative
   effects of acquiring low-quality customers on future payoffs.
   Critically, without the moderating effect of maintenance incentives, the
   adverse selection effect of acquisition incentives overwhelms the
   sales-enhancing effects, clarifying the importance of multidimensional
   incentives for customer relationship management. Reducing private
   information (through job transfers) hurts customer maintenance but has
   greater impact on productivity by moderating adverse selection at
   acquisition. This article also contributes to the recent literature on
   detecting and disentangling customer adverse selection and customer
   moral hazard (defaults) with a new identification strategy that exploits
   the time-varying effects of salesperson incentives.

AB Technology is making it easier for firms to track consumers' purchase
   history and leverage the information when setting prices. This article
   explores the practice of behavior-based pricing (BBP) in a horizontally
   differentiated market where consumers' taste is diverse and the
   consideration set is limited. The analysis identifies a novel mechanism
   that can help firms earn more profits with BBP than without it. Prior
   research shows that BBP intensifies price competition for new consumers.
   The authors show that if consumer valuation is low, the lower price can
   help expand sales to consumers for whom only the second preferred
   product is available, and the resulting increase in revenue more than
   offsets the loss in revenue because of the intensified price
   competition. The opposite result occurs if product valuation is high.
   Moreover, the difference in the price charged for old and new consumers
   under BBP decreases with the diversity in consumers' taste if consumer
   valuation is low. The result, however, is reversed if consumer valuation
   is high.

AB In the context of user-generated content (UGC), mobile devices have made
   it easier for consumers to review products and services in a timely
   manner. In practice, some UGC sites indicate if a review was posted from
   a mobile device. For example, TripAdvisor uses a "via mobile" label to
   denote reviews from mobile devices. However, the extent to which such
   information affects consumers is unknown. To address this gap, the
   authors use TripAdvisor data and five experiments to examine how mobile
   devices influence consumers' perceptions of online reviews and their
   purchase intentions. They find that knowing a review was posted from a
   mobile device can lead consumers to have higher purchase intentions.
   Interestingly, this is due to a process in which consumers assume mobile
   reviews are more physically effortful to craft and subsequently equate
   this greater perceived effort with the credibility of the review.

AB Research suggests that consumers are averse to relying on algorithms to
   perform tasks that are typically done by humans, despite the fact that
   algorithms often perform better. The authors explore when and why this
   is true in a wide variety of domains. They find that algorithms are
   trusted and relied on less for tasks that seem subjective (vs.
   objective) in nature. However, they show that perceived task objectivity
   is malleable and that increasing a task's perceived objectivity
   increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers
   mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to
   perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms' perceived affective
   human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of
   algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the
   results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two
   online field studies with over 56,000 participants. The results provide
   insights into when and why consumers are likely to use algorithms and
   how marketers can increase their use when they outperform humans.

AB Four experiments supported by six supplemental studies show that premium
   but higher-priced products (e.g., direct flights, larger-capacity data
   storage devices) are more popular when the additional cost is made
   explicit using differential price framing (DPF; e.g., "for $20 more")
   rather than being left implicit, as in standard inclusive price framing
   (IPF; e.g., "for $60 total"). The DPF effect is driven by pricing
   focalism: relative to IPF, DPF creates a focus on the price difference,
   which, because it is smaller than the total price, leads to lower
   perceived expensiveness and thus greater choice share for the premium
   option. This price framing effect is robust to displaying the total cost
   of the purchase, bad deals, and easy-to-compute price differences, and
   it appears to be uniquely effective in pricing contexts. However, DPF
   effects are reduced among consumers who adopt a slow and effortful
   decision process. These findings have implications for research on price
   partitioning, the design of effective pricing strategy, the sources of
   expensiveness perceptions in the marketplace, and consumer welfare.

AB Many service providers offer supplementary products related to their
   ongoing services (e.g., fitness centers offer fitness smartwatches). In
   seven studies, the authors show that the payment method for such
   supplementary products (multiple payments vs. a single lump sum) affects
   customers' tendency to defect from the provider's core service over
   time. Specifically, when customers pay for add-ons in multiple
   payments-provided that (1) they perceive the add-on as being bundled
   with the core service and (2) the payment period has an end point-they
   are initially less likely to defect from the service provider than when
   they pay in a single payment. Over time, however, as payments are made,
   this gap closes, such that defection intentions under the two payment
   methods eventually become similar. The authors propose that this
   phenomenon reflects "commitment projection," wherein a decrease in
   customers' commitment to the add-on product over time is projected onto
   their commitment to the service provider. These findings carry important
   managerial implications, given that many service providers offer add-on
   products in multiple-payment plans and that customers' defection
   decisions substantially affect firms' profitability.

AB Logos frequently include textual and/or visual design elements that are
   descriptive of the type of product/service that brands market. However,
   knowledge about how and when logo descriptiveness can influence brand
   equity is limited. Using a multi-method research approach across six
   studies, the authors demonstrate that more (vs. less) descriptive logos
   can positively influence brand evaluations, purchase intentions, and
   brand performance. They also demonstrate that these effects occur
   because more (vs. less) descriptive logos are easier to process and thus
   elicit stronger impressions of authenticity, which consumers value.
   Furthermore, two important moderators are identified: the positive
   effects of logo descriptiveness are considerably attenuated for brands
   that are familiar (vs. unfamiliar) to consumers and reversed (i.e.,
   negative) for brands that market a type of product/ service linked with
   negatively (vs. positively) valenced associations in consumers' minds.
   Finally, an analysis of 597 brand logos suggests that marketing
   practitioners might not fully take advantage of the potential benefits
   of logo descriptiveness. The theoretical contributions and managerial
   implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Companies frequently allow customers to customize products by assembling
   different product features or ingredients. Whereas existing research has
   demonstrated that customers assign greater overall value to customized
   products, this research focuses on the effect of customization on
   customers' perceptions of specific product attributes (e.g., how healthy
   a product is). The findings of six studies-in the field, laboratory, and
   online-demonstrate that customizers and noncustomizers differ in their
   product perceptions even if the product is objectively the same. This is
   because customization leads customers to perceive the product in line
   with their own self-image (e.g., as an unhealthy eater), a phenomenon
   that the authors term "self-image-consistent product perceptions."
   Essentially, customization may influence product perceptions depending
   on the product and individuals' self-image; this can have downstream
   consequences on recommendations and social media communication. The
   authors test this theory for different product categories (clothing,
   food, and vacation packages) and attributes (fashionable, healthy, and
   adventurous) and demonstrate that framing customization as a simple
   choice or strengthening product positioning through labeling mitigates
   negative effects of customization.

   from over 9.5 million tweets posted during and shortly after four key
   debates leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the authors
   test a series of hypotheses about how tweeting evolves over time during

   of the "Twittersphere" became increasingly decoupled from the live
   event, and (2) the drivers of the success of tweets during the debates
   differed from the drivers of success observed after the debates. During
   the debates, users acted akin to narrators, posting shorter tweets that
   commented on unfolding events, with linguistic emotionality playing a
   limited role in sharing. However, when the debates were over, users
   acted more like interpreters, with successful posts being more elaborate
   and visually and emotionally rich accounts of the event. Evidence for

AB How consumers use review content has remained opaque due to the

   data. The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep
   learning-based natural language processing on data that tracks
   individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on
   an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They
   extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product
   categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe
   consumers' review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not
   read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that
   are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the
   causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep
   learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a
   regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and
   price content significantly increase conversion across almost all
   product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the
   average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more
   competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A
   counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on
   content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting

   increasing search frictions by placing obstacles to locating discounted
   items can improve online retailers' margins and even increase
   conversion. The authors demonstrate this using a simple theoretical
   framework that suggests inducing consumers to inspect higher-priced
   items first may simultaneously increase the average price of items sold
   and the overall expected purchase probability by inducing consumers to
   search more products. The authors test and confirm these predictions in
   a series of field experiments conducted with a dominant online fashion
   and apparel retailer. Furthermore, using information in historical
   transaction data about each consumer, the authors demonstrate that
   price-sensitive shoppers are more likely to willingly incur search costs
   when locating discounted items. Our results show that increasing search
   frictions can be used as a self-selecting price discrimination tool to

   traits in the text they write when applying for a loan. This textual
   information has a substantial and significant ability to predict whether
   borrowers will pay back the loan above and beyond the financial and
   demographic variables commonly used in models predicting default. The
   authors use text-mining and machine learning tools to automatically
   process and analyze the raw text in over 120,000 loan requests from
   Prosper, an online crowdfunding platform. Including in the predictive
   model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict
   loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The
   authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more
   likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the

   and short-term-focused words. The authors further observe that
   defaulting loan requests are written in a manner consistent with the

AB This article studies how the incentive structures and disclosure schemes
   of a contest affect the contestants' intrinsic motivations.
   Specifically, the authors measure the effects of these design decisions
   on two types of nonmonetary rank-based utility: self-generated and
   peer-induced. They run a set of laboratory experiments involving
   contests under various reward spreads and disclosure schemes. First,
   they find that virtually all commonly adopted disclosure schemes
   generate positive peer-induced rank-based utility. However, the relative
   performances of alternative disclosure schemes can depend on the spread
   of contest rewards and the number of contestants. Second, being
   recognized as a winner confers positive peer-induced rank-based utility;
   moreover, being recognized as the sole first-place winner or as one
   among multiple winners does not produce significantly different
   peer-induced utility. Third, "shaming" by disclosing the identity of
   contestants ranked at the bottom leads to negative peer-induced
   rank-based utility, but the effect is marginally insignificant. Finally,
   a smaller spread of contest rewards consistently results in higher
   levels of self-generated rank-based utility. These results underscore
   the importance of jointly choosing incentive structures and disclosure
   schemes.

AB As sustainable consumption becomes increasingly important, firms must
   better understand the drivers behind the consumption of these products.
   This article examines the effects of mass media in the context of the
   U.S. hybrid vehicle market. Drawing on monthly sales data, the authors
   provide evidence that the general coverage of climate change or global
   warming by major media outlets exerts an overall positive impact on the
   sales of hybrid vehicles. This impact mainly comes from the media
   reports that assert that climate change is occurring. In contrast, media
   coverage that either denies climate change or holds a neutral stance on
   the issue has little impact. The authors provide preliminary evidence
   that a social norm advocating for environmentally friendly consumption
   plays an important role in how media coverage affects consumer purchase.
   They provide implications for theory and practice and call for future
   research that examines the causal impact of media in general on consumer
   decisions, especially in domains that are crucial for the society.

AB Research on customer participation (CP) has focused on its benefits for
   customers. However, recent research suggests that CP is beneficial to
   both customers and firms. The literature is also sparse on the economic
   (e.g., profitability) and customer (e.g., customer retention) impact of
   CP. This research introduces the concept of customer empowerment and
   develops and tests a model of customer empowerment as a parallel
   mediator, along with customer satisfaction, to explain the linkage
   between CP and bank branch performance. Furthermore, the authors draw on
   a broader set of moderators beyond customer characteristics to examine
   when CP affects empowerment and satisfaction. Using triadic matched data
   from a multiwave design and a three-level model in which customers are
   nested within employees, who are, in turn, nested within bank branches,
   the authors show that customer empowerment and satisfaction fully
   mediate the effect of CP on branch performance. The findings also show
   that CP results in greater customer empowerment and satisfaction when
   there is fit between participation and the context in which it is used.
   The authors discuss implications for advancing CP research and suggest
   actionable steps for reaping the economic and customer benefits of CP.

AB Previous research has shown that there exist "harbinger customers" who
   systematically purchase new products that fail (and are discontinued by
   retailers). This article extends this result in two ways. First, the
   findings document the existence of "harbinger zip codes." If households
   in these zip codes adopt a new product, this is a signal that the new
   product will fail. Second, a series of comparisons reveal that
   households in harbinger zip codes make other decisions that differ from
   other households. The first comparison identifies harbinger zip codes
   using purchases from one retailer and then evaluates purchases at a
   different retailer. Households in harbinger zip codes purchase products
   from the second retailer that other households are less likely to
   purchase. The analysis next compares donations to congressional election
   candidates; households in harbinger zip codes donate to different
   candidates than households in neighboring zip codes, and they donate to
   candidates who are less likely to win. House prices in harbinger zip
   codes also increase at slower rates than in neighboring zip codes.
   Investigation of households that change zip codes indicates that the
   harbinger zip code effect is more due to where customers choose to live,
   rather than households influencing their neighbors' tendencies.

AB Mass customization interfaces typically guide consumers through the
   configuration process in a sequential manner, focusing on one product
   attribute after the other. What if this standardized customization
   experience were personalized for consumers on the basis of how they
   process information? A series of large-scale field and experimental
   studies, conducted with Western and Eastern consumers, shows that
   matching the interface to consumers' culture-specific processing style
   enhances the effectiveness of mass customization. Specifically,
   presenting the same information isolated (by attribute) to Western
   consumers but contextualized (by alternative) to Eastern consumers
   increases satisfaction with and likelihood of purchasing the configured
   product, along with the amount of money spent on the product. These
   positive consumer responses emerge because of an increase in "interface
   fluency"-consumers' subjective experience of ease when using the
   interface. The authors advise firms to personalize the customization
   experience by employing processing-congruent interfaces across consumer
   markets.

AB In many markets, such as video streaming or information services, a
   consumer may purchase multiple competing products or services. The
   existing theoretical literature typically assumes that each consumer can
   buy only one product. This article explicitly models the consumer's
   multipurchase behavior and examines an upstream content creator's
   content production and selling strategies as well as competing
   downstream distributors' content acquisition and pricing strategies. The
   authors find that in contrast to the case of single-product purchase,
   under multiproduct purchase, only one distributor will acquire the
   creator's new content in equilibrium. Furthermore, when the content
   distributors are not highly differentiated (each having a limited amount
   of unique content), the content creator will reduce new content
   production, leading to lower profits for both the content creator and
   the content distributors. By contrast, when the distributors are already
   highly differentiated with a substantial amount of unique content, the
   content creator will increase its content production, leading to higher
   profits for both the content creator and the distributors. The authors
   show that their main results and insights are robust to several
   alternative assumptions.

   content on social media engagement. After accounting for selection bias
   on the inclusion of image content, the authors find a significant and
   robust positive mere presence effect of image content on user engagement
   in both product categories on Twitter. They also find that high-quality
   and professionally shot pictures consistently lead to higher engagement
   on both platforms for both product categories. However, the effect of
   colorfulness varies by product category, while the presence of human

AB Native advertising is a type of online advertising that matches the form
   and function of the platform on which it appears. In practice, the
   choice between display and in-feed native advertising presents brand
   advertisers and online news publishers with conflicting objectives.
   Advertisers face a trade-off between ad clicks and brand recognition,
   whereas publishers need to strike a balance between ad clicks and the
   platform's trustworthiness. For policy makers, concerns that native
   advertising confuses customers prompted the U.S. Federal Trade
   Commission to issue guidelines for disclosing native ads. This research
   aims to understand how consumers respond to native ads versus display
   ads and to different styles of native ad disclosures, using randomized
   online and field experiments combining behavioral clickstream, eye
   movement, and survey response data. The results show that when the
   position of an ad on a news page is controlled for, a native ad
   generates a higher click-through rate because it better resembles the
   surrounding editorial content. However, a display ad leads to more
   visual attention, brand recognition, and trustworthiness for the website
   than a native ad.

AB Previous research has demonstrated that consumers evaluate products
   according to their perceived benefits when making a choice. This article
   extends prior work by proposing a method that evaluates the degree to
   which multiple a priori defined benefits mediate product choices. The
   model is the first to consider process heterogeneity-that is,
   heterogeneity in how consumers perceive multiple attributes to
   positively or negatively affect multiple benefits simultaneously and the
   contribution of each benefit to product utility. The authors propose
   discrete choice experiments to holistically measure the link between
   attributes and benefits, as well as between attributes and choice,
   resulting in data that can be analyzed with a generalized probit model.
   The approach contributes to mediation research by offering an
   alternative method of handling multiple multinomial mediators and
   dichotomous outcome variables. An empirical illustration of bread
   choices shows how consumer judgments about health and value perceptions
   of products mediate purchase decisions. The authors demonstrate how the
   method can help managers (1) confirm and test existing knowledge about
   latent benefits, including whether they explain all the variation in
   choice, and (2) consider process heterogeneity to inform market
   segmentation strategies.

AB Marketing research relies on individual-level estimates to understand
   the rich heterogeneity of consumers, firms, and products. While much of
   the literature focuses on capturing static cross-sectional
   heterogeneity, little research has been done on modeling dynamic
   heterogeneity, or the heterogeneous evolution of individual-level model
   parameters. In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for
   capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level, latent,
   Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard
   heterogeneity specifications, this Gaussian process dynamic
   heterogeneity (GPDH) specification models individual-level parameters as
   flexible variations around population-level trends, allowing for sharing
   of statistical information both across individuals and within
   individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise
   individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. The authors show
   that GPDH nests existing heterogeneity specifications and that not
   flexibly capturing individual-level dynamics may result in biased
   parameter estimates. Substantively, they apply GPDH to understand
   preference dynamics and to model the evolution of online reviews. Across
   both applications, they find robust evidence of dynamic heterogeneity
   and illustrate GPDH's rich managerial insights, with implications for
   targeting, pricing, and market structure analysis.

AB Behavior-based pricing (BBP) refers to the practice in which firms
   collect consumers' purchase history data, recognize repeat and new
   consumers from the data, and offer them different prices. This is a
   prevalent practice for firms and a worldwide concern for consumers.
   Extant research has examined BBP under the assumption that consumers
   observe firms' practice of BBP. However, consumers do not know that
   specific firms are doing this and are often unaware of how firms collect
   and use their data. In this article, the authors examine (I) how firms
   make BBP decisions when consumers do not observe whether firms perform
   BBP and (2) how the transparency of firms' BBP practice affects firms
   and consumers. They find that when consumers do not observe firms'
   practice of BBP and the cost of implementing BBP is low, a firm indeed
   practices BBP, even though BBP is a dominated strategy when consumers
   observe it. When the cost is moderate, the firm does not use BBP;
   however, it must distort its firstperiod price downward to signal and
   convince consumers of its choice. A high cost of implementing BBP serves
   as a commitment device that the firm will forfeit BBP, thereby improving
   firm profit. By comparing regimes in which consumers do and do not
   observe a firm's practice of BBP, the authors find that transparency of
   BBP increases firm profit but decreases consumer surplus and social
   welfare. Therefore, requiring firms to disclose collection and usage of
   consumer data could hurt consumers and lead to unintended consequences.

AB People like graspable objects more when the objects are located on the
   dominant-hand side of their body or when the handles point toward their
   dominant-hand side. However, many products do not have handles or are
   not graspable (e.g., services, objects hanging on the wall). Can
   nongraspable products nevertheless benefit from the effects of appealing
   to viewers' dominant hands? The present research shows that, yes,
   consumers respond more positively to nongraspable products if a haptic
   cue (an object that is graspable or suggestive of hand action) is
   located within the same visual field as the target and is positioned to
   appeal to the viewer's dominant hand. This result is driven by the
   creation and transfer of perceived ownership from cue to target. These
   findings extend the use of haptic cues to nongraspable products and
   uncover the critical role played by perceived ownership, including its
   ability to transfer from one object to another located in the same
   visual field. Moreover, the current research demonstrates situations in
   which the use of haptic cues will not enhance response.

AB In this research, the authors propose that incidental exposure to price
   promotions can cause downstream impatience in an unrelated domain.
   Specifically, price promotions trigger reward seeking-a general
   motivational state-and reward seeking, in turn, yields impatience. Seven
   experiments (N = 1,795) demonstrate how incidental exposure to price
   promotions can cause greater willingness to pay to avoid waiting
   (Experiments I a and I b), shorter actual wait times (Experiments 2, 3b,
   and 5), greater propensity to break a rule to save time (Experiment 3a),
   and greater discounting in a consequential intertemporal choice
   (Experiment 4). Consistent with this account, the effect is both more
   pronounced for people with greater reward sensitivity (Experiments 3a
   and 3b) and mediated by reward seeking (Experiment 4). Finally, a
   conceptual replication in a field setting underscores the external
   validity and managerial relevance of the findings (Experiment 5).

AB Selfish incentives typically outperform prosocial incentives, and
   customer referral programs frequently use such "selfish" (i.e.,
   sender-benefiting) incentives to incentivize current customers to
   recruit new customers. However, in two field experiments and a fully
   incentivized lab experiment, this research finds that "prosocial" (i.e.,
   recipient-benefiting) referral incentives recruit more new customers.
   Five subsequent experiments test a process account for this effect,
   identifying two key psychological mechanisms: reputational benefits and
   action costs. First, at the referral stage, senders (existing customers)
   anticipate reputational benefits for referring recipients (potential new
   customers), who receive a reward for signing up. These reputational
   benefits render recipient-benefiting referrals just as effective as
   sender-benefiting referrals at the relatively low-cost referral stage.
   Second, at the uptake stage, recipient-benefiting referrals are more
   effective than sender-benefiting referrals: recipient-benefiting
   referrals directly incentivize recipients to sign up, providing a clear
   reward for an otherwise costly uptake decision. The preponderance of
   selfish, or sender-benefiting, referral incentives in the marketplace
   suggests these effects are unanticipated by marketers who design
   incentive schemes.

AB The authors examine how gender identity and local-global identity-two
   important consumer identities and segmentation bases-affect consumer
   price sensitivity. These identities may be associated with similar
   behavioral norms such that a female identity and a local identity are
   associated with the norms of small groups and intimate relationships,
   whereas a male identity and a global identity are associated with the
   norms of large groups and broad relationships. Thus, a female identity
   and a global (vs. local) identity, as is the case with a male identity
   and a local (vs. global) identity, results in identity incongruence (vs.
   congruence). The authors argue that identity incongruence depletes
   cognitive resources and induces affective processing, which in turn
   activates a sacrifice mindset and results in lower price sensitivity.
   Five studies with different research designs, divergent measures of key
   constructs, and diverse samples support the theories and identify
   boundary conditions of the focal relationship. The findings expand the
   literature on multiple consumer identities and price sensitivity and
   provide useful guidelines for global companies' pricing strategies.

AB The authors propose a new conceptual basis for predicting when and why
   consumers match others' consumption choices. Specifically, they
   distinguish between ordinal ("ranked") versus nominal ("unranked")
   attributes and propose that consumers are more likely to match others on
   ordinal than on nominal attributes. Eleven studies involving a range of
   different ways of operationalizing ordinal versus nominal attributes
   collectively support this hypothesis. The authors' conceptualization
   helps resolve divergent findings in prior literature and provides
   guidance to managers on how to leverage information about prior
   customers' choices and employees' recommendations to shape and predict
   future customers' choices. Furthermore, the authors find process
   evidence that this effect is driven in part by consumers' beliefs that a
   failure to match on ordinal (but not nominal) attributes will lead to
   social discomfort for one or both parties. Although the primary focus is
   on food choices, the effects are also demonstrated in other domains,
   extending the generalizability of the findings and implications for
   managerial practice and theory. Finally, the conceptual framework offers

   industry-health care-and the $1 trillion nonprofit sector. Using
   analytical and empirical analyses, the authors reveal the marketing
   strategies helping private nonprofit hospitals achieve higher output,
   prices, and profits than for-profit hospitals. Nonprofit hospitals,
   focusing on both profits and output, obtain these outcomes by expanding
   their service mix with high-priced premium specialty medical services
   (PSMS), whereas for-profit hospitals can be more profitable with higher
   prices for basic services. Competition increases the differences between
   nonprofit and forprofit hospitals in PSMS breadth, output, and prices.
   Nonprofit hospitals lose their competitive advantage when competing with
   other nonprofits; that is, presence of a for-profit competitor broadens
   available nonprofit PSMS. With broader service mixes, nonprofits focus
   more on national advertising than for-profits because PSMS (e.g.,
   pediatric trauma, neurosurgery, heart transplants, oncology) require
   larger geographic markets than local basic services (e.g., laboratory,
   diagnostics, nursing, pharmaceutics). Exogenous, heterogeneous state
   regulations restricting for-profit hospital entry help econometric
   identification (i.e., markets prohibiting for-profits act as controls).
   Service mix may be a key difference between nonprofit and for-profit

AB The authors study multiperiod sales force incentive contracting in which
   salespeople can engage in effort gaming, a phenomenon that has extensive
   empirical support. Focusing on a repeated moral hazard scenario with two
   independent periods and a risk-neutral agent with limited liability, the
   authors conduct a theoretical investigation to understand which effort
   profiles the firm can expect under the optimal contract. The authors
   show that various effort profiles that may give the appearance of being
   suboptimal, such as postponing effort exertion ("hockey stick") and not
   exerting effort after a bad or a good initial demand outcome ("giving
   up" and "resting on laurels," respectively) may indeed be induced
   optimally by the firm. This is because, under certain conditions that
   depend on how severe the contracting frictions are and how effective
   effort exertion is in increasing demand, the firm wants to concentrate
   rewards on extreme demand outcomes. Doing this induces gaming and
   reduces expected demand but also makes motivating effort cheaper, thus
   saving on incentive payments. On introducing dependence between time
   periods, such as when the agent can transfer demands between periods,
   this insight continues to hold and, furthermore, "hockey stick," "giving
   up," and "resting on laurels" can be optimal for the firm even under
   repeated short time horizon contracting. The results imply that one must
   carefully consider the setting and environmental factors when making
   inferences about contract effectiveness from dynamic effort profiles of
   agents.

AB Many studies have quantified the effects of TV ad spending or gross
   rating points on brand sales. Yet this effect is likely moderated by the
   different types of brand-related messages or cues (e.g., logo, brand
   attributes) embedded in the ads and by the ways (e.g., explicitly or
   implicitly) these cues are conveyed to TV audiences. The authors thus
   measure 17 cues often used within ads to build brand awareness (or
   salience) and brand image and investigate their influence on ad
   effectiveness. Technically, the study builds a dynamic model to quantify
   the effects of advertising on sales; builds a robust and interpretable
   (i.e., nonparametric and sparse) factor model that integrates
   correlated, left-censored branding cues; and then models the effects of
   advertising as a function of the factors identified by these cues. An
   analysis of 177 campaigns aired by 62 brands finds that salience cues
   (e.g., logo) and benefit and attribute messages moderate ad
   effectiveness. It also finds that explicit cues are more effective than
   implicit ones; nonetheless, the primary drivers of ad effectiveness are
   visual salience cues: the duration and frequency with which the logo and
   the duration with which the product are displayed. The study can thus
   suggest ways brand and ad agency managers can improve the effects of
   creative ad content on sales.

AB For many consumer goods, the visual appearance is a vital determinant of
   market success. Although there is an emerging literature on how
   objective design characteristics drive consumer preferences, this
   literature has not yet taken into account that product design happens in
   the context of a brand's equity. This research addresses the question of
   how to leverage brand equity when designing the visual appearance of a
   product. Specifically, it investigates the role of two key strategic
   visual design decisions: brand typicality (similarity within the brand's
   range) and segment typicality (similarity to the competitive set).
   Drawing on fluency theory, the authors argue that high-equity brands
   benefit more from brand typicality but less from segment typicality than
   low-equity brands. Using data from the U.S. car market tracking market
   shares of 456 car models of 39 major brands operating in seven market
   segments across 13 years, the study provides empirical evidence for this
   conjecture and, thereby, implications for strategic product design and
   visual design theory.

AB Ethics has long been, and continues to be, a central topic among
   marketing scholars and practitioners. When providing complex
   services-multiple interactions over time that are predicated on the
   evolving needs of customers-service providers face ethical dilemmas,
   which are often resolved by engaging an ethics committee (EC). Despite
   the prevalence of ECs, research on service providers' preference to
   engage with an EC is sparse. This study examines whether the role that
   health care providers play, as either task manager or relationship
   manager, makes a difference in their preference for engaging with and
   utilizing an EC for resolving ethical dilemmas. Results based on 1,440
   observations collected from health care service providers show that
   service providers' task or relationship management role, as well as
   prior experience with an ethics consultation, influences their
   preference both for engaging an EC and for having the EC prescribe a
   specific outcome to resolve an ethical dilemma. This study extends prior
   work on conceptual models examining ethical decision-making processes in
   marketing.

AB The authors develop and test a theory of consumer inaction traps in the
   domain of decisions to either address or endure product malfunctions.
   According to this theory, the magnitude of product malfunctions can have
   a paradoxical effect on consumption experience. In particular, the less
   severe a product malfunction is, the more inclined consumers are to
   defer the initial decision about whether to take corrective action.
   Subsequent opportunities for corrective action are devalued relative to
   previously forgone ones. This dynamic tends to trap consumers in a state
   of inaction, resulting in their enduring smaller malfunctions longer
   than larger ones. A consequence of these inaction traps is that minor
   product malfunctions may result in less enjoyable overall consumption
   experiences than more severe defects. Evidence from eight experiments
   and a survey provides support for this theorizing by demonstrating the
   inaction-trap phenomenon, examining its downstream consequences,
   shedding light on the psychological dynamics of inaction, and
   identifying boundary conditions that suggest interventions for
   counteracting consumers' vulnerability to suffering disproportionately
   from relatively minor product malfunctions.

AB Prior research on the use of scent in advertising has shown that scent
   can enhance the memorability of and engagement with an ad. However, can
   scenting an ad also change the way consumers perceive and react to the
   advertised product? This research provides new insights for this
   question and demonstrates an additional facet of scent: its ability to
   physically represent the essence of a target product and thus induce a
   sense of proximity. Through six studies, the authors show that scented
   ads enhance consumers' sense of proximity of the advertised product and
   consequently increase product appeal. In line with the proposed visceral
   nature of the effect, this effect holds even for unpleasant scents but
   is contingent on the scent's ability to represent the advertised
   product. The effect is weakened when the product is physically close.
   The findings of this research have implications for when and why firms
   should use scented ads.

AB Researchers, marketers, and consumers often believe that amplifying
   emotional content is impactful for the spread of information and
   purchasing decisions. However, there is little systematic investigation
   of when emotionality backfires. This research demonstrates when and why
   positive emotion can have enhancing versus backfiring effects. The
   authors find that reviewers who express greater positive emotion are
   indeed more positive toward their products, regardless of product type.
   In addition, expressed emotion for hedonic products has a positive
   impact when read by others, but this emotion backfires for utilitarian
   products, leading others to be less positive. The authors construct a
   conceptual model of these effects and show that violated expectations
   leading to decreased trust underlie this divergence between reviewers
   and readers. The effects occur in well-controlled experiments as well as
   computational linguistic analysis of 100,000 Amazon reviews across 500
   products. Indeed, emotional reviews of utilitarian products are less
   likely to become popular and be displayed on the product's front page on
   Amazon. This work also introduces a novel tool for quantifying natural
   language in marketing: the Evaluative Lexicon.

AB Every day, consumers share word of mouth (WOM) on how products and
   behaviors are commonly adopted through the use of consensus language.
   Consensus language refers to words and expressions that suggest general
   agreement among a group of people regarding an opinion, product, or
   behavior (e.g., "everyone likes this movie"). In a series of online and
   field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the interpretation and
   persuasiveness of consensus language depends on the tie strength between
   the communicator and the receiver of WOM. Although abundant literature
   highlights the advantage of strong ties (e.g., close friends, family) in
   influence and persuasion, the authors find that weak ties (e.g., distant
   friends, acquaintances) are more influential than strong ties when using
   consensus language. The authors theorize and demonstrate that this
   effect occurs because weak ties evoke perceptions of a larger and more
   diverse group in consensus, which signals greater validity for the issue
   at hand. These findings contribute to research on WOM, tie strength, and
   descriptive norms and provide practical implications for marketers on
   ways to analyze and encourage consumer discourse.

AB A demonstration field experiment in a live-radio fund drive shows that
   women (but not men) primed with moral traits give about 20% more. The
   authors test one understudied explanation for this finding: gender
   differences in how market behavior (e.g., giving and supporting a
   nonprofit) shrinks moral identity discrepancy (i.e., the gap between
   actual and ideal moral identity). Field Survey I demonstrates the basic
   effect: the less money women (but not men) have historically given on
   average to a nonprofit, the larger their moral identity discrepancy.
   Field Experiment 2 shows a managerial implication of this basic effect:
   when primed with moral identity, women (but not men) who have supported
   the nonprofit less frequently in the past are more likely to follow an
   emailed link to help the nonprofit again. Study 3 tests one possible
   pathway underpinning this finding: even though giving makes women and
   men experience similar feelings of encouragement and uplift and similar
   reinforcement of their moral identity, only women with larger
   prebehavior moral identity discrepancy consequently shrink this
   discrepancy.

AB Internet news and search sites often excerpt content from and link to
   competing news outlets. On the one hand, providing outbound links can
   make the linking site more attractive, even to the point of stealing
   traffic from the linked sites. Regulatory policy, such as the European
   Union's Copyright Directive Article 15 taxing links, is predicated in
   part on this idea. On the other hand, receiving inbound links can
   increase a linked site's audience by informing readers about its news
   content that day. To explore these opposing perspectives, the authors
   develop a dynamic learning model and fit it to browsing and link data
   from celebrity news sites. They then simulate how banning links affects
   consumer browsing and find that linking increases celebrity news
   consumption, especially among consumers who browse the least. On
   average, linking benefits both the linking and linked sites. The authors
   estimate that exposure to a link increases the likelihood of visiting
   the linked site by .14%. This increase is approximately three times the
   commonly reported click-through rate for paid display advertisements.

AB The authors develop an incentive-aligned experimental paradigm to study
   how consumer purchase dynamics are affected by the interplay between
   competing firms' loyalty programs and their pricing and promotional
   strategies. In this experiment, participants made sequential choices
   between two competing airlines in a stylized frequent traveler task for
   which an optimal dynamic decision policy can be numerically computed.
   The authors find that, on average, participants are able to partially
   realize the long-term benefits from loyalty programs, though most are
   sensitive to price. They also find that participants' preferences and
   levels of bounded rationality depend on the nature of the competitive
   environment, the particular state of each decision scenario, and the
   type of optimal action. Accordingly, the authors use an approximate
   dynamic programming model to incorporate boundedly rational decision
   making. The model classifies participants into five segments that
   exhibit variation in their performance and decision strategies.
   Importantly, they find that participants are able to adapt their
   decision strategies to the environment they face, and thus the overall
   market outcome and the performance of each firm are influenced by both
   the competitive environment and the assumption on the extent of consumer
   optimality.

AB An important aspect of multimedia advertising effectiveness that remains
   unexplored is a customer-level analysis of the relative importance of
   each medium for multiple retailer-brands within a product category. The
   increasing availability of customer databases for parent companies
   containing multimedia ad exposures, sales transactions in several
   purchase channels, and information across multiple retailer-brands now
   allows for a broader examination of advertising effectiveness. In this
   research, the authors monitor 4,000 customers over two years, linking
   their exposure to three media (email, catalogs, and paid search) to
   their in-store and online purchases for three retailer-brands in the
   clothing category. They develop a Tobit model for sales response to
   multimedia advertising that captures within-brand and within-channel
   correlations and accommodates individual-level advertising response
   parameters. Due to the very large number of observations (2.4 million)
   and random effects (60), the authors employ an emerging machine learning
   technique, variational Bayes, to estimate the model parameters. They
   find that email and sometimes catalogs from a focal retailer-brand have
   a negative influence on other retailer-brands in the category, whereas
   paid search influences only the focal retailer-brand. However,
   competitor catalogs often positively influence focal retailer-brand
   sales, but only among omnichannel customers. They segment customers by
   retailer-brand and channel usage, revealing a sizeable group of
   customers who shop across multiple retailer-brands and both purchase
   channels. Moreover, this segment is the most responsive to multimedia
   advertising.

AB The authors investigate how heuristics and analytics contribute to the
   advertising budget decision by decomposing it into four components: (1)
   baseline spending, (2) adaptive experimentation, (3)
   advertising-to-sales ratio, and (4) competitive parity. They propose a
   methodology to estimate and infer the weights of these four components.
   Applying this methodology to sales and advertising data across eight
   brands from three categories substantiates for the first time, and
   uniformly across all brands, that managers depart from optimality
   through adaptive experimentation, which is in line with dual control
   theory that suggests they do so to learn about advertising
   effectiveness. The adaptive experimentation finding, combined with
   evidence on the use of heuristic methods, suggests that budget decision
   making is characterized by bounded rationality. Furthermore, budgeting
   decisions are brand-specific, reflecting the considerations of a brand's
   market position and performance. Finally, simulation studies show that
   brands from categories with high uncertainty in advertising
   effectiveness can benefit from double-digit revenue lifts by placing
   higher emphasis on adaptive experimentation.

AB Ads promising a desired change are ubiquitous in the marketplace. These
   ads typically include visuals of the starting and ending point of the
   promised change ("before/after" ads). "Progression" ads, which include
   intermediate steps in addition to starting and ending points, are much
   rarer in the marketplace. Across several consumer domains, the authors
   show an ad-type effect: progression ads foster spontaneous simulation of
   the process through which the change will happen, which makes these ads
   more credible and, in turn, more persuasive than before/after ads
   (Studies 1-3). The authors also show that impairing process simulation
   and high skepticism moderate the ad-type effect (Studies 4-5). Finally,
   they show effect reversals: if consumers focus on achieving the desired
   results quickly, and it is possible to do so, progression ads and the
   associated process simulation backfire in terms of credibility and
   persuasion (Studies 6-7). These findings contribute to existing research
   by identifying conditions under which progression ads have beneficial or
   disadvantageous effects. These findings have managerial implications
   because they run counter to current marketing practices, which favor
   before/after over progression ads.

AB This research examines how the unsystematic (vs. systematic) spatial
   arrangement of a set of alternatives affects consumers' product choices.
   The key hypothesis is that an unsystematic product arrangement-in which
   an assortment consisting of several alternatives is arranged in an
   apparently arbitrary manner-causes greater perceptual disfluency, which
   in turn triggers more extensive exploratory product search, ultimately
   promoting the choice of unfamiliar products. This sequence of effects is
   particularly pronounced when consumers do not have a strong prior
   preference for specific alternatives in the assortment. Evidence from
   five studies, including a large-scale field experiment, provides support
   for this theorizing across various display formats and product domains.
   The findings advance our understanding of how the spatial arrangement of
   a product assortment influences consumer choice, and they shed light on
   the psychological mechanism that governs this effect.

   that scanners, as a bodily extension, influence sales through both
   cognitive (shelf attention, perceived control) and affective (number of

   implications for retailers considering whether to integrate scanners
   into their store environments.

AB Previous studies of in-store decision making have assumed that
   motivations for unplanned purchases are homogeneous throughout a
   shopping trip. In response to this assumption, the authors develop a
   conceptual framework to explain how consumers' internal (i.e.,
   intrinsic) and external (i.e., extrinsic) motivations for unplanned
   purchases actually vary during a shopping trip. Two field studies and
   five online experiments provide evidence that the personality trait of
   buying impulsivity predicts differences in whether a shopper initially
   focuses on internal motivations (e.g., "because I love it") or external
   motivations (e.g., "because it is on sale") for unplanned purchases at
   the beginning of a shopping trip and, consistent with a mechanism of
   motivation balancing, that motivations for unplanned purchases change as
   a shopper satisfies their initial motivations. The studies also
   demonstrate how the level of buying impulsivity influences the
   effectiveness of point-of-purchase messages at stimulating unplanned
   purchases and consumers' relative spending on unplanned purchases.
   Overall, these findings address conflicting results in previous shopping
   studies, advance the literature streams on consumer motivation and
   sequential choice, and contribute insights to enhance shopper-marketing
   programs.

AB Previous research on the effects of celebrity endorsement has focused on
   the transfer of positive properties (likeableness, credibility, symbolic
   meanings, etc.) from the endorser to the product. Taking a different
   perspective, this study suggests that the way in which consumers
   evaluate an endorser (i.e., the cognitive process, such as applying
   family origin or achievement as the basis for evaluation) will carry
   over to the evaluation of the endorsed product (e.g., applying country
   of origin or performance as the criteria). Five experiments support this
   process-transfer account and show that it can be induced by subtle
   verbal/visual cues in advertisements. Because the process transfer is
   not inherently associated with positive/negative valence, it provides a
   theoretical rationale for explaining successful endorsements involving
   endorsers who are less favorable/credible, less of a "fit" with the
   product, or associated with some negative meanings, in addition to those
   involving positively or neutrally evaluated endorsers. The
   process-transfer model supplements existing models and provides a more
   comprehensive understanding of endorser effects. It provides marketers
   with a set of less stringent guidelines for selecting endorsers as well
   as valuable damage control tools for brands when an endorser screws up.

AB This research examines the psychological processes and factors that
   shape illness-detection versus illness-prevention health actions. Four
   experiments using contexts of mental health, skin cancer, and breast
   cancer show that illness detection evokes fear, which undermines
   engagement in detection behaviors. Considering detection at low (vs.
   high) levels of thought reduced fear and increased health persuasion.
   Illness prevention is driven by self-efficacy perceptions and
   considering prevention at high (vs. low) levels of thought increases
   persuasion. In further evidence of process, trait fear moderated the
   detection effects, and dispositional self-efficacy moderated the
   prevention effects. As an intervention, framing a detection action as
   serving illness-prevention goals increased people's likelihood of
   engaging with an online breast cancer detection tool. These findings
   illuminate the psychology of detection as being distinct from the
   psychology of prevention, identify the role of fear in the consideration
   of health behaviors, and show contexts in which construal levels have
   divergent effects on health persuasion.

AB Although product advertising has been widely studied and understood in
   relation to the consumer's purchase decision, advertising may also have
   unintended but important societal and economic consequences. In this
   article, the authors examine a public health outcome-birth
   rate-associated with advertisements for erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs.
   Since the United States loosened regulations on direct-to-consumer
   television advertising for prescription drugs in 1997, ED drug makers
   have consistently been top spenders. By comparing advertising data with
   multiple birth data sets (patient-level hospital data from Massachusetts
   between 2001 and 2010 and micro birth certificate data from the United
   States between 2000 and 2004), the authors demonstrate that increased ED
   drug television advertising leads to a higher birth rate. Their results,
   which are robust with respect to different functional forms and
   falsification tests, show that a 1% increase in ED drug advertising
   contributes to an increase of .04%-.08% of total births. Their findings
   suggest that beyond the customer purchase decision, advertising can have
   important public health outcomes, with resulting implications for
   managerial decision making and policy formulation.

AB Consumers and marketers use facial information to make important
   inferences about others in many business contexts. However, consumers
   and firms are increasingly concerned about privacy and discrimination.
   To address privacy-perception trade-offs, the authors propose a novel
   contour-as-face (CaF) framework that transforms face images into contour
   images incorporating both the nonoutline and outline features of facial
   parts. In three empirical studies, the authors (1) compare human
   perceptions of face and contour images along 15 dimensions commonly
   assessed in marketing contexts; (2) investigate the effectiveness of
   contour images for protecting anonymity related to identity, age, and
   gender; and (3) implement the CaF framework in a real-life online dating
   context. Results show that the CaF framework effectively resolves
   privacy-perception trade-off problems by preserving the information that
   is useful for humans to make inferences about many relevant perceptual
   dimensions in marketing while making it virtually impossible for humans
   to infer identity and very difficult to infer age and gender
   accurately-two critical discrimination factors. Results from the field
   implementation demonstrate the feasibility and value of using the CaF
   framework for real-life decision making.

AB Free shipping promotions have become popular among online retailers.
   However, little is known about their influence on consumers' purchases,
   return behavior, and, ultimately, firm profit. The authors propose that
   free shipping promotions encourage customers to make riskier purchases,
   leading to more product returns. They estimate the impact of these
   promotions on purchase incidence, high-risk and low-risk spend, and
   return share. The results show that free shipping promotions increase
   expenditure for high-risk products, expanding their share of the
   consumer's market basket and thus increasing the overall return rate.
   This is validated in a field experiment. A field test and an online lab
   experiment analyze the mechanism linking free shipping and returns. The
   results suggest that the free shipping effect occurs through consumers'
   perceptions that free shipping serves as a risk premium compensating
   them for potential returns and through positive affect generated by the
   promotion. A simulation shows that for the focal firm, free shipping
   promotions increase net sales volume, but higher product returns and
   lost shipping revenue render these promotions unprofitable.

AB Consumers can buy concert tickets from primary platforms (e.g.,
   Ticketmaster) or from consumer-to-consumer resale platforms (e.g.,
   StubHub). Recently, Ticketmaster has entered and been trying to control
   the resale market by prohibiting consumers from reselling on competing
   resale platforms. Several states in the United States have passed or are
   discussing laws requiring tickets to be transferrable on any resale
   sites, worrying that platform integration-Ticketmaster controlling both
   the primary and the resale platforms-will increase ticket service fees
   and harm musicians and consumers. This article establishes a
   game-theoretic framework and shows that the opposite can happen:
   platform integration can lower the service fees in both markets,
   alleviating double marginalization in the primary market and benefiting
   the musician and consumers. Moreover, with platform integration, the
   presence of a small number of scalpers can counterintuitively reduce the
   ticket price and benefit the musicians and consumers. In addition,
   platform competition in the resale market may harm consumers. This
   article further shows that these insights apply in other markets (e.g.
   used goods, peer-to-peer product-sharing markets) and provides
   suggestive empirical support for the theoretical results.

   realized an increase in the rebranded PL tier's intrinsic brand
   strength, along with a reduced price elasticity. However, and in

AB Manufacturers frequently face the challenge of motivating distributor
   salespeople to focus efforts on their products rather than competitors'
   products. The present research explores two mechanisms that
   manufacturers use to address this challenge: training and incentives
   (spiffs). The authors find that the impact of these mechanisms on
   distributor salespeople's efforts (toward a manufacturer's products)
   largely depends on the extent to which manufacturers also provide
   training and incentives to distributor sales managers. More
   specifically, providing greater incentives to distributor sales managers
   undermines the relationship between their salespeople's training and
   effort but enhances the relationship between their salespeople's
   incentives and effort. Furthermore, greater sales manager training
   enhances the impact of salespeople's incentives on effort; however,
   greater salesperson training undermines the relationship between
   salesperson incentives and effort. Thus, this research shows that the
   combination of mechanisms (training and incentives) and the levels at
   which manufacturers provide them (distributor salespeople and sales
   managers) can have different implications for distributor salespeople's
   efforts.

AB To boost sales, marketers often conduct promotions that offer gifts
   conditional on the purchase of a focal product. Such promotions can
   present gifts in different formats: customers could be informed that
   they will receive a gift directly or that they will receive a voucher
   entitling them to a gift. Normatively speaking, the two formats are
   equivalent, as a voucher's value is identical to that of the gift it
   represents. Yet this article suggests that promotion format (voucher vs.
   direct gift) influences consumers' intention to purchase the focal
   product. Five lab experiments and one field experiment reveal that,
   compared with presenting a gift directly, introducing a voucher
   attenuates the influence of gift value on purchase decisions, decreasing
   purchase intentions for promotions offering high-value gifts but
   increasing purchase intentions for promotions offering low-value gifts.
   This effect occurs because vouchers break the direct association between
   the focal product and the gift, reducing people's tendency to compare
   the gift's value with the focal product's value. The effect observed can
   be attenuated by increasing the salience of gift value.

AB Both the total amount to be donated and the way it is communicated can
   influence consumer reactions to cause-related marketing (CM) campaigns.
   While companies often choose not to explicate any donation limit, this
   study argues that donation frames (e.g., minimum or maximum total
   donation) can enhance the likelihood of consumer purchases associated
   with CM campaigns. In a series of four studies, the authors find that
   consumers often respond more favorably to minimum-frame CM campaigns
   with a relatively low donation amount (e.g., at least $100,000 will be
   donated) than those with a high donation amount (e.g., at least $10
   million will be donated) despite the superiority of the latter for the
   recipient cause. This effect is inverted for maximum donation frames,
   such that a high donation amount leads to greater consumer
   participation. This research also demonstrates that this effect is
   driven by the consumer desire to make a personal contribution to a
   cause, which is more likely to be observed when consumers endow it with
   high importance. These effects are obtained with attitudes, behavioral
   intentions, and actual expenditures.

AB Consumers' price evaluations are influenced by the left-digit bias,
   wherein consumers judge the difference between $4.00 and $2.99 to be
   larger than that between $4.01 and $3.00, even though the numeric
   differences are identical. This research examines when and why consumers
   are more likely to fall prey to the left-digit bias. The authors propose
   that the left-digit bias is stronger in stimulus-based price
   evaluations, wherein people see the focal price and the reference price
   side by side, and weaker in memory-based price evaluations, wherein
   people have to retrieve at least one price from memory. This is because
   in stimulus-based price evaluations, people tend to rely on perceptual
   representations of prices without rounding them. In memory-based price
   evaluations, they rely more on conceptual representations, which makes
   them more likely to round the prices. Results from six studies-five
   experiments and a scanner panel study-support the hypothesis that the
   left-digit bias is stronger in stimulus-based evaluations. These results
   inform managers about when to use left-digit pricing and characterize
   fundamental differences between stimulus-based and memory-based

   combination of Monte Carlo simulations and empirical case studies of

   misspecify the initial conditions are likely to lead to bias even in
   relatively long panel data sets. The magnitude of the bias in the state
   dependence parameter can be as large as a factor of 2-2.5. The authors
   propose a solution to the initial conditions problem that samples the
   initial states as auxiliary variables in a Markov chain Monte Carlo
   procedure. The approach assumes that the joint distribution of prices
   and consumer choices is in equilibrium, which is plausible for the
   mature consumer packaged goods products commonly used in empirical
   applications. In Monte Carlo simulations, the approach recovers the true

AB Retail expansion is led by multistore firms, which often mix two
   organizational forms: franchised and company-owned outlets ("franchising
   decisions"). The authors examine whether strategic considerations in
   entry and expansion play a role in organizational-form decisions (e.g.,
   franchising) in retailing. The authors utilize store count and revenues
   for franchised and company-owned outlets of nationwide convenience store
   chains in 47 geographical markets in Japan between 1984 and 2010. The
   empirical analyses show that strategic considerations in entry and
   expansion, ignored in the literature on franchising, appear to influence
   an organizational-form decision: firms rely more on company-owned
   outlets for expansion when the threat of entry from competitor firms in
   adjacent markets increases. The authors examine two interpretations: the
   convenience of quick deployment and a credible signal. Numerical
   analyses of a simple dynamic model of entry and franchising confirm that
   company-owned-outlet-based expansion arises under heightened entry
   threat. The simulation analysis highlights how franchising decisions in
   response to an elevated threat of entry may be beneficial (or harmful)
   for an incumbent firm, which yields key implications for firms,
   consumers, and policy makers.

   proposed Bayesian synthetic control methods (BSCMs) do not impose any
   restrictive constraints on the parameter space a priori. Moreover, they
   provide statistical inference in a straightforward manner as well as a
   natural mechanism to deal with the "large p, small n" and sparsity
   problems through Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures. Using simulations,
   the authors find that for a variety of data-generating processes, the
   proposed BSCMs almost always provide better predictive accuracy and
   parameter precision than extant SCMs. They demonstrate an application of
   the proposed BSCMs to a real-world context of a tax imposed on soda
   sales in Washington state in 2010. As in the simulations, the proposed
   models outperform extant models, as measured by predictive accuracy in
   the posttreatment periods. The authors find that the tax led to an
   increase of 5.7% in retail price and a decrease of 5.5%similar to 5.8%
   in sales. They also find that retailers in Washington overshifted the
   tax to consumers, leading to a pass-through rate of approximately 121%.

   and possible reasons underlying the polarity of online review
   distributions, with the majority of the reviews at the positive end of
   the rating scale, a few reviews in the midrange, and some reviews at the
   negative end of the scale. Compiling a large data set of online
   reviews-over 280 million reviews from 25 major online platforms-the
   authors find that most reviews on most platforms exhibit a high degree
   of polarity, but the platforms vary in the degree of polarity on the
   basis of how selective customers are in reviewing products on the
   platform. Using cross-platform and multimethod analyses, including
   secondary data, experiments, and survey data, the authors empirically
   confirm polarity self-selection, described as the higher tendency of
   consumers with extreme evaluations to provide a review as an important
   driver of the polarity of review distributions. In addition, they
   describe and demonstrate that polarity self-selection and the polarity
   of the review distribution reduce the informativeness of online reviews.

   prefer to locate themselves in proximity to others during consumption
   experiences, such as when they purchase reserved seating tickets to a
   performance. Applied to data from locational choice experiments that
   simulate reserved seating assortments, administered to more than 2,000
   participants, this approach reveals the importance of modeling proximity
   to others when studying locational choices. It also emphasizes the
   degree to which consumers are heterogeneous in their preferences for
   proximity to both focal elements (e.g., stage, screen, aisles) and other
   consumers. Therefore, event operators should collect data beyond
   purchase ticket logs and also include consumers who did not purchase.
   Furthermore, this study illustrates how managers can use fitted,
   individual-level parameters and an optimization model to make more
   effective seat-level availability decisions. In addition to these
   recommendations for managers of reserved seating venues, this article
   offers novel contributions to research related to advance selling,
   spatial models, and personal space.

AB This article examines how the consumer's search cost and filtering on a
   retail platform affect the platform, the third-party sellers, and the
   consumers. The authors show that, given the platform's percentage
   referral fee, a lower search cost can either increase or decrease the
   platform's profit. By contrast, if the platform optimally adjusts its
   referral fee, a lower search cost will increase the platform's profit.
   As the consumer's search cost decreases, if the platform's demand
   elasticity increases significantly, the platform should reduce its fee,
   potentially resulting in an all-win outcome for the platform, the
   sellers, and the consumers; otherwise, a lower search cost will increase
   the platform's optimal fee percentage, potentially leading to higher
   equilibrium retail prices. Furthermore, the availability of filtering on
   the platform will in expectation induce consumers to search fewer
   products but buy products with higher match values, and filtering can
   either increase or decrease equilibrium retail prices. When filtering
   reveals only a small amount of the products' match-value variations, it
   will benefit the platform, the sellers, and the consumers. This article
   shows that the effects of filtering and those of a decrease in search
   cost are qualitatively different.

AB Confronted with increasing digitalization, service firms are challenged
   to sustain customer loyalty. A promising means to do so is to leverage
   the digital presence of service employees on their website. A
   large-scale field study and several experimental studies show that the
   digital presence of service employees on the firm website increases
   current website service quality perceptions and positively shapes
   memories related to employee service quality perceptions from past
   service encounters. Both effects indirectly increase customer loyalty
   and, in turn, financial performance, and are amplified by employee
   accessibility and a service firm's customer orientation. The authors
   examine further boundary conditions for the memory process: only service
   employees evoke the beneficial spillover effect to employee service
   quality perceptions, and the spillover effect does not generalize to
   evaluations of product quality. Remarkably, an employee's digital
   presence, although factually unrelated, augments customer perceptions of
   service employees' competence and commitment and thus strengthens rather
   than erodes service employees' role in customer-firm relationships.
   Theoretical and managerial implications deepen the understanding of how
   to add a human touch to digital channels.

AB Luxury brands have started to offer consumers the opportunity to
   customize their exclusive products by making certain aesthetic
   decisions, such as the color, fabric, or cut of their products. A robust
   finding in the marketing literature is that consumers place a greater
   value on customized than on standard products because these unique
   products better fit and communicate their tastes, preferences, and
   identity. However, the majority of focal products in these studies fall
   outside the luxury segment. The authors demonstrate that consumers'
   customization preferences differ between mainstream and luxury brands.
   In the luxury segment, consumers pay a premium for the designer's
   expertise and the status that it can convey. As such, the consumers'
   desire for self-expression can potentially erode the product's signaling
   value. Through a series of four experiments, the authors demonstrate
   that luxury brands can benefit from customization but they can also take
   customization too far. Their findings suggest that brand managers should
   allow consumers to make fewer design decisions for luxury versus
   mainstream brands to preserve the signal value created by the designer.

AB The marketplace includes many attractive high-calorie indulgent food
   offerings. Despite their appeal, consumers may often be prompted to
   consider lower-calorie-package offerings instead (e.g., 100-calorie
   packs). The question thus arises: What predicts consumers' preferences
   between different kinds of lower-calorie offerings? The authors
   conceptualize two different routes to lower-calorie versions of
   indulgent foods: a lower-caloric-density version (e.g., baked potato
   chips) or a smaller-portion-size version (e.g., a smaller bag of potato
   chips). The authors examine how such versions are differentially
   preferred and why, focusing on the key role of dietary restraint. The
   authors show that as dietary restraint increases, the preference for a
   lower-calorie version created via lower caloric density (vs. a smaller
   portion size) increases. Differential weights placed on health and
   fullness goals help explain differing preferences across dietary
   restraint (as the lower-caloric-density version is perceived as
   healthier and more filling, albeit less tasty, than the
   smaller-portion-size version). This framework offers theoretical
   implications for understanding two routes to cutting calories, practical
   implications for food marketers, and methodological implications for
   studying food choices.

   reactions to consumption regulations. First, they demonstrate via a
   natural experiment that conservatives (but not liberals) increase usage
   of mobile phones in cars after a law was enacted prohibiting that
   activity (Study 1). Then, through three lab experiments the authors
   illustrate that after consumers are exposed to consumption regulations
   from the government (e.g., laws that restrict consumption, warning
   labels designed by the Food and Drug Administration), conservatives (vs.
   liberals) are more likely to (1) use phones when restricted (Study 2),
   (2) purchase unhealthy foods (Study 3), and (3) view smoking
   e-cigarettes more favorably (Study 4). No such effects are observed when
   a nongovernment source is used, or when the message from the government
   is framed as a notification (vs. warning). These findings point to the
   important roles of political ideology and the message source in
   increasing reactance to consumption regulations, thereby mitigating the
   effectiveness of public policy initiatives undertaken by the government.

AB Many problems in marketing and economics require firms to make targeted
   consumer-specific decisions, but current estimation methods are not
   designed to scale to the size of modern data sets. In this article, the
   authors propose a new algorithm to close that gap. They develop a
   distributed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for estimating
   Bayesian hierarchical models when the number of consumers is very large
   and the objects of interest are the consumer-level parameters. The
   twostage and embarrassingly parallel algorithm is asymptotically
   unbiased in the number of consumers, retains the flexibility of a
   standard MCMC algorithm, and is easy to implement. The authors show that
   the distributed MCMC algorithm is faster and more efficient than a
   single-machine algorithm by at least an order of magnitude. They
   illustrate the approach with simulations with up to 100 million
   consumers, and with data on 1,088,310 donors to a charitable
   organization. The algorithm enables an increase of between $1.6 million
   and $4.6 million in additional donations when applied to a large
   modern-size data set compared with a typical-size data set.

AB In gathering information for an intended purchase decision, consumers
   submit search phrases to online search engines. These search phrases
   directly express the consumers' needs in their own words and thus
   provide valuable information to marketing managers. Interpreting
   consumers' search phrases renders a better understanding of their
   purchase intentions, which is critical for marketing success. In this
   article, the authors develop an integrated model to connect the latent
   topics embedded in consumers' search phrases to their website visits and
   purchase decisions. Using a unique data set containing more than 8,000
   search phrases submitted by consumers, the model identifies latent
   topics underlying the searches that led consumers to the firm's website.
   Compared with a model lacking any textual information from consumers'
   search phrases, a model using textual data in a heuristic approach, and
   a model based on the latent Dirichlet allocation, the proposed model
   provides a better evaluation of a consumer's position on the path to
   purchase and achieves much better predictive accuracy, which could in
   turn substantially increase the firm's revenue. The authors also extend
   the discussion to aggregators, affiliated websites, and segments of
   consumers who are exposed to the firm's outbound ads. Marketing managers
   can use this method to extract structured information from consumers'
   search phrases to facilitate their inference of consumers' latent
   purchase states and thereby improve marketing efficiency.

AB This research introduces a framework wherein consumers take on
   "requestor" or "responder" roles in making joint consumption decisions.
   The authors document a robust preference expression asymmetry wherein
   "requestors" soliciting others' consumption preferences (e.g., "Where do
   you want to go for dinner?") desire preference expressions (e.g., "Let's
   go to this restaurant"), whereas "responders" instead do not express
   preferences (e.g., "Anywhere is fine with me"). This asymmetry
   generalizes under a broad set of situations and occurs because the
   requestor and responder roles differ in their foci. Compared to
   responders, requestors are more focused on mitigating the difficulty of
   arriving at a decision, whereas compared to requestors, responders are
   more focused on conveying likability by appearing easygoing. Responders
   thus behave suboptimally, incurring a "preference cost" (when masking
   preferences) and a "social friction cost" (requestors favor responders
   who express preferences). Requestors can elicit preference expression by
   conveying their own dislike of decision making, which increases
   responders' focus on mitigating decision difficulty. The authors
   conclude by discussing the framework's contributions to looking "under
   the hood" of joint consumption decisions.

   mediated by the trading behavior of short sellers. Using quarterly data
   from 273 firms over 2007-2017, the authors find that short interest-a
   measure of short seller activity-mediates the impact of customer
   satisfaction and dissatisfaction on abnormal stock returns. Customer
   dissatisfaction has a more pronounced effect on short selling compared
   with customer satisfaction. In addition, customer satisfaction and
   dissatisfaction are more relevant for firms with low capital intensity
   and firms that face lower competitive intensity. The results show that a
   one-unit increase in customer satisfaction is associated with a.56
   percentage point increase in abnormal returns, while a one-unit increase
   in customer dissatisfaction is associated with a 1.34 percentage point

AB Negotiations today are less likely to be characterized by information
   asymmetry-the notion that buyers are less informed than sellers-due to
   the amount of information available to buyers. A number of industries
   have reacted to this change by shifting their attention to earning
   profits in aftermarkets: products and services that augment the main
   purchase (e.g., add-ons, insurance, financing, service and maintenance).
   In these aftermarkets, firms often retain an information advantage, even
   if information asymmetries are eliminated from the main purchase. This
   has given rise to an interesting setting untapped by prior research:
   information "symmetry" in the front end (main purchase) and information
   "asymmetry" in the back end (aftermarket). The authors argue that
   symmetry in the front end provides an opportunity to build trust, as the
   knowledgeable customer can verify the information disclosed by the
   seller. In an observational study in the automotive industry, the
   authors find that customers to whom the salesperson revealed the cost of
   a car at the beginning of the negotiation spent significantly more in
   the back end than others. As corroborated in subsequent studies, this
   effect holds only when cost is disclosed at the beginning of the
   negotiation and when customers can verify the cost information.

AB This research examines the impact of defaults on product choice in
   sequential-decision settings. Whereas prior research has shown that a
   default can affect what consumers purchase by promoting choice of the
   preselected option, the influence of defaults is more nuanced when
   consumers make a series of related choices. In such a setting, consumer
   preferences may evolve across choices due to "spillover" effects from
   one choice to subsequent choices. The authors hypothesize that defaults
   systematically attenuate choice spillover effects because accepting a
   default is a more passive process than either choosing a nondefault
   option in the presence of a default or making a choice in the absence of
   a default. Three experiments and a field study provide compelling
   evidence for such default-induced changes in choice spillover effects.
   The findings show that firms' setting of high-price defaults with the
   aim of influencing consumers to choose more expensive products can
   backfire through the attenuation of spillover. In addition to advancing
   the understanding of the interplay between defaults and preference
   dynamics, insights from this research have important practical
   implications for firms applying defaults in sequential choices.

   agency conflicts between manufacturers and sales partners. Drawing on
   multiple agency theory, the authors introduce direct and indirect
   channel usage as focal design dimensions of multichannel sales systems
   and investigate each channel's performance effects using a matched
   manufacturer-sales partner data set. Whereas direct channel usage
   predominantly lowers agency conflicts in terms of information asymmetry
   and sales partner moral hazard, indirect channel usage amplifies moral
   hazard concerns. How those sales partner effects translate into
   manufacturer performance outcomes critically depends on governance
   mechanisms, confirming predictions from governance value analysis:
   formalization enhances performance outcomes for manufacturers in the
   case of indirect channel usage but diminishes performance in the case of
   direct channel usage. The authors observe converse effects for
   centralization and information exchange: centralization and information
   exchange enhance outcomes of direct channel usage but diminish outcomes
   of indirect channel usage. The focal managerial implication is that
   managers must align the design of their multichannel sales systems with
   effective governance mechanisms.

AB Consumers increasingly expect brands to "pick a side" on divisive
   sociopolitical issues, but managers are reluctant to risk alienating
   customers who oppose their position. Moreover, research on
   identity-based consumption and negativity bias suggests that corporate
   political advocacy (CPA) is more likely to repel existing customers who
   oppose the CPA than to attract new customers who support it, implying
   that the net effect will be negative even if consumers overall are
   evenly divided in their support/ opposition. In this research, the
   authors posit that despite this negativity bias in individual-level
   choice, the net effect of CPA at the market level is determined by a
   sorting process that benefits small-share brands and hurts large-share
   brands. This is because having few customers to lose and many to gain
   can offset the risk of the negativity bias in consumers' identity-driven
   responses to CPA, potentially leading to a net influx of customers for
   small-share brands. Five experiments provide support for this theorizing
   and identify authenticity as a necessary condition for small share
   brands to benefit.

AB Marketers commonly seed information about products and brands through
   individuals believed to be influential on social media, which often
   involves enlisting micro influencers, users who have accumulated
   thousands as opposed to millions of followers (i.e., other users who
   have subscribed to see that individual's posts). Given an abundance of
   micro influencers to choose from, cues that help distinguish more versus
   less effective influencers on social media are of increasing interest to
   marketers. The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the
   prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world
   data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following
   fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers,
   has a positive effect on a social media user's perceived influence.
   Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement
   with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more
   favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to
   spread it (i.e., retweets). They identify a theoretically important
   mechanism underlying the effect: following fewer others conveys greater
   autonomy, a signal of influence in the eyes of others.

AB This article introduces a near-optimal bidding algorithm for use in
   real-time display advertising auctions. These auctions constitute a
   dominant distribution channel for internet display advertising and a
   potential funding model for addressable media. The proposed efficient,
   implementable learning algorithm is proven to rapidly converge to the
   optimal strategy while achieving zero regret and constituting a
   competitive equilibrium. This is the first algorithmic solution to the
   online knapsack problem to offer such theoretical guarantees without
   assuming a priori knowledge of object values or costs. Furthermore, it
   meets advertiser requirements by accommodating any valuation metric
   while satisfying budget constraints. Across a series of 100 simulated
   and 10 real-world campaigns, the algorithm delivers 98% of the value
   achievable with perfect foresight and outperforms the best available
   alternative by 11%. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be augmented
   to simultaneously estimate impression values and learn the bidding
   policy. Across a series of simulations, we show that the total regret
   delivered under this dual objective is less than that from any competing
   algorithm required only to learn the bidding policy.

AB The authors analyze the impact of a tax on sweetened beverages using a
   unique data set of prices, quantities sold, and nutritional information
   across several thousand taxed and untaxed beverages for a large set of
   stores in Philadelphia and its surrounding area. The tax is passed
   through at an average rate of 97%, leading to a 34% price increase.
   Demand in the taxed area decreases by 46% in response to the tax.
   Cross-shopping to stores outside of Philadelphia offsets more than half
   of the reduction in sales in the city and decreases the net reduction in
   sales of taxed beverages to only 22%. There is no significant
   substitution to bottled water and modest substitution to untaxed natural
   juices. The authors show that tax avoidance through cross-shopping
   severely constrains revenue generation and nutritional improvement, thus
   making geographic coverage an important policy decision.

AB Using one field and two online lab experiments, this article shows that
   congruency between shelf layout and a consumer's internal product
   categorization increases the perceived variety of the assortment and
   reduces the perceived complexity of the shelf layout. These assortment
   perceptions, in turn, heighten purchase intention and satisfaction
   toward the chosen item. Results are robust across internal
   categorization measurements (planogram design vs. sorting tasks),
   congruency measures (distance- vs. matching-based), and products
   (biscuits vs. yogurt snacks). In the field study,
   familiarity-operationalized as either consumption frequency or
   subjective product knowledge-increased the overall effect of
   categorization congruency and strengthened its pathway through perceived
   variety (vs. the one through complexity). The authors show how their
   research can be exploited to improve shelf layouts by optimizing the
   external categorization. They demonstrate the value of a unifying
   Bayesian framework for research on behavioral decision making that uses
   the same set of posterior parameter draws for parameter inference,
   moderated mediation analysis, and optimization under uncertainty.

AB Empirical demand functions, such as those from choice-based conjoint
   analyses, are critical to many aspects of marketing. Approaches have
   been developed to ensure that research subjects provide honest and
   thoughtful responses. However, to reduce costs, researchers increasingly
   collect data online, under conditions that compromise the value of the
   information provided. Objective measures related to how the study is
   completed, such as latency (how quickly answers are given), can only be
   tied to other objective measures (such as the consistency of the
   answers), but ultimately their relationship to the subject's utility
   function is questionable. To address this problem, the authors introduce
   a mixture modeling framework that clusters subjects based on variances.
   The proposed model naturally groups subjects based on their internal
   consistency. The authors argue that a higher level of internal
   consistency (i.e., lower variance) reflects more engaged consumers who
   have sufficient experience with the product category and choice task.
   "Gremlins," in contrast, behave such that the noise in their responses
   overwhelms any signal, leading to a lack of predictive power. This
   approach provides an automated way to determine which respondents are
   relevant. The authors discuss the conceptual and modeling framework and
   illustrate the method using both simulated and commercial data.

AB Open innovation contests that display all submitted ideas to
   participants are a popular way for firms to generate ideas. In such
   contest-based ideation, the authors show that seeing numerous
   competitive ideas of others harms, rather than stimulates, creative
   performance (Study 1). Others' competitive prior ideas interfere with
   idea generation, as new ideas need to be differentiated from the
   preceding ones to be original. Exposure to an increasing number of prior
   ideas thus heightens individuals' perceived constraints of expressing
   ideas and harms creative performance (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore,
   creative performance monotonically reduces with an increasing number of
   prior ideas (Study 4). A final study demonstrates that showing only a
   limited number of ideas as well as grouping prior ideas offer actionable
   ways to reduce prior ideas' harmful influence (Study 5). These results
   illustrate viable ways to improve contest-based ideation outcomes merely
   by changing how competitive prior ideas are presented.

AB In 2019, U.S. pharmaceutical companies paid $3.6 billion to physicians
   in the form of gifts to promote their drugs. To curb inappropriate
   financial relationships between health care providers and firms, several
   state laws require firms to publicly declare the payments they make to
   physicians. In 2013, this disclosure law was rolled out to all 50
   states. The authors investigate the causal impact of this increased
   transparency on subsequent payments between firms and physicians. While
   firms and physicians were informed of the disclosure regulation at data
   collection, complete transparency did not occur until the data were
   published online. The authors estimate the heterogeneous treatment
   effects of the online data disclosure exploiting the phased rollout of
   the disclosure laws across states, facilitated by recent advances in
   machine learning methods. Using a 29-month national panel covering $100
   million in payments between 16 antidiabetic brands and 50,000
   physicians, the authors find that the monthly payments changed
   insignificantly, on average, due to disclosure. However, the average
   null effect masks some unintended consequences of disclosure, wherein
   payments may have increased for more expensive drugs and among
   physicians who prescribed more heavily. The authors further explore
   potential mechanisms that can parsimoniously describe the data pattern.

AB Public school districts not only make strategic investments in internet
   access as a means to attract and retain students but also communicate
   the value of these investments with parents as part of their marketing
   programs. While it helps attract more customers, how does school
   district internet access spending (SDIAS) affect academic performance
   and disciplinary problems among students? Using a longitudinal data set
   that combines SDIAS of 1,243 school districts with academic performance
   and disciplinary records of more than 9,000 Texas public schools between
   2000 and 2014, the authors find that a one-standard-deviation increase
   in SDIAS (an average increase of $.6 million) is associated with an
   improvement in eight academic performance indicators, with effect sizes
   ranging from 2% to 5% of a standard deviation, amounting to a $.8
   million to $1.8 million increase in cumulative income for the current
   students of a school district. Furthermore, a one-standard-deviation
   increase in SDIAS is associated with a 5% increase in Part II
   offense-related school disciplinary problems, amounting to a yearly cost
   of $25,800 to $53,440 for a school district. The positive and negative
   consequences of SDIAS are more pronounced among schools in regions with
   a higher level of household internet access.

AB Anecdotal evidence and extant research show that consumers can prefer

   that moderate such preferences are not well understood. The authors
   posit power distance belief (PDB) as a moderator such that low-PDB
   consumers prefer user-designed to designer-designed products because
   they identify more with user-driven companies. In contrast, high-PDB
   consumers prefer designer-designed to user-designed products due to
   their stronger trust in designer-driven companies. Six studies examining
   power distance belief at both the country and individual levels provide
   convergent support for the proposed moderating effect of PDB and
   underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the
   interaction between design philosophy and PDB is more likely for
   low-complexity than high-complexity products.

AB Sales force incentive design often involves significant participation by
   sales managers in designing the compensation plans of salespeople who
   report to them. Although sales managers hold valuable territory-level
   information, they may benefit from misrepresenting that information
   given their own incentives. The author uses a game theoretic model to
   show (1) how a firm can efficiently leverage a manager's true knowledge
   and (2) the conditions under which involving the manager is optimal.
   Under the proposed approach, the firm delegates sales incentive
   decisions to the manager within restrictive constraints. She can then
   request relaxed constraints by fulfilling certain requirements. The
   author shows how these constraints and requirements can be set to ensure
   the firm's best possible outcome given the manager's information. Thus,
   this "request mechanism" offers an efficient, reliable alternative to
   approaches often used in practice to incorporate managerial input, such
   as internal negotiations and behind-the-scenes lobbying. The author then
   identifies the conditions under which this mechanism outperforms the
   well-established theoretical approach of offering the salesperson a menu
   of contracts to reveal territory-level information.

AB There is a growing body of evidence that customer satisfaction is
   predictive of firms' future financial performance. However, studies of
   this relationship have been limited to competitive markets, and
   monopolistic markets have been largely ignored. This study explores the
   large and important utilities market and exploits its unique regulatory
   requirements that generate detailed and reliable operating and
   accounting data to examine the overall relationship between customer
   satisfaction and utility profit and establish the causal mechanisms
   involved. Using data from U.S. public utility firms, the authors show
   that even when customer satisfaction does not affect future revenues, it
   does positively predict future profitability by reducing utility firm
   operating costs. More specifically, they find that higher satisfaction
   reduces the costs of utility firm distribution, customer service, and
   sales and general administration expenses. These findings and additional
   post hoc evidence are consistent with the notion that customer
   satisfaction (1) generates efficiency-enhancing benefits for utility
   firms by lowering the direct and employee engagement costs of dealing
   with dissatisfied customers and (2) fosters greater trust and
   cooperation from customers. This study has important implications for
   both managers and regulators and provides important new insights for
   market-based asset theory and regulatory economic theory.
