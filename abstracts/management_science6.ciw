AB We consider the optimal production and inventory control of an
   assemble-to-order system with m components, one end-product, and n
   customer classes. A control policy specifies when to produce each
   component and, whenever an order is placed, whether or not to satisfy it
   from on-hand inventory. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision
   process and characterize the structure of an optimal policy. We show
   that a base-stock production policy is optimal, but the base-stock level
   for each component is dynamic and depends on the inventory level of all
   other components (more specifically, it is nondecreasing). We show that
   the optimal inventory allocation for each component is a rationing
   policy with different rationing levels for different demand classes. The
   rationing levels for each component are dynamic and also nondecreasing
   in the inventory level of all other components. We compare the
   performance of the optimal policy to heuristic policies, including the
   commonly used base-stock policy with fixed base-stock levels, and find
   them to perform surprisingly well, especially for systems with lost
   sales.

AB This paper considers, two independent firms that invest in resources
   such as capacity or inventory based on imperfect market forecasts. As
   time progresses and new information becomes available, the firms update
   their forecasts and have the option to trade their resources. The trade
   contract is determined as the bargaining equilibrium or, alternatively,
   as the price equilibrium. Assuming a fairly general form of the profit
   functions, we characterize the Nash equilibrium investment levels, which
   are first-best under the price equilibrium trade contract, but not under
   the bargaining equilibrium trade contract. To gain additional insights,
   we then focus on firms that face stochastic demand functions with
   constant price elasticity and have contingent pricing power. Assuming a
   general forecast evolution process, we characterize the impact of the
   option to trade and the firms' cooperation on equilibrium investments,
   expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus. Finally, to study the
   main driving forces of trading, we employ a well-established and
   empirically tested forecast updating model in which the forecast
   evolution process follows a two-dimensional geometric Brownian motion.
   Under this model, we prove that the equilibrium investments, expected
   prices, profits, and consumer surplus are nondecreasing in the quality
   and timing of forecast revisions, in market variability, and in foreign
   exchange volatility, but are nonincreasing in market correlation.

AB We develop and study efficient Monte Carlo algorithms for pricing
   path-dependent options with the variance gamma model. The key ingredient
   is difference-of-gamma bridge sampling, based on the representation of a
   variance gamma process as the difference of two increasing gamma
   processes. For typical payoffs, we obtain a pair of estimators (named
   low and high) with expectations that (1) are monotone along any such
   bridge sampler, and (2) contain the continuous-time price. These
   estimators provide pathwise bounds on unbiased estimators that would be
   more expensive (infinitely expensive in some situations) to compute. By
   using these bounds with extrapolation techniques, we obtain significant
   efficiency improvements by work reduction. We then combine the gamma
   bridge sampling with randomized quasi-Monte Carlo to reduce the variance
   and thus further improve the efficiency. We illustrate the large
   efficiency improvements on numerical examples for Asian, lookback, and
   barrier options.

AB This study formalizes the departure between risk-neutral and physical
   index return volatilities, termed volatility spreads. Theoretically, the
   departure between risk-neutral and physical index volatility is
   connected to the higher-order physical return moments and the parameters
   of the pricing kernel process. This theory predicts positive volatility
   spreads when investors are risk averse, and when the physical index
   distribution is negatively skewed and leptokurtic. Our empirical
   evidence is supportive of the theoretical implications of risk aversion,
   exposure to tail events, and fatter left-tails of the physical index
   distribution in markets where volatility is traded.

AB Advertising is one of the key marketing tools managers have at their
   disposal to influence their customers into purchasing a new product. The
   overall objective of new product advertising is to inform and persuade
   customers. Drawing up an advertising plan for a new product that is
   under the influence of diffusion phenomenon is not an easy task. Hence,
   research in this area is very limited. In our research, we use an
   empirically proven diffusion demand function that explicitly
   incorporates the advertising component. Our results suggest that optimal
   advertising is determined by the advertising effectiveness, discount
   rate, and the ratio of advertisement to profits. Depending upon the
   interplay among these factors, the optimal advertising takes
   decrease-increase, increase-decrease, monotonically increasing or
   monotonically decreasing shape.

AB We integrate psychological theories of individual creativity with
   organizational theories of exploration versus exploitation to examine
   the relationship between past success and creativity over time. A key
   prediction derived from this theoretical integration is that successful
   people should be more likely to generate new ideas, but these ideas will
   tend to be less divergent as they favor the exploitation of familiar
   knowledge at the expense of the exploration of new domains. This
   prediction departs from the often-held view that people who generate
   more ideas will also generate ideas that are more divergent. Analyses of
   patenting in the hard disk drive industry support our prediction and
   indicate that collaboration with other inventors and organizational
   norms for exploration attenuate the tendency for successful individuals
   to generate increasingly incremental ideas.

AB Technological developments combine previously distinct technologies that
   result in converging markets. In converging markets, firms from
   different industries compete against each other, often for the first
   time. We propose that firms introducing new products in converging
   markets will learn vicariously from other firms in the market. Further,
   we propose that this learning will vary across the dual-technology
   frontier (DTF), where the high-technology frontier (HTF) and
   low-technology frontier (LTF) map onto innovative activities driven by
   technological opportunity and user needs. We propose that at the HTF,
   local search will dominate and firms will be influenced by HTF product
   introductions of similarly sized, successful firms. At the LTF, learning
   will occur across the DTF, vary by origin industry of the firm, and be
   affected by complementarities in routines and capabilities and market
   competition among firms. We test the proposed model of vicarious
   learning using panel data on new product introductions of 67 firms in
   the U.S. digital camera market in the 1990s. Findings generally support
   our proposed model of vicarious learning in this market. They show
   heterogeneity in vicarious learning across the technology frontier and
   firm characteristics-including the origin industry of target firms. Our
   results show that vicarious learning in new product introductions in
   converging markets-which includes both mimetic and nonmimetic
   learning-is similar in some ways, but different from more traditional
   markets. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our
   findings for theories of organizational learning, new product
   development, and converging markets.

AB In this paper, we study dynamic alliance formation among agents in
   competitive markets. We look at n agents selling substitutable products
   competing in a market. In this setting, we examine models with
   deterministic and stochastic demand, and we use a two-stage approach. In
   Stage 1, agents form alliances (coalitions), and in Stage 2, coalitions
   make decisions (price and inventory) and compete against one another. To
   analyze the stability of coalition structures in Stage 1, we use two
   notions from cooperative games-the largest consistent set (LCS) and the
   equilibrium process of coalition formation (EPCF)-which allow players to
   be farsighted. Thus, in forming alliances, players consider two key
   phenomena: First, players trade off the size of the total profit of the
   system versus their allocation of this total pie, and second, they weigh
   the possibility that an immediate beneficial defection can trigger
   further counter defections that in the end may prove to be worse than
   the status quo. In particular, one such example is that of the grand
   coalition-which we show to be stable in the farsighted sense-even though
   players benefit myopically by defecting from it. We also provide
   conditions under which a situation of a few lone players competing
   against a large coalition is stable. We examine the impact of the size
   of the market (n), the degree of competition, the effect of cost
   parameters, and the variability of the demand process on the prices,
   inventory levels, and structure of the market. We discuss the possible
   strategic implications of our results to firms in a competitive market
   and for new entrants.

AB We study the optimal levels of advertising and promotion budgets in
   dynamic markets with brand equity as a mediating variable. To this end,
   we develop and estimate a state-space model based on the Kalman filter
   that captures the dynamics of brand equity as influenced by its drivers,
   such as the brand's advertising and sales promotion expenditures. By
   integrating the Kalman filter with the random coefficients logit demand
   model, our estimation allows us to capture the dynamics of brand equity
   as well as to model consumer heterogeneity using store-level data. Using
   these demand model estimates, we determine the Markov perfect
   equilibrium advertising and promotion strategies. Our empirical analysis
   is based on store-level scanner data in the orange juice category, which
   comprises two major brands-Tropicana and Minute Maid. As expected, we
   find that sales promotions have a significant positive effect on
   consumers' utility and induce consumers to switch to the promoted brand.
   However, there is also a negative effect of promotions on brand equity
   that carries over from period to period. Overall, we find that while
   sales promotions have a net positive impact both in the short term and
   in the long term, the implied total profit elasticity including the
   long-term effect is smaller than the short-term profit elasticity.
   Correspondingly, we expect myopic decision makers to allocate higher
   than optimal expenditures to sales promotions. Our results from the
   supply-side analysis reveal that the actual promotion levels for both
   brands are indeed higher than the optimal budgets for the
   forward-looking (long-term orientation) as well as the two-year planning
   horizon scenarios. Hence, it may be profitable for both brands to reduce
   their promotion levels. Further, we find that although the
   forward-looking promotional spending levels are higher for the smaller
   brand, Minute Maid, it is market leader Tropicana that spends more on
   sales promotions. Turning to optimal advertising budgets, we find that
   the equilibrium forward-looking advertising levels are higher for
   Tropicana, the brand that has higher brand equity and a higher
   responsiveness to advertising. Further, as expected, the optimal
   forward-looking advertising levels are higher than the myopic levels and
   the two-year planning horizon levels for both brands. However, the
   forward-looking advertising levels are lower than the actual advertising
   expenditures for both brands. This implies that even when we consider
   the long-term effects of advertising, the brands are overspending on
   advertising.

AB Most performance evaluation models in the operations management
   literature implicitly assume that tasks possess standardized completion
   criteria. However, in many systems, particularly service and
   professional work, judgment is frequently required to determine how much
   time to allocate to a task. In this paper, we show that introducing
   discretion in task completion adds a fourth variability buffer, quality,
   to the well-known buffers of capacity, inventory and time. To gain
   insight into the managerial implications of this difference, we model
   the work of one- and two-worker systems with discretionary task
   completion as controlled queues. After characterizing the optimal
   control policy and identifying some practical heuristics, we use this
   model to examine the differences between discretionary and
   noncliscretionary work. We show that in systems with discretionary task
   completion, (i) adding capacity may actually increase congestion, and
   (ii) task variability in service time can improve system performance.
   This implies that it may be suboptimal to expect shorter delays as a
   result of a capacity increase, and that task variability reduction may
   not be an appropriate goal in systems with discretionary task
   completion. We also find that the benefit of queue pooling is smaller in
   systems with discretionary task completion than in systems with
   nondiscretionary task completion.

AB This paper examines the subject of cost allocation in a multiple product
   inventory system, allowing for consolidation of shipments. If we order
   multiple items using an economic order quantity (EOQ) policy, and
   consolidate shipments, part of the ordering cost is shared, and part is
   specific to each. item; we want to find the consolidation choice with
   optimal total cost and divide the cost fairly among the individual
   items. Such a fair division is central to a costing system in which no
   group of items subsidizes the others; there are no free riders! We use a
   cooperative inventory game to determine when this can be done. This game
   is usually not concave, so we want to know what consolidation
   combinations determine when this cost can be fairly divided, using the
   core of the game. We prove that consolidation of all the items is
   cheaper exactly if there are fair cost allocations (core of the game is
   not empty), which happens when the portion of the ordering cost common
   to all items is not too small. We further show how sensitive the
   nonempty core result is to adjustments in the cost parameters and show
   how to determine a threshold value for the shared ordering cost, which
   assures the existence of a fair cost allocation.

AB The need to hide sensitive information before sharing databases has long
   been recognized. In the context of data mining, sensitive information
   often takes the form of itemsets that need to be suppressed before the
   data is released. This paper considers the problem of minimizing the
   number of nonsensitive itemsets lost while concealing sensitive ones. It
   is shown to be an intractably large version of an NP-hard problem.
   Consequently, a two-phased procedure that involves the solution of two
   smaller NP-hard problems is proposed as a practical and effective
   alternative. In the first phase, a procedure to solve a sanitization
   problem identifies how the support for sensitive itemsets could be
   eliminated from a specific transaction by removing the fewest number of
   items from it. This leads to a modified frequent itemset hiding problem,
   where transactions to be sanitized are selected such that the number of
   nonsensitive itemsets lost, while concealing sensitive ones, is
   minimized. Heuristic procedures are developed for these problems using
   intuition derived from their integer programming formulations. Results
   from computational experiments conducted on a publicly available retail
   data set and three large data sets generated using IBM's synthetic data
   generator indicate that these approaches are very effective, solving
   problems involving up to 10 million transactions in a short period of
   time. The results also show that the process of sanitization. has
   considerable bearing on the quality of solutions obtained.

   A shortage function is defined that looks for possible increases in

   guaranteed for the resulting optimal portfolios. We also establish a
   link to a proper indirect mean-variance-skewness utility function. For
   computational reasons, the optimal portfolios resulting from this dual
   approach are only locally optimal. This framework permits to
   differentiate between portfolio efficiency and allocative efficiency,
   and a convexity efficiency component related to the difference between
   the primal, nonconvex approach and the dual, convex approach.
   Furthermore, in principle, information can be retrieved about the

AB Firms often have to make their production decisions under conditions of
   demand uncertainty. This is especially true for product categories such
   as automobiles and technology goods where the lead time needed for
   manufacturing forces firms to make production decisions well in advance
   of the selling season. Once the firm has produced the goods, the
   available production volume affects the firm's subsequent marketing
   decisions. In this paper, we study the relationship between the firm's
   production and marketing decisions for a durable goods manufacturer. We
   develop a dynamic model of a durable product market in which the demand
   functions are developed from a micromodeling of consumer utility
   functions and an equilibrium analysis of consumer strategies. After
   taking into account the demand uncertainty as well as the potential for
   cannibalization of future sales, the manufacturer makes its production
   and sales decisions. We find that the firm's optimal inventory level is
   U-shaped in the durability of the product and that the firm suffers a
   larger loss due to uncertainty when it is leases rather than sells its
   products. Furthermore, unlike the case for nondurables, for durable
   goods we find that the effect of uncertainty persists even after the
   uncertainty has been resolved.

AB Bundling, which is the practice of selling two or more products or
   services in a package, is a pervasive marketing practice and is often
   used as a strategic competitive tool. However, there has not been enough
   consideration of competitive bundling situations in which exit of a
   competitor is not a concern. In this paper, we address this issue by
   identifying conditions under which strategic competitors may or may not
   resort to bundling when competitor exit considerations are absent. We
   study competition between a multiproduct generalist firm and two
   single-product specialist firms in two product categories, one of which
   has undifferentiated products and the other has differentiated products.
   In our model, the specialist firms can form an alliance to bundle their
   products in competing with the generalist firm. In contrast to the
   previous literature, we find that concurrent bundling by competitors, if
   it occurs in equilibrium, is profitable. We also find that when one
   competitor bundles and the other does not, the bundling firm gains a
   greater share of customers and makes a higher profit. However, when
   conditions favor counterbundling by a competitor, such counterbundling
   helps the competitor retain its customers. Finally, we note that under
   other market conditions, concurrent bundling by competitors escalates
   price competition to the extent that retaining customers through
   bundling is not profitable. In such a case, we show that strategic
   competitors are better off having asymmetric product lines with one
   competitor bundling and the other selling unbundled.

AB Modularity in product design and flexible supply chains is increasingly
   common in buyer-supplier relationships. Although the benefits of supply
   chain flexibility and component modularity for end-product manufacturers
   are accepted, little is known about their impact on suppliers. We
   advance the literature on modularity by exploring how three aspects of a
   supplier's relationships with its customers affect the supplier's
   survival: duration of buyer-supplier relationships, autonomy from
   customers, and links to prominent buyers. We compared the effects of
   these aspects of buyer-supplier relationships for low- and
   high-modularity components. Using data on U.S. carburetor and clutch
   manufacturers from 1918 to 1942, we found that suppliers of
   high-modularity components benefited more from autonomy provided by
   potential customers, whereas suppliers of low-modularity components
   benefited more from ties to higher status customers. Both benefited from
   autonomy generated by existing customers. Thus, relationships that
   require trust and extensive sets of interfirm routines, as do those for
   low-modularity components, led to both greater relationship benefits and
   greater constraints.

AB This paper studies the impact of competition on a firm's choice of
   technology (product-flexible or product-dedicated) and capacity
   investment decisions. Specifically, we model two firms competing with
   each other in two markets characterized by price-dependent and uncertain
   demand. The firms make three decisions in the following sequence: choice
   of technology (technology game), capacity investment (capacity game),
   and production quantities (production game). The technology and capacity
   games occur while the demand curve is still uncertain, and the
   production game is postponed until after the demand curve is revealed.
   We develop best-response functions for each firm in the technology game
   and compare how a monopolist and a cluopolist respond to a given
   flexibility premium. We show that the firms may respond to competition
   by adopting a technology which is the same as or different from what the
   competitor adopts. We conclude that contrary to popular belief,
   flexibility is not always the best response to competition-flexible and
   dedicated technologies may coexist in equilibrium. We demonstrate that
   as the difference between the two market sizes increases a cluopolist is
   willing to pay less for flexible technology, whereas the decision of a
   monopolist is not affected. Further, we find that a firm that invests in
   flexibility benefits from a low correlation between demands for two
   products, but the extent of this benefit differs depending on the
   competitor's technology choice. Our results indicate that higher demand
   substitution may or may not promote the adoption of flexibility under
   competition, whereas it always facilitates the adoption of flexibility
   without competition. Finally, we show that contrary to intuition, as the
   competitor's cost of capacity increases, the premium a flexible firm is
   willing to pay for flexibility decreases.

AB The declining cost of information technology (IT) over time provides the
   later entrant in information-intensive industries a cost advantage. On
   the other hand, the earlier entrant has the potential to build and
   retain its market share if consumers incur a cost in switching to the
   later entrant. We investigate the impact of a decline in the IT cost and
   the switching cost on IT investment strategies of firms. We find that a
   declining IT cost always hurts the early entrant's profit. The early
   entrant may assume an aggressive investment strategy or a defensive
   investment strategy in response to a decline in the IT cost, depending
   on whether the switching cost relative to the extent of decline in the
   IT cost is high or low, respectively. A decline in IT cost also hurts
   the later entrant's profit if the switching cost is high. A surprising
   result is that when the decline in the IT cost is higher than a critical
   value, a higher switching cost increases consumer surplus. When firms
   control the switching cost, the early entrant increases its investment
   in quality and switching cost and maintains its quality and its
   market-share leadership irrespective of the extent of decline in the IT
   cost.

AB We develop a model of consumer learning and choice behavior in response
   to uncertain service in the marketplace. Learning could be asymmetric,
   that is, consumers may associate different weights with positive and
   negative experiences. Under this consumer model, we characterize the
   steady-state distribution of demand for retailers given that each
   retailer holds a constant in-stock service level. We then consider a
   noncooperative game in steady state between two retailers competing on
   the basis of their service levels. The demand distributions of retailers
   in this game are modeled using a multiplicative aggregate market-share
   model in which the mean demands are obtained from the steady-state
   results for individual purchases, but the model is simplified in other
   respects for tractability. Our model yields a unique pure strategy Nash
   equilibrium. We show that asymmetry in consumer learning has a
   significant impact on the optimal service levels, market shares, and
   profits of the retailers. When retailers have different costs, it also
   determines the extent of competitive advantage enjoyed by the lower-cost
   retailer.

AB We consider a single buyer who wishes to outsource a fixed demand for a
   manufactured good or service at a fixed price to a set of potential
   suppliers. We examine the value of competition as a mechanism for the
   buyer to elicit service quality from the suppliers. We compare two
   approaches the buyer could use to orchestrate this competition: (1) a
   supplier-allocation (SA) approach, which allocates a proportion of
   demand to each supplier with the proportion allocated to a supplier
   increasing in the quality of service the supplier promises to offer, and
   (2) a supplier-selection (SS) approach, which allocates all demand to
   one supplier with the probability that a particulhr supplier is selected
   increasing in the quality of service to which the supplier commits. In
   both cases, suppliers incur a cost whenever they receive a positive
   portion of demand, with this cost increasing in the quality of service
   they offer and the demand they receive. The analysis reveals that (a) a
   buyer could indeed orchestrate a competition among potential suppliers
   to promote service quality, (b) under identical allocation functions,
   the existence of a demand-independent service cost gives a distinct
   advantage to SS-type competitions, in terms of higher service quality
   for the buyer and higher expected profit for the supplier, (c) the
   relative advantage of SS versus SA depends on the magnitude of
   demand-independent versus demand-dependent service costs, (d) in the
   presence of a demand-independent service cost, a buyer should limit the
   number of competing suppliers under SA competition but impose no such
   limits under SS competition, and (e) a buyer can induce suppliers to
   provide higher service levels by selecting an appropriate allocation
   function. We illustrate the impact of these results through three
   example applications.

AB This research examines the evolution of cooperative interorganizational
   relationships and provides an empirical test of four propositions from
   the DSO (Dwyer et al. 1987) hfe-cycle theory, and one proposition from
   the RV (Ring and Van cle Ven 1994) theory of relationship development.
   Using primary data from over 1,500 resellers in a channel of
   distribution, we find that the mature phase is not the pinnacle of the
   relationship lifecycle; relationship properties (e.g., relationship
   harmony, overall dependence, and the reseller's trust in the
   manufacturer) in this stage are no different than in the build-up phase.
   However, relationship properties that support relationship expansion
   (e.g., goal congruence and information exchange norms) reach their
   zenith in the build-up phase and afterwards fade into the background.
   All of the various relationship properties hit their nadir in the
   decline phase. We also examine the development of relationships over a
   five-year period and consider whether movement across the stages in
   accordance with DSO's theory has the same association to overall
   performance evaluations as movement through regressive patterns. We find
   that a negative history extracts a price: Movement through regressive
   patterns is negatively related to performance, and these relationships
   do not enjoy a fresh start. Instead, these movements can last for an
   extended period of time and are negatively related to performance
   outcomes during the decline phase. Thus, the development path taken
   appears to be related to the results achieved. Finally, we also find
   evidence of the critical role that individual sales representatives play
   in creating successful interorganizational relationships.

AB Companies such as Zara and World Co. have recently implemented novel
   product development processes and supply chain architectures enabling
   them to make more product design and assortment decisions during the
   selling season, when actual demand information becomes available. How
   should such retail firms modify their product assortment over time in
   order to maximize overall profits for a given selling season? Focusing
   on a stylized version of this problem, we study a finite horizon
   multiarmed bandit model with several plays per stage and Bayesian
   learning. Our analysis involves the Lagrangian relaxation of weakly
   coupled dynamic programs (I)Ps), results contributing to the emerging
   theory of DP cluality and various approximations. It yields a
   closed-form dynamic index policy capturing the key exploration versus
   exploitation trade-off and associated suboptimality bounds. In numerical
   experiments its performance proves comparable to that of other
   closed-form heuristics described in the literature, but this policy is
   particularly easy to implement and interpret. This last feature enables
   extensions to more realistic versions of the motivating dynamic
   assortment problem that include implementation delays, switching costs,
   and demand substitution effects.

AB In this paper, we study the impact of coordinated replenishment and
   shipment in inventory/distribution systems. We analyze a system with
   multiple retailers and one outside supplier. Random demand occurs at
   each retailer, and the supplier replenishes all the retailers. In
   traditional inventory models, each retailer orders directly from the
   supplier whenever the need arises. We present a new, centralized
   ordering policy that orders for all retailers simultaneously. The new
   policy is equivalent to the introduction of a warehouse with no
   inventory that is in charge of the ordering, allocation, and
   distribution of inventory to the retailers. Under such a policy, orders
   for some retailers may be postponed or expedited so that they can be
   batched with other retailers' orders, which results in savings in
   ordering and shipping costs. In addition to the policy we propose for
   supplying inventory to the retailers, we also consider three other
   policies that are based on these well-known policies in the literature:
   (a) can-order policy, (b) echelon inventory policy, and (c)
   fixed-replenishment interval policy Furthermore, we create a framework
   for simultaneously making inventory and transportation decisions by
   incorporating the transportation costs (or limited truck capacities). We
   numerically compare the performance of our proposed policy with these
   policies to identify the settings in which each policy would perform
   well.

   the U.S. Treasury market the volatility of interest-rate changes is
   underestimated by the standard approach that uses the thin-tailed normal
   distribution. The empirical results indicate that (1) the volatility of
   maximal and minimal changes in interest rates declines as
   time-to-maturity rises, yielding a downward-sloping volatility curve for
   the extremes; (2) the minimal changes are more volatile than the maximal
   changes for all data sets and for all asymptotic distributions used; (3)
   the minimal changes in Treasury yields have fatter tails than the
   maximal changes; and (4) for both the maxima and minima, the extreme
   changes in short-term rates have thicker tails than the extreme changes
   in long-term rates. This paper extends the standard option-pricing
   models with lognormal forward rates to accomrnodate significant kurtosis
   observed in the interest-rate data. This paper introduces a closed-form
   option-pricing model based on the generalized extreme value distribution
   that successfully removes the well-known pricing bias of the lognormal

AB Empirical evidence suggests that decision makers often weight successive
   additional units of a valued attribute or monetary endowment unequally,
   so that their utility functions are intrinsically nonlinear or
   irregularly shaped. Although the analyst may impose various functional
   specifications exogenously, this approach is ad hoc, tedious, and
   reliant on various metrics to decide which specification is "best." In
   this paper, we develop a method that yields individual-level, flexibly
   shaped utility functions for use in choice models. This flexibility at
   the individual level is accomplished through splines of the truncated
   power basis type in a general additive regression framework for latent
   utility Because the number and location of spline knots are unknown, we
   use the birth-death process of Denison et al. (1998) and Green's (1995)
   reversible jump method. We further show how exogenous constraints
   suggested by theory, such as monotonicity of price response, can be
   accommodated. Our formulation is particularly suited to estimating
   reaction to pricing, where individual-level monotonicity is justified
   theoretically and empirically, but linearity is typically not. The
   method is illustrated in a conjoint application in which all covariates
   are splined simultaneously and in three panel data sets, each of which
   has a single price spline. Empirical results indicate that piecewise
   linear splines with a modest number of knots fit these data well,
   substantially better than heterogeneous linear and log-linear a priori
   specifications. In terms of price response specifically, we find that
   although aggregate market-level curves can be nearly linear or
   loglinear, individuals often deviate widely from either. Using splines,
   hold-out prediction improvement over the standard heterogeneous probit
   model ranges from 6% to 14% in the scanner applications and exceeds 20%
   in the conjoint study. Moreover, "optimal" profiles in conjoint and
   aggregate price response curves in the scanner applications can differ
   markedly under the standard and the spline-based models.

AB Interorganizational alliances are widely recognized as critical to
   product innovation, particularly in high-technology markets. Many new
   product development (NPD) alliances tend to be asymmetric, that is, they
   are formed between a larger firm and a smaller firm. As is the case with
   alliances in general, asymmetric alliances also typically result in
   changes in the shareholder values of the partner firms. Are the changes
   in shareholder values of the partner firms significant? Are asymmetric
   NPD alliances win-win or win-lose partnerships? Are the gains or losses
   symmetric for the larger and smaller partner firms? What factors drive
   the changes in shareholder values of the partner firms? These important
   questions remain largely unexplored as evidenced by the dearth of
   empirical research on the effect of asymmetric NPD alliances on
   shareholder value and on the apportionment of this value between the
   partner firms. We develop and empirically test a model of short-term
   changes in shareholder values of larger and smaller firms involved in
   NPD alliances, using the event study methodology on data covering 167
   asymmetric alliances in the information technology and communication
   industries. In this model, we examine alliance, firm, and partner
   characteristics as potential determinants of the changes in shareholder
   values of the partner firms due to an NPD alliance announcement. Our
   model accounts for selection correction, potential cross-correlation
   across the residuals from the models of firm value changes for the
   larger and smaller firms, and unobserved heterogeneity. The results
   suggest that both the partners experience significant short-term
   financial gains, but there are considerable asymmetries between the
   larger and smaller firms with regard to the effects of alliance,
   partner, and firm characteristics on the gains of the partner firms. The
   results relating to alliance characteristics suggest that while a broad
   scope alliance enhances the financial gains for the larger firm, a scale
   R&D alliance (relative to a link alliance) contributes positively to the
   financial gains for the smaller firm. With regard to partner
   characteristics, while partner alliance experience positively influences
   the financial gains for the larger firm, it has no significant effect on
   the financial returns for the smaller firm. Further, partner
   innovativeness is positively associated with the financial gains for the
   larger firm, but partner reputation is unrelated to the financial gains
   of the smaller firm. Regarding firm characteristics, the magnitude of
   the financial gains accruing from a firm's own alliance experience is
   considerably higher for the smaller firm than it is for the larger firm.
   We outline the implications of the research findings for future research
   and management practice.

AB W e examine whether cooperative planning and uncertainty affect the
   magnitude of rework in concurrent engineering projects with upstream and
   downstream operations, and explore the impact of such rework on project
   delays. Using survey data from a sample of 120 business process (BP)
   redesign and related information technology (IT) development projects in
   healthcare and telecommunications, our results indicate that upstream
   (BP) rework and downstream (IT) rework is mediated and mitigated by
   cooperative planning through upstream/downstream strategy coupling and
   cross-functional involvement. In addition, uncertainty related to a lack
   of firm or industry experience with such projects increases the
   magnitude of upstream rework but not downstream rework or the amount of
   cooperative planning. After accounting for project scope, implementation
   horizon and whether delays are anticipated, we find that project delay
   is primarily influenced by the magnitude of downstream rework and
   downstream delay: the magnitude of both upstream and downstream rework
   significantly increases downstream delay, which significantly increases
   project delay. However, the magnitude of upstream rework does not
   directly affect project delay. These results suggest that project delay
   is under managerial control as cooperative planning is a managerial
   function that reduces downstream rework, while uncertainty from a lack
   of experience with the design affecting upstream rework is not directly
   under managerial control.

   customers pay fixed, prenegotiated rental fees and expect a high quality
   of service. Walk-in customers have no contractual relations with the

   classes, the rental firm has to decide when to offer service to contract
   customers and what fees to charge walk-in customers for service.
   We formulate this rental management problem as a problem in stochastic
   control and characterize optimal policies for managing contract and

   which these policies perform optimally. Complementary numerical tests

AB Any buyer that depends on suppliers for the delivery of a service or the
   production of a make-to-order component should pay close attention to
   the suppliers' service or delivery lead times. This paper studies a
   queueing model in which two strategic servers choose their
   capacities/processing rates and faster service is costly. The buyer
   allocates demand to the servers based on their performance; the faster a
   server works, the more demand the server is allocated. The buyer's
   objective is to minimize the average lead time received from the
   servers. There are two important attributes to consider in the design of
   an allocation policy: the degree to which the allocation policy
   effectively utilizes the servers' capacities and the strength of the
   incentives the allocation policy provides for the servers to work
   quickly. Previous research suggests that there exists a trade-off
   between efficiency and incentives, i.e., in the choice between two
   allocation policies a buyer may prefer the less efficient one because it
   provides stronger incentives. We find considerable variation in the
   performance of allocation policies: Some intuitively reasonable policies
   generate essentially no competition among servers to work quickly,
   whereas others generate too much competition, thereby causing some
   servers to refuse to work with the buyer. Nevertheless, the trade-off
   between efficiency and incentives need not exist: It is possible to
   design an allocation policy that is efficient and also induces the
   servers to work quickly We conclude that performance-based allocation
   can be an effective procurement strategy for a buyer as long as the
   buyer explicitly accounts for the servers' strategic behavior.

AB In this paper, we consider a buyer who designs a product and owns the
   brand, yet outsources the production to a supplier. Both the buyer and
   the supplier incur quality-related costs, e.g., costs of customer
   goodwill and future market share loss by the buyer and warranty-related
   costs shared by both the buyer and the supplier whenever a nonconforming
   item is sold to a customer. Therefore, both parties have an incentive to
   invest in quality-improvement efforts. This paper explores the roles of
   different parties in a supply chain in quality improvement. We show that
   the buyer's involvement can have a significant impact on the profits of
   both parties and of the supply chain as a whole, and he cannot cede the
   responsibility of quality improvement to the supplier in many cases. We
   also investigate how quality-improvement decisions interact with
   operational decisions such as the buyer's order quantity and the
   supplier's production lot size.

   that the two mechanisms have different effects on the learning behaviors

   directly influences learning behaviors, while the psychological
   mechanism directly affects knowledge creation. The effects of both
   mechanisms on knowledge creation are complementary, yet independent.
   Findings suggest that the value of adhering to a method may lie in
   modifying the learning behaviors that subsequently create knowledge.
   When a firm adopts a quality program such as Six Sigma, the method and

   using a network diffusion framework. We start by investigating the
   presence and nature of contagion effects by defining alternative
   cross-country networks and testing their relative strength. Second, we
   study how the rate of diffusion differs between the two standards and
   between early- and later-adopting countries. Third, we identify which
   countries had more influence on diffusion than others. Empirically, we
   build a diffusion model which includes several possible cross-country
   contagion effects and then use Bayesian methods for estimation and model
   selection. Using country by year data for 56 countries and nine years,
   we find that accounting for cross-country influences improves both the
   fit and the prediction accuracy of our models. However, the specific
   cross-country contagion mechanism is different across the two standards.
   Diffusion of ISO 9000 is driven primarily by geography and bilateral
   trade relations, whereas that of ISO 14000 is driven primarily by
   geography and cultural similarity. We also find that the diffusion rate
   of ISO standards is higher for later-adopting countries and for the
   later ISO 14000 standard. We discuss several implications of our
   findings for the global diffusion of management standards.

   that prospect theory and some other generalizations of expected utility
   can make to the resolution of these inconsistencies. We used five
   methods to measure utilities under risk and found clear violations of
   expected utility. Of the theories studied, prospect theory was the most
   consistent with our data. The main improvement of prospect theory over
   expected utility was in comparisons between a riskless and a risky
   prospect (riskless-risk methods). We observed no improvement over
   expected utility in comparisons between two risky prospects (risk-risk
   methods). An explanation for the latter observation may be that there
   was less distortion in probability weighting in the interval [0.10,
   0.20] than has commonly been observed.

AB Value at risk (VaR) is a central concept in risk management. As stressed
   by Artzner et al. (1999, Coherent measures of risk, Math. Finance 9(3)
   203-228), VaR may not possess the subadditivity property required to be
   a coherent measure of risk. The key idea of this paper is that, when
   tail thickness is responsible for violation of subadditivity, eliciting
   proper conditioning information may restore VaR rationale for
   decentralized risk management. The argument is threefold. First, since
   individual traders are hired because they possess a richer information
   on their specific market segment than senior management, they just have
   to follow consistently the prudential targets set by senior management
   to ensure that decentralized VaR control will work in a coherent way.
   The intuition is that if one could build a fictitious conditioning
   information set merging all individual pieces of information, it would
   be rich enough to restore VaR subadditivity. Second, in this
   decentralization context, we show that if senior management has access
   ex post to the portfolio shares of the individual traders, it amounts to
   recovering some of their private information. These shares can be used
   to improve backtesting to check that the prudential targets have been
   enforced by the traders. Finally, we stress that tail thickness required
   to violate subadditivity even for small probabilities, remains an
   extreme situation because it corresponds to such poor conditioning
   information that expected loss appears to be infinite. We then conclude
   that lack of coherence of decentralized VaR management, that is VaR
   nonsubadditivity at the richest level of information, should be an
   exception rather than a rule.

AB Investment in information technology (IT) is an important driver of
   economic growth and productivity in the United States and other
   developed countries, but as yet it is not shown to be a significant
   driver in developing countries. Previous research suggests that IT
   investment and complementary assets are insufficient for developing
   countries to realize economic benefits. This research note examines the
   factors that influence IT investment in developed and developing
   countries to determine how greater investment might be stimulated to
   achieve productivity gains. We use the flexible accelerator model of
   investment and find that it is a good predictor of country-level IT
   investment. We also extend the model to include country-level variables,
   and find a negative relationship between IT investment and interest
   rates, but positive and significant relationships between investment,
   openness to trade, and telecommunications infrastructure. When we
   include interaction effects between national income levels and country
   variables, we find that the impacts of interest rates, size of the
   financial sector, teledensity, and intellectual property rights are
   strongest in shaping IT investment for developed countries. In contrast,
   we find that the impact of openness to trade is greater for developing
   countries, as is the size of government and education levels.

AB Horizontal scope-the set of products and services offered-is an
   important dimension of firm strategy and a potentially significant
   source of competitive advantage. On one hand, the ability to build close
   buyer-supplier relationships over multiple transactions can give an
   advantage to broad firms that offer buyers "one-stop shopping." On the
   other hand, the existence of organizational tradeoffs can give an
   advantage to firms that specialize in a narrower range of products or
   services. We develop a biform game that incorporates this tension and
   show how the use of three generic scope strategies-specialist,
   generalist, and hybrid-depends on organizational tradeoffs,
   client-specific scope economies, barriers to entry heterogeneity in
   buyer task requirements, and the bargaining power of suppliers relative
   to buyers. We then use the model to study a variety of issues in supply
   chain management, including the gains to coordinating suppliers, the
   optimal level of buyer power, and the desirability of subsidizing
   suppliers.
   One of our objectives is to show how biform games, which introduce
   unstructured negotiations into game theory analysis, can be used to
   develop applied theory relevant to strategy. Generalizing from our
   stylized model, we identify a class of biform games involving buyers and
   suppliers that is useful for strategy analysis. Games in this class have
   the attractive property of each supplier's share of industry total
   surplus being the product of its added value and its relative bargaining
   power.

   Using a biform game, we examine whether such a position can confer a
   competitive advantage, as well as whether any such advantage could
   persist if actors formed relations strategically. Our analysis reveals
   that, if one considers exogenous the relations between actors, brokers
   can enjoy an advantage but only if (1) they do not face substitutes
   either for the connections they offer or the value they can create, (2)
   they intermediate more than two parties, and (3) interdependence does
   not lock them into a particular pattern of exchange. If, on the other
   hand, one allows actors to form relations on the basis of their
   expectations of the future value of those relations, then profitable
   positions of intermediation only arise under strict assumptions of
   unilateral action. We discuss the implications of our analysis for firm

AB A systematic understanding of industry dynamics is critical to strategy
   research because individual firm performance dynamics both reflect and
   affect change at the industry level. Descriptive research on industry
   dynamics has identified a dominant pattern where prices fall, output
   rises, and the number of firms rises and then falls over time. Several
   models have been advanced to explain these patterns, with a particular
   focus on explaining why a shakeout in the number of firms occurs. In the
   most prominent models, shakeout is generated by rising realized
   heterogeneity among firms that either is assumed to be unrecognized but
   determined ex ante or is generated by stochastic innovation outcomes
   coupled with convex adjustment costs and scale advantages in innovation
   and learning. In this paper, we develop an alternative model where
   heterogeneity. develops among firms over time (leading to a shakeout)
   because firms must make choices about highly interdependent productive
   activities where the ideal combinations cannot be easily deduced or
   imitated. By combining two established models (a Cournot model of
   competition with an NK model of interdependency in production
   activities), we are able to advance an alternative explanation for the
   observed patterns of industry behavior, including shakeout. We show that
   variation in the potential for interdependency in activities among
   industries is able to explain varying levels of shakeout as well as
   differing patterns of entry and exit among industries. Notably, the
   model generates several empirical predictions not apparent in past
   research and several that directly conflict with the results of
   prominent alternative models of industry dynamics. Specifically, we show
   that when the potential for interdependency within an industry is lows
   entry slows down and incumbent survival is all but assured, whereas in
   industries where the potential for interdependencies is high, shakeouts
   are severe and the rates of entry and exit remain high over longer time
   periods, with decreasing survival rates for incumbents.

   explained using a theory in which disagreements lead employees of
   incumbent firms to found spinoffs in the same industry. Predictions of
   the theory concerning entry and firm survival are tested using data on
   the origin, location, and years of production of every entrant into the
   industry from 1895 to 1966. The geographic concentration of the industry
   is attributed to four early successful entrants and the many successful
   spinoffs they spawned in the Detroit area and not to conventional
   agglomeration economies benefiting co-located firms, as featured in
   modern theories of agglomeration. Implications of the findings regarding

AB This paper integrates and extends the literatures on industry evolution
   and dominant firms to develop a dynamic theory of dominant and fringe
   competitive interaction in a segmented industry. It argues that a
   dominant firm, seeing contraction of growth in its current segment(s),
   enters new segments in which it can exploit its technological strengths,
   but that are sufficiently distant to avoid cannibalization. The dominant
   firm acts as a low-cost Stackelberg leader, driving down prices and
   triggering a sales takeoff in the new segment. We identify a "churn"
   effect associated with dominant firm entry: fringe firms that precede
   the dominant firm into the segment tend to exit the segment, while new
   fringe firms enter, causing a net increase in the number of firms in the
   segment. As the segment matures and sales decline in the segment, the
   process repeats itself. We examine the predictions of the theory with a
   study of price, quantity, entry, and exit across 24 product classes in
   the desktop laser printer industry from 1984 to 1996. Using descriptive
   statistics, hazard rate models, and panel data methods, we find
   empirical support for the theoretical predictions.

AB We develop a formal model of the timing of resource development by
   competing firms. Our aim is to deepen and extend resource-level
   theorizing about sustainable competitive advantage. Our analysis
   formalizes the notion of barriers to imitation, particularly those based
   on time compression diseconomies where the faster a firm develops a
   resource, the greater the cost. Time compression diseconomies are
   derived from a micromodel of resource development with diminishing
   returns to effort. We use a continuous time model of the flows of
   development costs and market revenues, which allows us to integrate
   strategic and financial analyses of firm investment problems.
   We examine two dimensions of sustainability: whether the resources
   underlying a firm's competitive advantage are economically imitable and,
   if so, how long imitation takes. Surprisingly, we show that sustainable
   competitive advantage does not necessarily lead to superior performance.
   We find that imitators sometimes benefit from reductions in their
   absorptive capacity and that innovators should license either all or
   none of their knowledge. Despite recent criticisms, we reaffirm the
   usefulness of a resource level of analysis for strategy research,
   especially when the focus is on resources developed through internal
   projects with identifiable stopping times.

AB The theoretical literature on managing R&D pipelines is largely based on
   real option theory making decisions about undertaking, continuing, or
   terminating projects. The theory typically assumes that each project or
   causally related set of projects is independent. However, casual
   observation suggests that firms expend much effort on managing and
   balancing their R&D pipelines, where managing appears to be related to
   the choice of R&D selection thresholds, project risk, and whether to buy
   or sell projects to fill the pipeline. Not only do these policies appear
   to differ across firms, they also appear to vary over time for the same
   firm. Changes in management policies suggest that the choice of R&D
   selection thresholds is a time-varying strategic decision and there may
   be some type of vertical interdependency among R&D projects in different
   stages. In this paper we develop a model using dynamic-programming
   techniques that explain why firms vary in their R&D project-management
   policies. The novelty and value of our model derives from the central
   insight that some firms invest in downstream cospecialized activities
   that would incur substantial adjustment costs if R&D efforts are
   unsuccessful whereas other firms have no such investment. If transaction
   costs in technology markets are positive, which implies that accessing
   the market for projects is costly, these investments lead to
   state-contingent project-selection rules that create a dynamic and
   vertical interdependency among R&D activities and product mix. We
   describe how choices of R&D selection thresholds, preferences over
   project risk, and use of technology markets for the buying and selling
   of projects differ by the state of the firm's pipeline, the magnitude of
   transaction costs in the adjustment market, and the magnitude of
   technology costs. These results yield interesting managerial and public
   policy implications.

AB Neoclassical models of strategic behavior have yielded many insights
   into competitive behavior, despite the fact that they often rely on a
   number of assumptions-including instantaneous market clearing and
   perfect foresight-that have been called into question by a broad range
   of research. Researchers generally argue that these assumptions are
   "good enough" to predict an industry's probable equilibria, and that
   disequilibrium adjustments and bounded rationality have limited
   competitive implications. Here we focus on the case of strategy in the
   presence of increasing returns to highlight how relaxing these two
   assumptions can lead to outcomes quite different from those predicted by
   standard neoclassical models. Prior research suggests that in the
   presence of increasing returns, tight appropriability and accommodating
   rivals, in some circumstances early entrants can achieve sustained
   competitive advantage by pursuing "get big fast" (GBF) strategies:
   Rapidly expanding capacity and cutting prices to gain market share
   advantage and exploit positive feedbacks faster than their rivals. Using
   a simulation of the duopoly case we show that when the industry moves
   slowly compared to capacity adjustment delays, boundedly rational firms
   find their way to the equilibria predicted by conventional models.
   However, when market dynamics are rapid relative to capacity adjustment,
   forecasting errors lead to excess capacity-overwhelming the advantage
   conferred by increasing returns. Our results highlight the risks of
   ignoring the role of disequilibrium dynamics and bounded rationality in
   shaping competitive outcomes, and demonstrate how both can be
   incorporated into strategic analysis to form a dynamic, behavioral game
   theory amenable to rigorous analysis.

AB he value of delayed differentiation (also known as postponement) for a
   monopolist has been extensively studied in the operations literature. We
   analyze the case of (imperfectly) competitive markets with demand
   uncertainty, wherein the choice of supply chain configuration (i.e.,
   early or delayed differentiation) is endogenous to the competing firms.
   We characterize firms' choices in equilibrium and analyze the effects of
   these choices on quantities sold, profits, consumer surplus, and
   welfare. We demonstrate that purely strategic considerations not
   previously identified in the literature play a pivotal role in
   determining the value of delayed differentiation. In the face of either
   entry threats or competition, these strategic effects can significantly
   diminish the value of delayed differentiation. In fact, under plausible
   conditions, these effects dominate the traditional risk-pooling benefits
   associated with delayed differentiation, in which case early
   differentiation is the dominant strategy for firms, even under cost
   parity with delayed differentiation. We extend the main model to study
   the effects of alternate market structures, asymmetric markets, and
   inventory holdback. Our results-in particular that for a broad range of
   parameter values, early differentiation is a dominant strategy even
   under cost parity with delayed differentiation-are robust to these
   relaxations.

AB his paper develops a model of dynamic pricing with endogenous
   intertemporal demand. In the model, there is a monopolist who sells a
   finite inventory over a finite time horizon. The seller adjusts prices
   dynamically to maximize revenue. Customers arrive continually over the
   duration of the selling season. At each point in time, customers may
   purchase the product at current prices, remain in the market at a cost
   to purchase later, or exit, and they wish to maximize individual
   utility. The customer population is heterogeneous along two dimensions:
   they may have different valuations for the product and different degrees
   of patience (waiting costs). We demonstrate that heterogeneity in both
   valuation and patience is important because they jointly determine the
   structure of optimal pricing policies. In particular, when high-value
   customers are proportionately less patient, markdown pricing policies
   are effective because the high-value customers would buy early at high
   prices while the low-value customers are willing to wait (i.e., they are
   not lost). On the other hand, when the high-value customers are more
   patient than the low-value customers, prices should increase over time
   to discourage inefficient waiting. Contrary to intuition, we find that
   strategic waiting by customers may sometimes benefit the seller: when
   low-value customers wait, they compete for availability with high-value
   customers and thus increase their willingness to pay. Our results also
   shed light on how the composition of the customer population affects
   optimal revenue, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Finally, we
   consider the long-run problem of selecting the optimal initial stocking
   quantity.

AB In a variety of industries ranging from agriculture to electronics and
   oil, procurement takes place through a combination of bilateral
   fixed-price contracts and open market trading among supply chain
   participants, which allows them to improve supply chain performance by
   utilizing new demand and cost information. The strategic behavior of the
   participants in these markets interacts with the way fixed-price
   contracts are formulated and significantly affects supply chain
   efficiency. In this paper, we develop a strategic model that allows
   endogenous price formation in an industrial spot market where supply
   chain participants have private information. Utilizing the model, we
   analyze the equilibrium of a dynamic game between a single supplier and
   multiple manufacturers who first contract with the supplier at a fixed
   price and then trade on a spot market. We study how such trading affects
   supply chain performance and show that it does not eliminate fixed-price
   contracting even though the fixed price is determined under inferior
   information. We find that it reduces prices, increases the quantities
   produced, and improves supply chain profits and consumer surplus.
   However, depending on the information structure of the supply chain,
   spot trading may make either the supplier or the manufacturers worse
   off. Our results show how the informational regime affects the
   profitability of supply chain participants and the allocation of
   quantities between the procurement venues. We show that beyond a
   threshold level, the effect of increasing supply uncertainty, or
   decreasing either the demand uncertainty or the information asymmetry
   among the manufacturers, is to increase the percentage procured on the
   spot market as well as the overall quantity procured and sold, and to
   decrease prices. As the number of manufacturers increases, procurement
   shifts from fixed-price contracting to spot trading and in the limit,
   the supply chain is both fully coordinated and informationally
   efficient. We also show that in many cases, the supplier may gain
   strategic advantage by sharing some of her cost information with the
   manufacturers.

   (CF) partnerships in a supply chain that consists of a manufacturer and
   a retailer. To reflect the reality in production environments, we
   propose a scorecard that captures inventory considerations, production
   smoothing, and adherence-to-plans. We present a prescriptive convex-cost
   production planning model for the manufacturer, and a replenishment
   model for the retailer. We use our integrative reference model to study
   the potential benefits of CF partnerships. Overall, we find that the
   benefits of CF depend on the following key characteristics of the supply
   chain: the relative explanatory power of the supply chain partners, the
   supply side agility, and the internal service rate. CF is expected to
   bring high benefits to the supply chain when the manufacturer has the
   largest relative explanatory power. But quite disappointingly, in these
   cases a CF partnership does not appear to be valuable to the
   manufacturer. When the retailer is the dominant observer of market
   signals, CF typically yields a "win-win" outcome. In order to
   effectively act upon the information exchanged via CF, the supply side
   needs to be sufficiently agile. The benefits reported in this paper
   should be considered as conservative. This is because CF partnerships
   often bring better information, improved decision support technologies,
   as well as process improvement to the trading partners. Consequently,
   the supply side agility can be improved. If this indeed happens, the
   compound benefits of CF can be dramatically higher than our conservative
   estimates. Finally, we provide a qualitative discussion of the possible
   role of internal service rates in supply chains, either as planning
   parameters to improve performance, or as a mechanism for sharing the
   benefits of CF between the trading partners.

AB W e analyze a revenue management problem in which a seller facing a
   Poisson arrival stream of consumers operates an online multiunit
   auction. Consumers can get the product from an alternative list price
   channel. We consider two variants of this problem: In the first variant,
   the list price is an external channel run by another firm. In the second
   one, the seller manages both the auction and the list price channels.
   Each consumer, trying to maximize his own surplus, must decide either to
   buy at the posted price and get the item at no risk, or to join the
   auction and wait until its end, when the winners are revealed and the
   auction price is disclosed. Our approach consists of two parts. First,
   we study structural properties of the problem, and show that the
   equilibrium strategy for both versions of this game is of the threshold
   type, meaning that a consumer will join the auction only if his arrival
   time is above a function of his own valuation. This consumer's strategy
   can be computed using an iterative algorithm in a function space,
   provably convergent under some conditions. Unfortunately, this procedure
   is computationally intensive. Second, and to overcome this limitation,
   we formulate an asymptotic version of the problem, in which the demand
   rate and the initial number of units grow proportionally large. We
   obtain a simple closed-form expression for the equilibrium strategy in
   this regime, which is then used as an approximate solution to the
   original problem. Numerical computations show that this heuristic is
   very accurate. The asymptotic solution culminates in simple and precise
   recipes of how bidders should behave, as well as how the seller should
   structure the auction, and price the product in the dual-channel case.

AB Buyout options allow bidders to instantly purchase at a specified price
   an item listed for sale through an 10 online auction. A temporary buyout
   option disappears once a regular bid is submitted, whereas a permanent
   option remains available until it is exercised or the auction ends. Such
   buyout price may be static and remain constant throughout the auction,
   or dynamic and vary as the auction progresses. We formulate a
   game-theoretic model featuring time-sensitive bidders with independent
   private values and Poisson arrivals but endogenous bidding times to
   answer the following questions: How should a seller set the buyout price
   (if at all)? What are the implications of using a temporary buyout
   option relative to a permanent one? What is the potential benefit
   associated with using a dynamic buyout price? For all buyout option
   types we exhibit a Nash equilibrium in bidder strategies, argue that
   this equilibrium constitutes a plausible outcome prediction, and study
   the problem of maximizing the corresponding seller revenue. Our
   numerical experiments suggest that when any participant is time
   sensitive, the seller may significantly increase his utility by
   introducing a buyout option, but that dynamic buyout prices may not
   provide a substantial advantage over static ones. Furthermore, whereas
   permanent buyout options yield higher predicted revenue than temporary
   options, they also provide additional incentives for late bidding and
   may therefore not be always more desirable.

AB T his paper proves the renegotiation-proofness principle for a dynamic
   LEN (linear contracts, exponential utility, normal distributions) model
   and examines the impact of repeated renegotiation on incentives and
   managerial tenure when performance information is serially correlated.
   In addition to providing a general solution to a multiperiod agency
   problem with serially correlated performance measures, this paper
   characterizes optimal managerial tenure/turnover policies as a function
   of the time-series properties of performance measures. With negatively
   correlated performance measures, the principal prefers longer managerial
   tenure, and no turnover is optimal. With positively correlated
   performance measures, absent a switching cost, turnover every period is
   optimal. In the presence of a fixed switching cost, interior optimal
   turnover policies exist if the performance measures are positively
   correlated. Switching costs are necessary, but not sufficient for
   interior optimal tenure. The optimal turnover policies present an
   alternative to theories of performance-driven managerial turnover and
   are consistent with evidence that a majority of managerial turnovers are
   (age-related) normal retirements.

AB Two important defensive mechanisms available to governments combating
   terrorism are warnings and the deployment of physical resources.
   Warnings are relatively inexpensive to issue but their effectiveness
   suffers from false alarms. Physical deployments of trained security
   personnel can directly thwart attacks but are expensive and need to be
   targeted to specific locations. In this paper, we model the joint
   optimization of defenses against terrorist attacks based on warnings and
   physical deployments when there is uncertainty in the timing and
   location of attacks. We model both private warnings issued to security
   forces and public warnings broadcast to the general public. By
   structuring the trade-offs faced by decision makers in a formal way, we
   try to shed light on an important public policy problem. We show that
   the interaction between the use of warnings and physical defenses is
   complex and significant. For public warnings, we also model the possible
   response of terrorists and show how these responses influence the
   effectiveness of such warnings.

AB Movie studios often have to choose among thousands of scripts to decide
   which ones to turn into movies. Despite the huge amount of money at
   stake, this process-known as green-lighting in the movie industry is
   largely a guesswork based on experts' experience and intuitions. In this
   paper, we propose a new approach to help studios evaluate scripts that
   will then lead to more profitable green-lighting decisions. Our approach
   combines screenwriting domain knowledge, natural-language processing
   techniques, and statistical learning methods to forecast a movie's
   return on investment (ROI) based only on textual information available
   in movie scripts. We test our model in a holdout decision task to show
   that our model is able to significantly improve a studio's gross ROI.

AB This paper contributes to research on organizational learning by
   investigating specific learning activities undertaken by improvement
   project teams in hospital intensive care units and proposing an
   integrative model to explain implementation success. Organizational
   learning is important in this context because medical knowledge changes
   constantly and hospital care units must learn new practices if they are
   to provide high-quality care. To develop a model of factors affecting
   improvement project teams driving essential organizational learning in
   health care, we draw from three streams of related
   research-best-practice transfer (BPT), team learning (TL), and process
   change (PC). To test the model's hypotheses, we collected data from 23
   neonatal intensive care units seeking to implement new or improved
   practices. We first analyzed the frequency of specific learning
   activities reported by improvement project participants and discovered
   two distinct factors: learn-what (activities that identify current best
   practices) and learn-how (activities that operationalize practices in a
   given setting). Next, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses
   supported three of our four hypotheses. Specifically, a high level of
   supporting evidence for a unit's portfolio of improvement projects was
   associated with implementation success. Learn-how was positively
   associated with implementation success, but learn-what was not.
   Psychological safety was associated with learn-how, which was found to
   mediate between psychological safety and implementation success.

   when employees generate innovations, and whether these innovations are
   developed as internal ventures or outside the firm. The model shows that
   if generating innovations distracts employees from their assigned tasks,
   firms may discourage innovation. Firms may reject profitable
   opportunities that fall outside of their core activities. If employees
   own the intellectual property (IP), they may leave to do a start-up. The
   allocation of IP rights also affects the generation of innovation. The
   external entrepreneurial environment is a complement to firm-internal
   innovation. If the external environment is particularly good, firms may
   embrace employee innovation and take advantage of it through spin-offs.

AB This paper studies the assortment planning problem with multiple
   merchandise categories and basket shopping consumers (i.e., consumers
   who desire to purchase from multiple categories). We present a duopoly
   model in which retailers choose prices and variety level in each
   category and consumers make their store choice between retail stores and
   a no-purchase alternative based on their utilities from each category.
   The common practice of category management (CM) is an example of a
   decentralized regime for controlling assortment because each category
   manager is responsible for maximizing his or her assigned category's
   profit. Alternatively, a retailer can make category decisions across the
   store with a centralized regime. We show that CM never finds the optimal
   solution and provides both less variety and higher prices than optimal.
   In a numerical study, we demonstrate that profit loss due to CM can be
   significant. Finally, we propose a decentralized regime that uses basket
   profits, a new metric, rather than accounting profits. Basket profits
   are easily evaluated using point-of-sale data, and the proposed method
   produces near-optimal solutions.

   a single-period model, with fulfilled expectations equilibrium. The
   buyers experience positive network effects that are a function of the
   number of suppliers and the suppliers receive similar positive network
   effects depending on the number of buyers. We develop a general model
   with atomistic buyers and suppliers. We find that biased marketplaces
   set prices to induce greater participation (demand) from both buyers and
   suppliers compared to a neutral marketplace. This counterintuitive
   result can be understood in the context of the positive cross-network
   effects experienced by buyers and suppliers and the added benefit to the
   owner of a biased marketplace from participating in the marketplace.
   Biased marketplaces also provide greater social welfare compared to

AB Information about delays can enhance service quality in many industries.
   Delay information can take many forms, with different degrees of
   precision. Different levels of information have different effects on
   customers and therefore on the overall system. To explore these effects,
   we consider a queue with balking under three levels of delay
   information: no information, partial information (the system occupancy),
   and full information (the exact waiting time). We assume Poisson
   arrivals, independent exponential service times, and a single server.
   Customers decide whether to stay or balk based on their expected waiting
   costs, conditional on the information provided. We show how to compute
   the key performance measures in the three systems, obtaining closed-form
   solutions for special cases. We then compare the three systems. We
   identify some important cases where more accurate delay information
   improves performance. In other cases, however, information can actually
   hurt the provider or the customers.

AB Queueing systems managed by ticket technology are widely used in service
   industries as well as government offices. Upon arriving at a ticket
   queue, each customer is issued a numbered ticket. The number currently
   being served is displayed. An arriving customer balks if the difference
   between his ticket number and the displayed number exceeds his patience
   level. We propose a Markov chain model of a ticket queue and develop
   effective evaluation tools. These tools can help management quantify the
   service level and identify the performance gap between the ticket queue
   and the conventional physical queue, in which a waiting line is formed.
   We gain insights about the ways customer service is affected by
   information loss in the ticket queue. In particular, we show that ticket
   and physical queues have significantly different balking probabilities
   when customer patience is low and the system traffic is heavy. We also
   propose an improvement to the ticket queue that provides each customer
   with his expected waiting time conditioned on his observed number
   difference, which is shown to raise the performance of the ticket queue
   to that of the physical queue.

AB Many organizations use product variety as one possible strategy for
   increasing their competitiveness. They have installed flexible
   manufacturing systems because these systems offer a powerful means for
   accommodating production and assembly of a variety of products. However,
   increased product variety comes at a cost. For instance, if the resource
   requires to be set up each time it switches to operate on a new product,
   the resulting delays and costs could negate the intended benefits of
   increased product variety. Analyzing these flexible resources for
   optimal design and operation is therefore very important. To address
   such issues, we model a flexible resource, serving multiple products,
   using a queueing model-more precisely, a polling model. In this model, a
   single server attends to multiple service centers (queues) at which
   requests arrive and queue up for service, performing a setup at a polled
   queue only if that queue is nonempty. This is the state dependent (SD)
   polling model.
   Exact analysis of the SD polling model is inherently very complex. This
   paper presents a very efficient procedure to compute a hierarchy of
   successively improving bounds on the values of performance measures
   obtained from the SD polling model with the exact solution as its limit.
   This procedure can be applied to quickly estimate performance measures
   for large SD polling models previously deemed analytically intractable.

   theory (CPT) implies both properties, but the transfer of attention
   exchange (TAX) model violates both. Original prospect theory satisfies
   GLS but may or may not satisfy coalescing, depending on whether editing
   rules are assumed. A configural form of CPT proposed by Wu and Markle
   [Wu, G., A. B. Markle. 2004. An empirical test of gain-loss separability
   in prospect theory. Working Paper 06-25-04, Graduate School of Business
   University of Chicago] violates GLS, but satisfies coalescing. New tests
   were designed and conducted to test these theories against specific
   predictions of a TAX model. This model used parameters estimated from
   previous data, together with simple new assumptions to extend TAX to
   gambles with negative and mixed consequences. Contrary to all three
   forms of prospect theory, systematic violations of both coalescing and
   GLS were observed. Violations of GLS were confirmed by analyses of
   individual data patterns by means of an error model in which each choice
   can have a different rate of error. Without estimating any parameters
   from the new data, the TAX model predicted the majority choices in the
   new data fairly well, correctly predicting when modal choices would
   violate GLS, when they would satisfy it, and when indifference would be
   observed.

   not only learn which strategy to adopt by imitating the strategy of the

   should interact by selectively creating and/or severing ties with other
   players based on a myopic cost-benefit comparison. We find that scalable
   cooperation-that is, high levels of cooperation in large populations-can
   be achieved in sparse networks, assuming that individuals are able to
   sever ties unilaterally and that new ties can only be created with the
   mutual consent of both parties. Detailed examination shows that there is
   an important trade-off between local reinforcement and global expansion
   in achieving cooperation in dynamic networks. As a result, networks in
   which ties are costly and local structure is largely absent tend to
   generate higher levels of cooperation than those in which ties are made
   easily and friends of friends interact with high probability, where the
   latter result contrasts strongly with the usual intuition.

AB In this paper, we model the formation of innovation networks as they
   emerge from bilateral decisions. In contrast to much of the literature,
   here firms only consider knowledge production, and not network issues,
   when deciding on partners. Thus, we focus attention on the effects of
   the knowledge and information regime on network formation. The
   effectiveness of a bilateral collaboration is determined by cognitive,
   relational, and structural embeddedness. Innovation results from the
   recombination of knowledge held by the partners to the collaboration,
   and its success is determined in part by the extent to which firms'
   knowledge complement each other. Previous collaborations (relational
   embeddedness) increase the probability of a successful collaboration, as
   does information gained from common third parties (structural
   embeddedness). Repeated alliance formation creates a network. Two
   features are central to the innovation process: how firms pool their
   knowledge resources, and how, firms derive information about potential
   partners. When innovation is decomposable into separate subtasks,
   networks tend to be dense; when structural embeddedness is important,
   networks become cliquish. For some regions in this parameter space,
   small worlds emerge.

AB Scholars who view organizational, social, and technological systems as
   sets of interdependent decisions have increasingly used simulation
   models from the biological and physical sciences to examine system
   behavior. These models shed light on an enduring managerial question:
   How much exploration is necessary to discover a good configuration of
   decisions? The models suggest that, as interactions across decisions
   intensify and local optima proliferate, broader exploration is required.
   The models typically assume, however, that the interactions among
   decisions are distributed randomly. Contrary to this assumption, recent
   empirical studies of real organizational, social, and technological
   systems show that interactions among decisions are highly patterned.
   Patterns such as centralization, small-world connections, power-law
   distributions, hierarchy, and preferential attachment are common. We
   embed such patterns into an NK simulation model and obtain dramatic
   results: Holding fixed the total number of interactions among decisions,
   a shift in the pattern of interaction can alter the number of local
   optima by more than an order of magnitude. Thus, the long-ran value of
   broader exploration is significantly greater in the face of some
   interaction patterns than in the face of others. We develop simple,
   intuitive rules of thumb that allow a decision maker to examine two
   interaction patterns and determine which warrants greater investment in
   broad exploration. We also find that, holding fixed the interaction
   pattern, an increase in the number of interactions raises the number of
   local optima regardless of the pattern. This validates prior comparative
   static results with respect to the number of interactions, but
   highlights an important implicit assumption in earlier work-that the
   underlying interaction pattern remains constant as interactions become
   more numerous.

AB The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to conceptually understand
   membership dynamics in the open source software (OSS) community, and (2)
   to explore how different network characteristics (i.e., network size and
   connectivity) influence the stability of an OSS network. Through the
   lens of Ising theory, which is widely accepted in physics, we
   investigate basic patterns of interaction and present fresh conceptual
   insight into dynamic and reciprocal relations among OSS community
   members. We also perform computer simulations based on empirical data
   collected from two actual OSS communities. Key findings include: (1)
   membership herding is highly present when external influences (e.g., the
   availability of other OSS projects) are weak, but decreases
   significantly when external influences increase, (2) propensity for
   membership herding is most likely to be seen in a large network with
   random connectivity, and (3) for large networks, when external
   influences are weak, random connectivity will result in higher network
   strength than scale-free connectivity (as external influences increase,
   however, the reverse phenomenon is observed). In addition, scale-free
   connectivity appears to be less volatile than random connectivity in
   response to an increase in the strength of external influences. We
   conclude with several implications that may be of significance to OSS
   stakeholders in particular, and to a broader range of online communities
   in general.

AB In recent years, understanding the structure and function of complex
   networks has become the foundation for explaining many different
   real-world complex biological, technological, and informal social
   phenomena. Techniques from statistical physics have been successfully
   applied to the analysis of these networks, and have uncovered surprising
   statistical structural properties that have also been shown to have a
   major effect on their functionality dynamics, robustness, and fragility.
   This paper examines, for the first time, the statistical properties of
   strategically important organizational networks-networks of people
   engaged in distributed product development (PD)-and discusses the
   significance of these properties in providing insight into ways of
   improving the strategic and operational decision making of the
   organization. We show that the structure of information flow networks
   that are at the heart of large-scale product development efforts have
   properties that are similar to those displayed by other social,
   biological, and technological networks. In this context, we also
   identify novel properties that may be characteristic of other
   information-carrying networks. We further present a detailed model and
   analysis of PD dynamics on complex networks, and show how the underlying
   network topologies provide direct information about the characteristics
   of these dynamics. We believe that our new analysis methodology and
   empirical results are also relevant to other organizational
   information-carrying networks.

AB We apply random graph modeling methodology to analyze bipartite
   consumer-product graphs that represent sales transactions to better
   understand consumer purchase behavior in e-commerce settings. Based on
   two real-world e-commerce data sets, we found that such graphs
   demonstrate topological features that deviate significantly from
   theoretical predictions based on standard random graph models. In
   particular, we observed consistently larger-than-expected average path
   lengths and a greater-than-expected tendency to cluster. Such deviations
   suggest that the consumers' product choices are not random even with the
   consumer and product attributes hidden. Our findings provide
   justification for a large family of collaborative filtering-based
   recommendation algorithms that make product recommendations based only
   on previous sales transactions. By analyzing the simulated
   consumer-product graphs generated by models that embed two
   representative recommendation algorithms, we found that these
   recommendation algorithm-induced graphs generally provided a better
   match with the real-world consumer-product graphs than purely random
   graphs. However, consistent deviations in topological features remained.
   These findings motivated the development of a new recommendation
   algorithm based on graph partitioning, which aims to achieve high
   clustering coefficients similar to those observed in the real-world
   e-commerce data sets. We show empirically that this algorithm
   significantly outperforms representative collaborative filtering
   algorithms in situations where the observed clustering coefficients of
   the consumer-product graphs are sufficiently larger than can be
   accounted for by these standard algorithms.

AB Empirical evidence on the distributional characteristics of common stock
   returns indicates: (1) A power-law tail index close to three describes
   the behavior of the positive tail of the survivor function of returns
   (pr(r > x) similar to x(-alpha)), a reflection of fat tails; (2) general
   linear and nonlinear dependencies exist in the time series of returns;
   (3) the time-series return process is characterized by short-run
   dependence (short memory) in both returns as well as their volatility,
   the latter usually characterized in the form of autoregressive
   conditional heteroskedasticity; and (4) the time-series return process
   probably does not exhibit long memory, but the squared returns process
   does exhibit long memory. We propose a model of complex,
   self-referential learning and reasoning amongst economic agents that
   jointly produces security returns consistent with these general observed
   facts and which are supported here by empirical results presented for a
   benchmark sample of 50 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The
   market we postulate is populated by traders who reason inductively while
   compressing information into a few fuzzy notions that they can in turn
   process and analyze with fuzzy logic. We analyze the implications of
   such behavior for the returns on risky securities within the context of
   an artificial stock market model. Dynamic simulation experiments of the
   market are conducted, from which market-clearing prices emerge, allowing
   us to then compute realized returns. We test the effects of varying
   values of the parameters of the model on the character of the simulated
   returns. The results indicate that the model proposed in this paper can
   jointly account for the presence of a power-law characterization of the
   positive tail of the survivor function of returns with exponent on the
   order of three, for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, for
   long memory in volatility, and for general nonlinear dependencies in
   returns.

AB We model and estimate the effects to downstream productivity from
   information technology (IT) investments made upstream. Specifically, we
   examine how an industry's productivity is affected by the IT capital
   stock of its suppliers. These supplier-driven IT spillovers occur
   because, due to competition in the supplying industry, quality benefits
   from suppliers' IT investments can pass downstream. If the output
   deflators of supplying industries (consequently the intermediate input
   deflator of the using industries) do not capture the quality improvement
   from IT, then the output productivity of the supplying industries is
   mismeasured or misassigned. We develop and empirically test a model
   capturing these supplier-driven effects using data on 85 manufacturing
   industries at the three-digit SIC code level. We find that for a 10.5%
   increase in suppliers' IT capital, the suppliers' output increases by
   0.63%-0.70%, which is more than covering the cost of the increase in
   suppliers' IT capital. In addition, this increase in suppliers' IT
   capital increases the average downstream industry's output by $66-$72
   million, thereby confirming substantial supplier-driven IT spillovers
   downstream. We also infer the magnitude of the measurement error of the
   price deflator of the intermediate input resulting from the failure to
   account for IT-related quality improvement, finding that the measured
   price deflator overestimates the true deflator by approximately 30% at
   the mean level of IT capital.

   valuations for a set of goods that she previously ranked in order of
   preference. The individual is ex ante uncertain about her utility from
   consumption of the goods and can exert costly cognitive effort to reduce
   this uncertainty. We show that incorporating information from a prior
   decision has three primary effects: (a) Valuations are expected to
   exhibit higher variance in particular, the spread of valuations between
   the most and least preferred alternatives increases; (b) decision makers
   will, in expectation, exert more effort during the valuation phase; and
   (c) the relative impact of prior decisions on valuation spread
   increases, the more each attribute contributes to overall utility. The
   model predictions are then tested in a series of controlled lab

AB Geographically dispersed sellers in electronic reverse marketplaces such
   as those hosted by market-makers like Ariba are uncertain about the
   number of competitors they face in any given market session. We refer to
   this uncertainty about the number of competitors as market-structure
   uncertainty. Over the course of several market sessions sellers learn
   about the competitive nature of the marketplace. How they learn to
   reduce the market-structure uncertainty depends on the
   market-transparency scheme, or the revelation policy adopted. A
   revelation policy determines the extent to which information-the number
   of sellers in a session, their bidding patterns, etc.-is revealed to
   sellers. Because these policies control what sellers learn, and how they
   bid in future sessions, they determine buyer surplus. Possibly because
   market-structure uncertainty is more prevalent in information
   technology-enabled marketplaces than traditional ones, prior work has
   not addressed the impact of revelation policies on this type of
   uncertainty. Currently, there is little guidance available to buyers in
   choosing, the appropriate revelation policy.
   To address this information-technology-enabled problem, we use game
   theory to compare the buyer surplus generated under a set of revelation
   policies commonly used in electronic reverse marketplaces. We
   demonstrate that the policy that generates the least amount of
   market-structure uncertainty for the sellers always maximizes buyer
   surplus. We further investigate to provide intuition regarding how
   bidders' reactions to overcome uncertainty differs with the nature of
   uncertainty, and how those reactions impact buyer surplus.

   mitigates risk. Theory is presented for general utility functions and
   mean-variance formulations and is illustrated with networks featuring
   resource diversification, flexibility (e.g., inventory substitution),
   and sharing (commonality). In contrast to single-resource settings,
   risk-averse newsvendors may invest more in networks than risk-neutral
   newsvendors: some resources and even total spending may exceed
   risk-neutral levels. With normally distributed demand, risk-averse
   newsvendors change resource levels roughly proportionally to demand
   variance, while risk-neutral agents adjust only proportionally to
   standard deviation.
   Two effects explain this operational hedge and suggest rules of thumb
   for strategic placement of safety capacity and inventory in networks:
   (1) Risk pooling suggests rebalancing capacity toward inexpensive
   resources that serve lower-profit variance markets. This highlights the
   role of profit variance (instead of demand variance) in risk-averse
   network investment. (2) Ex post revenue maximization suggests
   rebalancing capacity toward substitutable flexible but away from shared
   capacity when markets differ in profitability. Capacity imbalance and
   allocation flexibility thus mitigate profit risk and truly are
   operational hedges.

   of whether one can globally set a pair of coordinating transshipment
   prices, i.e., payments that each party has to make to the other for the
   transshipped goods, that induce the local decision makers to make
   inventory and transshipment decisions that are globally optimal. A
   recent paper suggests, for a special case of our model, that there
   always exists a unique pair of coordinating transshipment prices. We
   demonstrate through a counterexample that this statement is not correct
   and derive sufficient and necessary conditions under which it would
   hold. We show that in some conditions, coordinating prices may exist for
   only a narrow range of problem parameters and explore conditions when
   this can happen. Finally, we study the effects of demand and capacity
   variability on the magnitude of coordinating transshipment prices.

   existence of learning curves in manufacturing and service industries, it
   is not clear whether learning curves also apply to knowledge work like
   software development. We evaluate the relative productivity impacts from
   accumulating specialized experience in a system, diversified experience
   in related and unrelated systems, and experience from working with
   others on modification requests (MRs) in a telecommunications firm,
   which uses an incremental software development methodology. Using
   multilevel modeling, we analyze extensive data archives covering more
   than 14 years of systems development work on a major telecommunications
   product dating from the beginning of its development process. Our
   findings reveal that the relative importance of the different types of
   experience differs across levels of analysis. Specialized experience has
   the greatest impact on productivity for MRs completed by individual
   developers, whereas diverse experience in related systems plays a larger
   role in improving productivity for MRs and system releases completed by
   groups and organizational units. Diverse experience in unrelated systems
   has the least influence on productivity at all three levels of analysis.
   Our findings support the existence of learning curves in software

AB Research on industry life cycles suggests that competitive pressures are
   more severe during the shakeout stage, which could be associated with
   the emergence of a dominant design, than at other stages.
   Transaction-cost theory, on the other hand, assumes generally
   competitive markets and does not address the industry life cycle. It
   therefore implies that transaction-cost economizing is a superior firm
   strategy regardless of the stage of the life cycle. This paper seeks to
   reconcile these two streams of research by investigating whether
   aligning transactions with governance modes in accordance with
   transaction-cost prescriptions has a differential effect on firm
   survival in preshakeout versus shakeout stages of the industry life
   cycle. Analyzing data from the early U.S. auto industry (1917-1933), we
   find that while transaction misalignment did not have a significant
   impact on firm survival during the preshakeout stage or during the
   period as a whole, it did have a significantly larger negative impact on
   survival during the shakeout stage than during the preshakeout stage. We
   also find that the negative effects of misalignment on survival were
   significantly weaker for larger firms during the shakeout stage. This
   suggests that applications of transaction-cost theory which assume
   uniformly severe selection pressures across the industry life cycle and
   uniform effects of misalignment across firms of different sizes could be
   misleading. It also suggests that theories of the industry life cycle
   could usefully take transaction costs into account along with production
   costs in their analyses of competition over the life cycle.

AB In this paper, a market-based decomposition method for decomposable
   linear systems is developed. The solution process iterates between a
   master problem that solves the market-matching problem, and subproblems
   that solve the agents' bundle-determination problems. Starting from any
   initial price and feasible allocation, system optimality can be achieved
   under a dynamic market-trading algorithm in a finite number of trades.
   The final market-clearing prices are discovered by this market trading
   and an efficient allocation is achieved by direct, wealth-improving
   resource exchanges among self-interested agents. Certain types of
   strategic behavior by the agents and a dealer in the marketplace are
   studied as well. Our proposed market mechanism addresses price dynamics,
   incentive issues, and economic transactions of real-world, distributed
   decision-making situations more realistically than traditional
   decomposition approaches. In addition, it can be operated in both
   synchronous and asynchronous environments. We provide a market-based
   paradigm for decentralized problem solving and information processing
   that can be easily implemented to support real-time optimization of
   distributed systems.

AB Recent technological and market forces have profoundly impacted the
   music industry. Emphasizing threats from peer-to-peer (P2P)
   technologies, the industry continues to seek sanctions against
   individuals who offer a significant number of songs for others to copy.
   Combining data on the performance of music albums on the Billboard
   charts with file sharing data from a popular network, we assess the
   impact of recent developments related to the music industry on survival
   of music albums on the charts and evaluate the specific impact of P2P
   sharing on an album's survival on the charts. In the post-P2P era, we
   find significantly reduced chart survival except for those albums that
   debut high on the charts. In addition, superstars and female artists
   continue to exhibit enhanced survival. Finally, we observe a narrowing
   of the advantage held by major labels. The second phase of our study
   isolates the impact of file sharing on album survival. We find that,
   although sharing does not hurt the survival of top-ranked albums, it
   does have a negative impact on low-ranked albums. These results point to
   increased risk from rapid information sharing for all but the "cream of
   the crop."

AB Motivated by the increasing use of auctions by government agencies, we
   consider the problem of fairly pricing public goods in a combinatorial
   auction. A well-known problem with the incentive-compatible
   Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism is that the resulting
   prices may not be in the core. Loosely speaking, this means the payments
   of the winners could. be so low, that there are bidders who would have
   been willing to pay more than the payments of the winning bidders.
   Clearly, this "unfair" outcome is unacceptable for a public sector
   auction. Recent advances in auction theory suggest that combinatorial
   auctions resulting in efficient outcomes and bidder-Pareto-optimal core
   payments offer a viable practical alternative to address this problem.
   This paper confronts two critical issues facing the
   bidder-Pareto-optimal core payment. First, motivated to minimize a
   bidder's ability to benefit through strategic manipulation (through
   collusive agreement or unilateral action), we demonstrate the strength
   of a mechanism that minimizes total payments among all such auction
   outcomes, narrowing the previously broad solution concept. Second, we
   address the computational difficulties of achieving these outcomes with
   a constraint-generation approach,promising to broaden the range of
   applications for which bidder-Pareto-optimal core pricing achieves a
   comfortably rapid solution.

AB Firms in many industries experience protracted periods of pricing power,
   the ability to successfully enact price increases. In these situations,
   firms must decide not only whether to raise prices, but to whom.
   Specifically, in a competitive context, they must determine whether it
   is more profitable to increase prices across-the-board or to a specific
   segment of their customer base. While selective price decreases are
   ubiquitous in practice (e.g., better deals to potential new customers by
   phone carriers; better deals to current customers by various magazines),
   to our knowledge selective price increases are relatively rare.
   We illustrate the benefits of targeted price increases, and, as such, we
   expand the repertoire of firms' promotional policies. To that end, we
   explore a scenario where, two competing firms must decide whether to
   increase prices to the entire market or only to a specific segment.
   Targeted price increases (TPI), i.e., being offered an unchanged price
   (selectively) when others are subject to price increases, can be offered
   to Loyals (those who bought from the firm in the previous period) or
   Switchers (those who did not). The effects of TPIs are estimated through
   a laboratory experiment and an associated stochastic model, each
   allowing for both rational (Loyalty, Switching) and behaviorist
   (Betrayal, Jealousy) effects.
   We find that TPIs can indeed yield beneficial results (greater retention
   for Loyals or greater attraction of Switchers) and greater profits in
   certain circumstances. Results for TPI are additionally benchmarked
   against those for targeted price decreases and are found to differ. The
   range of effects stemming from the experiment can be used in a
   competitive analysis to yield equilibrium strategies for the two firms.
   In this case, we find that-depending on the magnitude of the price
   increase, market shares of the two firms, and price knowledge across
   consumer segments-a firm may wish to embrace targeted price increases in
   some situations, to institute across-the-board price increases in
   others, and to not enact any price increases in still others. We show
   that a firm can sacrifice considerable profit if it settles on a
   suboptimal pricing strategy (e.g., wrongly. instituting an
   across-the-board increase), favors the wrong segment (e.g., Switchers
   instead of Loyals), or ignores "behaviorist" effects (Betrayal or
   Jealousy).

AB We propose that the temporal dimension is fragile in that choices are
   insufficiently sensitive to it, and second, such sensitivity as exists
   is exceptionally malleable, unlike other dimensions such as money, which
   are attended by default. To test this, we axiomatize a
   "constant-sensitivity" discount function, and in four studies, we show
   that the degree of time-sensitivity is inadequate relative to the
   compound discounting norm, and strongly susceptible to manipulation.
   Time-sensitivity is increased by a comparative within-subject
   presentation (Experiment 1), direct instruction (Experiment 3), and
   provision of a visual cue for time duration (Experiment 4);
   time-sensitivity is decreased using a time pressure manipulation
   (Experiment 2). In each study, the sensitivity manipulation has an
   opposite effect on near-future and far-future valuations: Increased
   sensitivity decreases discounting in the near future and increases
   discounting in the far future. In contrast, such sensitivity
   manipulations have little effect on the money dimension.

AB We develop a model for pricing securities whose value may depend
   simultaneously on equity, interestrate, and default risks. The framework
   may also be used to extract probabilities of default (PD) functions from
   market data. Our approach is entirely based on observables such as
   equity prices and interest rates, rather than on unobservable processes
   such as firm value. The model stitches together in an arbitrage-free
   setting a constant elasticity of variance (CEV) equity model (to
   represent the behavior of equity prices prior to default), a default
   intensity process, and a Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model for the
   evolution of riskless interest rates. The model captures several
   stylized features such as a negative relation between equity prices and
   equity volatility, a negative relation between default intensity and
   equity prices, and a positive relationship between default intensity and
   equity volatility. We embed the model on a discrete-time, recombining
   lattice, making implementation feasible with polynomial complexity. We
   demonstrate the simplicity of calibrating the model to market data and
   of using it to extract default information. The framework is extensible
   to handling correlated default risk and may be used to value distressed
   convertible bonds, debt-equity swaps, and credit portfolio products such
   as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Applied to the CDX INDU
   (credit default index-industrials) Index, we find the S&P 500 index

AB Understanding the value of a product development project is central to a
   firm's choice of project portfolio. The value of a project to a firm
   depends not only on its properties but also on the other projects being
   developed by the firm. This is due to interactions with the other
   projects that address the same consumer need and require the same
   development resources. In this study, we empirically investigate the
   structure and significance of these portfolio-level project
   interactions. Using a self-developed pharmaceutical industry data set,
   we conduct an event study around the failure of phase III clinical
   trials and their effect on the market valuation of the firm. The study
   exploits the natural experiment of a product development failure to give
   us a measure of the value of a drug development project to a firm. We
   then explain the variance in the value of projects based on interactions
   with other projects in the firm's portfolio. We find that the presence
   of other projects targeting the same market and a build-up of projects
   that require the same development resources reduce the value of a
   development project. In addition to providing evidence on the
   significance and structure of these portfolio-level project
   interactions, the empirical model estimated in this paper also provides
   a data-driven approach to valuing projects that may be relevant to
   licensing transactions.

   system that faces frequent, component-based technology innovations. For
   each component, there are two technologies with overlapping life cycles
   coexisting in the market. All cost parameters associated with each
   technology (procurement cost, salvage value, etc.) evolve dynamically.
   We investigate two technology-inventory coordination schemes, one is at
   the strategic level, where technology and inventory decisions are
   sequentially made using partial information, and another is at the
   operational level, where technology and inventory decisions are jointly
   made using full information. The performance gap between the two
   coordination schemes quantifies the value of incorporating dynamic
   inventory information in technology management. We develop effective
   solution techniques and approximation methods and characterize their
   policy structures. Our numerical study indicates that the
   strategic-level technology-inventory coordination is generally
   sufficient, but the operational-level coordination becomes necessary
   when demand variability is high and salvage loss is heavy. We also
   propose a hybrid technology-inventory coordination scheme, whereby the
   firm adopts a technology management plan using the strategic-level
   coordination scheme, but executes it dynamically by adapting to
   inventory information, using a heuristic proposed in this paper. Our
   numerical study suggests that the hybrid strategy can virtually achieve
   the performance of the optimal operational level coordination. Our
   analysis provides guidelines for the effective technology-adoption and
   inventory-control coordination strategies in the ATO system with rapid
   innovations.

   balancing of incentives and downside risk. We then develop a refinement

AB This paper analyzes sequential auctioning of single units of an
   indivisible good to a fluctuating population composed of overlapping
   generations of unit-demand bidders. Two phenomena emergent in such a
   market are investigated: forward-looking bidding strategies, and
   closed-loop selling strategies that involve learning from past prices.
   The buyers shade their bids down, i.e., bid less than they would in a
   single isolated auction, whenever they expect the seller to sell another
   unit of the good in the near future. Unlike in exogenous sequences of
   auctions, the optimal bidding strategy thus depends on the seller's
   selling strategy. The converse dependence also occurs: the seller can
   learn about current demand from past realized prices, and sell only in
   periods with high-enough demand. Such learning depends on the extent of
   bid-shading because the seller needs to invert the bidding strategy to
   learn. In equilibrium, buyer bid-shading persists even when the seller
   does not sell in every period, but it is self-regulating in that it
   eventually vanishes when the existence of the market is threatened by
   low seller profits. In this sense, auction markets have a
   "self-preservation instinct." General properties of learning about
   current demand from past auction prices are also investigated and
   characterized.

   campaign budgets affect advertising strategies in the context of a
   political campaign. Our key finding is that tight campaign limits
   stimulate aggressive advertising on the part of competing parties, while
   generous budgets often lead to parties acting defensively. The analysis
   also provides an explanation for the increasingly partisan campaigns
   that the Republicans and Democrats have taken in recent elections. When
   there is significant polarization amongst noncommitted voters and
   campaign spending limits are higher, we find that parties "retrench"

AB Cooperation and coordination among employees can yield significant

   incentive systems that induce task-related effort, helping, and
   knowledge sharing within workgroups. We identify three distinct types of
   employee linkages that must be accommodated in the design of effective
   incentive systems: (1) outcome linkages, whereby the outcome of one
   employee's task is influenced by that of another; (2) help linkages,
   whereby each employee can directly expend effort on helping another; and
   (3) knowledge linkages, whereby each employee can share job-related
   knowledge with another. We analytically investigate the effect of each
   type of employee linkage, and some combinations of these linkages, on
   the optimal design of incentive systems. Our analytical results
   demonstrate how, by optimally weighting individual-level and
   workgroup-level incentives, managers can balance the need to induce
   cooperation and coordination among employees with the need to manage
   employees' incentive-related risk. Counter to conventional wisdom, we
   also demonstrate that both group and individual incentives are necessary
   to facilitate cooperative behaviors such as knowledge sharing in
   workgroups. Further, we empirically test some of the insights developed
   from the analytical models; our empirical findings support these
   analytical results.

AB We examine the trade-offs between demand information and inventory in a
   distribution channel. While better demand information has a positive
   direct effect for the manufacturer in improving the efficiency of
   holding inventory in a channel, it can also have the strategic effect of
   increasing retail prices and limiting the extraction of retail profits.
   Having inventory in the channel can help the manufacturer to manage
   retail pricing behavior while better extracting retail surplus. Thus,
   even if the information system is perfectly reliable, the manufacturer
   might not always want to institute an information-enabled channel over a
   channel with inventory.
   We show this first in a channel with a single retailer, where the
   channel with perfect information is preferred over the channel with
   inventory only if the marginal cost of production is sufficiently high.
   We also analyze a channel with an imperfectly reliable information
   system and find that if the manufacturer were to choose the precision of
   the demand information system, it might not prefer perfect information,
   even if such information was costless to acquire. In a channel with
   competing retailers, the channel with perfect information is preferred
   when retail competition is sufficiently intense. Thus, the presence of
   inventory can play a role in managing competition among retailers and in
   helping the manufacturers to appropriate surplus especially when
   retailers are sufficiently differentiated.

AB This paper studies a procurement problem with one buyer and multiple
   potential suppliers who hold private information about their own
   production costs. Both the purchase quantity and the price need to be
   determined. An optimal procurement strategy for the buyer requires the
   buyer to first design a supply contract that specifies a payment for
   each possible purchase quantity and then invites the suppliers to bid
   for this contract. The auction can be conducted in many formats such as
   the English auction, the Dutch auction, the first-priced, sealed-bid
   auction, and the Vickrey auction. The winner is the supplier with the
   highest bid, and is given the decision right for the quantity produced
   and delivered. Applying this theory to a newsvendor model with
   supply-side competition, this paper establishes a connection between the
   above optimal procurement strategy and a common practice in the retail
   industry, namely, the use of slotting allowances and vendor-managed
   inventory. Also discussed in the newsvendor context are the role of
   well-known supply contracts such as returns contracts and
   revenue-sharing contracts in procurement auctions, the scenarios where
   the buyer and suppliers may possess asymmetric information about the
   demand distribution, and how the cost of supply-demand mismatch is
   affected by supply-side competition. Finally, this paper compares the
   optimal procurement strategy with a simpler but suboptimal strategy
   where the buyer first determines a purchase quantity and then seeks the
   lowest-cost supplier for the quantity in an auction.

AB Consider a firm developing an innovative product. Due to market
   pressures, production must begin soon after the product development
   effort is complete, which requires that an upstream supplier invests in
   capacity while the design of the product and production process are in
   flux. Because the product is ill-defined at this point in time, the
   firms are unable to write court-enforceable contracts that specify the
   terms of trade or the supplier's capacity investment. However, the firms
   can adopt an informal agreement (relational contract) regarding the
   terms of trade and capacity investment. The potential for future
   business provides incentive for the firms to adhere to the relational
   contract. We show that the optimal relational contract may be complex,
   requiring the buyer to order more than her demand to indirectly monitor
   the supplier's capacity investment. We propose a simpler relational
   contract and show that it performs very well for a broad range of
   parameters. Finally, we identify characteristics of the business
   environment that make relational contracting particularly valuable.

   of the investor. We find the optimal allocation to the risky security as
   a proportion of financial wealth and as a proportion of the total
   wealth, defined as the combination of the financial wealth and the human
   capital of the investor. When the investor's objective is the
   maximization of the terminal wealth, we show that the optimal allocation
   to the risky security is a hump-shaped function of the investment
   horizon. However, when the investor maximizes utility from intertemporal
   consumption, the optimal allocation in the risky security is a constant
   proportion of the total wealth of the investor.

   any firm can lend to any other firm, so that each firm is subject to
   counterparty risk either from direct borrowers or from remote firms in
   the network. This model takes into account the role of each firm's cash
   management. We show that we can obtain a semiclosed form formula for the
   price of debt and equity when cash accounts are buffers to bankruptcy
   risk. As in other structural models, the strategic bankruptcy decision
   of shareholders drives credit spreads, and differentiates debt from
   equity Cash-flow risk also causes credit-risk interdependencies between
   firms. Our model applies to the case where not only financial flows but
   also operations are dependent across firms. We use queueing theory to
   obtain our semiclosed form formulae in steady state. We perform a
   simplified implementation of our model to the U.S. automotive industry,
   and show how we infer the impact on a supplier's credit spreads of
   revenue changes in a manufacturer or even in a large car dealer. We also

AB This paper examines the use of options contracts by firms acquiring
   rights to commercialize university technologies. By combining
   information about the sequence of licensing decisions with
   characteristics of the firms and technologies involved, I explore
   factors that shape decisions to purchase and exercise option contracts
   for these technologies. Decisions by firms that considered but did not
   purchase an option or a license are included in the sample. Consistent
   with the basic premise of real-options theory, I find that firms are
   more likely to purchase option contracts for more uncertain
   technologies. Also in line with theoretical predictions, I find that
   firms that are better able to evaluate an external technology are less
   likely to purchase options before licensing. The results also highlight
   more complex motives for exercising options in technology licensing. On
   the one hand, firms appear to benefit from their ability to learn about
   the technology during the option period. On the other hand, firms that
   are better able to "absorb" the technology during the contract period
   may have reduced incentives to subsequently license the invention.

   with a brand image. The economic value of such association to the
   consumer of a brand is coming from its affect on the information
   exchange between consumers engaged in a search for partnerships with
   each other. It turns out that the brand use can be valuable to consumers
   for communication even when they do not have the proper incentives to
   make simple conversations valuable or informative. In particular, when
   the correlation of the interests of agents in a partnership is low,
   conversations are not very informative, while brand use remains
   informative and valuable. Furthermore, the more widespread the brand use
   is, the less truthful (and informative) one can expect conversations to
   be. In addition, the consumer value of a brand image is shown to have an
   inverse-U shape in the difficulty of searching, as consumers look for
   conformity when a search is difficult, and conversations become more and
   more truthful when a search becomes very easy.

AB Although alliance studies have generally favored an ambidextrous
   approach between exploration and exploitation, they tend to overlook a
   firm's characteristics, its industry constraints, or the dynamic network
   in which the firm is embedded. This study examines the ambidexterity
   hypothesis and its boundary conditions with a unique research method. We
   not only analyze empirical data from five U.S. industries spanning eight
   years, but also expand theoretical insights to the network level by
   building a computer simulation model. Both our empirical and simulation
   results reveal the contingencies of the ambidexterity hypothesis in
   alliance formation. Our findings show that although an ambidextrous
   formation of alliances benefits large firms, a focused formation of
   either exploratory or exploitative alliances benefits small firms. In an
   uncertain environment an ambidextrous formation enhances firm
   performance but so does a focused formation in a stable environment.
   Finally, the simulation model demonstrates that a firm's centrality and
   structural hole positions in network relations can moderate the
   relationships between alliance formation choices and firm performance,
   and that the ambidexterity hypothesis may be limited to the earlier
   stage of the network. Our study provides critical evidence into the
   viability of adopting a dynamic network perspective in understanding the
   ambidexterity hypothesis and advancing strategic alliance research
   beyond static and dyadic levels.

AB A growing body of qualitative evidence shows that loss aversion, a
   phenomenon formalized in prospect theory, can explain a variety of field
   and experimental data. Quantifications of loss aversion are, however,
   hindered by the absence of a general preference-based method to elicit
   the utility for gains and losses simultaneously. This paper proposes
   such a method and uses it to measure loss aversion in an experimental
   study without making any parametric assumptions. Thus, it is the first
   to obtain a parameter-free elicitation of prospect theory's utility
   function on the whole domain. Our method also provides an efficient way
   to elicit utility midpoints, which are important in axiornatizations of
   utility. Several definitions of loss aversion have been put forward in
   the literature. According to most definitions we find strong evidence of
   loss aversion, at both the aggregate and the individual level. The
   degree of loss aversion varies with the definition used, which
   underlines the need for a commonly accepted definition of loss aversion.

AB Decision making by physicians on patients' treatment has come under
   increased public scrutiny. In fact, there is a fair amount of debate on
   the effects of marketing actions of pharmaceutical firms toward
   physicians and their impact on physician prescription behavior. While
   some scholars find a strong and positive influence of marketing actions,
   some find only moderate effects, and others even find negative effects.
   Debate is also mounting on the role of other influencers (such as
   patient requests) in physician decision making, both on prescriptions
   and sample dispensing. The authors argue that one factor that may tip
   the balance in this debate is the role of drug characteristics, such as
   a drug's effectiveness and a drug's side effects.
   Using a unique data set, they show that marketing
   efforts-operationalized as detailing and symposium meetings of firms to
   physicians-and patient requests do affect physician decision making
   difterentially across brands. Moreover, they find that the
   responsiveness of physicians' decision making to marketing efforts and
   patient requests depends upon the drug's effectiveness and side effects.
   This paper presents clear guidelines for public policy and managerial
   practice and envisions that the study of the role of drug
   characteristics, such as effectiveness and side effects, may lead to
   valuable insights in this surging public debate.

AB The only therapy for a patient with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is
   liver transplantation, which is performed by using either a cadaveric
   liver from a deceased donor or a portion of a living-donor's liver. This
   study addresses the following decision problem for an ESLD patient with
   an available living donor. Should she have a transplantation now or
   wait? If she decides to have the transplantation now, should she use her
   living-donor liver or a cadaveric liver for transplantation? We
   formulate this problem as a discrete-time, infinite-horizon Markov
   decision process model and solve it using clinical data. Because living
   donors are typically related to the recipient, we incorporate a
   disutility associated with using the living-donor liver as opposed to
   using a cadaveric liver. We perform a structural analysis of the model,
   including a set of intuitive conditions that ensure the existence of
   structured policies such as an at-most-three-region (AM3R) optimal
   policy. Our computational experiments confirm that the optimal policy is
   typically of AM3R type.

   response modes use different measures of miscalibration, so it is
   difficult to directly compare their relative (in)accuracy. We employed a
   more refined within-subject design in which decision makers (DMs) used
   both response modes to make judgments about a random sample of stocks
   accompanied by identical information to facilitate comparison between
   the two judgment methods. DMs judged the probabilities that the stocks
   will reach a certain threshold, provided lower and upper bounds of these
   forecasts, and estimated median, 50%, 70%, and 90% confidence intervals
   of their future prices. We found that the judgments were internally
   consistent and coherent, but in most cases they were slightly
   miscalibrated. We used several new methods of analysis that allow for
   more precise and reliable comparison between the two response modes. We
   inferred point probability estimates for the target events from the
   confidence intervals and analyzed them by the same methods applied to
   binary judgments. Interestingly, when we quantified miscalibration in
   identical fashion for both methods we did not find evidence of
   differential levels of miscalibration for the probability judgments and
   the confidence intervals. We discuss the theoretical and practical
   implications of these results.

AB Probability forecasters who are rewarded via a proper scoring rule may
   care not only about the score, but also about their performance relative
   to other forecasters. We model this type of preference and show that a
   competitive forecaster who wants to do better than another forecaster
   typically should report more extreme probabilities, exaggerating toward
   zero or one. We consider a competitive forecaster's best response to
   truthful reporting and also investigate equilibrium reporting functions
   in the case where another forecaster also cares about relative
   performance. We show how a decision maker can revise probabilities of an
   event after receiving reported probabilities from competitive
   forecasters and note that the strategy of exaggerating probabilities can
   make well-calibrated forecasters (and a decision maker who takes their
   reported probabilities at face value) appear to be overconfident.
   However, a decision maker who adjusts appropriately for the
   misrepresentation of probabilities by one or more forecasters can still
   be well calibrated. Finally, to try to overcome the forecasters'
   competitive instincts and induce cooperative behavior, we develop the
   notion of joint scoring rules based on business sharing and show that
   these scoring rules are strictly proper.

AB In financial risk management, coherent risk measures have been proposed
   as a way to avoid undesirable properties of measures such as value at
   risk that discourage diversification and do not account for the
   magnitude of the largest, and therefore most serious, losses. A coherent
   risk measure equals the maximum expected loss under several different
   probability measures, and these measures are analogous to "populations"
   or "systems" in the ranking-and-selection literature. However, unlike in
   ranking and selection, here it is the value of the maximum expectation
   under any of the probability measures, and not the identity of the
   probability measure that attains it, that is of interest. We propose
   procedures to form fixed-width, simulation-based confidence intervals
   for the maximum of several expectations, explore their correctness and
   computational efficiency, and illustrate them on risk-management
   problems. The availability of efficient algorithms for computing
   coherent risk measures will encourage their use for improved risk
   management.

   general public (N = 476). The statistical information that had the most
   interesting effects, "individual own past-cost information,"
   unfortunately enhanced adverse selection, which we could directly verify
   because the real health costs of the clients were known. For a
   prescriptive evaluation this drawback must be weighted against some
   advantages: a desirable interaction with risk attitude, increased
   customer satisfaction, and increased cost awareness. Descriptively,
   ambiguity seeking was found rather than ambiguity aversion, and no risk
   aversion was found for loss outcomes. Both findings, obtained in a
   natural decision context, deviate from traditional views in risk theory
   but are in line with prospect theory. We confirmed prospect theory's
   reflection at the level of group averages but falsified it at the
   individual level.

AB Negotiations are often conducted under the stipulation that an impasse
   is to be resolved using final-offer arbitration (FOA). In fact, FOA
   frequently is not needed; in Major League Baseball, for instance, more
   than 80% of the salary negotiations that could go to arbitration instead
   reach a bargained agreement. We show that the risk aversion of at least
   one side explains this phenomenon. We then model pay negotiation in
   baseball by applying a bargaining solution with a variable disagreement
   outcome representing FOA, studying the existence of pure Nash
   equilibrium initial offers and their effects on the player's eventual
   pay, and considering the Nash solution as a special case.

AB We investigate the long-standing puzzle on the underpricings of
   convertible bonds. We hypothesize that the observed underpricing is
   induced by the possibility that a convertible bond might renegotiate on
   some of its covenants, e.g., an imbedded put option in financial
   difficulties. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that the initial
   underpricing Is larger for lower rated bonds. The underpricing worsens
   if the issuer experiences subsequent financial difficulties. However,
   conditional on no rating downgrades, our main empirical result shows
   that convertible bond prices do converge to their theoretical prices
   within two years. This seasoning period is shorter for higher rated
   convertible bonds.

   proposes a method to optimize the design of the ads. Utilizing a large
   dataset of consumers' attention to over 1,100 individual feature ads
   collected with eye-tracking technology, we analyze the effects of the
   five key design elements of feature ads-brand, text, pictorial, price,
   and promotion-on consumers' attention to them. Attention is measured in
   terms of selection and gaze duration. We focus on the effects of the
   surface sizes of the design elements. A key feature of our model is that
   it takes into account the impact of visual clutter in the ad display
   page. To capture the clutter effects, we propose two new entropy-based
   measures that characterize the salience of feature ads in their
   competitive environment based on Attention Engagement Theory. In a
   Bayesian framework, we simultaneously estimate the parameters of the
   model and optimize the design of feature ads in terms of surface sizes
   of the five design elements. Our optimization results and comparisons
   with alternative design approaches indicate that significant
   improvements in attention to feature advertising can be achieved without
   increase in costs, and that the resultant optimal feature ad designs
   create win-win opportunities for manufacturers and retailers.

AB This paper develops empirical proxy measures of information technology

   analyzing IT returns: production function and market value
   specifications. The results suggest that IT capital investments make a
   substantially larger contribution to overall firm risk than non-IT
   capital investments. Further, firms with higher IT risk have a higher
   marginal product of IT relative to firms with low IT risk. In the market
   value specification, the impact of IT risk is positive and significant,
   and inclusion of the IT risk term substantially reduces the coefficient
   on IT capital. We estimate that about 30% of the gross return on IT
   investment corresponds to the risk premium associated with IT risk.
   Taken together, our results show that IT risk provides part of the
   explanation for the unusually high valuations of IT capital investment
   in recent research.

AB Performance-based contracting is reshaping service support supply chains
   in capital-intensive industries such as aerospace and defense. Known as
   ''power by the hour'' in the private sector and as ''performance-based
   logistics'' (PBL) in defense contracting, it aims to replace
   traditionally used fixed-price and cost-plus contracts to improve
   product availability and reduce the cost of ownership by tying a
   supplier's compensation to the output value of the product generated by
   the customer (buyer).
   To analyze implications of performance-based relationships, we introduce
   a multitask principal-agent model to support resource allocation and use
   it to analyze commonly observed contracts. In our model the customer
   (principal) faces a product availability requirement for the ''uptime''
   of the end product. The customer then offers contracts contingent on
   availability to n suppliers (agents) of the key subsystems used in the
   product, who in turn exert cost reduction efforts and set spare-parts
   inventory investment levels. We show that the first-best solution can be
   achieved if channel members are risk neutral. When channel members are
   risk averse, we find that the second-best contract combines a fixed
   payment, a cost-sharing incentive, and a performance incentive.
   Furthermore, we study how these contracts evolve over the product
   deployment life cycle as uncertainty in support cost changes. Finally,
   we illustrate the application of our model to a problem based on
   aircraft maintenance data and show how the allocation of performance
   requirements and contractual terms change under various environmental
   assumptions.

AB A manufacturer writes supply contracts with N buyers. Then, the buyers
   invest in innovation, and the manufacturer builds capacity. Finally,
   demand is realized, and the firms renegotiate the supply contracts to
   achieve an efficient allocation of capacity among the buyers. The court
   remedy for breach of contract (specific performance versus expectation
   damages) affects how the firms share the gain from renegotiation, and
   hence how the firms make investments ex ante. The firms may also engage
   in renegotiation design, inserting simple clauses into the supply
   contract to shape the outcome of renegotiation. For example, when a
   buyer grants a financial ''hostage'' to the manufacturer or is charged a
   per them penalty for delay in bargaining, the manufacturer captures the
   gain from renegotiation. ''Tradable options,'' which grant buyers the
   right to trade capacity without intervention from the manufacturer,
   return the gain from renegotiation to the buyers. This paper proves
   that, under surprisingly general conditions, the firms can coordinate
   their investments with the simplest of supply contracts (fixed-quantity
   contracts). This may require renegotiation design, and certainly
   requires that the firms understand the breach remedy and set their
   contract parameters accordingly.

AB In a stylized model of biopharmaceutical. contract manufacturing, this
   paper shows how the potential for renegotiation influences the optimal
   structure of supply contracts, investments in innovation and capacity;
   the way scarce capacity is allocated, and firms' resulting profits. Two
   buyers contract for capacity with a common manufacturer. Then, the
   buyers invest in innovation (product development and marketing) and the
   manufacturer builds capacity. Finally, the firms may renegotiate to
   allow a buyer facing poor market conditions to purchase less than the
   contractual commitment and a buyer facing favorable conditions to
   purchase more. We show that renegotiation can greatly increase the
   firms' investments and profits, provided that the contracts are designed
   correctly. Failing to anticipate renegotiation leads to contracts that
   allow too much flexibility in the buyer's order quantity, and perform
   poorly relative to contracts designed to anticipate renegotiation. We
   provide clear conditions under which quantity flexibility contracts with
   renegotiation coordinate the system. Where quantity flexibility
   contracts fail, employing tradable options improves performance.

   technology strategies increase the survival chances of entrants into
   new, technologically dynamic industries? Does the effectiveness of these
   strategies differ by pre-entry experience? Does the effectiveness of
   these strategies differ by when firms enter a new industry? Consistent
   with the published literature, we find that diversifying entrants have
   an initial survival advantage over entrepreneurial startups. But, we
   find the reverse for later entrants: startups that enter later in the
   industry have a survival advantage over the later entering diversifying
   entrants. We explain this finding in terms of the firms' product
   technology strategies (i.e., offering products based on the technology
   standard and products incorporating the latest technology), pre-entry
   experience, and entry timing. Our findings highlight that it is crucial
   to study what firms do after they enter a new industry to more
   completely understand their ultimate performance.

AB Prior studies examining factors that influence the learning curve mainly
   focus on settings in which firms adopt new products or technologies or
   open new plants or assembly lines. Less is known, however, about how
   more mature firms learn, when they are further down the learning curve.
   To gain insight into factors that enhance learning in this situation, I
   examine factors that increase both the ability and the opportunity to
   learn. I hypothesize that the ability to learn is enhanced by the
   presence of a moderate amount of temporary employees in the workforce
   and by providing employees with related variation in tasks, measured by
   product heterogeneity. In addition, I hypothesize that opportunities for
   learning are created when there is some slack in resources and when
   there are no problems in other important performance dimensions that
   consume employee attention.
   These hypotheses are examined using data of the Royal Dutch Mail, which
   has 27 geographically dispersed regions. Although these 27 regions are
   homogeneous with respect to their tasks, internal organization, type of
   products delivered, and technology used, their learning rates differ
   considerably. In the sample of 972 observations used for this analysis,
   I find that this variation in learning rates is explained by the
   percentage of temporary employees used, the level of excess capacity,
   the degree of product heterogeneity, and the degree to which regions
   face problems in other important performance dimensions. These findings
   provide insight into strategies that help managers in designing work
   processes to maintain a positive learning curve.

   contribution of this paper is to identify, through extensive

   are independent and normally distributed. We also (a) summarize the main
   structural approaches to deriving selection procedures, (b) formalize
   new sampling allocations and stopping rules, (c) identify strengths and
   weaknesses of the procedures, (d) identify some theoretical links
   between them, and (e) present an innovative empirical test bed with the

   most efficient and easiest to control procedures allocate samples with a

   price sensitivities for customer purchase incidence decisions across
   complementary product categories. We use a hierarchical Bayesian
   multivariate probit model to uncover this pattern. We estimated this
   model using purchase incidence data for six categories involving three
   pairs of complementary products.
   Our results show a new and interesting pattern of correlation among
   price parameters of complementary products. For example, we find that
   the correlation of own-price sensitivities of complementary products is
   negative. These results are consistent across the three complementary
   pairs of products. We also investigate the reason for this
   counterintuitive result.
   Finally, we present some managerial implications of our model. We show
   how our model can be used for cross-category targeting decisions by
   retailers. We find that compared to nontargeted discounting, the average
   profitability gain from customized discounting across the three category
   pairs is only 1.29% when complementarity is ignored, but this gain
   improves to 8.26% when full complementarity is taken into account. We
   also investigate whether ignoring the complex pattern of correlation has
   implications for managerial actions regarding targeting and optimal
   discounting. We find that retailers can make misleading inferences about
   the impact of targeted discounts when they ignore cross-category effects
   in modeling.

   integration is often one of the most challenging tasks in managing

   problems such as schema integration and entity identification, it has
   largely overlooked a basic question: When an attribute value for a

   should the ''best'' value be chosen from the set of possible values?
   This paper provides an answer to this question. We first show how a
   probability distribution over a set of possible values can be derived.
   We then demonstrate how these probabilities can be used to solve a given
   decision problem by minimizing the total cost of type I, type II, and
   misrepresentation errors. Finally, we propose a framework for
   integrating multiple data sources when a single ''best'' value has to be
   chosen and stored for every attribute of an entity.

   machine failure as the state variable. Thus, they obtain deterministic
   optimal maintenance and sale date. We study two underlying stochastic
   models with known and random machine modes, and clarify the relationship
   between the resulting value functions to that of KS. In particular, our
   maintenance and sale date decisions, when the machine is in operation,
   are precisely the ones obtained from the deterministic solution of KS.
   We explain why that is so. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition
   for an optimal maintenance and sale date policy that is missing in KS.
   We describe many applications of the KS model in areas other than that
   of machine maintenance. We conclude the paper with extensions of the KS
   problem that are stochastic control problems not easily solvable or not
   at all solvable as deterministic problems.

AB Due to lack of detention capacity ( the U. S. government measures
   capacity by the number of detention beds), tens of thousands of
   apprehended illegal aliens are released into the U. S. interior each
   year, instead of being removed from the country. This vulnerability can
   be exploited by terrorist groups wanting to enter the United States. We
   construct a queueing model of the U. S. detention and removal
   operations, and derive approximate analytical expressions for key
   performance measures, including a simple normal approximation for the
   required number of beds. Due to shortcomings in the U. S. government's
   data collection procedures, we cannot directly estimate all of the
   model's parameter values. Consequently, we use the approximate
   analytical expressions and the 2003 U. S. government data quantifying
   these key performance measures to estimate several unknown parameter
   values. Although current funding is for approximately 21,000 detention
   beds, we estimate that approximately 34,500 beds are needed to remove
   all potential detainees ( this does not include nonviolent, noncriminal
   Mexicans, who are returned to Mexico within several hours) based on 2003
   data. The dramatic increase in the arrivals of potential detainees since
   2003 suggests that approximately 50,000 beds are currently required,
   although the estimation of future arrival rates is very difficult due to
   uncertainties about the future direction of U. S. immigration policy.
   Our estimated bed requirements are approximately 25% higher than naive
   estimates that fail to account for right censoring of residence times
   due to some detainees being released from detention before removal to
   make way for higher-priority detainees.

AB Public officials with the authority to order hurricane evacuations face
   a difficult trade-off between risks to life and costly false alarms.
   Evacuation decisions must be made on the basis of imperfect information,
   in the form of forecasts. The quality of these decisions can be improved
   if they are also informed by measures of uncertainty about the forecast,
   including estimates of the value of waiting for updated, more accurate,
   forecasts. Using a stochastic model of storm motion derived from
   historic tracks, this paper explores the relationship between lead time
   and track uncertainty for Atlantic hurricanes and the implications of
   this relationship for evacuation decisions. Typical evacuation clearance
   times and track uncertainty imply that public officials who require no
   more than a 10% probability of failing to evacuate before a striking
   hurricane ( a false negative) must accept that at least 76%-and for some
   locations over 90%-of evacuations will be false alarms. Reducing
   decision lead times from 72 to 48 hours for major population centers
   could save an average of hundreds of millions of dollars in evacuation
   costs annually, with substantial geographic variation in savings.

AB The people living and working around the roads used for hazardous
   material (hazmat) shipments face the risk of suffering undesirable
   consequences of an accident. The main responsibility to mitigate the
   hazmat transport risk at a population zone belongs to the government
   agency with jurisdiction over that region. One of the common policy
   tools is to close certain road links to vehicles carrying hazmats. In
   effect, the road network available to dangerous goods carriers can be
   determined by the regulator. The transport risk in the region, however,
   is determined by the carriers' routing decisions over the available road
   network. Thus, the regulator needs to make the road closure decisions so
   that the total risk resulting from the carriers' route choices is
   minimized. We provide a path-based formulation for this network design
   problem. Alternative solutions can be generated by varying the routing
   options included in the model for each shipment. Each solution
   corresponds to a certain compromise between the two parties in terms of
   transport risk and economic viability. The proposed framework can be
   used for identifying mutually agreeable hazmat transport policies. We
   present two applications of the methodology to illustrate the insights
   that can be gained through its use: The first application focuses on

AB The newsvendor model captures the trade-off faced by a decision maker
   that needs to place a firm bet prior to the occurrence of a random
   event. Previous research in operations management has mostly focused on
   deriving the decision that minimizes the expected mismatch costs. In
   contrast, we present two methods that estimate the unobservable cost
   parameters characterizing the mismatch cost function. We present a
   structural estimation framework that accounts for heterogeneity in the
   uncertainty faced by the newsvendor as well as in the cost parameters.
   We develop statistical methods that give consistent estimates of the
   model primitives, and derive their asymptotic distribution, which is
   useful to do hypothesis testing. We apply our econometric model to a
   hospital that balances the costs of reserving too much versus too little
   operating room capacity to cardiac surgery cases. Our results reveal
   that the hospital places more emphasis on the tangible costs of having
   idle capacity than on the costs of schedule overrun and long working
   hours for the staff. We also extend our structural models to incorporate
   external information on forecasting biases and mismatch costs reported
   by the medical literature. Our analysis suggests that overconfidence and
   incentive conflicts are important drivers of the frequency of schedule
   overruns observed in our sample.

AB Product recommendation models are key tools in customer relationship

   based on the principle that customer preference similarity stemming from
   prior purchase behavior is a key element in predicting current product
   purchase. The proposed recommendation model is dependent on two
   complementary methodologies: joint space mapping (placing customers and
   products on the same psychological map) and spatial choice modeling
   (allowing observed choices to be correlated across customers). Using a
   joint space map based on past purchase behavior, a predictive model is
   calibrated in which the probability of product purchase depends on the
   customer's relative distance to other customers on the map. An empirical
   study demonstrates that the proposed approach provides excellent
   forecasts relative to benchmark models for a customer database provided

AB Random coefficients choice models are seeing widespread adoption in
   marketing research, partly because of their ability to generate
   household-level parameter estimates with limited data. However, the
   power of such models may tempt researchers to trust that they continue
   to produce reasonable estimates, when in fact either model
   misspecification or insufficient data limits the models' ability to
   recover household-level parameters successfully. If household-level
   choice behaviors are not recovered successfully, managerial decisions
   such as marketing-mix planning and targeting, direct marketing,
   segmentation, and forecasting may not produce the desired results. This
   study addresses the following questions. First, can random coefficients
   choice models correctly identify markets characterized by preference and
   response heterogeneity, state dependence, the use of alternative
   decision heuristics that result in reduced choice sets, and combinations
   of these effects? If so, how much data is required, and is this
   realistic given the size of data sets typically used in marketing
   analyses? Which model selection criteria should be used to identify
   these markets? When there is spurious market identification, which
   parameters contribute to the spurious result? An extensive simulation
   experiment is conducted wherein random coefficients logit models with
   varying specifications of parameter heterogeneity, state dependence
   effects, and choice set heterogeneity are applied to 128 experimental
   conditions. The results show which types of markets can be identified
   reliably and which cannot. Based on the results of the simulation, the
   authors develop a model selection heuristic that identifies the correct
   market in 81% of the experimental conditions. In contrast, strict
   application of the best model selection criterion alone results in
   correct market identification in at most 34% of experimental conditions.
   Interestingly, we find that the amount of data (number of households or
   number of purchases per household) does not affect our ability to
   identify the correct market type with this heuristic, so there is a good
   chance of identifying the correct market type even when little data is
   available.

AB The measurement of customer lifetime value is important because it is
   used as a metric in evaluating decisions in the context of customer
   relationship management. For a firm, it is important to form some
   expectations as to the lifetime value of each customer at the time a
   customer starts doing business with the firm, and at each purchase by
   the customer. In this paper, we use a hierarchical Bayes approach to
   estimate the lifetime value of each customer at each purchase occasion
   by jointly modeling the purchase timing, purchase amount, and risk of
   defection from the firm for each customer. The data come from a
   membership-based direct marketing company where the times of each
   customer joining the membership and terminating it are known once these
   events happen. In addition, there is an uncertain relationship between
   customer lifetime and purchase behavior. Therefore, longer customer
   lifetime does not necessarily imply higher customer lifetime value. We
   compare the performance of our model with other models on a separate
   validation data set. The models compared are the extended NBD-Pareto
   model, the recency, frequency, and monetary value model, two models
   nested in our proposed model, and a heuristic model that takes the
   average customer lifetime, the average interpurchase time, and the
   average dollar purchase amount observed in our estimation sample and
   uses them to predict the present value of future customer revenues at
   each purchase occasion in our hold-out sample. The results show that our
   model performs better than all the other models compared both at
   predicting customer lifetime value and in targeting valuable customers.
   The results also show that longer interpurchase times are associated
   with larger purchase amounts and a greater risk of leaving the firm.
   Both male and female customers seem to have similar interpurchase time
   intervals and risk of leaving; however, female customers spend less
   compared with male customers.

AB Although previous scholars have examined the value of virtual
   communities to customers, in this study we investigate the role of a
   firm's efforts in cultivating trust and harvesting value for themselves
   via the virtual communities that they sponsor. We hypothesize that the
   perceptions of a firm's efforts to provide quality content, to foster
   member embeddedness, and to encourage interaction foster favorable
   customer beliefs about and trust in a virtual community sponsor.
   Further, we hypothesize that trust motivates customers to behave
   relationally toward the sponsoring firm by sharing information with,
   coproducing new products with, and granting loyalty to, the sponsoring
   firm. Data from 663 customers are analyzed using structural equation
   modeling techniques. We find that efforts to provide quality content and
   foster member embeddedness have positive effects on customer beliefs
   about the sponsor. In fact, fostering member embeddedness has a stronger
   explanatory effect on customer beliefs than does providing quality
   content. However, despite the fact that previous studies show that
   customers value interaction in virtual communities, our findings suggest
   that firms must do more than encourage interaction among their community
   members if they hope to create value from their virtual communities.

AB Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on advertising
   to build and maintain awareness for their brands in competitive markets.
   However, awareness formation models in the marketing literature ignore
   the role of competition. Consequently, we lack both the empirical
   knowledge and normative understanding of building brand awareness in
   dynamic oligopoly markets. To address this gap, we propose an N-brand
   awareness formation model, design an extended Kalman filter to estimate
   the proposed model using market data for five car brands over time, and
   derive the optimal closed-loop Nash equilibrium strategies for every
   brand. The empirical results furnish strong support for the proposed
   model in terms of both goodness-of-fit in the estimation sample and
   cross-validation in the out-of-sample data. In addition, the estimation
   method offers managers a systematic way to estimate ad effectiveness and
   forecast awareness levels for their particular brands as well as
   competitors' brands. Finally, the normative analysis reveals an inverse
   allocation principle that suggests-contrary to the proportional-to-sales
   or competitive parity heuristics -that large (small) brands should
   invest in advertising proportionally less (more) than small (large)
   brands.

   from a sample of six open source software projects to explore two sets
   of research questions derived from the literature on software reuse in
   firms and open source software development. We find that code reuse is
   extensive across the sample and that open source software developers,
   much like developers in firms, apply tools that lower their search costs
   for knowledge and code, assess the quality of software components, and
   have incentives to reuse code. Open source software developers reuse
   code because they want to integrate functionality quickly, because they
   want to write preferred code, because they operate under limited
   resources in terms of time and skills, and because they can mitigate
   development costs through code reuse.

AB Recently, an agile software development technique called extreme
   programming has caught the attention of practitioners and researchers in
   the software industry. A core practice of extreme programming is pair
   programming, where two developers work on the same piece of code. We
   introduce the problem of assigning pairs of developers to modules so as
   to maximize the commonality -a measure of the extent to which common
   developers work on related modules -subject to a load-balancing
   constraint that is motivated by the need to control the completion time
   of the project. We consider two variants of this problem. In MCAP(n), a
   developer is teamed up with exactly one other developer to form a pair
   that works together for the entire duration of the project. In MCAP(s),
   we allow a developer to pair with more than one other developer during
   the project. This "pair-splitting" version of the problem facilitates
   knowledge dissemination among developers, but can increase the effort
   needed for a developer to adjust to the work habits of several partners.
   The difference between the commonality achieved with and without pair
   splitting crucially depends on the underlying structure of the problem.
   For trees, we show that the value of the maximum commonality is the same
   for both MCAPn and MCAPs. Additionally, we obtain polynomial-time
   algorithms for both of these variants. For general graphs, both problems
   MCAPn and MCAPs are shown to be strongly NP-complete. We prove that the
   maximum commonality for MCAPs is at most 3 2 times the maximum
   commonality of MCAPn. We also provide polynomial-time algorithms and
   approximation results for a number of special cases of these problems.

   considered the halo a reflection of consumers' inability to discriminate
   between different attributes and have therefore labeled it the "halo

   rationale for the halo effect. We use a decision-theory framework to
   show that the halo is consistent with the goal of minimizing estimation
   risk. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we demonstrate that a decision
   using the halo has lower estimation risk compared to not using the halo
   heuristic. Therefore, using the halo results in utility maximization and

   the call center industry, this is rational behavior, at least under the
   approximating asymptotic regime considered in this paper. We then
   suggest other contracts that do not result in this type of undesirable
   behavior from a contract customer's perspective. We compare the
   performance of the different contracts in terms of mean, variance, and
   outer percentiles of delay for both customer types using both numerical
   and asymptotic heavy-traffic analyses. We argue that including terms
   reflecting the second moment of delay in a contract would be beneficial
   to contract customers and, in a sense, fairer.

AB Predictions of call center arrivals are a key input to staff scheduling
   models. It is, therefore, surprising that simplistic forecasting methods
   dominate practice, and that the research literature on forecasting
   arrivals is so small. In this paper, we evaluate univariate time series
   methods for forecasting intraday arrivals for lead times from one
   half-hour ahead to two weeks ahead. We analyze five series of intraday
   arrivals for call centers operated by a retail bank in the United
   Kingdom. A notable feature of these series is the presence of both an
   intraweek and an intraday seasonal cycle. The methods considered include
   seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling;
   periodic autoregressive modeling; an extension of Holt-Winters
   exponential smoothing for the case of two seasonal cycles; robust
   exponential smoothing based on exponentially weighted least absolute
   deviations regression; and dynamic harmonic regression, which is a form
   of unobserved component state-space modeling. Our results indicate
   strong potential for the use of seasonal ARIMA modeling and the
   extension of Holt-Winters for predicting up to about two to three days
   ahead and that, for longer lead times, a simplistic historical average
   is difficult to beat. We find a similar ranking of methods for call
   center data from an Israeli bank.

   and analyze arrival data to a call center. The attractive feature of
   this model is that it takes into account both covariate and time effects
   on the call volume intensity, and in so doing, enables us to assess the
   effectiveness of different advertising strategies along with predicting
   the arrival patterns. A Bayesian analysis of the model is developed and
   an extension of the model is presented to describe potential
   heterogeneity in arrival patterns. The proposed model and the
   methodology are implemented using real call center arrival data.

AB We study large-scale service systems with multiple customer classes and
   many statistically identical servers. The following question is
   addressed: How many servers are required (staffing) and how does one
   match them with customers (control) to minimize staffing cost, subject
   to class-level quality-of-service constraints? We tackle this question
   by characterizing scheduling and staffing schemes that are
   asymptotically optimal in the limit, as system load grows to infinity.
   The asymptotic regimes considered are consistent with the
   efficiency-driven (ED), quality-driven (QD), and
   quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) regimes, first introduced in the
   context of a single-class service system.
   Our main findings are as follows: (a) Decoupling of staffing and
   control, namely, (i) staffing disregards the multiclass nature of the
   system and is analogous to the staffing of a single-class system with
   the same aggregate demand and a single global quality-of-service
   constraint, and (ii) class-level service differentiation is obtained by
   using a simple idle-server-based threshold-priority (ITP) control (with
   state-independent thresholds); and (b) robustness of the staffing and
   control rules: our proposed single-class staffing (SCS) rule and ITP
   control are approximately optimal under various problem formulations and
   model assumptions. Particularly, although our solution is shown to be
   asymptotically optimal for large systems, we numerically demonstrate
   that it performs well also for relatively small systems.

AB We consider the problem of minimizing staffing costs in an inbound call
   center, while maintaining an acceptable level of service in multiple
   time periods. The problem is complicated by the fact that staffing level
   in one time period can affect the service levels in. subsequent periods.
   Moreover, staff schedules typically take the form of shifts covering
   several periods. Interactions between staffing levels in different time
   periods, as well as the impact of shift requirements on the staffing
   levels and cost, should be considered in the planning. Traditional
   staffing methods based on stationary queueing formulas do not take this
   into account. We present a simulation-based analytic center
   cutting-plane method to solve a sample average approximation of the
   problem. We establish convergence of the method when the service-level
   functions are discrete pseudoconcave. An extensive numerical study of a
   moderately large call center shows that the method is robust and, in
   most of the test cases, outperforms traditional staffing heuristics that
   are based on analytical queueing methods.

AB This paper develops methods to determine appropriate staffing levels in
   call centers and other many-server queueing systems with time-varying
   arrival rates. The goal is to achieve targeted time-stable performance,
   even in the presence of significant time variation in the arrival rates.
   The main contribution is a flexible simulation-based iterative-staffing
   algorithm (ISA) for the M-t/G/s(t) + G model-with nonhomogeneous Poisson
   arrival process (the M,) and customer abandonment (the +G). For
   Markovian M-t/M/s(t) + M special cases, the ISA is shown to converge.
   For that M-t/M/s(t) + M model; simulation experiments show that the ISA
   yields time-stable delay probabilities across a wide range of target
   delay probabilities. With ISA, other performance measures-such as agent
   utilizations, abandonment probabilities, and average waiting times-are
   stable as well. The ISA staffing and performance agree closely with the
   modified-offered-load. approximation, which was previously shown to be
   an effective staffing algorithm without customer abandonment. Although
   the ISA algorithm so far has only been extensively tested for M-t/M/s(t)
   + M models, it can be applied much more generally-to M-t/G/s(t) + G
   models and beyond.

AB Call center managers are facing increasing pressure to reduce costs
   while maintaining acceptable service quality Consequently, they often
   face constrained stochastic optimization problems, minimizing cost
   subject to service-level constraints. Complicating this problem is the
   fact that customer-arrival rates to call centers are often time varying.
   Thus, to satisfy their service goals in a cost-effective manner, call
   centers may employ permanent operators who always provide service, and
   temporary operators who provide service only when the call center is
   busy, i.e., when the number of customers in system increases beyond a
   threshold level. This provides flexibility to dynamically adjust the
   number of operators providing service in response to the timevarying
   arrival rate.
   The constrained dynamic operator staffing (CDOS) problem involves
   determining the number of permanent and temporary operators, and the
   threshold value(s) that minimize time-average hiring and opportunity
   costs subject to service-level constraints. We model the CDCS problem as
   a constrained Markov decision process (MDP) and seek the optimal
   nonrandomized policy. The only exact method in the literature to obtain
   the optimal nonrandomized policy for a constrained MDP is enumeration,
   which is often computationally prohibitive. We provide a novel exact and
   efficient solution method, the modified balance equations disjunctive
   constraints (MBEDC) algorithm, yielding a mixed-integer program
   formulation; the computation times of this algorithm for sample problems
   are lower than enumeration by up to a factor of 200, and by a factor of
   10 on average. Using our algorithm, we quickly solve diverse instances
   of the CDOS problem, generating managerial insights. into the effects of
   temporary operators and service-level constraints.

AB This paper considers a call center outsourcing contract analysis and
   choice problem faced by a contractor and a service provider. The service
   provider receives an uncertain call volume over multiple periods and is
   considering outsourcing all or part of these calls to a contractor. Each
   call brings in a fixed revenue to the service provider. Answering calls
   requires having service capacity; thus implicit in the outsourcing
   decision is a capacity decision. Insufficient capacity implies that
   calls cannot be answered, which in turn means there will be a revenue
   loss. Faced, with a choice between a volume-based and a capacity-based
   contract offered by a contractor that has pricing power, the service
   provider determines optimal capacity levels. The optimal price and
   capacity of the contractor together with the optimal capacity of the
   service provider determine optimal profits of each party under the two
   contracts being considered. This paper characterizes optimal capacity
   levels and partially characterizes optimal pricing decisions under each
   contract. The impact of demand variability and the economic parameters
   on contract choice are explored through numerical examples. It is shown
   that no contract type is universally preferred and that operating
   environments as well as cost-revenue structures have an important
   effect.

AB In this paper, we study the contracting issues in an outsourcing supply
   chain consisting of a user company and a call center that does
   outsourcing work for the user company. We model the call center as a
   G/G/s queue with customer abandonment. Each call has a revenue
   potential, and we model the call center's service quality by the
   percentage of calls resolved (revenue realized). The call center makes
   two strategic decisions: how many agents to have and how much effort to
   exert to achieve service quality.
   We are interested in the contracts the user company can use to induce
   the call center to both staff and exert effort at levels that are
   optimal for the outsourcing supply chain (i.e., chain coordination). Two
   commonly used contracts are analyzed first: piecemeal and
   pay-per-call-resolved contracts. We show that although they can
   coordinate the staffing level, the resulting service quality is below
   system optimum. Then, depending on the observability and contractibility
   of the call center's effort, we propose two contracts that can
   coordinate both staffing and effort. These contracts suggest that
   managers pay close attention to service quality and its contractibility
   in seeking call center outsourcing.

AB The most prevalent form of training call center agents is via classroom
   instruction coupled with roleplays. Role-play training has a theoretical
   base in behavior modeling that entails observation, practice, and
   feedback. Emerging simulation-based technologies offer enhancements to
   behavior modeling that are absent in role-play training. This study
   evaluates the effectiveness of simulation-based training (henceforth,
   simulation training) as a behavior modeling technique vis-a-vis
   role-play training in a real-world call center environment across tasks
   of different levels of complexity. We collaborate with call centers at
   two Fortune 50 firms and examine on-job performance metrics to evaluate
   the effectiveness of simulation training. The performance measures of
   interest are call accuracy and call duration because these are two
   important factors that influence customer satisfaction and productivity
   in call center operations. After controlling for factors such as
   trainee's learning and technology orientation, age, education, and call
   center experience, results show that simulation training outperforms
   role-playing-based training in terms of both accuracy and speed of
   processing customer calls. Further, the relative superiority of
   simulation training improves at higher levels of task complexity.

AB We investigate the benefits of migrating from a call center, where all
   agents are pooled and customers are treated indifferently by any agent,
   toward a call center where customers are grouped into clusters with
   dedicated teams of agents. Each cluster is referred to as a portfolio.
   Customers of the same portfolio are always served by an agent of the
   corresponding team. There is no specialization involved in this
   organization in the sense that all customer portfolios as well as all
   agent teams have (statistically) identical behaviors. The reason for
   moving to this organization is that dealing with teams of limited size
   allows a much better workforce management than the situation usually
   encountered in large call centers.
   The purpose of this paper is to examine how the benefits of moving to
   this new organization can outweigh the drawbacks. The drawbacks come
   from the fact that there is less of a pooling effect in the new
   organization than in the original one. The benefits come from the better
   human resource management that results in a higher efficiency of the
   agents, both in terms of speed and quality of the answers they provide
   to customers. Our analysis is supported by the use of some simple
   queueing models and provides some interesting insights. In particular,
   it appears that for some reasonable ranges of parameters, the new
   organization can outperform the original organization. We then extend
   the analysis to the case where, in addition to the identified customer
   portfolios, there is an additional flow of calls called out-portfolio
   flow. It is shown that this feature makes the new organization even more
   efficient.

AB This paper studies the influence of supply-side and demand-side factors
   on the compensation of information technology (IT) professionals and
   considers the human capital and institutional explanations. We focus on
   returns to an MBA and the IT-related experience of IT professionals and
   use the largest data set of IT professionals that has been compiled to
   date in the United States to answer our research questions. We find that
   firms pay a significant premium for an MBA. Although firms value the IT
   experience of IT professionals, they value an MBA significantly more.
   The results of this study cast doubt on the belief that IT skills have a
   large firm-specific component. Although IT experience is valued more
   than non-IT experience for IT professionals, firms value IT experience
   at other firms much more than they value firm-specific IT experience.
   Likewise, contrary to popular perception, we do not find evidence for
   complementarities between an MBA education and IT experience. Among
   institutional effects, firms in IT and IT-intensive industries pay
   significantly more to IT professionals than do other firms, and dot-com
   firms also paid a significant premium in 1999 and 2000. However, these
   firms do not value an MBA or firm-specific IT experience any more than
   other firms. We discuss the implications of these findings for further
   research, for firms' compensation practices, and for individual IT
   professionals.

AB This paper characterizes optimal pay-performance sensitivities of
   compensation contracts for managers who have private information about
   their skills, and those skills affect their outside employment
   opportunities. The model presumes that the rate at which a manager's
   opportunity wage increases in his expertise depends on the nature of
   that expertise, i.e., whether it is general or-firm specific. The
   analysis demonstrates that when managerial expertise is largely firm
   specific (general), the optimal pay-performance sensitivity is lower
   (higher) than its optimal value in a benchmark setting of symmetric
   information. Furthermore, when managerial skills are largely firm
   specific (general), the optimal pay-performance sensitivity decreases
   (increases) as managerial skills become a more important determinant of
   firm performance. Unlike the standard agency-theoretic prediction of a
   negative trade-off between risk and pay-performance sensitivity, this
   paper identifies plausible circumstances under which risk and incentives
   are positively associated. In addition to providing an explanation for
   why: empirical tests of risk-incentive relationships hive produced mixed
   results, the analysis generates insights that can be useful in guiding
   future empirical research.

AB Most online feedback mechanisms rely on voluntary reporting of privately
   observed outcomes. This introduces the potential for reporting bias, a
   situation where traders exhibit different propensities to report
   different outcome types to the system. Unless properly accounted for,
   reporting bias may severely distort the distribution of public feedback
   relative to the underlying distribution of private transaction outcomes
   and, thus, hamper the reliability of feedback mechanisms. This study
   offers a method that allows users of feedback mechanisms where both
   partners of a bilateral exchange are allowed to report their
   satisfaction to "see through" the distortions introduced by reporting
   bias and derive unbiased estimates of the underlying distribution of
   privately observed outcomes. A key aspect of our method lies in
   extracting information from the number of transactions where one or both
   trading partners choose to remain silent. We apply our method to a large
   data set of eBay feedback. Our results support the widespread belief
   that eBay traders are more likely to post feedback when satisfied than
   when dissatisfied and are consistent with the presence of positive and
   negative reciprocation among eBay traders. Most importantly, our
   analysis derives unbiased estimates of the risks that are associated
   with trading on eBay that, we believe, are more realistic than those
   suggested by a naive interpretation of the unusually high (>99%) levels
   of positive feedback currently found on that system.

AB As a new type of word-of-mouth information, online consumer product
   review is an emerging market phenomenon that is playing an increasingly
   important role in consumers' purchase decisions. This paper argues that
   online consumer review, a type of product information created by users
   based on personal usage experience, can serve as a new element in the
   marketing communications mix and work as free "sales assistants" to help
   consumers identify the products that best match their idiosyncratic
   usage conditions.
   This paper develops a normative model to address several important
   strategic issues related to consumer reviews. First, we show when and
   how the seller should adjust its own marketing communication strategy in
   response to consumer reviews. Our results reveal that if the review
   information is sufficiently informative, the two types of product
   information, i.e., the seller-created product attribute information and
   buyer-created review information, will interact with each other. For
   example, when the product cost is low and/or there are sufficient expert
   (more sophisticated) product users, the two types of information are
   complements, and the seller's best response is to increase the amount of
   product attribute information conveyed via its marketing communications
   after the reviews become available. However, when the product cost is
   high and there are sufficient novice (less sophisticated) product users,
   the two types of information are substitutes, and the seller's best
   response is to reduce the amount of product attribute information it
   offers, even if it is cost-free to provide such information. We also
   derive precise conditions under which the seller can increase its profit
   by adopting a proactive strategy, i.e., adjusting its marketing
   strategies even before consumer reviews become available. Second, we
   identify product/market conditions under which the seller benefits from
   facilitating such buyer-created information(e.g., by allowing consumers
   to post user-based product reviews on the seller's website). Finally, we
   illustrate the importance of the timing of the introduction of consumer
   reviews available as a strategic variable and show that delaying the
   availability of consumer reviews for a given product can be beneficial
   if the number of expert (more sophisticated) product users is relatively
   large and cost of the product is low.

AB Tournaments of heterogeneous candidates can be thought of as
   probabilistic mechanisms that select high-quality agents. We quantify
   the efficiency of such selection by the likelihood of selecting the best
   player, here termed the "predictive power." We study three widely used
   tournament formats: contests, binary elimination tournaments, and
   round-robin tournaments. Using a simple model, we demonstrate
   analytically, and through simulations, how the predictive power of these
   formats depends on the number of players,noise level, and distribution
   of players' types. We also present the results of exploratory
   simulations for two alternative criteria of selection efficiency: the
   expected ability of the winner and the expected rank of the winner. All
   three criteria may exhibit unexpected nonmonotonic behavior as functions
   of the number of players and/or noise level. We discuss the conditions
   under which different types of behavior should be expected, and their
   implications for managerial decisions.

   corporate venturing for reasons other than, capturing these returns.
   First, higher venturing returns increase managerial compensation, to
   which firms respond by increasing incentives. Managers increase effort,
   prompting firms to reallocate them to new ventures, where the marginal
   product of effort is highest. Second, as returns to venturing become
   large, corporate venturing emerges as a way to recruit/retain managers
   who would otherwise choose alternative employment. We derive several

AB Coproduction systems, in which multiple products are produced
   simultaneously in a single production run, are prevalent in many
   industries. Such systems typically produce a random quantity of
   vertically differentiated products. This product hierarchy enables the
   firm to fill demand for a lower-quality product by converting a
   higher-quality product. In addition to the challenges presented by
   random yields and multiple products, coproduction systems often serve
   multiple customer classes that differ in their product valuations.
   Furthermore, the sizes of these classes are uncertain, Employing a
   utility-maximizing customer model, we investigate the production,
   pricing, downconversion, and allocation decisions in a two-class,
   stochastic-demand, stochastic-yield coproduction system. For the
   single-class case, we establish that downconversion will not occur if
   prices are set optimally. In contrast, we show that downconversion can
   be optimal in the two-class case, even if prices are set optimally. We
   consider the benefit of postponing certain operational decisions, e.g.,
   the pricing or allocation-rule decisions, until after uncertainties are
   resolved. We use the term recourse to denote actions taken after
   uncertainties have been resolved. We find that recourse pricing benefits
   the firm much more than either downconversion or recourse allocation do,
   implying that recourse demand management is more valuable than recourse
   supply management. Special cases of our model include the single-class
   and two-class random-yield newsvendor models.

AB In this paper, we develop a simultaneous model of consumer brand choice
   and negotiated price in the highly relevant marketing context of
   automobile transactions. Consumer brand choice is modeled as a
   multinomial probabilistic outcome, and the individual consumer-level
   transaction price is modeled to be consistent with the Nash bargaining
   solution. Our simultaneous model introduces a natural way to account for
   price endogeneity in a microlevel choice setting when the price paid is
   individual specific and correlated with the idiosyncratic preference of
   a buyer. It also accounts for the potential selectivity bias in studying
   the negotiated price by integrating consumer brand choice modeling. We
   apply the proposed model to a data set of 4,795 consumer automobile
   purchases. The empirical results show that the proposed approach not
   only better fits the data of consumer choice and negotiated price, but
   it also provides additional insights into buyers' and sellers' behaviors
   in comparison with models that study only consumer choice or the
   negotiated price, but not both simultaneously.

AB Queueing systems with scheduled arrivals, i.e., appointment systems, are
   typical for frontal service systems, e.g., health clinics. An aspect of
   customer behavior that influences the overall efficiency of such systems
   is the phenomenon of no-shows. The consequences of no-shows cannot be
   underestimated; e.g., British surveys reveal that in the United Kingdom
   alone more than 12 million general practitioner (GP) appointments are
   missed every year, costing the British health service an estimated 250
   pound million annually. In this study we answer the following key
   questions: How should the schedule be computed when there are no-shows?
   Is it sufficiently accurate to use a schedule designed for the same
   expected number of customers without no-shows? How important is it to
   invest in efforts that reduce no-shows-i.e., given that we apply a
   schedule that takes no-shows into consideration, is the existence of
   no-shows still costly to the server and customers?

AB Value-at-Risk (VaR) is one of the most widely accepted risk measures in

   VaR remains a very difficult problem. We propose a computationally
   tractable approximation method for minimizing the VaR of a portfolio
   based on robust optimization techniques. The method results in the
   optimization of a modified VaR measure, Asymmetry-Robust VaR (ARVaR),
   that takes into consideration asymmetries in the distributions of
   returns and is coherent, which makes it desirable from a financial
   theory perspective. We show that ARVaR approximates the Conditional VaR
   of the portfolio as well. Numerical experiments with simulated and real
   market data indicate that the proposed approach results in lower
   realized portfolio VaR, better efficient frontier, and lower maximum
   realized portfolio loss than alternative approaches for quantile-based
   portfolio risk minimization.

AB W e consider a scenario in which a large equipment manufacturer wishes
   to outsource the work involved in repairing purchased goods while under
   warranty. Several external service vendors are available for this work.
   We develop models and analyses to support decisions concerning how
   responsibility for the warranty population should be divided between
   them. These also allow the manufacturer to resolve related questions
   concerning, for example, whether the service capacities of the
   contracted vendors are sufficient to deliver an effective post-sales
   service. Static allocation models yield information concerning the
   proportions of the warranty population for which the vendors should be
   responsible overall. Dynamic allocation models enable consideration of
   how such overall workloads might be delivered to the vendors over time
   in a way which avoids excessive variability in the repair burden. We
   apply dynamic programming policy improvement to develop an effective
   dynamic allocation heuristic. This is evaluated numerically and is also
   used as a yardstick to assess two simple allocation heuristics suggested
   by static models. A dynamic greedy allocation heuristic is found to
   perform well. Dividing the workload equally among vendors with different
   service capacities can lead to serious losses.

AB This paper proposes using nonlinear mixed-integer programming to solve
   the customized bundle-pricing problem in which consumers are allowed to
   choose up to N goods out of a larger pool of J goods. Prior work has
   suggested that this mechanism has attractive features for the pricing of
   information and other low-marginal cost goods. Although closed-form
   solutions exist for this problem for certain cases of consumer
   preferences, many interesting scenarios cannot be easily handled without
   a numerical solution procedure. In this paper, we investigate the
   efficiency gains created by customized bundling over the alternatives of
   pure bundling or individual sale under different assumptions about
   customer preferences and firm cost structure, as well as the potential
   loss of efficiency caused by pricing with incomplete information about
   consumer reservation values. Our analysis suggests that customized
   bundling enhances sellers' profits and enhances welfare when consumers
   do not place positive values on all goods, and that this consumer
   characteristic is much more important than the shape of the valuation
   distribution in determining the optimal pricing scheme. We also find
   that customized bundling outperforms both pure bundling and individual
   sale in the presence of incomplete information, and that customized
   bundling still outperforms other simpler pricing schemes evert when
   exact consumer valuations are not known ex ante.

   Management Sci. 50(4) 445-457) claimed that retailers prefer
   vendor-managed inventory (VMI) because it restores competition among
   manufacturers and encourages them to maintain a higher stock of their
   own brand under VMI than would be maintained under retailer-managed
   inventory (RMI). This paper shows that these results do not hold in
   general: each manufacturer's stocking level may be higher under RMI than
   under VMI and the retailer may lose by adopting VMI depending on the
   profit margin of the, retailer relative to that of the manufacturers,
   the magnitude of the holding costs, and the intensity of brand
   competition. Numerical examples show that the effect of brand
   competition on the system is not so significant and the transfer of
   holding cost to the vendor is the key incentive for the retailer's

AB Traditional inventory models, with a few exceptions, do not account for
   the existence of inventory record inaccuracy (IRI), and those that do
   treat IRI as random. This study explores IRI observed both within and
   across product categories and retail stores. Examining nearly 370,000
   inventory records from 37 stores of one retailer, we find 65% to be
   inaccurate. We characterize the distribution of IRI and show, using
   hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), that 26.4% of the total variance in
   IRI lies between product categories and that 2.7% lies between stores.
   We identify several factors that mitigate record inaccuracy, such as
   inventory auditing practices, and several factors that exacerbate record
   inaccuracy, such as the complexity of the store environment and the
   distribution structure. Collectively, these covariates explain 67.6% and
   69.0% of the variance in IRI across stores and product categories,
   respectively. Our findings underscore the need to design processes to
   reduce the occurrence of IRI and highlight factors that can be
   incorporated into inventory planning tools developed to account for its
   presence.

AB Software vulnerabilities represent a serious threat to cybersecurity,
   most cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, there is
   no agreed-upon policy for their disclosure. Disclosure policy (which
   sets a protected period given to a vendor to release the patch for the
   vulnerability) indirectly affects the speed and quality of the patch
   that a vendor develops. Thus, CERT/CC and similar bodies acting in the
   public interest can use disclosure to influence the behavior of vendors
   and reduce social cost. This paper develops a framework to analyze the
   optimal timing of disclosure. We formulate a model involving a social
   planner who sets the disclosure policy and a vendor who decides on the
   patch release. We show that the vendor typically releases the patch less
   expeditiously than is socially optimal. The social planner optimally
   shrinks the protected period to push the vendor to deliver the patch
   more quickly, and sometimes the patch release time coincides with
   disclosure. We extend the model to allow the proportion of users
   implementing patches to depend upon the quality (chosen by the vendor)
   of the patch. We show that a longer protected period does not always
   result in a better patch quality. Another extension allows for some
   fraction of users to use "work-arounds." We show that the possibility of
   work-arounds can provide the social planner with more leverage, and
   hence the social planner shrinks the protected period. Interestingly,
   the possibility of work-arounds can sometimes increase the social cost
   due to the negative externalities imposed by the users who are able to
   use the work-arounds on the users who are not.

AB Patch management is a crucial component of information security
   management. An important problem within this context from a vendor's
   perspective is to determine how to release patches to fix
   vulnerabilities in its software. From a firm's perspective, the issue is
   how to update vulnerable systems with available patches. In this paper,
   we develop a game-theoretic model to study the strategic interaction
   between a vendor and a firm in balancing the costs and benefits of patch
   management. Our objective is to examine the consequences of time-driven
   release and update policies. We first study a centralized system in a
   benchmark scenario to find the socially optimal time-driven patch
   management. We show that the social loss is minimized when patch-release
   and update cycles are synchronized. Next, we consider a decentralized
   system in which the vendor determines its patch-release policy and the
   firm selects its patch-update policy in a Stackelberg framework,
   assuming that release and update policies are either time driven or
   event driven. We develop a sufficient condition that guarantees that a
   time-driven release by the vendor and a time-driven update by the firm
   is the equilibrium outcome for patch management. However, in this
   equilibrium, the patch-update cycle of the firm may not be synchronized
   with the patch-release cycle of the vendor, making it impossible to
   achieve the socially optimal patch management in the decentralized
   system. Therefore, we next examine cost sharing and liability as
   possible coordination mechanisms. Our analysis shows that cost sharing
   itself may achieve synchronization and social optimality However,
   liability by itself cannot achieve social optimality unless
   patch-release and update cycles are already synchronized without
   introducing any liability. Our results also demonstrate that cost
   sharing and liability neither complement nor substitute each other.
   Finally, we show that an incentive-compatible contract on cost sharing
   can be designed to achieve coordination in case of information
   asymmetry.

AB The format of pricing contracts varies substantially across business
   contexts, a major variable being whether a contract imposes a fixed fee
   payment. This paper examines how the use of the fixed fee in pricing
   contracts affects market outcomes of a manufacturer-retailer channel.
   Standard economic theories predict that channel efficiency increases
   with the introduction of the fixed fee and is invariant to its framing.
   We conduct a laboratory experiment to test these predictions.
   Surprisingly, the introduction of the fixed fee fails to increase
   channel efficiency. Moreover, the framing of the fixed fee does make a
   difference: an opaque frame as quantity discounts achieves higher
   channel efficiency than a salient frame as a two-part tariff, although
   these two contractual formats are theoretically equivalent.
   To account for these anomalies, we generalize the standard economic
   model by allowing the retailer's utilities to be reference dependent so
   that the up-front fixed fee payment is perceived as a loss and the
   subsequent retail profits as a gain. We embed this reference-dependent
   utility function in a quantal response equilibrium framework where the
   retailer is allowed to make decision mistakes due to computational
   complexity The key prediction of this behavioral model is that channel
   efficiency decreases with loss aversion for sufficiently Nash-rational
   retailers. Consistent with this prediction, the estimated loss-aversion
   coefficient is 1.37 in the two-part tariff condition, significantly
   higher than 1.27 in the quantity discount condition. At the same time,
   loss aversion dominates contract complexity in explaining the data.
   Lastly, we conduct a follow-up experiment to confirm the central role of
   loss aversion as a behavioral driver. In one condition, the retailer
   becomes less loss averse when we temporally compress the fixed fee
   payment and the realization of retail profits, which supports the loss
   aversion theory. In the other condition, the retailer's contract
   acceptance rate does not decline when we reward the manufacturer a
   higher cash payment for each experimental point earned, which rules out
   the competing hypothesis that the retailer rejects contract offers due
   to fairness concerns.

AB We investigate contracting and information sharing in two competing
   supply chains, each consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. The
   two supply chains are identical, except they may have different
   investment costs for information sharing. The problem is studied using a
   two-stage game. In the first stage, the manufacturers decide whether to
   invest in information sharing. In the second stage, given the
   information structure created in the first stage, the manufacturers
   offer contracts to their retailers and the retailers engage in Cournot
   competition. We analyze the game for two different contract types. For
   the case of contract menus, a supply chain that does not have
   information sharing will lower its selling quantities because of the
   negative quantity distortions in the contract menus, thus creating a
   strategic disadvantage in Cournot competition. The value of information
   sharing to a supply chain is positive, and the dominant strategy of each
   supply chain is to invest in information sharing when the investment
   costs are low. We fully characterize the equilibrium information sharing
   decisions under different investment costs. For the case of linear price
   contracts, the value of information sharing,to a supply chain becomes
   negative, and the dominant strategy of each supply chain is not to
   invest in information sharing regardless of investment costs. Our
   results highlight the importance of contract type as a driver of the
   value of information sharing and the role of information sharing
   capability as a source of competitive advantage under supply chain
   competition.

AB This paper considers inventory models with advance demand information
   and flexible delivery. Customers place their orders in advance, and
   delivery is flexible in the sense that early shipment is allowed.
   Specifically, an order placed at time t by a customer with demand lead
   time T should be fulfilled by period t + T; failure to fulfill it within
   the time window [t, t + T] is penalized. We consider two situations: (1)
   Customer demand lead times are homogeneous and demand arriving in period
   t is a scalar d(t) to be satisfied within T periods. We show that
   state-dependent (s, S) policies are optimal, where the state represents
   advance demands outside the supply lead-time horizon. We find that
   increasing the demand lead time is more beneficial than decreasing the
   supply lead time. (2) Customers are heterogeneous in their demand lead
   times. In this case, demands are vectors and may exhibit crossover,
   necessitating an allocation decision in addition to the ordering
   decision. We develop a lower-bound approximation based on an allocation
   assumption, and propose protection-level heuristics that yield upper
   bounds on the optimal cost. Numerical analysis quantifies the optimality
   gaps of the heuristics (2% on average for the best heuristic) and the
   benefit of delivery flexibility (14% on average using the best
   heuristic), and provides insights into when the heuristics perform the
   best and when flexibility is most beneficial.

AB In this paper, we study a decentralized assembly system consisting of a
   single assembler who buys complementary components from independent
   suppliers under two contracting schemes: push and pull. In both schemes,
   the component suppliers are allowed to freely form coalitions (or
   alliances) among themselves to better coordinate their pricing or
   production decisions. We show that the sole driver of the inefficiency
   in a push system, which is due to horizontal decentralization of
   suppliers, is the number of alliances that were formed. Specifically, it
   is shown that in a push system, the assembler's profit, the total profit
   of all suppliers and the consumers' surplus are all decreasing in the
   number of coalitions, and are thus maximized when the grand coalition is
   formed. We further carry out a stability analysis of coalition
   structures to verify to what extent suppliers can reduce or eliminate
   the inefficiency due to their decentralization by forming alliances. We
   show that in a push system with more than two suppliers and a power
   demand distribution, myopic suppliers would act independently, resulting
   with a least efficient channel, which makes all channel members, as well
   as the end consumers, worse off. On the other hand, we prove that
   farsighted suppliers would form the grand coalition and thus be able to
   completely eliminate the inefficiency stemming from their
   decentralization. Finally, it is shown that, in contrast to a push
   system, in a pull system the suppliers can easily coordinate their
   production quantities to eliminate the inefficiency due to their
   decentralization.

AB We consider the problem in which several products have to be shipped
   from a supplier to a set of retailers over an infinite time horizon.
   Each product is made available at the supplier and absorbed by each
   retailer at given constant production and consumption rates. For each
   product, the unit inventory cost at the supplier is equal to the unit
   inventory cost at the retailers. Shipments can be performed in each
   discrete time instant by a fleet of vehicles of given transportation
   capacity and routing is allowed. The aim is to determine shipping
   policies that minimize the sum of transportation cost and inventory cost
   both at the supplier and at the retailers. We study direct shipping
   policies, i.e., policies in which each retailer is served independently.
   We show the worst-case performance of the best single, best double, best
   triple, best frequency-based, and optimal direct shipping policies. In
   each of these policies each link is optimized independently. We prove
   that, in the worst case, the ratio between the cost of the optimal
   direct shipping policy and the optimal cost of the problem in which
   routing is allowed-i.e., the worst-case performance bound of this
   policy-is not greater than two whenever the unit volume on each link is
   not lower than 1/4 of the vehicle capacity. Moreover, if the unit volume
   is not lower than the capacity, the bound is about 1.21. These bounds
   are tight and obtained by applying frequency-based policies that make
   use of at most three different shipping frequencies and cannot be
   improved by allowing more frequencies or using time-based policies on
   each link. Computational results show that the best among the
   frequency-based direct shipping policies used to obtain the worst-case
   results gives an average percent increase error, with respect to a lower
   bound on the optimal cost of the problem in which routing is allowed, of
   6.44% on a large set of randomly generated problem instances.

AB To motivate buyers to increase their order quantity, suppliers often
   rely on a well-established and widely used approach-they offer quantity
   discounts. This practice is in large part driven to obtain improved
   economies in transportation through higher truckload utilization.
   Recently, transportation rates, which are increasing faster than other
   costs, have become a larger portion of total net landed cost, placing
   the traditional quantity-discount practices under scrutiny. Many
   suppliers are left perplexed as to why their approach is not effective
   anymore, and some are even concerned that their overall profits may have
   actually decreased due to their discount parameters. In this paper, we
   study a multiperiod model, with a buyer facing stochastic end-item
   demand and a supplier offering an all-units quantity discount to him, to
   understand better the dynamics of such systems. We provide guidelines
   and insights on how to set effective discount parameters, and when not
   to expect much from them. We derive the optimal policy of the buyer,
   develop insights as to why the policy is complex, study the supplier's
   profit as a function of her offered quantity-discount scheme
   (accommodating the buyer's optimal policy), and discover a new
   phenomenon that is distinct and structurally different from the
   well-known bullwhip effect.

   are possible in this auction format. A winner of the auction may regret
   paying too much relative to the second highest bid, and a loser may
   regret missing an opportunity to win at a favorable price. In theory,
   under very general conditions, being sensitive to winning and paying too
   much should result in lower average bids, and being sensitive to missing
   opportunities to win at a favorable price should result in higher bids.
   For example, the U.S. Government's policy of revealing losing bids may
   cause regret-sensitive bidders to anticipate regret and bid
   conservatively, decreasing the government's revenue. We test these
   predictions in the laboratory and find strong support for both.

AB New products are often launched sequentially, by different firms, and
   the purchasing decisions are sometimes made by dyads. This paper
   proposes a new model that explicitly considers dyadic decision making in
   drug prescription and allows assessment of the relative influence that
   physicians and patients have in making decisions concerning new as well
   as existing ethical drugs. Modeling sequentially launched competing
   products in a category allows for parsing out effects that are hard to
   differentiate in models designed to capture only a single product's
   dynamics. The proposed model is applied to prescription drug data sets
   in the pharmaceutical industry, and it also explicitly captures both
   physicians' and patients' pretrial and posttrial utilities of each drug
   in the therapeutic category. Based on the model's fit and out-of-sample
   forecasting performance, we find that, in many cases, the incorporation
   of the dyadic decision making leads to better performance vis-A-vis
   models where such decision making is not explicitly considered. We also
   find that in many cases the posttrial utility of a drug is greater than
   its corresponding pretrial utility, lending partial empirical support to
   the prevailing industry practice of spending on various activities
   (e.g., sampling to physicians) needed to get potential patients to try a
   new drug. The proposed model enables managers to predict in advance the
   sales of sequentially launched new drugs and plan the new product launch
   and strategy accordingly. The model is also applicable to other product
   categories involving more than a single decision maker, including
   business-to-business products (e.g., office equipment) as well as to
   products targeting children (e.g., toys).

AB One of the goals of psychological research on subjective probability

   judgments. In this paper, our aim is to reduce partition dependence, a
   judgmental bias that arises from the particular way in which a state
   space is partitioned for the purposes of making probability judgments.
   We explore a property of subjective probabilities called interior
   additivity (IA). Our story begins with a psychological model of
   subjective probability judgment that exhibits IA. The model is a linear

AB This research examines how certain economic incentives can lead agents
   to prefer difficult solutions to their organizational tasks that reduce
   their likelihood of obtaining a successful task outcome. Drawing on the
   career concerns literature, I model a decision context in which agents
   have the operational autonomy to choose among different solutions.
   Analyzing this model reveals that agents with career concerns will,
   under certain conditions, deliberately reduce their likelihood of
   succeeding with a task by choosing a solution that makes their task more
   difficult. These findings suggest that highly capable agents prefer
   moderately difficult tasks to showcase their capability, while
   less-capable agents prefer highly difficult tasks to mask their lack of
   capability. The robustness of these results is examined in various
   extensions. Furthermore, the paper provides insights on how incentives
   can be designed to alleviate this problem.

   attempts by private firms to commercialize inventions licensed from the

   explore the influence of several appropriability mechanisms on the
   commercialization and termination of projects to develop products based
   on university inventions. Our central hypothesis is that the
   relationship between a licensee's decision to either terminate or
   commercialize the invention is driven by the current market value of the
   invention, as well as the option value of delaying its
   commercialization. We use a competing risks framework that allows for
   nonparametric heterogeneity and correlated risks. We find that better
   appropriability in the sense of more effective patent strength and
   secrecy has a strong negative effect on the hazard of license
   termination. The effectiveness of learning has a strong positive effect
   on the hazard of technology commercialization, while lead time has a
   negative effect.

AB Developing the "right" new products is critical to firm success and is
   often cited as a key competitive dimension. This paper explores new
   product development (NPD) portfolio strategy and the balance between
   incremental and radical innovation. We characterize innovative effort
   through a normative theoretical framework that addresses a popular
   practice in NPD portfolio management: the use of strategic buckets.
   Strategic buckets encourage the division of the overall NPD resource
   budget into smaller, more focused budgets that are defined by the type
   of innovative effort (incremental or radical). We show that time
   commitment determines the balance between incremental and radical
   innovation. When managers execute this balance, they are often
   confounded by (i) environmental complexity, defined as the number of
   unknown interdependencies among technology and market parameters that
   determine product performance; and (ii) environmental instability, the
   probability of changes to the underlying performance functions. Although
   both of these factors confound managers, we find that they have
   completely opposite effects on the NPD portfolio balance. Environmental
   complexity shifts the balance toward radical innovation. Conversely,
   environmental instability shifts the balance toward incremental
   innovation. Risk considerations and implications for theory and practice
   are also discussed.

AB Component sharing-the use of a component on multiple products within a
   firm's product line-is widely practiced as a means of offering high
   variety at low cost. Although many researchers have examined tradeoffs
   involved in component sharing, little research has focused on the impact
   of component sharing on quality. In this paper, we examine how component
   sharing impacts one dimension of quality-reliability-defined as mean
   time to failure. Design considerations suggest that a component designed
   uniquely for a product will result in higher reliability due to the
   better fit of the component within the architecture of the product. On
   the other hand, the learning curve literature suggests that greater
   experience with a component can improve conformance quality, and can
   increase reliability via learning from end-user feedback. The
   engineering literature suggests that improved conformance in turn
   increases reliability. Sharing a component across multiple products
   increases experience, and hence, should increase reliability. Using data
   from the automotive industry, we find support for the hypothesis that
   higher component reliability is associated with higher cumulative
   experience with a component. Further, we find support for the hypothesis
   that higher component reliability is associated with a component that
   has been designed uniquely for a product. This finding suggests that the
   popular design strategy of component sharing can in some cases
   compromise product quality, via reduced reliability.

AB Modularity has been heralded as an organizational and technical
   architecture that enhances incremental and modular innovation. Less
   attention has been paid to the possible implications of modular
   architectures for imitation. To understand the implications of modular
   designs for competitive advantage, one must consider the dual impact of
   modularity on innovation and imitation jointly. In an attempt to do so,
   we set up three alternative structures that vary in the extent of
   modularity and hence in the extent of design complexity: nonmodular,
   modular, and nearly modular designs. In each structure, we examine the
   trade-offs between innovation benefits and imitation deterrence. The
   results of our computational experiments indicate that modularization
   enables performance gains through innovation but, at the same time, sets
   the stage for those gains to be eroded through imitation. In contrast,
   performance differences between the leaders and imitators persist in the
   nearly modular and the nonmodular structures. Overall, we find that
   design complexity poses a significant trade-off between innovation
   benefits (i.e., generating superior strategies that create performance
   differences) and imitation deterrence (i.e., preserving the performance
   differences). We also examine the robustness of our results to
   variations in imitation accuracy. In addition to documenting the overall
   robustness of our principal finding, the ancillary analyses provide a
   more nuanced rendering of the relationship between the architecture of
   complexity and imitation efforts.

AB ast research in new product development (NPD) has conceptualized
   prototyping as a " design- build- testanalyze" cycle to emphasize the
   importance of the analysis of test results in guiding the decisions made
   during the experimentation process. New product designs often involve
   complex architectures and incorporate numerous components, and this
   makes the ex ante assessment of their performance dif. cult. Still,
   design teams often learn from test outcomes during iterative test cycles
   enabling them to infer valuable information about the performances of
   (as yet) untested designs. We conceptualize the extent of useful
   learning from analysis of a test outcome as depending on two key
   structural characteristics of the design space, namely whether the set
   of designs are " close" to each other (i. e., the designs are similar on
   an attribute level) and whether the design attributes exhibit nontrivial
   interactions (i. e., the performance function is complex).
   This study explicitly considers the design space structure and the
   resulting correlations among design performances, and examines their
   implications for learning. We derive the optimal dynamic testing policy,
   and we analyze its qualitative properties. Our results suggest optimal
   continuation only when the previous test outcomes lie between two
   thresholds. Outcomes below the lower threshold indicate an overall low
   performing design space and, consequently, continued testing is
   suboptimal. Test outcomes above the upper threshold, on the other hand,
   merit termination because they signal to the design team that the
   likelihood of obtaining a design with a still higher performance (given
   the experimentation cost) is low. We find that accounting for the design
   space structure splits the experimentation process into two phases: the
   initial exploration phase, in which the design team focuses on obtaining
   information about the design space, and the subsequent exploitation
   phase in which the design team, given their understanding of the design
   space, focuses on obtaining a "good enough" configuration. Our analysis
   also provides useful contingency-based guidelines for managerial action
   as information gets revealed through the testing cycle. Finally, we
   extend the optimal policy to account for design spaces that contain
   distinct design subclasses.

AB This paper considers the impact of the intellectual property (IP) system
   on the timing of cooperation/licensing by start-up technology
   entrepreneurs. If the market for technology licenses is efficient, the
   timing of licensing is independent of whether IP has already been
   granted. In contrast, the need to disclose complementary (yet
   unprotected) knowledge, asymmetric information or search costs may
   retard efficient technology transfer. In these cases, reductions in
   uncertainty surrounding the scope and extent of IP rights may facilitate
   trade in the market for ideas. We employ a data set combining
   information about cooperative licensing and the timing of patent
   allowances (the administrative event when patent rights are clarified).
   Although preallowance licensing does occur, the hazard rate for
   achieving a cooperative licensing agreement significantly increases
   after patent allowance. Moreover, the impact of the patent system
   depends on the strategic and institutional environment in which firms
   operate. Patent allowance plays a particularly important role for
   technologies with longer technology life cycles or that lack alternative
   appropriation mechanisms such as copyright, reputation, or brokers. The
   findings suggest that imperfections in the market for ideas may be
   important, and that formal IP rights may facilitate gains from
   technological trade.

AB When is it better to use agent-based (AB) models, and when should
   differential equation (DE) models be used? Whereas DE models assume
   homogeneity and perfect mixing within compartments, AB models can
   capture heterogeneity across individuals and in the network of
   interactions among them. AB models relax aggregation assumptions, but
   entail computational and cognitive costs that may limit sensitivity
   analysis and model scope. Because resources are limited, the costs and
   benefits of such disaggregation should guide the choice of models for
   policy analysis. Using contagious disease as an example, we contrast the
   dynamics of a stochastic AB model with those of the analogous
   deterministic compartment DE model. We examine the impact of individual
   heterogeneity and different network topologies, including fully
   connected, random, Watts-Strogatz small world, scale-free, and lattice
   networks. Obviously, deterministic models yield a single trajectory for
   each parameter set, while stochastic models yield a distribution of
   outcomes. More interestingly, the DE and mean AB dynamics differ for
   several metrics relevant to public health, including diffusion speed,
   peak load on health services infrastructure, and total disease burden.
   The response of the models to policies can also differ even when their
   base case behavior is similar. In some conditions, however, these
   differences in means are small compared to variability caused by
   stochastic events, parameter uncertainty, and model boundary. We discuss
   implications for the choice among model types, focusing on policy
   design. The results apply beyond epidemiology: from innovation adoption
   to financial panics, many important social phenomena involve analogous
   processes of diffusion and social contagion.

   difficult environment in which to value options than when the underlying
   is a security. There is no initial revenue, and cumulative revenue
   cannot decrease. Revenues from innovations are characterized by
   different lives and different rates of the resolution of uncertainty. A
   common deterministic model for predicting revenue from an innovation is
   known as the Bass model. We embed the Bass model in a gamma process,
   resulting in a stochastic process with moments proportional to the mean
   of the Bass model. To illustrate this model we choose the valuation of
   options on movie box office revenue. These options enable film
   distributors to manage the risk of a movie, and they offer

   become available. Call prices obtained using the maximum likelihood (ML)
   parameter estimates from the full data set closely approximate the

AB This paper provides insights about when versioning is an optimal
   strategy for information goods. Our characterization of this class of
   goods is that variable costs are invariant with quality, including the
   special case of zero variable costs. Our analysis assumes a monopoly
   firm that has an existing product in the market and has an opportunity
   to segment the market by introducing additional lower-quality versions.
   We derive a simple decision rule for determining the optimality of
   versioning based on the solution to a single-product maximization
   problem. Versioning is optimal when the optimal market share of the
   lower-quality version, offered alone, is greater than the optimal market
   share of the high-quality version, offered alone. A firm can profitably
   employ versioning for an information good if it can design the lower
   quality in a way that, relative to their valuations for the high-end
   version, high-type consumers have a lower relative valuation for the
   lower quality than do low-type consumers. When variable costs increase,
   a firm that offered only one product version need not consider adding
   another version. When variable costs decrease, the firm should explore
   adding a lower-quality version.

   Using this framing proxy, we show that investors who execute more

AB While research on the cost effectiveness of standardization to date has
   focused on the impact of different degrees of standardization, it has
   paid insufficient attention to the process an organization uses to
   formulate and implement standardized procedures. Drawing on the
   organizational decision-making literature and procedural fairness
   literature, this study identifies a number of key process features in
   standardization and argues that variations in these process features
   across organizations help account for the varying success of
   standardization in achieving cost effectiveness. Using hospital drug
   standardization for coronary artery and pneumonia cases to ground much
   of the argument, I analyzed inpatient discharge data from Florida,
   Illinois, New York, and Texas, combined with an original survey of 243
   hospital pharmacy directors. The results indicated that an increasing
   degree of standardization was associated with cost effectiveness when
   the level of formal objectivity in creating the standardized procedure
   was high and when there was due process in resolving disputes about the
   standardized procedure. This finding broadly supports the argument that
   the cost effectiveness of standardization depends not just on the degree
   of standardization but also on the process by which the standardized
   procedures are created and implemented.

AB Motivated by the medical literature findings that physicians are
   inertial, we seek to understand (1) whether physicians exhibit
   structural persistence in drug choice (structural persistence occurs
   when the drug chosen for a patient depends structurally on the drug
   previously prescribed by the physician to other patients) and (2)
   whether persistence, if present, is a physician-specific characteristic
   or a physician state that can change over time. We further explore the
   role of promotional tools on persistence and drug choice, and we
   investigate whether physicians who exhibit persistence respond
   differently to three forms of sales promotion: one-to-one meetings
   (detailing), out-of-office meetings, and symposium meetings.
   Our results show significant levels of physician persistence in drug
   choice. We find that persistence is mostly a cross-sectional physician
   feature. Nonpersistent physicians appear to be responsive to detailing
   and symposium meetings, whereas persistent physicians seem to be
   responsive only to symposium meetings. Out-of-office meetings, such as
   golf or lunch, have no effect on physicians' drug choice. We also find
   that (1) older physicians and those who work in smaller practices are
   more likely to be persistent and (2) physicians who are more willing to
   receive sales force representatives have a lower likelihood of being
   persistent. Finally, we discuss implications for public policy from our
   rich set of results.

AB We introduce the concept of marketing avoidance-consumer efforts to
   conceal themselves and to deflect marketing. The setting is one in which
   sellers market some item through solicitations to potential consumers,
   who differ in their benefit from the item and suffer harm from receiving
   solicitations. Concealment by one consumer induces sellers to shift
   solicitations to other consumers, whereas deflection does not.
   Solicitations cause two externalities: direct harm on consumers and the
   (indirect) cost of consumer concealment and deflection. We find that in
   markets where the marginal cost of solicitation is sufficiently low,
   efforts by low-benefit consumers to conceal themselves will increase the
   cost-effectiveness of solicitations and lead sellers to market more.
   However, concealment by high-benefit consumers leads sellers to market
   less. Furthermore, concealment by low-benefit consumers increases direct
   privacy harm, and consumer welfare is higher with deflection than
   concealment. Finally, it is optimal to impose a charge on solicitations.

AB Sales presentations are the core of the selling process where
   salespeople provide information to prospects. One challenge is that the
   amount of information available to be potentially communicated may
   exceed salespeople's ability to communicate or customers' ability to
   process: there is limited "bandwidth" between the firm and customers.
   One important decision, then, is which information should customers see?
   What the firm chooses to tell customers may be informative in itself.
   When constrained to a "seller-initiated information revelation" format,
   where the firm chooses which feature to show, the firm never finds it
   optimal to offer more features than it is able to inform customers
   about. Consequently, customers never find credible a claim that the
   product has all features. The important implication is that price alone
   cannot serve as a signal of quality in this setting. In contrast, a
   "buyer-initiated information revelation" format, where customers decide
   which information to receive, increases the probability of a sale and
   also results in the production of higher quality products.
   In a competitive setting, by adopting buyer-initiated information
   revelation, firms are able to attain positive profits. This is due to
   the fact that customers infer the product's quality from the price along
   with the information revelation format. Customers know that at some
   prices, firms find it profitable to produce high-quality products and at
   other, lower, prices, this is not the case. Thus, customer empowerment
   leads to higher profits.

AB Dynamic pricing offers the potential to increase revenues. At the same
   time, it creates an incentive for customers to strategize over the
   timing of their purchases. A firm should ideally account for this
   behavior when making its pricing and stocking decisions. In particular,
   we investigate whether it is optimal for a firm to create rationing risk
   by deliberately understocking products. Then, the resulting threat of
   shortages creates an incentive for customers to purchase early at higher
   prices. But when does such a strategy make sense? If it is pro. table to
   create shortages, what is the optimal amount of rationing risk to
   create? We develop a stylized model to study this problem. In our model,
   customers have heterogeneous valuations for the firm's product and face
   declining prices over two periods. Customers are assumed to have
   identical risk preferences and know the price path and fill rate in each
   period. Via its capacity choice, the firm is able to control the fill
   rate and, hence, the rationing risk faced by customers. Customers behave
   strategically and weigh the payoff of immediate purchases against the
   expected payoff of delaying their purchases. We analyze the capacity
   choice that maximizes the firm's profits. First, we consider a monopoly
   market and characterize conditions under which rationing is optimal. We
   examine how the optimal amount of rationing is affected by the magnitude
   of price changes over time and the degree of risk aversion among
   customers. We then analyze an oligopoly version of the model and show
   that competition reduces the firms' ability to profit from rationing.
   Indeed, there exists a critical number of firms beyond which a rationing
   equilibrium cannot be supported.

   using a model that captures three aspects of particular interest: first,
   the joint use of dynamic pricing and lead-time quotation controls to

   expedite orders at a cost; and third, the interaction of the
   aforementioned demand controls with the operational decisions of
   sequencing and expediting that the firm must employ to optimize revenues
   and satisfy the quoted lead times. Using an approximating diffusion

AB Manufacturers have recently begun outsourcing product assembly and
   completion tasks to their suppliers. Such outsourcing solves several
   contracting problems but generates new incentive frictions between
   manufacturers and their suppliers. In this paper, we analyze a
   manufacturer's decision to outsource an assembly (second-stage) task to
   a preestablished supplier. We find that outsourcing second-stage tasks
   becomes more attractive as the cost of either the first- or second-stage
   activity rises. Outsourcing becomes less attractive when the supplier is
   unable to accept large levels of liability. The manufacturer is shown to
   prefer more testing when she outsources assembly to her supplier as
   opposed to when she assembles products in house. Last, we find that the
   contracting frictions identified persist when the supplier's work can be
   tested individually, albeit imperfectly.

AB From a large array of economic and financial data series, this paper
   identifies three fundamental risk dimensions underlying an economy:
   inflation, real output growth, and financial market volatility.
   Furthermore, through a no-arbitrage model, the paper links the dynamics
   and market pricing of the three risk dimensions to the term structure of
   U.S. Treasury yields and corporate bond credit spreads. Model estimation
   shows that positive inflation shocks increase Treasury yields and widen
   credit spreads on corporate bonds across all maturities and
   credit-rating classes. Positive real output growth shocks also increase
   Treasury yields, but they suppress the credit spreads at low
   credit-rating classes, thus generating negative correlations between
   interest rates and credit spreads. The financial market volatility
   factor has a small and transient effect on the Treasury yield curve, but
   it exerts a strongly positive and persistent effect on the credit spread
   term structure. The paper provides a robust and internally consistent
   method for extracting systematic economic information from a large array
   of noisy observations and establishing how different risk dimensions of
   the fundamental economy interact with interest rate and credit risk.

AB This paper investigates a two-factor affine model for the credit spreads
   on corporate bonds. The first factor can be interpreted as the level of
   the spread and the second factor is the volatility of the spread. The
   riskless interest rate is modeled using a standard two-factor affine
   model, thus leading to a four-factor model for corporate yields. This
   approach allows us to model the volatility of corporate credit spreads
   as stochastic, and also allows us to capture higher moments of credit
   spreads. We use an extended Kalman filter approach to estimate our model
   on corporate bond prices for 108 firms. The model is found to be
   successful at fitting actual corporate bond credit spreads, resulting in
   a significantly lower root mean square error than a standard alternative
   model both in sample and out of sample. In addition, key properties of
   actual credit spreads such as the stochastic volatility of the credit
   spreads and the positive skewness of the credit spread distribution are
   better captured by the model.

   by modelling them as large acyclic networks. Such large networks are
   common in the automobile and apparel industries. We develop a model to
   analyze the effect of these large-scale problems involving long
   sequences of contracts, and show that contract leadership, as well as
   leader position in the network, affect the performance of the entire
   supply chain. We generalize Spengler (Spengler, J. 1950. Vertical
   integration and anti-trust policy. J. Political Econom. 58 347-352) to a
   game on a "contract tree" for a particular supply chain and extend the
   concept of double marginalization so that it can be applied in the form
   of a transformation to each contract that is offered by one member to
   another in the "contract tree." We construct an algorithm to find the
   equilibrium solution, and derive the optimal location of the leader
   ("optimal" being the leader location that maximizes total supply chain
   profits). Our work formalizes many intuitive insights; for example,
   member profits are determined by systemwide rather than individual
   costs. Finally, we model Cournot competition between competing supply
   chains (both two heterogeneous trees and multiple identical trees) and
   show the effect of changes in leader position as well as cost structure

AB Loyalty programs are very common in practice. Many researchers have
   worked at understanding the impact of loyalty programs on market
   competition and the mechanism behind it. Interestingly, almost all of
   the studies have explored a symmetric equilibrium where both of the
   competing firms offer a loyalty program. To our knowledge, the extant
   literature has not investigated in-depth whether asymmetric equilibrium
   can exist where only one firm chooses to offer a loyalty program and the
   other firm chooses to compete via lowering prices. Such a question is
   important because some markets do support such asymmetric equilibriums
   with respect to loyalty programs. Also, the existence of asymmetric
   equilibrium shows that a loyalty program need not be pro. table for some
   firms.
   In this paper, we use a game-theoretic framework to investigate specific
   types of customer loyalty programs that provide benefit to loyal
   customers in the form of discount over market prices. The model
   considers consumer switching and includes two types of consumer
   heterogeneity. The first type of heterogeneity concerns the differences
   between customers with respect to their liking for loyalty programs, and
   the second type concerns the differences among the loyalty program
   members with respect to their ability to collect enough loyalty points
   to redeem loyalty rewards. By analyzing a duopoly market, we find that
   both symmetric equilibrium (i.e., where both competing firms offer the
   loyalty program) and asymmetric equilibrium (i.e., where one firm alone
   offers the loyalty program) can be sustained. The paper explores
   conditions for the existence of these two equilibriums.

   This decline was most pronounced among star analysts who moved to firms
   with lesser capabilities and those who moved solo, without other team
   members. Star analysts who moved between two firms with equivalent
   capabilities also exhibited a drop in performance, but only for two
   years. Those who switched to firms with better capabilities and those
   who moved with other team members exhibited no significant decline in
   short-term or long-term performance. These findings suggest that
   firm-specific skills and firms' capabilities both play important roles
   in star analysts' performance. In addition, we find that firms that hire
   star analysts from competitors with better capabilities suffered more
   extreme negative stock-market reactions than those that hire from
   comparable or lesser firms. These findings suggest that hiring stars may
   be perceived as value destroying and may not improve a firm's

   organizations that have survived a history of competition. Such
   experience adapts organizations to their environment, through so-called
   "Red Queen" evolution, but being well adapted for one context makes
   moving into new contexts more hazardous. Meanwhile, managers in such
   organizations infer from their histories of competitive success a biased
   assessment of their organization's ability to change. Consequently,
   although surviving competition makes organizational change especially
   hazardous, managers in surviving organizations are especially inclined
   to such initiatives. We develop these ideas in an empirically testable
   model, and find supportive evidence in estimates of the model using data

   Interestingly, we understand little about what determines the

   analyzing multiple determinants of time-to-build - i.e., the time it
   takes a firm to build and ramp up operations at a new manufacturing
   facility. Theoretically, we develop predictions regarding the effects of
   competitive, firm, and technology characteristics on time-to-build.
   Empirically, we test our predictions on a sample of plant construction
   projects in the memory segment of the global semiconductor industry. We
   find that competition from rivals with superior technology is associated
   with shorter time-to-build, at least up to a point. Firm and industry
   experience are associated with shorter time-to-build. International
   projects, and those that push the technological frontier, take longer.
   Findings from this study enrich the literatures on corporate growth,
   international expansion, and technology strategy. We discuss

AB Although past research has investigated the impact of exploration and
   exploitation on firm performance, there is limited research on these
   effects in interorganizational relationships. We examine whether the
   boundary condition for ambidextrous learning can be extended from firms
   to long-term interorganizational relationships. Specifically, we focus
   on a particular aspect of learning - namely, explorative and
   exploitative knowledge sharing - and examine its impact on the
   performance of long-term relationships. We also theorize how
   ambidextrous management of the relationship and ontological commitment
   to span the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic knowledge boundaries
   between partners enable knowledge sharing. Our theoretical predictions
   are tested using data collected from both account managers at customer
   firms responsible for the relationship with a leading supply chain
   vendor and account managers at the vendor firm responsible for
   relationships with customers. The findings suggest that both exploratory
   and exploitative knowledge sharing lead to relationship performance
   gains, that such sharing is enabled by the ambidextrous management of
   the relationship, and that such sharing is facilitated by ontological
   commitment. Interesting differences in the enablers and consequences of
   both forms of knowledge sharing are detected between customers and the
   vendor.

AB We examine how delays between actions and their consequent payoffs
   affect the process of organizational adaptation. Formal conceptions of
   organizational learning typically include the assumption that payoffs
   immediately follow their antecedent actions, making the search for
   better strategies relatively straightforward. However, previous actions
   influence current organizational performance through their effects on
   organizational resources and capabilities. These resources and
   capabilities cannot be modified instantly, so delays - from actions to
   changes in resources and capabilities to altered organizational
   performance - are inevitable. Our computational experiments show that
   delays increase learning complexity and performance heterogeneity
   through two mechanisms. First, complexity of state-space and, therefore,
   of learning grows exponentially with delay length. Second, the time
   required to experience the benefits of long-term strategies means the
   intermediate steps of those strategies are initially undervalued,
   prompting premature abandonment of potentially fruitful regions of the
   strategy space. We find that these mechanisms often cause organizations
   to converge to suboptimal, routine-like cycles of actions, based on
   organizations' continually updated cognitive maps of how actions
   influence payoffs. Furthermore, the evolution of these cognitive maps
   exhibits path dependence, leading to heterogeneity across organizations.
   Implications for overcoming temporal complexity and the impact of
   initial cognitive maps are discussed.

   probabilities of system safety measures and the total expected loss from
   a sequence of events. Using an event tree optimization approach, the

   reformulated as a specially structured nonconvex factorable program. We
   derive a tight linear programming relaxation along with related
   theoretical insights that serve to lay the foundation for designing a
   tailored branch-and-bound algorithm that is proven to converge to a
   global optimum. Computational experience is reported for a hypothetical
   case study, as well as for several realistic simulated test cases, based
   on different parameter settings. The results on the simulated test cases
   demonstrate that the proposed approach dominates the commercial software
   BARON v7.5 when the latter is applied to solve the original model by
   more robustly yielding provable optimal solutions that are at an average
   of 16.6% better in terms of objective function value; and it performs
   competitively when both models are used to solve the reformulated
   problem, particularly for larger test instances.

AB We investigate a basic premise of prospect theory: that the valuation of
   gains and losses is separable. In prospect theory, gain-loss
   separability implies that a mixed gamble is valued by summing the
   valuations of the gain and loss portions of that gamble. Two
   experimental studies demonstrate a systematic violation of the
   double-matching axiom, an axiom that is necessary for gain-loss
   separability. We document a reversal between preferences for mixed
   gambles and the associated gain and loss gambles-mixed gamble A is
   preferred to mixed gamble B, but the gain and loss portions of B are
   preferred to the gain and loss portions of A. The observed choice
   patterns are consistent with a process in which individuals are less
   sensitive to probability differences when choosing among mixed gambles
   than when choosing among either gain or loss gambles.

AB Prediction markets now cover many important political events. The 2004
   presidential election featured an active online prediction market at
   Intrade.com, where securities addressing many different election-related
   outcomes were traded. Using the 2004 data from this market, we examined
   three alternative models for these security prices, with special focus
   on the electoral college rules that govern U. S. presidential elections
   to see which models are more (or less) consistent with the data. The
   data reveal dependencies in the evolution of the security prices across
   states over time. We show that a simple diffusion model provides a good
   description of the overall probability distribution of electoral college
   votes, and an even simpler ranking model provides excellent predictions
   of the probability of winning the presidency. Ignoring dependencies in
   the evolution of security prices across states leads to considerable
   underestimation of the variance of the number of electoral college votes
   received by a candidate, which in turn leads to overconfidence in
   predicting whether that candidate will win the election. Overall, the
   security prices in the Intrade presidential election prediction market
   appear jointly consistent with probability models that satisfy the rules
   of the electoral college.

AB This paper was motivated by an observation in an international airport
   with regard to allocation of resources for check-in counters. In an
   exclusive check-in counter system, each flight has a dedicated number of
   counters that will be open until at least a half-hour before the
   scheduled departure of that flight. Currently, in many of the airports
   around the world, the decision to open or close check-in counters is
   done on an ad hoc basis by human schedulers. In doing so, the schedulers
   are almost always forced to perform a balancing act in meeting the
   quality of service stipulated by the airport authority vis-a-vis the
   optimal allocation of the resources to the counters. There appear to be
   very few academic and application papers in counter management, and most
   of those that have looked into this problem have resorted to simulation
   to study the queue characteristics. Ours is the first paper to show that
   for a specific flight, this complicated problem is amenable to
   analytical treatment. We first propose a multicounter queueing model
   with a special type of arrival process reflecting reality from the
   population of passengers booked for the flight. Most importantly, we
   derive the time-dependent operating characteristics to the queueing
   process under a specified time-window constraint. Then a stochastic
   dynamic programming model is formulated to determine the optimal numbers
   of counters to open over the time window specified. A numerical example
   is provided to illustrate the model solution and gain managerial
   insights.

AB Although organizations appear to learn from obvious failures, we argue
   that it is harder for them to learn from "near-misses"-events in which
   chance played a role in averting failure. In this paper, we formalize
   the concept of near-misses and hypothesize that organizations and
   managers fail to learn from near-misses because they evaluate such
   events as successes and thus feel safer about the situation. We
   distinguish perceived ("felt") risk from calculated statistical risk and
   propose that lower levels of perceived risk encourage people with
   near-miss information to make riskier subsequent decisions compared to
   people without near-miss information. In our first study, we confirm the
   tendency to evaluate near-misses as successes by having participants
   rate a project manager whose decisions result in either (a) mission
   success, (b) near-miss, or (c) failure. Participants (both students and
   NASA employees and contractors) give similar ratings to managers whose
   decisions produced near-misses and to managers whose decisions resulted
   in successes, and both ratings are significantly different from ratings
   of managers who experienced failures. We suggest that the failure to
   hold managers accountable for near-misses is a foregone learning
   opportunity for both the manager and the organization. In our second set
   of studies, we confirm that near-miss information leads people to choose
   a riskier alternative because of a lower perceived risk following
   near-miss events. We explore several alternative explanations for these
   findings, including the role of Bayesian updating in processing
   near-miss data. Ultimately, the analysis suggests that managers and
   organizations are reducing their perception of the risk, although not
   necessarily updating (lowering) the statistical probability of the
   failure event. We speculate that this divergence arises because
   perceived risk is the product of associative processing, whereas
   statistical risk arises from rule-based processing.

AB In this paper, we study a firm that faces demand from two sources:
   demand for new items and demand to replace failed items under warranty.
   We model this setting as a multiperiod single-product inventory problem
   where the demands for new items in different periods are independent and
   the demands for replacing failed items depend on the number and ages of
   the items under warranty. We consider backlogging and emergency supply
   cases, and study both discounted cost and average cost criteria. We
   prove the optimality of the w-dependent base-stock ordering policy where
   the base-stock level is a function of w, the vector representing the
   number of items at different ages currently under warranty. For the
   special case where the demand for new products is identically
   distributed, we prove the optimality of a stationary w-dependent base
   stock policy for the finite-horizon discounted and the infinite-horizon
   discounted and average cost cases. In our computational study, we find
   that an optimal w-dependent policy can lead to 69% average improvement
   in expected costs when compared to a policy that neglects demands from
   items under warranty.

AB In this paper, we examine the nature of optimal inventory policies in a
   system where a retailer manages substitutable products. We first
   consider a system with two products 1 and 2 whose total demand is D and
   individual demands are negatively correlated. A fixed proportion of the
   unsatisfied customers for an item will purchase the other item if it is
   available in inventory. For the single-period case, we show that the
   optimal inventory levels of the two items can be computed easily and
   follow what we refer to as "partially decoupled" policies, i.e., base
   stock policies that are not state dependent, in certain critical regions
   of interest both when D is known and random. Furthermore, we show that
   such a partially decoupled base-stock policy is optimal even in a
   multiperiod version of the problem for known D for a wide range of
   parameter values and in an N-product single-period model under some
   restrictive conditions. Using a numerical study, we show that heuristics
   based on the decoupled inventory policy perform well in conditions more
   general than the ones assumed to obtain the analytical results. The
   analytical and numerical results suggest that the approach presented
   here is most valuable in retail settings for product categories where
   the level of substitution between items in a category is not high,
   demand variation at the aggregate level is not high, and service levels
   or newsvendor ratios are high.

   retailer has some private information about the uncertain demand
   function which he may choose to disclose to the manufacturer. The
   manufacturer then sets a wholesale price based on the information
   received. The information exchange is said to be confidential if the
   manufacturer keeps the received information to herself, or
   nonconfidential if she discloses the information to some or all other
   retailers. Without confidentiality, information sharing is not possible
   because it benefits the manufacturer but hurts the retailers. With
   confidentiality, all parties have incentive to engage in information
   sharing if retail competition is intense. Under confidentiality, the
   retailers infer the shared information from the wholesale price and this
   gives rise to a signaling effect that makes the manufacturer's demand
   more price elastic, resulting in a lower equilibrium wholesale price and
   a higher supply chain profit. When all retailers share their information
   confidentially, they will truthfully report the information and the
   supply chain profit will achieve its maximum in equilibrium.

AB We examine a decentralized supply chain in which a single assembler buys
   complementary components from n suppliers and assembles the final
   product in anticipation of demand. Players take actions in the following
   sequence. First (stage 1), the suppliers form coalitions among
   themselves. Second (stage 2), the coalitions compete for a position in
   the negotiation sequence. Finally (stage 3), the coalitions negotiate
   with the assembler on allocations of the supply chain's profit. We model
   the multilateral negotiations between the suppliers and the assembler
   sequentially, i.e., the assembler negotiates with one coalition at a
   time. Each of these negotiations is modeled using the Nash bargaining
   concept. Further, in forming coalitions we assume that players are
   farsighted. We then predict at equilibrium the structure of the supply
   chain as a function of the players' relative negotiation powers. In
   particular, we show that the assembler always prefers the outcome where
   suppliers do not form coalitions. However, when the assembler is weak
   (low negotiation power) the suppliers join forces as a grand coalition,
   but when the assembler is powerful the suppliers stay independent, which
   is the preferred outcome to the assembler.

AB We consider a monopolist expert offering a service with a "credence"
   characteristic. A credence service is one in which the customer cannot
   verify, even after a purchase, whether or not the amount of prescribed
   service was appropriate; examples include legal, medical, or consultancy
   services, and car repair. This creates an incentive for the expert to
   "induce service," that is, to provide unnecessary services that add no
   value to the customer, but that allow the expert to increase his
   revenues. We focus on the impact of an operations phenomenon on service
   inducement-workload dynamics due to the stochasticity of interarrival
   and service times. To this end, we model the expert's service operation
   as a single-server queue. The expert determines the service price within
   a fixed and variable fee structure and determines the service inducement
   strategy. We characterize the expert's combined optimal price structure
   and service inducement strategy as a function of service capacity,
   market potential, inducement opportunity, value of service and waiting
   cost. We find that service inducement is a means to dynamically skim
   customer surplus with state-independent prices and provision of slower
   service to customers that arrive when the expert is idle. We conclude
   with design implications of our results in limiting service inducement.

AB Motivated by models of tenant assignment in public housing, we study
   approximating deterministic fluid models for overloaded queueing systems
   having multiple customer classes (classes of tenants) and multiple
   service pools (housing authorities), each with many servers (housing
   units). Customer abandonment acts to keep the system stable, yielding a
   proper steady-state description. Motivated by fairness considerations,
   we assume that customers are selected for service by newly available
   servers on a first-come,first-served (FCFS) basis from all classes the
   corresponding service pools are allowed to serve. In this context, it is
   challenging to determine stationary routing flow rates between customer
   classes and service pools. Given those routing flow rates, each single
   fluid queue can be analyzed separately using previously established
   methods. Our ability to determine the routing flow rates depends on the
   structure of the network routing graph. We obtain the desired routing
   flow rates in three cases: when the routing graph is (i) a tree
   (sparsely connected), (ii) complete bipartite (fully connected), and
   (iii) an appropriate combination of the previous two cases. Other cases
   remain unsolved. In the last two solved cases, the routing flow rates
   are actually not uniquely determined by the fluid model, but become so
   once we make stochastic assumptions about the queueing models that the
   fluid model approximates.

AB In an innovation contest, a firm (the seeker) facing an
   innovation-related problem (e. g., a technical R&D problem) posts this
   problem to a population of independent agents (the solvers) and then
   provides an award to the agent that generated the best solution. In this
   paper, we analyze the interaction between a seeker and a set of solvers.
   Prior research in economics suggests that having many solvers work on an
   innovation problem will lead to a lower equilibrium effort for each
   solver, which is undesirable from the perspective of the seeker. In
   contrast, we establish that the seeker can benefit from a larger solver
   population because he obtains a more diverse set of solutions, which
   mitigates and sometimes outweighs the effect of the solvers'
   underinvestment in effort. We demonstrate that the inefficiency of the
   innovation contest resulting from the solvers' underinvestment can
   further be reduced by changing the award structure from a fixed-price
   award to a performance-contingent award. Finally, we compare the quality
   of the solutions and seeker profits with the case of an internal
   innovation process. This allows us to predict which types of products
   and which cost structures will be the most likely to benefit from the
   contest approach to innovation.

AB Every organization is confronted by employee errors. Situational
   learning orientation may mitigate an employee's tendency to err. A
   situational learning orientation refers to the extent to which employees
   share the perception that there is an emphasis on improvement and on
   actively searching for additional knowledge and feedback in their
   department. The present study suggests that situational learning
   orientation interacts with two other organizational factors-autonomy and
   voice-as it influences employee errors, using the example of resident
   physicians' medical treatment errors. Senior nurses tallied the number
   of errors made by 123 residents from 25 departments over a three-month
   period. Results demonstrated that encouraging employee autonomy and
   voice fosters the benefits of learning by decreasing the number of
   treatment errors. Specifically, when the situational learning
   orientation was high, the number of errors decreased at an increasing
   rate as the perceived autonomy increased. When the learning orientation
   was low, there was a u-shaped relationship between autonomy and number
   of errors. In addition, only when the situational learning orientation
   was high did a higher employee voice lead to fewer treatment errors.

AB This research uses dual-process cognitive theory to describe how people
   process information differently when it is delivered via videoconference
   rather than when it is delivered face-to-face. According to this theory,
   relative to face-to-face communication, people in videoconferences tend
   to be more influenced by heuristic cues-such as how likeable they
   perceive the speaker to be-than by the quality of the arguments
   presented by the speaker. This is due to the higher cognitive demands
   that videoconferencing places on participants. We report on a field
   study of medical professionals in which we found differences in
   information processing as predicted: participants attending a seminar
   via videoconference were more influenced by the likeability of the
   speaker than by the quality of the arguments presented, whereas the
   opposite pattern was true for participants attending in-person. We also
   found that differences in cognitive load explain these effects. The
   discussion on the theoretical model and associated findings explains why
   prior videoconference studies have not consistently found main effects
   for media. The findings also show that videoconferencing is not like
   face-to-face communication, despite apparent similarities.

AB Content delivery networks (CDNs) are a vital component of the Internet's
   content delivery value chain, servicing nearly a third of the Internet's
   most popular content sites. However, in spite of their strategic
   importance, little is known about the optimal pricing policies or
   adoption drivers of CDNs. We address these questions using analytic
   models of CDN pricing and adoption under Markovian traffic and extend
   the results to bursty traffic using numerical simulations.
   When traffic is Markovian, we find that CDNs should provide volume
   discounts to content providers. In addition, the optimal pricing policy
   entails lower emphasis on value-based pricing and greater emphasis on
   cost-based pricing as the relative density of content providers with
   high outsourcing costs increases. However, when traffic is bursty and
   content providers have varying levels of traffic burstiness, volume
   discounts may be suboptimal and may even be replaced by volume taxes.
   Finally, when there is heterogeneity in burstiness across content
   providers, a pricing policy that accounts for both the mean and variance
   in traffic such as percentile-based pricing is more pro. table than
   traditional volume-based pricing (metering bytes delivered in a given
   time window). This finding is in contrast to the current practices of
   many CDN firms that use traditional volume-based pricing.

   absolute regret performance criteria. For both performance criteria, we
   derive the best possible static policies, which employ booking limits
   that remain constant throughout the booking horizon. The optimal
   policies have the form of nested booking limits. Dynamic policies, which
   employ booking limits that may be adjusted at any time based on the
   history of bookings, are also obtained. We provide extensive

AB An important managerial question is the choice of the pricing rule. We
   study whether this choice depends on the uncertainty about the number of
   participating bidders by comparing expected revenues under
   discriminatory and uniform pricing within an auction model with
   affiliated values, stochastic number of bidders, and linear bidding
   strategies. We show that if uncertainty about the number of bidders is
   substantial, then the discriminatory pricing generates higher expected
   revenues than the uniform pricing. In particular, the first-price
   auction might generate higher revenues than the second-price auction.
   Therefore, uncertainty about the number of bidders is an important
   factor to consider when choosing the pricing rule. We also study whether
   eliminating this uncertainty, i.e., revealing the number of bidders, is
   in the seller's interests, and discuss the existence of an increasing
   symmetric equilibrium.

   low starting price auctions, and pay more for them when they do win.
   Experienced bidders are less likely to bid on low starting price

AB Entrepreneurs play a fundamental role in bringing new technologies to
   market. Because technologies are often configurable to serve a variety
   of different markets, it is possible for entrepreneurs to identify
   multiple market opportunities prior to the first market entry of their
   emerging firms, and if they elect to do so, to therefore have a choice
   of which market to enter first. The empirical results presented in this
   paper offer three new insights regarding this important early-stage
   choice in new firm creation. First, they reveal that serial
   entrepreneurs have learned through prior start-up experience to generate
   a "choice set" of alternative market opportunities before deciding which
   one to pursue in their new firm creation. Second, the analysis indicates
   that entrepreneurs who identify a "choice set" of market opportunities
   prior to first entry derive performance benefits by doing so. Third, the
   positive relationship between the number of market opportunities
   identified prior to first entry and new firm performance is nonlinear
   and subject to decreasing marginal return. The research literature has
   yet to acknowledge the notion of multiple opportunity identification
   prior to entry, and the related idea of selecting the most favorable
   market opportunity for the creation of a new technology firm.

   customers in an in finite-horizon setting. Both retail outlets and
   customers are located on a finite homogenous line segment. The total
   demand posed by customers is normally distributed with known mean and
   variance. To optimally design and operate such a system, we need to
   determine the optimal values of the number of retail outlets, the
   location of each retail outlet, and the replenishment inventory levels
   maintained at each retail outlet. We analyze the system from an expected
   cost point of view, considering the fixed costs of operating the retail
   outlets, the expected holding and shortage costs, and the expected
   delivery costs. We show that all decisions can be represented as a
   function of the number of retail outlets. Moreover, we show that the
   system's expected cost function is quasi-convex in the number of retail
   outlets. We compare our model to a model that does not integrate these
   decisions at once. We show the advantage of our approach on both the
   solution and objective spaces. We propose an exact quanti. cation of
   this advantage in terms of the cost and problem parameters. In addition,

AB In this paper, we study the name-your-own-price (NYOP) channel. We
   examine theoretically and empirically whether asking consumers to place
   a joint bid for multiple items, rather than bid one item at a time as
   practiced today, can increase NYOP retailers' profits. Relatedly, we
   also examine whether allowing consumers to self-select whether to place
   a joint bid or itemwise bids increases retailers' profits and consumers'
   surplus. We construct a dynamic model that incorporates both demand
   uncertainty and supply uncertainty to address these issues. Our
   theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which joint bidding
   can increase both NYOP retailers' profits and consumers' surplus. We
   find that some consumers might bid more for the very same items when
   they place joint bids. The increase in bid amount is related to the fact
   that joint bidding reduces the chance of mismatch between NYOP
   retailers' costs and consumer bids. We conducted a laboratory study to
   assess the descriptive validity of some of the model predictions,
   because there are no field data on joint bidding in the NYOP channel.
   The results of the study are directionally consistent with our theory.

AB Practitioners and academics hypothesize that when there is high
   diversity in resource consumption patterns, costing systems are more
   sensitive to errors. Given that firms' resources to enhance costing
   accuracy are typically constrained, it is argued that costing system
   refinement efforts should be focused on such cases, where they are
   likely to be most effective. However, little guidance is available on
   how to identify those situations where costing system refinement efforts
   (such as introducing an activity-based costing system) are likely to pay
   off most in terms of increased accuracy. Further, to our knowledge, the
   existing guidance provided by this high diversity rule of thumb has
   never been empirically tested. Using a simulation method, we address
   these issues in this paper. Specifically, we model various aspects, and
   degrees, of diversity in the resource consumption patterns to be
   reflected by the costing system and find that more diversity in resource
   consumption patterns only leads to increased costing system sensitivity
   to errors for some of the aspects of diversity studied. We also identify
   situations in which allocating costing system refinement resources to
   cases characterized by high diversity in resource consumption patterns
   is detrimental to improved accuracy.

   life-cycle effects. The profitability of a remanufacturing system
   strongly depends on these issues as well as on their interactions. For a
   monopolist, we show that there exist thresholds on the remanufacturing
   cost savings, the green segment size, market growth rate, and consumer
   valuations for the remanufactured products, above which remanufacturing
   is profitable. More important, we show that under competition
   remanufacturing can become an effective marketing strategy, which allows

AB Firms routinely decide whether to make essential inputs themselves or
   buy the inputs from independent suppliers. Conventional wisdom suggests
   that a firm will not buy an input for a price above its in-house cost of
   production. We show that this is not necessarily the case when a
   monopolistic input supplier also serves the firm's retail rival. In this
   case, the decision to buy the input (and thus become one of the
   supplier's customers) can limit the incentive the supplier would
   otherwise have to provide the input on particularly favorable terms to
   the retail rival. Thus, a retail competitor may pay a premium to

AB This paper studies the impact of strategic customer behavior on supply
   chain performance. We start with a newsvendor seller facing
   forward-looking customers. The seller initially charges a regular price
   but may salvage the leftover inventory at a lower salvage price after
   random demand is realized. Customers anticipate future sales and choose
   purchase timing to maximize their expected surplus. We characterize the
   rational expectations equilibrium, where we find that the seller's
   stocking level is lower than that in the classic model without strategic
   customers. We show that the seller's profit can be improved by promising
   either that quantities available will be limited (quantity commitment)
   or that prices will be kept high (price commitment). In most cases, both
   forms of commitment are not credible in a centralized supply chain with
   a single seller. However, decentralized supply chains can use
   contractual arrangements as indirect commitment devices to attain the
   desired outcomes with commitment. Decentralization has generally been
   associated with coordination problems, but we present the contrasting
   view that disparate interests within a supply chain can actually improve
   overall supply chain performance. In particular, with strategic customer
   behavior, we find that (i) a decentralized supply chain with a wholesale
   price contract may perform strictly better than a centralized supply
   chain; (ii) contracts widely studied in the supply chain coordination
   literature (e.g., markdown money, sales rebates, and buyback contracts)
   can serve as a commitment device as well as an incentive-coordinating
   device; and (iii) some of the above contracts cannot allocate profits
   arbitrarily between supply chain members because of strategic customer
   behavior.

AB The strength of bargainers' preferences for fair settlements has
   important implications for predicting negotiation outcomes and guiding
   bargaining strategy. Existing literature reports a few calibration
   exercises for social utility models, but the predictive accuracy of
   these models for out-of-sample forecasting remains unknown. Therefore,
   we investigate whether fairness considerations are stable enough across
   bargaining situations to be quantified and used to forecast bargaining
   behavior accurately. We develop a model that embeds a preference for
   fair treatment in a quantal response framework to account for noise and
   experience. In addition, we estimate preference for fairness
   (willingness to pay) using the simplest, one-round version of sequential
   bargaining games and then employ it to perform out-of-sample forecasts
   of multiple-round games of various lengths, discount factors, pie sizes,
   and levels of bargainer experience. Except in circumstances in which the
   bargaining pie is very small, the fitted model has significant and
   substantial out-of-sample explanatory power. The stability we find
   implies that the model and techniques might ultimately be extended to
   estimates of the influence of fairness on field negotiations, as well as
   across subpopulations.

AB Classical reasons for carrying inventory include fixed (nonlinear)
   production or procurement costs, lead times, nonstationary or uncertain
   supply/demand, and capacity constraints. The last decade has seen active
   research in supply chain coordination focusing on the role of incentive
   contracts to achieve first-best levels of inventory. An extensive
   literature in industrial organization that studies incentives for
   vertical controls largely ignores the effect of inventories. Does the
   ability to carry inventory influence the problem of vertical control?
   Conversely, can inventories arise purely due to incentive effects? This
   paper explicitly considers both incentives and inventories, and their
   interplay, in a dynamic model of an upstream firm (supplier) and a
   downstream firm (buyer) who can carry inventories. In our model, none of
   the classical reasons for carrying inventory exists. However, as we
   prove, the buyer's optimal strategy in equilibrium is to carry
   inventories, and the supplier is unable to prevent this. These
   inventories arise out of purely strategic considerations not yet
   identified in the literature, and have a significant impact on the
   equilibrium solution as well as supplier, buyer, and channel profits.
   We prove that strategic inventories play a pivotal role under arbitrary
   contractual structures, general (arbitrary) demand functions and general
   (finite or infinite) horizon lengths. As one example, two-part tariff
   contracts do not lead to optimal channel performance, nor can the
   supplier extract away all of the channel profits, in our dynamic model.
   Our results imply that firms can and must carry inventories
   strategically, and that optimal vertical contracts must take the
   possibility of inventories into account.

AB We investigate the situation where a customer experiencing an inventory
   stockout at a retailer potentially leaves the firm's market. In
   classical inventory theory, a unit stockout penalty cost has been used
   as a surrogate to mimic the economic effect of such a departure; in this
   study, we explicitly represent this aspect of consumer behavior,
   incorporating the diminishing effect of the consumers leaving the market
   upon the stochastic demand distribution in a time-dynamic context. The
   initial model considers a single firm. We allow for consumer forgiveness
   where customers may flow back to the committed purchasing market from a
   nonpurchasing "latent" market. The per-period decisions include a
   marketing mix to attract latent and new consumers to the committed
   market and the setting of inventory levels. We establish conditions
   under which the firm optimally operates a base-stock inventory policy.
   The subsequent two models consider a duopoly where the potential market
   for a firm is now the committed market of the other firm; each firm
   decides its own inventory level. In the first model, the only decisions
   are the stocking decisions and in the second model, a firm may also
   advertise to attract dissatisfied customers from its competitor's
   market. In both cases, we establish conditions for a base-stock
   equilibrium policy. We demonstrate comparative statics in all models.

   of discount rates, the social discount rate has the following
   properties: it decreases over time, it is lower than the average of the
   discount rates in the population, and it converges to the discount rate
   of the most patient individual in the economy. These properties hold for
   both constant and decreasing individual discount rates. Finally, we
   evaluate how changes in the distribution of individual discount rates

AB This paper tests the notion of whether high preference for store brands
   leads to higher store loyalty. Our work differs from the earlier
   empirical evidence on this issue in how we de. ne and measure the two
   key constructs: store-brand loyalty and store loyalty. To measure
   store-brand preference, we develop a multicategory brand choice to
   elicit the basic latent tendency for a household to buy store brands,
   while controlling for other factors such as price sensitivity. The
   household-specific measures on store-brand preference and price
   sensitivity (along with other control variables) are then used to assess
   household store loyalty in the context of entry by a Wal-Mart
   supercenter in the market. Results show that store-brand buying behavior
   is driven by households' underlying "value trait" over and beyond what
   is captured by price sensitivity alone. In addition, these
   value-oriented households, which show high preference for store brands
   in the pre-entry period, shift a significantly higher level of their
   expenditures to Wal-Mart. These results are in contradiction to the
   conventional wisdom that high store-brand patronage is associated with a
   higher level of store loyalty. However, this finding comes with the
   caveat that the entrant analyzed in the paper has a well-defined "value"
   positioning and might not hold if the new entrant does not dominate the
   incumbent in the value proposition. Implications for supermarket
   managers in a more general context are discussed.

AB Supply chain contracting literature has traditionally focused on
   aligning incentives for economically rational players. Recent work has
   hypothesized that social preferences, as distinct from economic
   incentives, may influence behavior in supply chain transactions. Social
   preferences refer to intrinsic concerns for the other party's welfare,
   reciprocating a history of a positive relationship, and intrinsic
   desires for a higher relative payoff compared with the other party's
   when status is salient. This article provides experimental evidence that
   social preferences systematically affect economic decision making in
   supply chain transactions. Specifically, supply chain parties deviate
   from the predictions provided by self-interested profit-maximization
   models, such that relationship preference promotes cooperation,
   individual performance, and high system efficiency, sustainable over
   time; whereas status preference induces tough actions and reduces both
   system efficiency and individual performance.

AB There are many circumstances in which manufacturers provide inputs to
   wholesale customers only to subsequently compete with these wholesale
   customers in the retail realm. Such dual distribution arrangements
   commonly suffer from excessive encroachment in that the manufacturer's
   ex post retail aggression is harmful ex ante because it undercuts
   potential wholesale profits. This paper demonstrates that with dual
   distribution, a manufacturer can benefit from decentralized control and
   the use of transfer prices above marginal cost. Although these
   arrangements often create coordination concerns, a moderate presence of
   such concerns permits the manufacturer to credibly convey to its
   wholesale customer that it will not excessively encroach on its retail
   territory. This, in turn, permits the manufacturer to reap greater
   wholesale profits. We also note that this force can point to a silver
   lining in arm's-length (parity) requirements on transfer pricing in that
   they can solidify commitments to a particular retail posture.

AB We study competitive marketplaces with multiple suppliers and multiple
   buyers dealing with a single product. A buyer chooses the supplier who
   offers the best price for his order pro. le, as described by his order
   size and delivery frequency. A supplier's offering price reflects her
   logistic cost structure as captured by relevant economies of scale in a
   "setup cost" component, and storage- and distribution-related costs in a
   "holding cost per unit" component. We argue that the matching of buyers'
   order profiles to suppliers' cost structures is the main source of
   supply chain coordination benefit in this many-to-many supply chain.
   Such cost-effective matching can be achieved naturally through price
   competition among suppliers. We identify the segment of the buyer's
   order space that each supplier can win, and perform market share
   sensitivity analysis when a supplier's cost structure changes. The
   winning supplier, at the equilibrium of price competition, offers the
   lowest price of her closest competitor instead of the lowest price she
   can offer.

AB We consider duopoly models where firms make decisions on capacity,
   production, and price under demand uncertainty. Capacity and price
   decisions are made, respectively, ex ante and ex post demand
   realizations. The interplay between the timings of demand realization
   and production decision endows firms with different capabilities.
   Flexible firms can postpone production decisions until the actual demand
   curve is observed, but inflexible firms cannot. Under general demand
   structures and cost functions, we characterize the equilibrium for a
   symmetric duopoly and establish the strategic equivalence of price and
   quantity competitions when firms are flexible. We investigate the
   stochastic order properties of capacity and profit and show that they
   both increase for a flexible firm when the market is more volatile. We
   find that flexibility allows a firm to increase investment in capacity
   and earn a higher profit while benefiting customers by keeping the price
   in a narrower range; strategic equivalence implies that these properties
   are robust to market conjectures. We also show that flexibility plays an
   important role in mitigating the destructive effect of competition when
   the demand shock is additive; the destructive effect is nonexistent for
   firms facing multiplicative demand shock. When flexibility decision is
   endogenous, a firm's strategic flexibility choice depends on the cost of
   technology as well as the nature of demand shock. In particular, faced
   with a multiplicative demand shock,firms always choose to be inflexible,
   whereas all the possible equilibria are observed under additive demand
   shocks.

AB In this paper, we explore how organizations influence the unethical
   behavior of their employees. Using a unique data set of over three
   million vehicle emissions tests, we find strong evidence of ethical
   spillovers from firms to individuals. When inspectors work across
   different organizations, they adjust the rate at which they pass
   vehicles to the norms of those with whom they work. These spillovers are
   strongest at large facilities and corporate chains, and weakest for the
   large-volume inspectors. These results are consistent with the economics
   literature on productivity spillovers from organizations and peers and
   suggest that managers can influence the ethics of employee behavior
   through both formal norms and incentives. The results also suggest that
   employees have persistent ethics that limit the magnitude of this
   influence. These results imply that if ethical conformity is important
   to the financial and legal health of the organization, managers must be
   vigilant in their hiring, training, and monitoring to ensure that

   formal standardization, the roles of standard-setting committees,

   context is Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), an international
   standards-development organization in the wireless telecommunication
   industry. Panel data analyses exploiting natural experiments caused by a
   consortium merger and entry of Asian firms suggest that participation in
   industry consortia increases firms' contributions to the development of
   new technical specifications in 3GPP committees. Moreover, connections
   to standard-setting peers formed in consortia facilitate change requests
   to ongoing specifications. These results suggest that if firms in
   network technology industries want to influence the evolution of their
   industry, they should identify both formal standard-setting committees
   and industry consortia in which they can discuss, negotiate, and align
   positions on technical features with their peers. For policymakers,
   these results suggest that it is important to ensure that technical
   consortia remain open for all industry actors and that membership fees

   by analyzing a dynamic general equilibrium model where some investors
   have rational expectations, whereas others have incorrect beliefs
   concerning the mean growth rate of the economy. The main result is that
   an investor can survive if and only if he has the lowest survival index,
   which is a function of his belief accuracy, patience parameter, and
   relative risk aversion coefficient. If preferences are held constant
   across all investors, then those with incorrect beliefs cannot survive
   in the limit, although calibrations reveal that the selection process is
   excessively slow. However, if preferences vary across investors, even
   slightly, it becomes possible for an irrational investor to dominate the

   This paper investigates an explanation of sales as a way for uninformed

   preferences. We investigate the role of the rate of consumer forgetting
   on the timing between sales, and of the rate of consumer learning and
   menu costs on the length of a sale. The rate of consumer forgetting can
   be linked to the length of purchase cycle and the level of consumer
   involvement. We show that the discount frequency and the discount depth
   are increasing in the rate of consumer forgetting, and that the discount
   frequency is increasing in the learning rate. The duration of a sale is
   increasing in the rate of consumer forgetting and the rate of consumer
   learning.

   evaluate the relationship between vertical integration and different
   dimensions of product performance. Outsourcing facilitates access to
   cutting-edge technology and the use of high-powered performance
   contracts. Vertical integration allows firms to adapt to unforeseen
   contingencies and customer feedback, maintain balanced incentives over
   the life cycle, and develop firm-specific capabilities over time.
   Together, these effects highlight a crucial trade-off: while outsourcing
   is associated with higher levels of initial performance, vertical
   integration will be associated with performance improvement over the
   product life cycle. We test these ideas using detailed data from the
   luxury automobile segment, establishing three key results. First,
   initial performance is declining in the level of vertical integration.
   Second, the level of performance improvement is significantly increasing
   in the level of vertical integration. Finally, the impact of vertical
   integration is mediated by the level of preexisting capabilities, by the
   salience of opportunities to access external technology leaders, and by
   the scope for learning over the product life cycle. Together, the
   findings highlight a strategic governance trade-off between short-term
   performance and the evolution of firm capabilities.

AB Agglomeration in foreign direct investment (FDI) is typically attributed
   to location-specific characteristics such as natural resource advantages
   or production-related spillovers between multinational firms. The
   increasing collocation of the largest global firms in the cement
   industry since the 1980s is not easily attributed to either of these
   explanations. This paper draws on theories of multimarket contact to
   test whether strategic interaction across national markets has
   influenced the successive market entry decisions generating the observed
   agglomeration. We first establish that there is indeed nonrandom
   agglomeration of the six largest cement firms. We next show that
   preexisting cross-market interaction with current incumbents helps
   predict which firm will enter a given market and also the choice of
   market a given firm enters. The association does not appear to be caused
   by strategic convergence or mimicry of recent entry events and cannot be
   explained by production side effects, which depend only on local
   conditions. The findings are consistent with multimarket contact models
   where collocation allows firms to sustain higher prices in all markets.
   This latter inference is also supported by evidence of an association
   between global firm market share and local cement price. The paper
   suggests that pricing spillovers can serve as an alternative motivation
   for FDI agglomeration.

   use a vendor-managed consignment inventory (VMCI) scheme to manage the

   formulate the problem as a Stackelberg game played by the manufacturer
   against her component suppliers to determine her pricing policy for
   suppliers' consignment inventories. We further develop an efficient

   for innovations with certain characteristics, it is optimal not to

   model emphasizes the role of embedded real options that arise from
   certain types of financial innovations. The model provides an

AB Firms introducing network technologies ( whose benefits depend on who
   installs the technology) need to understand which user characteristics
   confer the greatest network benefits on other potential adopters. To
   examine which adopter characteristics matter, I use the introduction of
   a video-messaging technology in an investment bank. I use data on its
   2,118 employees, their adoption decisions, and their 2.4 million
   subsequent calls. The video-messaging technology can also be used to
   watch TV. Exogenous shocks to the benefits of watching TV are used to
   identify the causal ( network) externality of one individual user's
   adoption on others' adoption decisions. I allow this network externality
   to vary in size with a variety of measures of informal and formal
   influence. I find that adoption by either managers or workers in
   "boundary spanner" positions has a large impact on the adoption
   decisions of employees who wish to communicate with them. Adoption by
   ordinary workers has a negligible impact. This suggests that firms
   should target those who derive their informal influence from occupying
   key boundary-spanning positions in communication networks, in addition
   to those with sources of formal influence, when launching a new network
   technology.

AB We study a market with customers who have heterogeneous preferences for
   product attributes. We consider two types of firms that compete on price
   and product variety: A traditional firm, which chooses a limited set of
   product configurations, and a customizing firm, which can produce any
   configuration to order. The traditional firm carries product inventories
   and experiences a lead-time delay. The customizing firm does not carry
   inventory, and its customers incur waiting costs until they receive
   their orders. We assume that the customizing firm has limited capacity
   in the short run ( e. g., when it does not outsource production to
   high-volume manufacturers). We derive the equilibrium for a duopoly
   competition between the customizing firm and the traditional firm, study
   its characteristics, and compare it to a monopoly. We characterize
   conditions that favor customization under competition. We find that the
   customizing firm's profit is not monotone in the market size and its
   ease of customization. Similarly, a decline in the traditional firm's
   holding cost may increase or decrease its profit. We show that the unit
   cost differential between the firms crucially affects the customizing
   firm's ideal market size, its returns from expanding capacity, its
   product variety, and the way operational improvements affect its

AB Absorptive capacity is the principle that assimilating new knowledge
   requires prior knowledge. The attendant prescription is to invest more
   in R&D to derive greater benefit from the R&D of others (spillovers).
   Empirical tests of R&D productivity typically find absorptive capacity
   (R&D* rival R&D) to be significant. This result poses a puzzle, however:
   What can a firm conducting 50% of industry R&D learn from a set of firms
   each conducting 5%? Aren't the laggard firms merely playing catch-up?
   Yet, if this is so, why is the interaction term significant?
   One possible resolution to this puzzle is that the correlation between
   R&D spending and returns is really about innate ability (IQ) rather than
   investment behavior (absorptive capacity). In this view the causality
   between capability and behavior is reversed. It is not that firms obtain
   higher returns by investing more in R & D; it is that some firms have
   higher returns to R&D, thus they invest more. I conduct an empirical
   test of the competing views and find that (1) firms differ in the output
   elasticities of their own R&D (IQ) as well as the elasticities of
   spillovers from rivals, (2) absorptive capacity becomes insignificant
   when accounting for that heterogeneity, (3) R&D investment increases
   with IQ, but (4) R&D investment has no impact on firm's ability to
   benefit from spillovers.

AB No-arbitrage models are extremely flexible modelling tools but often
   lack economic motivation. This paper describes an equilibrium
   consumption-based CAPM framework based on Epstein-Zin preferences, which
   produces analytic pricing formulas for stocks and bonds under the
   assumption that macro growth rates follow affine processes. This allows
   the construction of equilibrium pricing formulas while maintaining the
   same flexibility of state dynamics as in no-arbitrage models. In
   demonstrating the approach, the paper presents a model that incorporates
   inflation such that asset prices are nominal. The model takes advantage
   of the possibility of non-Gaussian shocks and model macroeconomic
   uncertainty as a jump-diffusion process. This leads to endogenous stock
   market crashes as stock prices drop to reflect a higher expected rate of
   return in response to sudden increases in risk. The nominal yield curve
   in this model has a positive slope if expected inflation growth
   negatively impacts real growth. This model also produces asset prices
   that are consistent with observed data, including a substantial equity
   premium at moderate levels of risk aversion.

   divided into the strong firm's loyal segment and the switching segment,
   members of which have heterogeneous tastes for the firms' products. In
   the presence of loyal consumers, for a large set of the parameters of
   the demand function, the firms use mixed strategies over a finite number
   of prices. These strategies can be interpreted as occurrences of sales.
   The most common case is that of the strong firm's using two prices and
   the weak firm's using one price. However, when both firms use sales, the
   weak firm promotes more often than the strong firm.

AB Good metrics are well-defined formulae (often involving averaging) that
   transmute multiple measures of raw numerical performance (e. g., dollar
   sales, referrals, number of customers) to create informative summary
   statistics (e. g., average share of wallet, average customer tenure).
   Despite myriad uses (benchmarking, monitoring, allocating resources,
   diagnosing problems, explanatory variables), most uses require metrics
   that contain information summarizing multiple observations. On this
   criterion, we show empirically (with people data) that although
   averaging has remarkable theoretical properties, supposedly inferior
   nonaveraging metrics (e. g., maximum, variance) are often better. We
   explain theoretically (with exact proofs) and numerically (with
   simulations) when and why. For example, when the environment causes a
   correlation between observed sample sizes (e. g., number of past
   purchases, projects, observations) and latent underlying parameters (e.
   g., the likelihood of favorable outcomes), the maximum statistic is a
   better metric than the mean. We refer to this environmental effect as
   the Muth effect, which occurs when rational markets provide more
   opportunities (i.e., more observations) to individuals and organizations
   with greater innate ability. Moreover, when environments are adverse (e.
   g., failure-rich), nonaveraging metrics correctly overweight favorable
   outcomes. We refer to this environmental effect as the Anna Karenina
   effect, which occurs when less-favorable outcomes convey less
   information. These environmental effects impact metric construction,
   selection, and employment.

   economic and statistical terms, when the stock price crosses either the
   upper or lower limit of its past trading range. This increase in volume
   is more pronounced the longer the time since the stock price last
   achieved the price extreme, the smaller the firm, the higher the
   individual investor interest in the stock, and the greater the ambiguity
   regarding valuation. These results are robust across model
   specifications and controls for past returns and news arrival. Volume
   spikes when price crosses either the upper or lower limit of the past
   trading range, then gradually subsides. After either event, returns are
   reliably positive and, among small investors, trades classified as
   buyer-initiated are elevated. Overall, results are more consistent with
   bounded rationality than with other candidate explanations.

AB We present a dynamic pricing model for oligopolistic firms selling
   differentiated perishable goods to multiple finite segments of strategic
   consumers who are aware that pricing is dynamic and may time their
   purchases accordingly. This model encompasses strategic behavior by both
   firms and consumers in a unified stochastic dynamic game in which each
   firm's objective is to maximize its total expected revenues, and each
   consumer responds according to a shopping-intensity-allocation consumer
   choice model. We prove the existence of a unique subgame-perfect
   equilibrium, provide equilibrium optimality conditions, and prove
   monotonicity results for special cases. The model provides insights
   about equilibrium price dynamics under different levels of competition,
   asymmetry between firms, and multiple market segments with varying
   properties. We demonstrate that strategic behavior by consumers can have
   serious impacts on revenues if firms ignore that behavior in their
   dynamic pricing policies. Moreover, ideal equilibrium responses to
   consumer strategic behavior can recover only a portion of the lost
   revenues. A key conclusion is that firms may benefit more from limiting
   the information available to consumers than from allowing full
   information and responding to the resulting strategic behavior in an
   optimal fashion.

   to determine consumer choice of channels. In this way, our results
   provide empirical support for many such models. In particular, we
   empirically examine the trade-off between the benefits of buying online
   and the benefits of buying in a local retail store. How does a
   consumer's physical location shape the relative benefits of buying from
   the online world? We explore this problem using data from Amazon.com on

   locally, people substitute away from online purchasing, even controlling
   for product-specific preferences by location. These estimates are
   economically large, suggesting that the disutility costs of purchasing
   online are substantial and that offline transportation costs matter. We
   also show that offline entry decreases consumers' sensitivity to online
   price discounts. However, we find no consistent evidence that the

AB This article makes a bridge between the theory of optimal auditing and
   the scoring methodology in an asymmetric information setting. Our
   application is meant for insurance claims fraud, but it can be applied
   to many other activities that use the scoring approach. Fraud signals
   are classified based on the degree to which they reveal an increasing
   probability of fraud. We show that the optimal auditing strategy takes
   the form of a "red flags strategy," which consists in referring claims
   to a special investigative unit (SIU) when certain fraud indicators are
   observed. The auditing policy acts as a deterrence device, and we
   explain why it requires the commitment of the insurer and how it should
   affect the incentives of SIU staffs. The characterization of the optimal
   auditing strategy is robust to some degree of signal manipulation by
   defrauders as well as to the imperfect information of defrauders about
   the audit frequency. The model is calibrated with data from a large
   European insurance company. We show that it is possible to improve our
   results by separating different groups of insureds with different moral
   costs of fraud. Finally, our results indicate how the deterrence effect
   of the audit scheme can be taken into account and how it affects the
   optimal auditing strategy.

AB In this work we introduce a class of measures for evaluating the quality
   of financial positions based on their ability to achieve desired
   financial goals. In the spirit of Simon (Simon, H. A. 1959. Theories of
   decision-making in economics and behavioral science. Amer. Econom. Rev.
   49(3) 253-283), we call these measures satisficing measures and show
   that they are dual to classes of risk measures. This approach has the
   advantage that aspiration levels, either competing benchmarks or fixed
   targets, are often much more natural to specify than risk tolerance
   parameters. In addition, we propose a class of satisficing measures that
   reward diversification. Finding optimal portfolios for such satisficing
   measures is computationally tractable. Moreover, this class of
   satisficing measures has an ambiguity interpretation in terms of robust
   guarantees on the expected performance because the underlying
   distribution deviates from the investor's reference distribution.
   Finally, we show some promising results for our approach compared to
   traditional methods in a real-world portfolio problem against a

AB Much of the literature on team learning views experience as a
   unidimensional concept captured by the cumulative production volume of,
   or the number of projects completed by, a team. Implicit in this
   approach is the assumption that teams are stable in their membership and
   internal organization. In practice, however, such stability is rare,
   because the composition and structure of teams often change over time
   (e.g., between projects). In this paper, we use detailed data from an
   Indian software services firm to examine how such changes may affect the
   accumulation of experience within, and the performance of teams. We and
   that the level of team familiarity (i.e., the average number of times
   that each member has worked with every other member of the team) has a
   significant positive effect on performance, but we observe that
   conventional measures of the experience of individual team members
   (e.g., years at the. firm) are not consistently related to performance.

AB There is an emerging debate in the scholarly literature regarding the
   extent to which academic human capital contributes to firm performance.
   This debate centers on the nature of an academic scientist's human
   capital and its institutional specificity. Using data on the human
   capital of biomedical scientists developed during their careers in
   academe, this paper analyzes how the depth of their scientifically and
   commercially oriented academic human capital contributes to firm
   performance when these scientists subsequently start or join for-profit
   firms. We find that the scientific and commercial components of an
   academic scientist's human capital have differential effects on the
   performance of research and invention tasks at the. firm. We also find
   that the contribution of an academic scientist to a firm's patent
   productivity is decreasing with the depth of their scientifically
   oriented human capital, all else constant. These results support the
   view that academic human capital is heterogeneous and has an
   institutional specificity that mediates its value when applied in a
   commercialization environment.

AB We investigate how dynamic resource substitution in service systems
   impacts capacity requirements and responsiveness. Inspired by the
   contrasting network strategies of FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS),
   we study when two service classes (e. g., express or regular) should be
   served by dedicated resources (e. g., air or ground) or by an integrated
   network (e. g., air also serves regular). Using call center terminology,
   the question is whether to operate two independent queues or one
   N-network. We present analytic expressions for the delay distributions
   and the value of network integration through partial resource pooling.
   These show how the value of network integration depends on service
   quality (speed and reliability of service) and demand characteristics
   (volume averages and covariance matrix). Our results suggest that
   network integration is of little value and operating dedicated networks
   is a fine strategy if the firm primarily serves express requests with
   high reliability and if the correlation with regular requests is not
   strongly negative. In contrast, network integration offers significant
   gains for firms serving primarily regular requests, almost independent
   of correlation. Our analysis provides the intuition behind these
   findings in terms of three main drivers of integration value: arrival
   pooling, the substitution effect, and the correlation effect.

AB We analyze the allocation of objects in a network of caches that
   collaborate to service requests from customers. A thorough analysis of
   this problem in centralized and decentralized setups, both of which
   occur in practice, is essential for understanding the benefits of
   collaboration. A key insight offered by this paper is that an efficient
   implementation of cooperative cache management is possible because, in
   the centralized scenario, the object allocation resulting in the best
   social welfare can be found easily as a solution to a transportation
   problem. For the decentralized scenario involving selfish caches, it is
   shown that pure equilibria exist and that the cache network always
   reaches a pure equilibrium in a finite number of steps, starting from
   any point in the strategy space. An auction mechanism is developed to
   derive prices that motivate the caches to hold objects in a manner such
   that the optimal social welfare is attained. In the special case of
   symmetric caches, simple algorithms are devised to find the optimal
   social welfare allocation, the best pure equilibrium, and the prices for
   sharing objects. The results obtained in this paper should be valuable
   in developing and evaluating cache-management policies. Resource-sharing
   problems with a similar cost structure exist in a variety of other
   domains, and the insights gained here are expected to extend to those
   scenarios as well.

AB Past research on the relationship between top management team (TMT)
   compositional diversity and organizational performance has paid
   insufficient attention to the nature of TMT team processes in
   interaction with TMT diversity. We fill this gap by studying how three
   team mechanisms (collaborative behavior, accurate information exchange,
   and decision-making decentralization) moderate the impact of TMT
   diversity on financial performance of 33 information technology firms.
   We focus on two fundamentally different forms of TMT diversity:
   functional-background (FB) and locus-of-control (LOC). We argue that the
   former has the potential to enhance decision quality and organizational
   performance, whereas the latter might trigger relational conflict, and
   is, therefore, potentially detrimental to firm effectiveness. The
   ultimate aim of our study is to analyze which team processes help to
   transform distributed FB knowledge into high-quality decisions and
   organizational effectiveness, and which help avoid the potential
   detrimental effects of LOC diversity. We find that a TMT's collaborative
   behavior and information exchange are necessary conditions to unleash
   the performance benefits of FB diversity, but do not interact with LOC
   diversity. In addition, decentralized decision making spurs the
   effectiveness of functionally diverse teams, while at the same time
   reinforces the negative consequences of LOC diversity on firm
   performance.

   information about supply disruptions. We investigate how risk-management
   strategies of the manufacturer change and examine whether
   risk-management tools are more or less valuable in the presence of such
   asymmetric information. We model a supply chain with one manufacturer
   and one supplier, in which the supplier's reliability is either high or
   low and is the supplier's private information. On disruption, the
   supplier chooses to either pay a penalty to the manufacturer for the
   shortfall or use backup production to fill the manufacturer's order.
   Using mechanism design theory, we derive the optimal contract menu
   offered by the manufacturer. We find that information asymmetry may
   cause the less reliable supplier type to stop using backup production
   while the more reliable supplier type continues to use it. Additionally,
   the manufacturer may stop ordering from the less reliable supplier type
   altogether. The value of supplier backup production for the manufacturer
   is not necessarily larger under symmetric information; for the more
   reliable supplier type, it could be negative. The manufacturer is
   willing to pay the most for information when supplier backup production
   is moderately expensive. The value of information may increase as
   supplier types become uniformly more reliable. Thus, higher reliability
   need not be a substitute for better information.

AB This paper contributes large-sample evidence to an emerging discussion
   on open innovation and firm strategy. We ask why a startup should
   participate in an open standards community. We propose four ways that
   participation might increase a startup's chances of a liquidity event:
   gaining endorsement of the startup's technology standard, openly
   developing the startup's technology within the community (but not
   necessarily gaining endorsement), simply attending physical meetings of
   the community, and having startup members elected to leadership
   positions. Examination of venture-funded startups in the networking/data
   communications industry sectors reveals that those startups that
   participate in an open standards community (the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF)) have a greater likelihood of an initial public
   offering or acquisition. The strongest effects are due to attendance,
   and conditional on high levels of attendance, holding leadership
   positions within the IETF. Surprisingly, standards endorsement is
   insignificant when controlling for simple physical attendance. These
   results are robust to instrumental variable methods and alternative
   coding of variables. In two-stage models we also find that prominent
   venture capitalists might help their portfolio companies by steering
   them to effective technology strategies, in this case active
   participation in the IETF, and not simply by lending status.

AB The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enacted Rule 10b5-1 to deter
   insiders from trading with private information, yet also protect
   insiders' preplanned, non-information-based trades from litigation.
   Despite its requirement that insiders plan trades when not privately
   informed, the rule appears to enable strategic trade. Participating
   insiders' sales systematically follow positive and precede negative firm
   performance, generating abnormal forward-looking returns larger than
   those earned by nonparticipating colleagues. The observed association
   does not appear to be explained by market transaction disclosure
   response, "predictable" reversion following positive performance, or
   general periodic price declines. There is evidence, however, that a
   substantive proportion of randomly drawn plan initiations are associated
   with pending adverse news disclosures. There is also evidence that early
   sales plan terminations are associated with pending positive performance
   shifts, reducing the likelihood that insiders' sales execute at low
   prices. Collectively, this suggests that, on average, trading within the
   rule does not solely reflect uninformed diversification.

   systems, maintaining the average queue length within a certain range is

   "congestion-based staffing," or CBS, where the number of servers
   (inspection booths) is adjusted according to the queue length during a

   of material handling equipment interruptions in a manufacturing or

   physics-based models for workflow interruptions permits evaluation of
   the expected link travel time. The problem is then of routing in a way
   that minimizes total expected travel time. The rerouting problem is
   modeled as a multicommodity flow problem with link capacity design. A
   greedy upper bounding and Lagrangean relaxation algorithm are developed
   to solve this efficiently. To calibrate our modeling process we develop
   an object-oriented simulation model that explicitly considers various
   workflow interruptions. Our major finding is that rerouting traffic in a
   congested facility can significantly alleviate congestion delays and
   improve the efficiency of material movement. A managerial insight
   derived from this work is that rerouting is most effective in medium

   determining the optimal amount of effort that should be exerted to
   maintain the system over a planning horizon (finite or infinite). Using
   the receiver operating characteristic curve to derive a measure for
   system performance, we maximize system value by balancing system
   benefits with maintenance costs. The problem is cast as an optimal
   control model in which the goal is to choose the timing and extent of
   maintenance that must be expended to maximize system value. We find that
   the optimal solution usually possesses a steady-state component. The

AB This paper examines complementarity among vertical integration decisions
   in automobile product development. Though most research assumes that
   contracting choices are independent of each other, contracting
   complementarity arises when the returns to a single vertical integration
   decision are increasing in the level of vertical integration associated
   with other contracting choices. First, effective coordination may depend
   on the level of (noncontractible) effort on the part of each agent;
   contracting complementarity results if coordination efforts are
   interdependent and vertical integration facilitates a higher level of
   noncontractible effort. Second, effective coordination may require the
   disclosure of proprietary trade secrets, and the potential for
   expropriation by external suppliers may induce complementarity among
   vertical integration choices. We provide evidence for complementarity in
   product development contracting by taking advantage of a detailed data
   set that includes the level of vertical integration and the contracting
   environment for individual automobile systems in the luxury automobile
   segment. Using an instrumental variables framework that distinguishes
   complementarity from unobserved firm-level factors, the evidence is
   consistent with the hypothesis that contracting complementarity is an
   important driver of vertical integration choices. The findings suggest
   that contracting complementarity may be particularly important when
   coordination is important to achieve but difficult to monitor.

AB This paper investigates the impact of e-waste regulation on new product
   introduction in a stylized model of the electronics industry.
   Manufacturers choose the development time and expenditure for each new
   version of a durable product, which together determine its quality.
   Consumers purchase the new product and dispose of the last-generation
   product, which becomes e-waste. The price of a new product strictly
   increases with its quality and consumers' rational expectation about the
   time until the next new product will be introduced. "Feeupon-sale" types
   of e-waste regulation cause manufacturers to increase their equilibrium
   development time and expenditure, and thus the incremental quality for
   each new product. As new products are introduced ( and disposed of) less
   frequently, the quantity of e-waste decreases and, even excluding the
   environmental benefits, social welfare may increase. Consumers pay a
   higher price for each new product because they anticipate using it for
   longer, which increases manufacturers' profits. Unfortunately, existing
   "fee-upon-sale" types of e-waste regulation fail to motivate
   manufacturers to design for recyclability. In contrast,
   "fee-upon-disposal" types of e-waste regulation such as individual
   extended producer responsibility motivate design for recyclability but,
   in competitive product categories, fail to reduce the frequency of new
   product introduction.

AB Consider an inventory system with multiple supply sources and Poisson
   demand. The replenishment lead times from each source are stochastic,
   representing congestion and disruption. We develop performance
   evaluation and optimization tools for a family of reasonable order
   policies. These policies take into account real-time supply information,
   which can be obtained through tracking technologies such as global
   positioning systems and radio frequency identification. Performance
   evaluation of such state-dependent policies is generally hard. The main
   thrust of this paper is to show that, under these policies, the supply
   system becomes a network of queues with a special routing mechanism
   called an over flow bypass. The solution has a simple product form.
   Thus, we obtain closed-form performance measures. These results
   reinterpret and extend the existing analysis of a system with two
   sources having deterministic lead times. We further extend the analysis
   to batch ordering policies, non-Poisson demand processes, and multiple
   demand classes.

AB Although spillovers are a crucial factor in determining the optimal
   environment for innovation, there is no consensus regarding their impact
   on. firm behavior. One reason for this may be that models differ in
   their assumptions for the functional form of the spillover pool. In
   industrial organization and economic geography, for example, the
   predominant convention is that all innovation within an industry/region
   contributes to a spillover pool that has a common value for all. firms.
   An alternative convention prevalent in endogenous growth and
   evolutionary economics is that spillovers have directionality-the size
   of the relevant pool differs across. firms.
   Knowing the correct functional form may facilitate theoretical
   consensus, either analytically (by modifying models' assumptions) or
   empirically (by supporting a critical test of competing theories). We
   characterize and test the functional form of spillover pools for
   efficiency-enhancing innovation across 50 markets in the banking
   industry. Our results in that setting are consistent with expectations
   for asymmetric spillovers but inconsistent with expectations for pooled
   spillovers.

AB This paper presents the. first formal examination of role of causal
   ambiguity as a barrier to imitation. Here, the aspiring imitator faces a
   knowledge (i.e., "capabilities-based") barrier to imitation that is both
   causal and ambiguous in a precise sense of both words. Imitation
   conforms to a well-explicated process of learning by observing. I
   provide a precise distinction between the intrinsic causal ambiguity
   associated with a particular strategy and the subjective ambiguity
   perceived by a challenger. I. find that intrinsic ambiguity is a
   necessary but insufficient condition for a sustained capability-based
   advantage. I also demonstrate that combinatorial complexity, a
   phenomenon that has attracted the recent attention of strategy
   theorists, and causal ambiguity are distinct barriers to imitation. The
   former acts as a barrier to explorative/active learning and the latter
   as one to absorptive/passive learning. One implication of this is that
   learning by doing and learning by observing are complementary strategic
   activities, not substitutes-in most cases, we should expect. firm
   strategies to seek performance enhancement using efforts of both types.

AB We study a single-product single-location inventory system under

   time is positive. The performance measure of interest is the long-run
   average holding cost and lost sales penalty cost. For a large class of
   demand distributions, we show that when the lost sales penalty becomes
   large compared to the holding cost, the relative difference between the
   cost of the optimal policy and the best order-up-to policy converges to
   zero. For any given cost parameters, we establish a bound on this
   relative difference. Numerical experiments show that the best
   order-up-to policy performs well, yielding an average cost that is
   within 1.5% of the optimal cost when the ratio between the lost sales
   penalty and the holding cost is 100. We also propose a heuristic
   order-up-to level using two newsvendor expressions; in our experiments,
   the cost of this order-up-to policy is 2.52% higher, on an average, than
   the best order-up-to policy.

AB Ranking and selection procedures are standard methods for selecting the
   best of a. finite number of simulated design alternatives based on a
   desired level of statistical evidence for correct selection. But the
   link between statistical significance and. financial significance is
   indirect, and there has been little or no research into it. This paper
   presents a new approach to the simulation selection problem, one that
   maximizes the expected net present value of decisions made when using
   stochastic simulation. We provide a framework for answering these
   managerial questions: When does a proposed system design, whose
   performance is unknown, merit the time and money needed to develop a
   simulation to infer its performance? For how long should the simulation
   analysis continue before a design is approved or rejected? We frame the
   simulation selection problem as a "stoppable" version of a Bayesian
   bandit problem that treats the ability to simulate as a real option
   prior to project implementation. For a single proposed system, we solve
   a free boundary problem for a heat equation that approximates the
   solution to a dynamic program that. finds optimal simulation project
   stopping times and that answers the managerial questions. For multiple
   proposed systems, we extend previous Bayesian selection procedures to
   account for discounting and simulation-tool development costs.

AB The importance of material. flow management for a profit-maximizing.
   firm has been well articulated in the supply chain literature. We
   demonstrate in our analytical model that a. firm must also actively
   manage information. flows within the supply chain, which translates to
   controlling what it knows, as well as what its competitors and suppliers
   know. In our model of horizontal competition between an informed and an
   uninformed. firm with a common upstream supplier, material and
   information. flows intersect through leakage of demand (order)
   information to unintended recipients. As a result, the informed. firm's
   drive to control information. flows within the supply chain can trigger
   operational losses through material. flow distortion. These losses can
   be so severe that the. firm may prefer not to acquire information even
   when it is costless to do so. Our results underscore the importance of
   strategic information management-actively managing the supply chain's
   information. flows, and making trade-offs with material. flows where
   appropriate, to maximize profits.

AB Given a discrete maximization problem with a linear objective function
   where the coefficients are chosen randomly from a distribution, we would
   like to evaluate the expected optimal value and the marginal
   distribution of the optimal solution. We call this the persistency
   problem for a discrete optimization problem under uncertain objective,
   and the marginal probability mass function of the optimal solution is
   named the persistence value. In general, this is a difficult problem to
   solve, even if the distribution of the objective coefficient is well
   specified. In this paper, we solve a subclass of this problem when the
   distribution is assumed to belong to the class of distributions defined
   by given marginal distributions, or given marginal moment conditions.
   Under this model, we show that the persistency problem maximizing the
   expected objective value over the set of distributions can be solved via
   a concave maximization model. The persistency model solved using this
   formulation can be used to obtain important qualitative insights to the
   behavior of stochastic discrete optimization problems. We demonstrate
   how the approach can be used to obtain insights to problems in discrete
   choice modeling. Using a set of survey data from a transport choice
   modeling study, we calibrate the random utility model with choice
   probabilities obtained from the persistency model. Numerical results
   suggest that our persistency model is capable of obtaining estimates
   that perform as well, if not better, than classical methods, such as
   logit and cross-nested logit models. We can also use the persistency
   model to obtain choice probability estimates for more complex choice
   problems. We illustrate this on a stochastic knapsack problem, which is
   essentially a discrete choice problem under budget constraint.

AB Preference between two future outcomes may change over time-a phenomenon
   labeled as time inconsistency. The term "time inconsistency" is usually
   used to refer to cases in which a larger-later outcome is preferred over
   a smaller-sooner one when both are delayed by some time, but then with
   the passage of time a preference switches to the smaller-sooner outcome.
   The current paper presents four empirical studies showing that time
   inconsistency in the other direction is also possible: A person may
   prefer the smaller-sooner outcome when both options are in the future,
   but decide to wait for the larger-later one when the smaller option
   becomes immediately available. We. find that such "reverse time
   inconsistency" is more likely to be observed when the delays to and
   between the two outcomes are short (up to a week). We propose that
   reverse time inconsistency may be associated with a reversed-S shape
   discount function, and provide evidence that such a discount function
   captures part of the variation in intertemporal preferences.

   is generalized to a multivariate (Dirichlet) construction, bridging
   "simultaneously" over all time partition points of the trajectory of a
   gamma process. The generation of the increments of the gamma process,
   given its value at the terminal point, is interpreted as a Dirichlet
   partition of the unit interval. The increments are generated in a
   decreasing stochastic order and, under the Kingman limit, have a known
   distribution. Thus, simulation of a trajectory from the gamma process
   requires generating only a small number of uniforms, avoiding the
   expensive simulation of beta variates via numerical probability integral
   inversion. The proposed method is then applied in simulating the
   trajectory of a VG process using its difference-of-gammas
   representation. It has been implemented in both plain Monte Carlo and
   quasi-Monte Carlo environments. It is tested in pricing lookback,
   barrier, and Asian options and is shown to provide consistent efficiency
   gains, compared to the sequential method and the difference-of-gammas
   bridge sampling proposed by Avramidis and L'Ecuyer (Avramidis, A. N., P.

AB We consider a retailer that sells a product with uncertain demand over
   a. finite selling season. The retailer sets an initial stocking quantity
   and, at some predetermined point in the season, optimally marks down
   remaining inventory. We modify this classic setting by introducing three
   types of consumers: myopic consumers, who always purchase at the initial
   full price; bargain-hunting consumers, who purchase only if the
   discounted price is sufficiently low; and strategic consumers, who
   strategically choose when to make their purchase. A strategic consumer
   chooses between a purchase at the initial full price and a later
   purchase at an uncertain markdown price. In equilibrium, strategic
   consumers and the retailer make optimal decisions given their rational
   expectations regarding future prices, availability of inventory, and the
   behavior of other consumers. We. find that the retailer stocks less,
   takes smaller price discounts, and earns lower profit if strategic
   consumers are present than if there are no strategic consumers. We. find
   that a retailer should generally avoid committing to a price path over
   the season (assuming such commitment is feasible)-committing to a
   markdown price (or to not mark down at all) is often too costly
   (inventory may remain unsold) even in the presence of strategic
   consumers; the better approach is to be cautious with the initial
   quantity and then mark down optimally. Furthermore, we discuss the value
   of quick response (the ability to procure additional inventory after
   obtaining updated demand information, albeit at a higher unit cost than
   the initial order). We. find that the value of quick response to a
   retailer is generally much greater in the presence of strategic
   consumers than without them: on average 67% more valuable and as much as
   558% more valuable in our sample. In other words, although it is well
   established in the literature that quick response provides value by
   allowing better matching of supply with demand, it provides more value,
   often substantially more value, by allowing a retailer to control the
   negative consequences of strategic consumer behavior.

   manipulation among tech firms, small firms, and firms with high stock
   price volatility. In addition, firms that use smaller (non-big-five)

AB This paper extends the theoretical literature on firms' optimal
   information strategies to the situation when a firm's management
   attention capacity to process available data is scarce. In this case, a
   firm's optimal market intelligence strategy must trade off learning a
   little about a broad range of markets (a broad strategy) with gaining a
   very deep understanding of one or a few markets (a focused strategy).
   This trade-off is not present when data are scarce, an assumption made
   in most of the existing literature on optimal information search
   strategies. However, in data-rich environments, which are of increasing
   relevance given technology changes, we show a focused market
   intelligence strategy is always best when managers need to process a
   substantial amount of data before beginning to gain insights; i.e.,
   there are increasing returns to attention. Interestingly, this focused
   strategy can also be best with decreasing returns to attention when (a)
   managers are sufficiently efficient in processing the available data and
   (b) managers have sufficiently strong initial priors on the unknown
   market parameters. We show a broad market intelligence strategy is only
   optimal when new data points are sufficiently redundant, i.e., when the
   learning rate is sufficiently decreasing with the allocation of more
   attention. Our results also indicate that advances in information
   technology can account for the pressure on firms to become more focused
   and that competition increases the likelihood of a focused strategy.
   Competition can lead to asymmetric outcomes where firms focus on
   different markets. Finally, we note that a focused market intelligence
   strategy, and thus an asymmetric allocation of attention, does not
   require a priori differences between firms, markets, or market-specific
   core capabilities. Consequently, a focused market intelligence strategy
   can result in market-specific core competencies and produce firm
   differences from equivalent starting conditions.

   targeted their research and development (R&D) at small improvements of
   existing compounds instead of riskier drastic innovations. In this
   paper, we show that the bias in the pharmaceutical industry toward small
   innovations might be driven by the low sensitivity of the demand. In
   particular, small innovations get a proportionally larger reward because
   pharmaceutical firms target them at the inelastic segments of the
   demand. As a consequence, firms find it relatively more pro. table to
   invest in small innovations. We also study the effect on R&D incentives
   of marketing strategies and regulatory instruments aimed at controlling

AB We consider a decentralized assembly system in which a buyer purchases
   components from several first-tier suppliers. We examine the dynamics of
   suppliers' investments in cost-reduction initiatives over the life cycle
   of a product under different procurement approaches. We model the
   suppliers' investment decisions under cost-contingent contracts, with
   wholesale prices determined on the basis of the prevailing component
   costs, as a dynamic game in closed-loop strategies. We show that there
   always exists an equilibrium in which the suppliers' investments are
   synchronized, that is, in each period either all suppliers invest in
   process improvement or no supplier does. We also consider target-price
   contracts, under which the assembler announces the rate of component
   cost reduction to be achieved over the product's life cycle at the
   beginning of the contractual relationship. We show that target-price
   contracts lead to higher investment levels and profits if the rates are
   properly specified. In general, the equilibrium investments of the
   suppliers are lower than those under centralized control. The buyer can
   eliminate this inefficiency by subsidizing a certain fraction of the
   costs of investments. We extend the model to a setting with two
   competing assemblers and knowledge spillover at the suppliers. We find
   that the level of inefficiency under decentralized control decreases
   with increased competition and spillover rate.

AB Group decision making provides a mechanism for channeling individual
   members' knowledge into productive organizational outcomes. However, in
   hidden pro. le experiments in which group members have common
   information favoring an inferior choice, with private information
   favoring a superior choice, groups typically choose an inferior
   alternative. We report a hidden profile experiment where we induce
   homogenous preferences over choice characteristics and provide financial
   incentives so that the common purpose assumptions of the model hold more
   completely than in past experiments.
   Nevertheless, groups continue to choose an inferior alternative most of
   the time. These failures primarily result from mistakes in recalling
   information. Mistakes in recalling common information (which favors an
   inferior candidate) are typically corrected, whereas mistakes in
   recalling the private information needed to uncover the hidden pro. le
   cannot be corrected. Therefore, the dismal performance of groups in
   pooling the information needed to identify the superior option primarily
   result from the structure of the problem rather than deficiencies in how
   groups share and process information. The discussions necessary to
   resolve mistakes in recalling common information also help to explain

AB Scoring rules can provide incentives for truthful reporting of
   probabilities and evaluation measures for the probabilities after the
   events of interest are observed. Often the space of events is ordered
   and an evaluation relative to some baseline distribution is desired.
   Scoring rules typically studied in the literature and used in practice
   do not take account of any ordering of events, and they evaluate
   probabilities relative to a default baseline distribution. In this
   paper, we construct rich families of scoring rules that are strictly
   proper (thereby encouraging truthful reporting), are sensitive to
   distance (thereby taking into account ordering of events), and
   incorporate a baseline distribution relative to which the value of a
   forecast is measured. In particular, we extend the power and
   pseudospherical families of scoring rules to allow for sensitivity to
   distance, with or without a specified baseline distribution.

AB Studies of career dynamics implicitly claim that government employees
   are not entrepreneurial. Utilizing longitudinal data from the U. S.
   Panel Study for Income Dynamics, we investigate the reasons for the low
   rate of entrepreneurship from the public sector. We conjecture that it
   is due to labor market matching processes and the bureaucratic nature of
   public organizations and bureaucratization of individuals. Our
   life-course analysis identifies labor market matching as a major
   determinant: nonentrepreneurial types choose public sector employment.
   We also uncover tenure and context effects, which decrease and increase
   the hazard rate of entrepreneurial exit, respectively. Whereas the
   former effect points toward adaptation and internal labor market
   sorting, the latter draws attention to exits due to frustration.

AB We develop a model for the competitive interactions in service
   industries where firms cater to multiple customer classes or market
   segments with the help of shared service facilities or processes so as
   to exploit pooling benefits. Different customer classes typically have
   distinct sensitivities to the price of service as well as the delays
   encountered. In such settings firms need to determine (i) the prices
   charged to all customer classes; (ii) the waiting time standards, i. e.,
   expected steady state waiting time promised to all classes; (iii) the
   capacity level; and (iv) a priority discipline enabling the firm to meet
   the promised waiting time standards under the chosen capacity level, all
   in an integrated planning model that accounts for the impact of the
   strategic choices of all competing firms. We distinguish between three
   types of competition: depending on whether firms compete on the basis of
   their prices only, waiting time standards only, or on the basis of
   prices and waiting time standards. We establish in each of the three
   competition models that a Nash equilibrium exists under minor conditions
   regarding the demand volumes. We systematically compare the equilibria
   with those achieved when the firms service each market segment with a
   dedicated service process.

AB Prior research suggests that equity joint ventures (JVs) are
   particularly effective vehicles for accessing complex technology.
   Different schools of thought have emphasized different reasons why joint
   ventures might support greater knowledge transfer than "bare" license
   agreements: incentive alignment, organizational embeddedness, and
   enhanced administrative controls. We probe and re. ne these theoretical
   perspectives, drawing out implications of the different theories for the
   extent and speed of alliance-related knowledge transfer, as well as for
   knowledge "leakage" in areas not directly related to alliance
   activities. Using a proprietary data set derived from regulatory filings
   with the Japanese government we test these implications in our empirical
   analysis of U.S.-Japan agreements. The picture that emerges from the
   analysis is one of particularly intense but contained knowledge transfer
   in equity joint ventures, relative to bare license agreements: knowledge
   transfers directly related to the alliance activity are enhanced in the
   JV, and the speed of integration into the Japanese firm's subsequent
   innovations also increases. In marked contrast, leakage of unrelated
   technology is significantly reduced. These findings suggest that
   administrative structures that reduce technology leakage are a key
   feature of the equity joint venture, a result that is inconsistent with
   a "pure" knowledge-based perspective on alliances.

   affordable interventions against prevalent diseases. However, due to the
   dynamics of infectious disease eradication, policies focusing on a

   outcomes. Using a hypothetical two-disease dynamic transmission model,
   we explore several different decision rules with respect to vaccination
   policy for eradicable diseases. The simulations show that
   cost-effectiveness decreases as the extent of priority shifting
   increases. This model suggests the need for a longer-term dynamic

AB Most induction algorithms for building predictive models take as input
   training data in the form of feature vectors. Acquiring the values of
   features may be costly, and simply acquiring all values may be wasteful
   or prohibitively expensive. Active feature-value acquisition (AFA)
   selects features incrementally in an attempt to improve the predictive
   model most cost-effectively. This paper presents a framework for AFA
   based on estimating information value. Although straightforward in
   principle, estimations and approximations must be made to apply the
   framework in practice. We present an acquisition policy, sampled
   expected utility (SEU), that employs particular estimations to enable
   effective ranking of potential acquisitions in settings where relatively
   little information is available about the underlying domain. We then
   present experimental results showing that, compared with the policy of
   using representative sampling for feature acquisition, SEU reduces the
   cost of producing a model of a desired accuracy and exhibits consistent
   performance across domains. We also extend the framework to a more
   general modeling setting in which feature values as well as class labels
   are missing and are costly to acquire.

   scenario, each stage can access the inventory and cost information
   within its echelon (comprising the stage itself and all downstream
   stages); in the local scenario, each stage only accesses its own local
   information. Finally, in the quasilocal scenario, each stage knows its
   local information, plus the actual customer demands. We propose
   coordination schemes that regulate the stages to achieve the supply
   chain's optimal cost under each information setting. All these
   coordination schemes fit comfortably within an emerging practice called
   supply chain finance, which includes the organization and technology
   needed to implement them.

AB This paper examines the effect of recommender systems on the diversity
   of sales. Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe
   recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase
   sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the
   popularity of already-popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile
   these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways.
   First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore
   their path-dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase
   the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual
   implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results.
   First, some well-known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales
   diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters)
   recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend
   products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated
   favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer
   effect for popular products and vice versa for unpopular ones. This bias
   toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better
   consumer-product matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to
   consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new
   products. In line with this, result two shows that it is possible for
   individual-level diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to
   decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they
   often push users toward the same products. Third, we show how basic
   design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose
   recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and
   consumers' preferences.

AB This paper studies the role of product availability in attracting
   consumer demand. We start with a newsvendor model, but additionally
   assume that stockouts are costly to consumers. The seller sets an
   observable price and an unobservable stocking quantity. Consumers
   anticipate the likelihood of stockouts and determine whether to visit
   the seller. We characterize the rational expectations equilibrium in
   this game. We propose two strategies that the seller can use to improve
   profits: (i) commitment (i.e., the seller, ex ante, commits to a
   particular quantity) and (ii) availability guarantees (i.e., the seller
   promises to compensate consumers, ex post, if the product is out of
   stock). Interestingly, the seller has an incentive to overcompensate
   consumers during stockouts, relative to the first-best benchmark under
   which social welfare is maximized. We find that first-best outcomes do
   not arise in equilibrium, but can be supported when the seller uses a
   combination of commitment and availability guarantees. Finally, we
   examine the robustness of these conclusions by extending our analysis to
   incorporate dynamic learning, multiple products, and consumer
   heterogeneity.

AB W e develop and test an optimization model for maximizing response rates
   for online marketing research survey panels. The model consists of (1) a
   decision tree predictive model that classifies panelists into "states"
   and forecasts the response rate for panelists in each state and (2) a
   linear program that specifies how many panelists should be solicited
   from each state to maximize response rate. The model is forward looking
   in that it optimizes over a finite horizon during which S studies are to
   be fielded. It takes into account the desired number of responses for
   each study, the likely migration pattern of panelists between states as
   they are invited and respond or do not respond, as well as demographic
   requirements. The model is implemented using a rolling horizon whereby
   the optimal solution for S successive studies is derived and implemented
   for the first study. Then, as results are observed, an optimal solution
   is derived for the next S studies, and the solution is implemented for
   the first of these studies, etc. The procedure is field tested and shown
   to increase response rates significantly compared to the heuristic
   currently being used by panel management. Further analysis suggests that
   the improvement was due to the predictive model and that a "greedy
   algorithm" would have done equally well in the field test. However,
   further Monte Carlo simulations suggest circumstances under which the
   model would outperform the greedy algorithm.

AB A criticism of mechanism design theory is that the optimal mechanism
   designed for one environment can produce drastically different actions,
   outcomes, and payoffs in a second, even slightly different, environment.
   In this sense, the theoretically optimal mechanisms usually studied are
   not "robust." To study robust mechanisms while maintaining an expected
   utility maximization approach, we study a multiagent model in which the
   mechanism must be designed before the environment is as well understood
   as is usually assumed. The particular model is of an auction setting
   with binary private values. Our main result is that if the prior belief
   about the correlation in the agents' values is diffuse enough, the
   optimal Bayesian-Nash auction must also satisfy dominant strategy
   incentive constraints. Furthermore, when the optimal auction does
   provide dominant strategy incentives, it takes one of two forms: (i) if
   perfect correlation and negative correlation are excluded as
   possibilities, the auction incorporates all information about the prior
   belief over the possible correlations, and (ii) if either perfect
   correlation or negative correlation is a possibility, the auction does
   not incorporate any correlation information and can be described as a
   modified Vickrey auction.

AB We examine the procurement process selection problem of a large
   industrial buyer who employs reverse auctions for awarding procurement
   contracts. We contrast two classes of commonly used strategies under
   multiple sourcing; namely, single-stage reverse auctions, and two-stage
   processes where price-quantity adjustments between the buyer and the
   suppliers follow a first-stage reverse auction. Deriving bounds of
   efficiency for these two classes of procurement processes under convex
   supplier production costs, we present insights on the conditions under
   which each class is preferable for the buyer. Considering the effect of
   contracting and processing costs, a single-stage process is likely to be
   preferable to a two-stage process when the number of bidding suppliers
   is high, especially when capacity is rigid. A two-stage process with one
   information transfer in the second stage may be the preferred
   procurement mode when production is highly scalable, i.e., when the
   marginal production cost increase with increased production is small.
   When the number of suppliers is low, the effect of a decrease in
   production scalability depends on the current scalability level. For
   high scalability levels, a decrease in production scalability may
   decrease the efficiency of both single-stage and simple two-stage
   processes, whereas for low scalability levels, it tends to increase
   efficiency for both of these process classes. A decrease in production
   costs makes employing simple processes more attractive when production
   is highly scalable or when supplier capacity is rigid. For intermediate
   production scalability, however, a cost decrease may make employing
   two-stage processes with multiple information transfers in the second
   round preferable for the buyer.

AB The value of information sharing and how it could address the bullwhip
   effect have been the subject of studies in the literature. Most of these
   studies used different forms of demand models, assuming that no order
   smoothing was used by the retailer and that the supplier has full
   knowledge of the retailer's demand model and order policy. In this
   paper, we contribute to the literature by starting with a most general
   demand model, coupled with a smoothing policy for order variability
   control. In addition, we do not require that the supplier has full
   knowledge of the retailer's demand model and order policy, but instead
   let the retailer share its projected future orders (and freely revise
   them as the retailer sees fit). Under such a setting, we first obtain a
   unifying formula for the magnitude of the bullwhip effect. The formula
   indicates that it is the forecast correlation over the exposure period
   as a whole that determines the magnitude of the bullwhip effect. We then
   quantify the value of information sharing and generalize the existing
   results in the literature. Finally, we explore the optimal smoothing
   parameters that could bene fit the total supply chain. The resulting
   optimal policy resembles the postponement strategy. We find that
   information sharing together with order postponement improves the supply
   chain performance, even though the order variability may amplify in some
   cases.

   weights rather than on moments of asset returns. Finally, we compare

AB In this paper, we consider a periodic review inventory problem where
   demand in each period is modeled by linear regression. We use a Bayesian
   formulation to update the regression parameters as new information
   becomes available. We find that a state-dependent base-stock policy is
   optimal and we give structural results. One interesting finding is that
   our structural results are not analogous to classical results in
   Bayesian inventory research. This departure from classical results is
   due to the role that the independent variables play in the Bayesian
   regression formulation. Because of the computational complexity of the
   optimal policy, we propose a combination of two heuristics that
   simplifies the Bayesian inventory problem. Through analytical and
   numerical evaluation, we find that the heuristics provide near-optimal
   results.

AB Improved classification performance has practical real-world benefits
   ranging from improved effectiveness in detecting diseases to increased
   efficiency in identifying firms that are committing financial fraud.
   Multiclassifier combination (MCC) aims to improve classification
   performance by combining the decisions of multiple individual
   classifiers. In this paper, we present information market-based fusion
   (IMF), a novel multiclassifier combiner method for decision fusion that
   is based on information markets. In IMF, the individual classifiers are
   implemented as participants in an information market where they place
   bets on different object classes. The reciprocals of the market odds
   that minimize the difference between the total betting amount and the
   potential payouts for different classes represent the MCC probability
   estimates of each class being the true object class. By using a
   market-based approach, IMF can adjust to changes in base-classifier
   performance without requiring offline training data or a static ensemble
   composition. Experimental results show that when the true classes of
   objects are only revealed for objects classified as positive, for low
   positive ratios, IMF outperforms three benchmarks combiner methods,
   majority, average, and weighted average; for high positive ratios, IMF
   outperforms majority and performs on par with average and weighted
   average. When the true classes of all objects are revealed, IMF
   outperforms weighted average and majority and marginally outperforms
   average.

   electronic data interchange (EDI) and the Internet. Using purchase and
   fulfillment records from the U. S. government's Federal Supply Service,
   we provide a direct comparison of performance between a private network
   EDI channel and an Internet electronic market. Performance is measured
   using order cycle time and complete orders fulfilled. Our findings show
   that the Internet-based electronic market outperforms the EDI-based
   channel on these two important measures. Order cycle times were
   significantly lower when using the Internet-based electronic market,
   whereas the percentage of complete shipments was significantly higher
   after controlling for product, transaction, seller, and buyer-specific
   factors. The electronic market even outperforms the EDI channel when
   buyer and transaction characteristics favor the use of EDI. Because EDI
   is still prevalent in many industries, these results point to the gains
   that may be realized by switching to the newer technology.

AB Prospect theory is currently the main descriptive theory of decision
   under uncertainty. It generalizes expected utility by introducing
   nonlinear decision weighting and loss aversion. A difficulty in the
   study of multiattribute utility under prospect theory is to determine
   when an attribute yields a gain or a loss. One possibility, adopted in
   the theoretical literature on multiattribute utility under prospect
   theory, is to assume that a decision maker determines whether the
   complete outcome is a gain or a loss. In this holistic evaluation,
   decision weighting and loss aversion are general and
   attribute-independent. Another possibility, more common in the empirical
   literature, is to assume that a decision maker has a reference point for
   each attribute. We give preference foundations for this
   attribute-specific evaluation where decision weighting and loss aversion
   are depending on the attributes.

AB Whereas a number of studies have considered the implications of employee
   mobility, comparatively little research has considered institutional
   factors governing the ability of employees to move from one firm to
   another. This paper explores a legal constraint on mobility-employee
   non-compete agreements-by exploiting Michigan's apparently inadvertent
   1985 reversal of its non-compete enforcement policy as a natural
   experiment. Using a differences-in-differences approach, and controlling
   for changes in the auto industry central to Michigan's economy, we find
   that the enforcement of non-competes indeed attenuates mobility.
   Moreover, non-compete enforcement decreases mobility more sharply for
   inventors with firm-specific skills and for those who specialize in
   narrow technical fields. The results speak to the literature on employee
   mobility while offering a credibly exogenous source of variation that
   can extend previous research on the implications of such mobility.

AB We examine the extent to which employment horizon concerns affect the

   in annual bonus plans. We argue that managers of loss-making firms are
   likely to voluntarily or forcibly depart in the near future and,
   consequently, have a shorter employment horizon. Loss-making firms then
   need to increase the emphasis on forward-looking nonfinancial
   performance measures to motivate long-term effort of their managers.
   Thus, we hypothesize that the emphasis on nonfinancial performance
   measures is greater in loss making than in profitable firms even after
   controlling for the informativeness of earnings. We find consistent
   support for our hypothesis using different (archival, survey, and field)
   data sources and various proxies for short employment horizon and the
   emphasis on nonfinancial performance measures.

AB Formal contracting addresses the moral hazard problems inherent in
   interfirm deals via explicit terms designed to achieve incentive
   alignment. Alternatively, when firms expect to interact repeatedly,
   relational mechanisms may achieve similar results without the associated
   costs. However, as we now know from a growing body of theoretical and
   empirical work, the resulting intuition-that relational mechanisms will
   be substituted for formal ones whenever possible-does not generally
   hold. The extent to which firms substitute relational mechanisms for
   formal ones in the presence of repeated interaction is an empirical
   question that forms the basis of this paper. We study a sample of 52
   joint technology development contracts in the telecommunications and
   microelectronics industries and devise a coding scheme to allow
   empirical comparison of contract terms. Counter to the above intuition
   (but consistent with recent research), we find that a firm's contracts
   are more detailed and more likely to include penalties when it engages
   in frequent deals (whether with the same or different partners). Our
   results suggest complementarity between formal and relational contracts,
   and have implications for optimal contracting, particularly in high
   technology sectors.

AB Firms routinely face the challenging decision of whether to enter a new
   market where a firm's strong presence in an existing market has a
   positive influence (the leverage effect) on product adoption in the new
   market, but the reciprocal social influence on the existing market is
   negative (the backlash effect). In this paper, we show that a firm's
   optimal entry strategy in this situation cannot be characterized by the
   familiar "now or never" or "now or at maturity" strategies proposed in
   the literature. We show that a strong leverage effect does not
   necessarily provide the justification for a firm to enter a new market,
   and neither should a strong backlash effect necessarily deter a firm
   from embracing a new market. The optimal strategy is predicated on a
   judicious trade-off between the three factors of leverage, backlash, and
   patience. Thus, an astute manager can always find the opportune time to
   enter the new market if she takes into account the dynamic and recursive
   nature of cross-market interaction effects, where leverage enhances the
   backlash but backlash weakens the leverage in a nonlinear, dynamic
   fashion. We illustrate that firms stand to benefit from explicit
   considerations of these effects in deciding whether and when to enter a
   new market. Furthermore, we explore how the optimal time of entry into
   the new market relates to the time of peak sales for the existing
   market, demonstrating that depending on the interactive effects of
   leverage and backlash, entry could be optimal either before or after
   peak sales in the existing market.

AB Many markets that have traditionally relied on collocation of buyers,
   sellers, and products have introduced electronic channels. Although
   these electronic channels may provide benefits to buyers and sellers by
   lowering the transaction costs of participating in the market, there are
   trade-offs related to quality uncertainty and increased risk that may
   limit the adoption of the electronic channels. As a result, buyers and
   sellers use physical channels for some transactions and electronic
   channels for others. These usage patterns may evolve over time,
   particularly when the electronic channels are new. We examine buyer and
   seller use of electronic and physical channels in a market for products
   of uncertain quality (used vehicles) over a 2.5-year period. Results
   indicate that transactions involving low quality uncertainty and
   relatively rare products occurred in the electronic channels, whereas
   transactions involving high quality uncertainty and relatively plentiful
   products occurred in the physical channels. These patterns became
   clearer over time as buyers and sellers gained experience with the
   electronic channels. The electronic channels led to discounts for
   products of high quality uncertainty, but not for those of low quality
   uncertainty.

AB Previous research suggests firms can build a market share advantage by
   preempting later entrants with a broad product line and expanding
   rapidly into related markets. Whether such a strategy leads to a
   pioneering profit advantage relative to followers also depends on its
   cost effects. In this paper, we examine when the market share advantage
   of a pioneering firm with a broad product line strategy translates into
   a profit advantage by examining the cost effects of this strategy. Using
   the profit impact of marketing strategies data and an estimation method
   that controls for various unobserved factors, we find significant
   differences between different industry settings. From these contrasting
   findings, we generate an emerging theoretical framework that we subject
   to empirical testing. We conjecture, and empirically verify, that
   creating a broad product line with a versioning strategy-creating
   variety from a standard product in anticipating customer demand-does not
   increase the pioneering cost disadvantage, and thus results in a
   pioneering profit advantage. On the other hand, with a tailoring
   strategy-creating variety by customizing a product to actual customer
   demand-a broad product line substantially increases the pioneering cost
   disadvantage, thereby making a preemption strategy counterproductive.

AB Name-your-own-price (NYOP) retailers, such as Priceline, offer an
   alternative distribution channel for service providers in the travel
   industry such as airlines, hotels, and car rental companies. Our
   research employs an analytical model to identify and understand key
   trade-offs driving the decision by a service provider to employ an NYOP
   channel, assuming that such a channel is available. This decision
   requires the existence of forces that counteract the adverse
   consequences of cannibalization of sales through traditional
   posted-price channels. Our analysis provides some insight into these
   forces. Contracting with the NYOP retailer facilitates market
   segmentation and price discrimination, and allows for disposal of excess
   capacity after meeting business travel demand. However, the cost of this
   flexibility is that the service provider can no longer credibly
   precommit to maintaining high prices when there is unsold capacity.
   Also, when contracting with an independent retailer, the service
   provider is unable to extract the entire revenue generated from NYOP
   consumers. A key insight from our model is that the rationale for
   contracting with an NYOP retailer is driven by the uncertainty in
   business travel demand, not the expectation of excess capacity. Indeed,
   all else equal, the larger the capacity, the less likely it is that
   contracting with an NYOP retailer is the right decision on the part of
   the service provider.

   and without incentive alignment) and barter conjoint. The studies
   employed a total of three product categories, each with two validation
   tasks (one follows immediately and one conducted two weeks later). Our
   results confirmed prior research that incentive alignment, in general,
   substantially improves out-of-sample predictive performance of CBC.
   Furthermore, we found barter conjoint performs substantially better than
   the incentive-aligned CBC. However, in the spirit of "no free lunch,"
   barter conjoint is more taxing (in various ways) than CBC, suggesting a
   potential trade-off between consumer resource allocation (at the time of
   the task) and (managerial) predictive accuracy downstream. Given that
   this is the first study on barter conjoint, we discuss various

AB The internal rate of return (IRR) is a venerable technique for
   evaluating deterministic cash flow streams. Part of the difficulty in
   extending this measure to stochastic cash flows is the lack of coherent
   methods for accounting for multiple or nonexistent internal rates of
   return in deterministic streams. Recently such a coherent theory has
   been developed, and we examine its implications for stochastic cash
   flows. We devise an extension of the deterministic IRR, which we call
   the stochastic rate of return on mean investment. It has significant
   computational and conceptual advantages over the stochastic internal
   rate. For instance, in the deterministic case, the standard result is
   that under proper conditions a cash flow stream is acceptable (in the
   sense of positive present value) if its internal rate exceeds the
   interest rate. We show that a stochastic cash flow stream is acceptable
   (in the sense of positive certainty equivalent expected value) if the
   rate of return on mean investment has a suitably defined certainty
   equivalent exceeding the risk-free interest rate.

   Empirical tests validate the model's prediction of stronger momentum in

AB We report on a field study demonstrating systematic differences between
   the preferences people anticipate they will have over a series of
   options in the future and their subsequent revealed preferences over
   those options. Using a novel panel data set, we analyze the film rental
   and return patterns of a sample of online DVD rental customers over a
   period of four months. We predict and find that should DVDs (e. g.,
   documentaries) are held significantly longer than want DVDs (e. g.,
   action films) within customer. Similarly, we also predict and find that
   people are more likely to rent DVDs in one order and return them in the
   reverse order when should DVDs are rented before want DVDs.
   Specifically, a 1.3% increase in the probability of a reversal in
   preferences (from a baseline rate of 12%) ensues if the first of two
   sequentially rented movies has more should and fewer want
   characteristics than the second film. Finally, we find that as the same
   customers gain more experience with online DVD rentals, the extent to
   which they hold should films longer than want films decreases. Our
   results suggest that present bias has a meaningful impact on choice in
   the field, and that people may learn about their present bias with
   experience and, as a result, gain the capacity to curb its influence.

AB We conceptualize strategic decision-making processes within a
   manufacturing firm as streams of resources allocated to short-and
   long-term changes. The analogous ecological model, referred to as the
   Lotka-Volterra model, captures this dynamic tension between decisions
   made by the firm and its manufacturing operations. This representation
   leads to evolutionarily stable manufacturing strategies (ESMSs), which
   contribute to a firm's competitive advantage in different ways. Using a
   random sample of 30 firms from the U. S. semiconductor industry, we
   estimate parameters of the model and arrive at four ESMSs or strategic
   manufacturing groups that reflect theoretically and empirically
   distinctive adaptation patterns through their dynamic resource
   allocations. We observe that a majority of the firms were classified in
   one of the four groups, with relatively fewer firms in the other three.
   Notably, our classification based on ecology models agrees well with
   taxonomies in manufacturing and business strategy theory. Furthermore,
   our analysis shows significant differences among manufacturing practices
   and competitive capabilities of the four strategic groups. Managerially,
   these insights could provide the foundation to implement strategic
   changes that enable firms to leapfrog from one ESMS to another. This
   study also paves the way for development of a meso theory of the
   dynamics of manufacturing strategy.

   providers to store and exchange patient information using computers
   rather than paper records. Hospitals may be more likely to adopt EMRs if
   they can reassure patients that their confidentiality is legally
   protected. Alternatively, privacy protection may inhibit adoption if
   hospitals cannot benefit from easily exchanging patient information. We
   find that state privacy regulation restricting hospital release of
   health information reduces aggregate EMR adoption by hospitals by more
   than 24%. We present evidence that suggests that this is due to the
   suppression of network externalities.

   frequency have focused on one aspect of overconfidence, i.e.,
   miscalibration. Our paper offers a potential mechanism for the
   "better-than-average" aspect of overconfidence to influence trading
   frequency. In the context of our paper, overconfident investors tend to
   perceive themselves to be more competent, and thus are more willing to
   act on their beliefs, leading to higher trading frequency.

AB Mutual fund companies selectively advertise their better-performing
   funds. However, investors respond to advertised performance data as if
   those data were unselected (i.e., representative of the population). We
   identify the failure to discount selected or potentially selected data
   as selection neglect. We examine these phenomena in an archival study
   (Study 1) and two controlled experiments (Studies 2 and 3). Study 1
   identifies selection bias in mutual fund advertising by showing that the
   median performance rank for advertised funds is between the 79th and
   100th percentile. Study 2 finds that both novice investors and financial
   professionals fall victim to selection neglect in a financial
   advertising task unless the advertisement makes the selective nature of
   available performance data transparent. Study 3 shows that selection
   neglect associated with a large well-known company can be debiased with
   a simple extrinsic sample space cue, although individual differences in
   statistical reasoning also matter. We argue that selection neglect
   results from a general tendency to ignore underlying sample spaces
   rather than a fundamental misunderstanding about the data selection
   process or the value of selected data.

AB As companies outsource more product design and manufacturing activities
   to other members of the supply chain, improving end-product quality has
   become an endeavor extending beyond the boundaries of the firms'
   in-house process capabilities. In this paper, we discuss two contractual
   agreements by which product recall costs can be shared between a
   manufacturer and a supplier to induce quality improvement effort. More
   specifically, we consider (i) cost sharing based on selective root cause
   analysis (Contract S), and (ii) partial cost sharing based on complete
   root cause analysis (Contract P). Using insights from supermodular game
   theory, for each contractual agreement, we characterize the levels of
   effort the manufacturer and the supplier would exert in equilibrium to
   improve their component failure rate when their effort choices are
   subject to moral hazard. We show that both Contract S and Contract P can
   achieve the first best effort levels; however, Contract S results in
   higher profits for the manufacturer and the supply chain. For the case
   in which the information about the quality of the supplier's product is
   not revealed to the manufacturer (i. e., the case of information
   asymmetry), we develop a menu of contracts that can be used to mitigate
   the impact of information asymmetry. We show that the menu of contracts
   not only significantly decreases the manufacturer's cost due to
   information asymmetry, but also improves product quality.

AB We model an environment where e-retailers sell similar products and

   models where loyalty is exogenous, endogenizing the creation of loyal
   customers by allowing firms to engage in brand advertising leads to a
   continuum of symmetric equilibria; however, there is a unique
   equilibrium in secure strategies, and the set of equilibria converges to
   this unique equilibrium as the number of potential e-retailers grows
   arbitrarily large. Price dispersion is a key feature of all of these
   equilibria, including the limit equilibrium. Branding tightens the range
   of prices and reduces the value of the price information provided by a
   comparison site, and this reduces profits for platforms (such as an
   Internet price comparison site) where firms advertise prices. Data from
   a leading price comparison site are shown to be consistent with several

AB The growing sophistication of component technologies and the rising
   costs and uncertainties of developing and launching new products require
   firms to collaborate in the development of new products. However, the
   management of new product development that occurs jointly between firms
   presents a new set of challenges in sharing the costs and benefits of
   innovation. Although collaboration enables each firm to focus on what it
   does best, it also introduces new issues associated with the alignment
   of decisions and incentives that have to be managed alongside
   conventional performance and timing uncertainties of new product
   development. In this paper, we conceptualize and formulate the joint
   development of products involving two firms with differing development
   capabilities and examine the implications of arrangements that go beyond
   sharing of revenues to include sharing of development cost and work. We
   term these approaches that involve sharing of the development cost and
   sharing of the development work investment sharing and innovation
   sharing, respectively. These cost and effort sharing mechanisms have
   subtle interactions with the degree to which revenues are shared between
   firms and the type of development project under consideration. Our
   analysis shows that investment and innovation sharing are particularly
   relevant for products with no preexisting revenues, and their benefits
   also depend on the degree to which revenues are shared between the
   firms. Whereas investment sharing is more attractive for
   new-to-the-world product projects with significant timing uncertainty,
   innovation sharing plays an important role in environments where
   projects experience product quality uncertainty, firms are similar in
   their capabilities, and the costs of integration of work across firms
   can be controlled. Our key contribution involves the modeling of joint
   work and decision making between collaborating firms and unearthing the
   complementary role of revenue, cost, and innovative effort sharing
   mechanisms for new product development. We translate our analytical
   findings into a managerial framework and illustrate the results with
   examples from the life-sciences and electronics industries.

AB I examine whether technological innovation is a motivating factor in

   withdrawal) affects technological innovation in subsequent years. I find
   that firms engaging in acquisition activities are less innovative and
   have often experienced declines in technological innovation during the
   years prior to the bid. Among the bidders, the relatively more
   innovative ones are less likely to complete a deal. During the three
   years after the bid, successful bidders do not underperform matching
   firms, whereas failed bidders significantly underperform their
   nonbidding peers. I further find that formerly less innovative bidders
   benefit more from acquisitions. These findings suggest that
   technological innovation affects firms' acquisition decisions, and in

   To design truthful double-auction mechanisms, we propose a novel

   supply availability and demand requirement by introducing a phantom
   buyer with unlimited budget. To the best of our knowledge, this
   "padding" method leads to a class of mechanisms that are the first
   strategy-proof, individually rational, budget-balanced, and
   asymptotically efficient mechanisms for the specified exchange
   environment. Furthermore, these mechanisms dominate known truthful
   bundle/single-unit mechanisms with higher efficiency, lower buying

AB Why do firms use continuations in the prosecution of their patents?
   Motivated by the widespread use of continuations by U.S. firms and the
   prominence of this procedure in U. S. patent policy debates, we
   investigate the influence of corporate and patent characteristics on the
   use of continuations. We employ novel data on applicants and their
   filings of three types of continuations - the continuation application
   (CAP), the continuations in part (CIP), and divisions - during 1981 -
   2000 to distinguish among the motives for continuing patents. We find
   that CIPs are disproportionately. led by research and
   development-intensive firms that patent heavily, and that these
   continuations are more common in chemical and biological technologies.
   Patents issuing from CIPs cover relatively important inventions and
   their use appears consistent with a strategy of protecting "pioneering
   inventions." In contrast, CAPs and divisions are associated with less
   important patents assigned to capital-intensive firms, particularly in
   computer and semiconductor fields, and appear to be used in defensive
   patenting strategies. We analyze the effects of the 1995 change in
   patent term, and find that the act reduced continuations overall and
   shifted the output of continuations toward less important patents.

AB This paper empirically examines how business unit reorganization affects

   relationship. Unit reorganization is the creation, deletion, or
   recombination of business units within a firm. Innovation is radical and
   involves product market entry by a firm into markets in which it was not
   previously active. I test competing hypotheses that predict either a
   U-shape or inverted U-shape relationship between reorganization and
   innovation to determine whether and how learning occurs in the presence
   of unit-level structural change. Theoretical support is drawn from
   literature on dynamic capabilities and organizational learning. The
   sample studied is 250 medical firms belonging to the pharmaceutical,
   healthcare-service, and medical-device industries, studied over a
   20-year period. The findings are twofold. First, reorganization is found
   to exhibit a U-shape relationship with innovation, supporting learning
   arguments that stress the importance of experiencing a cohort of
   multiple events. Second, only reorganization experiences within a
   current period affect future innovation; past experiences do not impact
   future innovation, implying that firms may face constraints in
   organizational memory. The study concludes by exploring the structural
   origin (i.e., from internal, acquired, or recombined units) of
   innovative activity within firms.

   the maximum squared Sharpe ratio for monthly returns is greater than

   their individual members, it is important to understand their influence
   on belief revision as well. I report the results of four studies
   examining intuitions about group wisdom and the informational influence
   of groups. In their overt assessments, experimental participants rated
   larger groups as more accurate than smaller groups and discriminated
   more between them when group size was salient. When provided advice,
   participants relied more on groups than individuals to update their
   beliefs, but were only modestly sensitive to group size. Most were
   suboptimal in the use of that advice, overweighting their initial
   beliefs and underweighting the more valid judgment of the group. Thus
   although acknowledged in principle, the wisdom of crowds is only

AB We show how an upstream firm, by using a price-dependent profit-sharing
   rule, can prevent destructive competition between downstream firms that
   produce relatively close substitutes. With this rule, the upstream firm
   induces the retailers to behave as if demand has become less price
   elastic. As a result, competing downstream firms will maximize aggregate
   total channel profit. When downstream firms are better informed about
   demand conditions than the upstream firm, the same outcome cannot be
   achieved by vertical restraints such as resale price maintenance.
   Price-dependent profit sharing may also ensure that the downstream firms
   undertake efficient market expanding investments. The model is
   consistent with observations from the market for content commodities
   distributed by mobile networks.

AB Unspanned stochastic volatility (USV) refers to the inability of bonds
   to replicate volatility-sensitive derivative securities. Affine term
   structure models require special restrictions on the parameters to
   exhibit USV. We use a joint Eurodollar futures and options data set to
   estimate affine three-factor models with and without USV restrictions.
   The unrestricted model captures prices of futures and options well.
   Option pricing errors are much larger in the USV model. The USV model is
   rejected in favor of the unrestricted model based on the likelihood
   ratio and Wald tests. We use the implications of the unrestricted model
   as a benchmark for understanding the extant evidence that favors USV.
   Specifically, we replicate extant tests in samples simulated from the
   unrestricted model. We show that none of the existing findings
   contradict the model without USV restrictions.

AB Contests (or tournaments) are pervasive in organizations. They help
   performance evaluation by eliminating common shocks affecting agents'
   performance. However, tournaments are less effective when participants
   have heterogeneous ability because participants may conclude that the
   ability gap is too large to be overcome by their effort. Our theoretical
   analysis shows that a similar loss of motivation arises when tournaments
   take place over multiple periods because interim performance acts in a
   way that is similar to heterogeneous ability. Analyzing the sales
   contests organized by a commodities company, we document that winning
   participants decrease their effort as their lead extends, whereas the
   effort of trailing participants fades only when the gap to a winning
   position is very large. We also show that, on average, when contests are
   introduced they induce a higher level of effort among participants,
   although the incentives weaken as the number of participants increases.
   Finally, we demonstrate that although retailers respond to the multiple
   performance dimensions of the incentive program in part by shifting
   effort toward sales of more expensive products, they channel most of the
   increased effort toward reaching more customers.

AB Most prior event studies find that the announcement of a new alliance is
   accompanied by a positive stock market response for the partners. This
   result has usually been interpreted as evidence for the prevailing view
   that alliances are effective vehicles for partners to acquire or access
   new skills and thus become stronger competitors. However, partners
   should also earn positive abnormal returns if alliances are used to
   shape competitive interactions, attenuating competitive intensity
   industry-wide.
   In this study, we disentangle these different mechanisms by examining
   how alliance announcements affect the stock market's evaluation of
   allying firms' rivals: if an alliance is expected to make partner firms
   more competitive, this should lead to negative abnormal returns for
   partners' rivals; if an alliance is expected to facilitate a reduction
   in competitive intensity, this should lead to positive abnormal returns
   for rivals. Results from an event study analysis of research and
   development alliances in the telecommunications and electronics
   industries during 1996-2004 provide evidence consistent with competition
   attenuation in some alliances. Our research thus challenges the
   increasingly narrow focus on learning and resource accumulation through
   alliances, and calls for broader consideration of the roles and effects
   of collaboration, both for individual firms and for industry structure.

AB One important decision firms must make is to select the product line (
   characteristics and number of products) to offer consumers. This paper
   explores the effect of the interaction between consumer evaluation costs
   and pricing on the optimal product line length to offer consumers.
   Before deciding to buy a product among all products offered, a consumer
   learns the product line length. Given the product line length, a
   consumer decides whether to evaluate the products available and their
   prices. This decision to evaluate depends on the expected consumer
   surplus after the evaluation being greater than the evaluation costs.
   When the firm offers few products, the firm may not attract many
   consumers because of lack of product fit and may be forced to offer low
   prices. When the firm offers many products, all consumers will find a
   great product fit; that is, the variance of consumer valuations per
   product chosen is lower. This allows the firm to charge high prices to
   extract ex post consumer surplus, resulting in lower ex ante expected
   consumer surplus, which may lead consumers not to evaluate the products
   in the first place. That is, by offering fewer products a firm can
   commit not to extract all possible consumer surplus. These two forces
   may then lead to the existence of an interior optimal number of products
   to offer. The optimal number of products offered is decreasing in the
   evaluation costs.

   in a distribution channel, in which a manufacturer sells a product
   through a retailer. The manufacturer jointly determines the wholesale
   price and quality of the product, and the retailer determines the retail
   price. We find that if the marginal revenue function is strictly
   concave, then the manufacturer chooses a lower product quality level
   than if selling the product directly to customers. If the marginal
   revenue function is affine, then the manufacturer's optimal product
   quality decision is independent of the distribution channel structure.
   If the marginal revenue function is strictly convex, then the
   manufacturer chooses a higher product quality level than if selling the

AB We consider how two networked large-scale service systems that normally
   operate separately, such as call centers, can help each other when one
   encounters an unexpected overload and is unable to immediately increase
   its own staffing. Our proposed control activates serving some customers
   from the other system when a ratio of the two queue lengths ( numbers of
   waiting customers) exceeds a threshold. Two thresholds, one for each
   direction of sharing, automatically detect the overload condition and
   prevent undesired sharing under normal loads. After a threshold has been
   exceeded, the control aims to keep the ratio of the two queue lengths at
   a specified value. To gain insight, we introduce an idealized stochastic
   model with two customer classes and two associated service pools
   containing large numbers of agents. To set the important queue-ratio
   parameters, we consider an approximating deterministic fluid model. We
   determine queue-ratio parameters that minimize convex costs for this
   fluid model. We perform simulation experiments to show that the control
   is effective for the original stochastic model. Indeed, the simulations
   show that the proposed queue-ratio control with thresholds outperforms
   the optimal fixed partition of the servers given known fixed arrival
   rates during the overload, even though the proposed control does not use
   information about the arrival rates.

   assortment. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between product
   differentiation and assortment depth, with the depth of the assortment
   rising at first and then falling with the degree of product
   differentiation. For product categories that consist of relatively
   nondifferentiatied variants, a positive relationship arises between
   assortment depth and category sales, whereas a negative relationship
   emerges between assortment depth and sales in categories with more
   differentiated variants. Both the extent and manner in which store
   differentiation changes has important implications for assortment depth.
   If retailer market power is augmented following the closure of rival
   retailers, product assortments become deeper; however, if retailers gain
   market power by investing in store attributes that facilitate customer
   loyalty, product assortments become shallower.

   The results show how the information generated in the process of

   to exploit the information contained in the order they receive or, if
   they are uncertain about its quality, to assess it by actively

AB We propose a game-theoretical model of a retailer who sells a limited
   inventory of a product over a finite selling season by using one of two
   inventory display formats: display all (DA) and display one (DO). Under
   DA, the retailer displays all available units so that each arriving
   customer has perfect information about the actual inventory level. Under
   DO, the retailer displays only one unit at a time so that each customer
   knows about product availability but not the actual inventory level.
   Recent research suggests that when faced with strategic consumers, the
   retailer could increase expected profits by making an upfront commitment
   to a price path. We focus on such pricing strategies in this paper, and
   study the potential benefit of DO compared to DA, and its effectiveness
   in mitigating the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior. We find
   support for our hypothesis that the DO format could potentially create
   an increased sense of shortage risk, and hence it is better than the DA
   format. However, although potentially beneficial, a move from DA to DO
   is typically very far from eliminating the adverse impact of strategic
   consumer behavior. We observe that, generally, it is not important for a
   retailer to modify the level of inventory when moving from a DA to a DO
   format; a change in the display format, along with an appropriate price
   modification, is typically sufficient. Interestingly, across all
   scenarios in which a change in inventory is significantly beneficial, we
   observed that only one of the following two actions takes place: either
   the premium price is increased along with a reduction in inventory, or
   inventory is increased along with premium price reduction. We find that
   the marginal benefit of DO can vary dramatically as a function of the
   per-unit cost to the retailer. In particular, when the retailer's
   per-unit cost is relatively high, but not too high to make sales
   unprofitable or to justify exclusive sales to high-valuation customers
   only, the benefits of DO appear to be at their highest level, and could
   reach up to 20% increase in profit. Finally, we demonstrate that by
   moving from DA to DO, while keeping the price path unchanged, the
   volatility of the retailer's profit decreases.

AB This paper examines the proposition that during competence-destroying
   technological changes, incumbents are incompetent in researching in
   house a radically new technology. They only retain market leadership if
   their undestroyed, proprietary complementary assets compensate for their
   research incompetence. In contrast to prior research, I propose that
   there is not one but two sets of capabilities necessary to execute
   research and development (R&D), sets that differ in their market
   specificity: a technology-specific set (i.e., technological platforms
   that are non-market specific) and an application-specific set (i.e.,
   knowledge of the application that is therefore market specific).
   Although all markets require both sets of capabilities to execute R&D,
   prior research has analyzed cases where the application was not as
   complex, and therefore application-specific capabilities did not
   represent strategic factors. Because at the start of a technological
   discontinuity application-specific capabilities are undestroyed and have
   accrued only to incumbents, when complex enough, these capabilities can
   represent a source of competitive advantage for these firms, even in the
   face of competition from diversifying entrants reusing previously
   acquired technological platforms. I find evidence consistent with my
   proposition based on data on outcomes from drug discovery (as estimated
   through clinical endpoints in phase I trials) for firms competing in the
   anticancer drug market, one of the most complex markets within
   pharmaceuticals, as the market transitions into the biotechnology
   revolution. The proposition in this paper implies that although
   technological platforms can help firms move across markets,
   application-specific R&D capabilities can help firms retain leadership
   within a market across technological discontinuities.

AB An important characteristic of any offer is the deadline at which it
   expires. We consider an ultimatum deadline game in which the proposer's
   decision variable is the offer deadline, while the responder faces a
   standard finite-horizon search problem. We show that the responder's
   strategy is characterized by a shortest acceptable deadline: at the time
   of deadline, he accepts an offer if the deadline is longer than his
   shortest acceptable deadline, and rejects it otherwise. If the proposer
   has all information available to the responder, the optimal deadline is
   the responder's shortest acceptable deadline. If the proposer is
   uncertain about the responder's situation, the optimal deadline gets
   longer, unless this uncertainty is very large. After normative analysis
   of the deadline setting problem, we present results from a behavioral
   study of the game. The average shortest acceptable deadline set by the
   responders equals the one that would maximize the expected value,
   whereas the proposers tend to set deadlines that are too short. The
   prescriptive conclusion for a proposer, emerging from the model and the
   experiment, is that in case of uncertainty it is better to set a
   deadline longer than what would be optimal if uncertainty were ignored.

AB We develop a dynamic model in which Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)
   servicemembers incur a random amount of combat stress during each month
   of deployment, develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if their
   cumulative stress exceeds a servicemember-specific threshold, and then
   develop symptoms of PTSD after an additional time lag. Using Department
   of Defense deployment data and Mental Health Advisory Team PTSD survey
   data to calibrate the model, we predict that-because of the long time
   lags and the fact that some surveyed servicemembers experience
   additional combat after being surveyed-the fraction of Army soldiers and
   Marines who eventually suffer from PTSD will be approximately twice as
   large as in the raw survey data. We cannot put a confidence interval
   around this estimate, but there is considerable uncertainty (perhaps
   +/-30%). The estimated PTSD rate translates into approximate to 300,000
   PTSD cases among all Army soldiers and Marines in OIF, with approximate
   to 20,000 new cases each year the war is prolonged. The heterogeneity of
   threshold levels among servicemembers suggests that although multiple
   deployments raise an individual's risk of PTSD, in aggregate, multiple
   deployments lower the total number of PTSD cases by approximate to 30%
   relative to a hypothetical case in which the war was fought with many
   more servicemembers (i.e., a draft) deploying only once. The time lag
   dynamics suggest that, in aggregate, reserve servicemembers show
   symptoms approximate to 1-2 years before active servicemembers and
   predict that >75% of OIF servicemembers who self-reported symptoms
   during their second deployment were exposed to the PTSD-generating
   stress during their first deployment.

AB The number of firms carrying a cause-related product has significantly
   increased in recent years. We consider a duopoly model of competition
   between firms in two products to determine which products a firm will
   link to a cause. We first test the behavioral underpinnings of our model
   in two laboratory experiments to demonstrate the existence of both a
   direct utility benefit to consumers from cause marketing ( CM) and a
   spillover benefit onto other products in the portfolio. Linking one
   product in a product portfolio to a cause can therefore increase sales
   both of that product and, via a spillover effect, of other products in
   the firm's portfolio. We construct a CM game in which each firm chooses
   which products, if any, to place on CM. In the absence of a spillover
   benefit, a firm places a product on CM if and only if it can increase
   its price by enough to compensate for the cost of CM. Thus, in
   equilibrium, firms either have both products or neither product on CM.
   However, with the introduction of a spillover benefit to the second
   product, this result changes. We show that if a single firm in the
   market links only one product to a cause, it can raise prices on both
   products and earn a higher profit. We assume each firm has an advantage
   in one product and show that there is an equilibrium in which each firm
   links only its disadvantaged product to a cause. If the spillover effect
   is strong, there is a second equilibrium in which each firm links only
   its advantaged product to a cause. In each case, firms raise their
   prices on both products and earn higher profits than when neither firm
   engages in CM. We also show that a firm will never place its entire
   portfolio on CM. Overall, our work implies that, by carrying
   cause-related products, companies can not only improve their image in
   the public eye but also increase profits.

AB Much of prior work in the area of service operations management has
   assumed service rates to be exogenous to the level of load on the
   system. Using operational data from patient transport services and
   cardiothoracic surgery-two vastly different health-care delivery
   services-we show that the processing speed of service workers is
   influenced by the system load. We find that workers accelerate the
   service rate as load increases. In particular, a 10% increase in load
   reduces length of stay by two days for cardiothoracic surgery patients,
   whereas a 20% increase in the load for patient transporters reduces the
   transport time by 30 seconds. Moreover, we show that such acceleration
   may not be sustainable. Long periods of increased load (overwork) have
   the effect of decreasing the service rate. In cardiothoracic surgery, an
   increase in overwork by 1% increases length of stay by six hours.
   Consistent with prior studies in the medical literature, we also find
   that overwork is associated with a reduction in quality of care in
   cardiothoracic surgery-an increase in overwork by 10% is associated with
   an increase in likelihood of mortality by 2%. We also find that load is
   associated with an early discharge of patients, which is in turn
   correlated with a small increase in mortality rate.

AB Large-scale service systems, where many servers respond to high demand,
   are appealing because they can provide great economy of scale, producing
   a high quality of service with high efficiency. Customer waiting times
   can be short, with a majority of customers served immediately upon
   arrival, while server utilizations remain close to 100%. However, we
   show that this confluence of quality and efficiency is not achieved

   not operate as planned. In particular, we show that the large scale
   makes the system more vulnerable to service interruptions when (i) most
   customers remain waiting until they can be served, and (ii) when many
   servers are unable to function during the interruption, as may occur
   with a system-wide computer failure. Increasing scale leads to higher
   server utilizations, which in turn leads to longer recovery times from
   service interruptions and worse performance during such events. We
   quantify the impact of service interruptions with increasing scale by
   introducing and analyzing approximating deterministic fluid models. We
   also show that these fluid models can be obtained from many-server
   heavy-traffic limits.

AB Firms normally disclose quality information to consumers using two
   alternative formats: either directly to consumers or indirectly through
   downstream retailers. This study investigates optimal disclosure
   strategies/formats in a channel setting with bilateral monopolies. It
   shows that retail disclosure leads to more equilibrium information
   revelation. This is because the manufacturer can, through wholesale
   price cuts, partially absorb the retailer's effective disclosure cost
   and thus increase the retailer's incentive for disclosure. The
   conditions under which a particular disclosure format arises as the
   manufacturer's optimal choice are also examined. Even though direct
   disclosure is the ex post dominated option, the manufacturer may benefit
   from committing ex ante to the direct disclosure format when the cost of
   disclosure is sufficiently high.

AB Although one of the central questions in the global strategy field is
   how multinational firms successfully navigate multiple and often
   conflicting institutional environments, we know relatively little about
   the effect of conflicting labor market institutions on multinational
   firms' strategic choice and operating performance. With its decision to
   invest in manufacturing operations in nearly every one of the world's
   largest welding markets, Lincoln Electric offers us a quasi-experiment.
   We leverage a unique data set covering 1996-2006 that combines data on
   each host country's labor market institutions with data on each
   subsidiary's strategic choices and historical operating performance. We
   find that Lincoln Electric performed significantly better in countries
   with labor laws and regulations supporting manufacturers' interests and
   in countries that allowed the free use of both piecework and a
   discretionary bonus. Furthermore, we find that in countries with labor
   market institutions unfriendly to manufacturers, Lincoln Electric was
   still able to overcome most (although not all) of the institutional
   distance by what we term flexible intermediate adaptation.

AB The first step in transforming strategy from a hopeful statement about
   the future into an operational reality is to allocate resources to
   innovation and new product development (NPD) programs in a portfolio.
   Resource allocation and NPD portfolio decisions often span multiple
   levels of the organization's hierarchy, leading to questions about how
   much authority to bestow on managers and how to structure incentives for
   NPD. In this study, we explore how funding authority and incentives
   affect a manager's allocation of resources between existing product
   improvement (relatively incremental projects) and new product
   development (more radical projects). Funding may be either fixed or
   variable depending on the extent to which the manager has the authority
   to use revenue derived from existing product sales to fund NPD efforts.
   We find that the use of variable funding drives higher effort toward
   improving existing products and developing new products. However,
   variable funding has a subtle side effect: it induces the manager to
   focus on existing product improvement to a greater degree than new
   product development, and the relative balance in the NPD portfolio
   shifts toward incremental innovation. In addition, we highlight a
   substitution effect between explicit incentives (compensation
   parameters) and implicit incentives (career concerns). Explicit
   incentives are reduced as career concerns become more salient.

   difficult because valuable resources are often tacit, ambiguous, or

   assessments that rely upon the concept of relatedness between resources
   to characterize the direction of growth of the firm. We tackle the
   problem for the general case by developing a general interindustry

   embedded in the multiproduct organization decisions of every diversified
   firm in the U. S. manufacturing economy. The index is general in that it
   can be used across industry contexts without requiring explicit
   identification of resources and it provides a percentile relatedness
   rank for every possible pair of four-digit Standard Industrial
   Classification manufacturing industries. The general index is tested for
   predictive validity and found to perform as expected. Applications of

AB We study the following question: How does competition influence the
   inventory holdings of General Motors' dealerships operating in isolated
   U. S. markets? We wish to disentangle two mechanisms by which local
   competition influences a dealer's inventory: (1) the entry or exit of a
   competitor can change a retailer's demand (a sales effect); and (2) the
   entry or exit of a competitor can change the amount of buffer stock a
   retailer holds, which influences the probability that a consumer finds a
   desired product in stock (a service-level effect). Theory is clear on
   the sales effect-an increase in sales leads to an increase in inventory
   (albeit a less than proportional increase). However, theoretical models
   of inventory competition are ambiguous on the expected sign of the
   service-level effect. Via a Web crawler, we obtained data on inventory
   and sales for more than 200 dealerships over a six-month period. Using
   cross-sectional variation, we estimated the effect of the number and
   type of local competitors on inventory holdings. We used several
   instrumental variables to control for the endogeneity of market entry
   decisions. Our results suggest that the service-level effect is strong,
   nonlinear, and positive. Hence, we observe that dealers carry more
   inventory (controlling for sales) when they face additional competition.

AB The phenomenon of sponsored search advertising-where advertisers pay a
   fee to Internet search engines to be displayed alongside organic
   (nonsponsored) Web search results-is gaining ground as the largest
   source of revenues for search engines. Using a unique six-month panel
   data set of several hundred keywords collected from a large nationwide
   retailer that advertises on Google, we empirically model the
   relationship between different sponsored search metrics such as
   click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per click, and ranking of
   advertisements. Our paper proposes a novel framework to better
   understand the factors that drive differences in these metrics. We use a
   hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework and estimate the model using
   Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Using a simultaneous equations model,
   we quantify the relationship between various keyword characteristics,
   position of the advertisement, and the landing page quality score on
   consumer search and purchase behavior as well as on advertiser's cost
   per click and the search engine's ranking decision. Specifically, we
   find that the monetary value of a click is not uniform across all
   positions because conversion rates are highest at the top and decrease
   with rank as one goes down the search engine results page. Though search
   engines take into account the current period's bid as well as prior
   click-through rates before deciding the final rank of an advertisement
   in the current period, the current bid has a larger effect than prior
   click-through rates. We also find that an increase in landing page
   quality scores is associated with an increase in conversion rates and a
   decrease in advertiser's cost per click. Furthermore, our analysis shows
   that keywords that have more prominent positions on the search engine
   results page, and thus experience higher click-through or conversion
   rates, are not necessarily the most pro. table ones-profits are often
   higher at the middle positions than at the top or the bottom ones.
   Besides providing managerial insights into search engine advertising,
   these results shed light on some key assumptions made in the theoretical
   modeling literature in sponsored search.

AB Recent product introductions such as the Xbox 360, Sony Playstation 2,
   and PT Cruiser have been characterized by shortage of these products.
   Some experts have suggested that such scarcity can be a deliberate
   strategy for making the product more desirable. In this paper, we
   empirically examine the relationship between introductory inventory
   levels and consumer preference in the U. S. automobile industry and show
   that relative scarcity of a car at the time of introduction is
   associated with higher consumer preference for the product. Furthermore,
   we perform an empirical test of alternative theories about the rationale
   for introductory product scarcity. Specifically, we consider two
   theories of supplier-induced scarcity, namely the buying frenzy theory
   and the signaling theory, and an alternative theory that suggests that
   demand uncertainty causes introductory product scarcity. We find more
   support for the signaling theory of supplier-induced scarcity than the
   buying frenzy theory or the demand uncertainty theory in our analysis of
   the automobile market.

   This choice depends not only on the technical promise of the compound,
   but also on commercial considerations such as the expected profitability
   of the market or concerns about product cannibalization. After
   controlling for selection, we find that (a) even after controlling for
   scale and scope in research, established pharmaceutical firms are more
   innovative than newly entered biotech firms; (b) older biotech firms
   display selection behaviors and innovation performances similar to
   established pharmaceutical firms; and (c) compounds licensed during

AB This paper studies a manufacturer that sells to a newsvendor retailer
   who can improve the quality of her demand information by exerting costly
   forecasting effort. In such a setting, contracts play two roles:
   providing incentives to influence the retailer's forecasting decision
   and eliciting information obtained by forecasting to inform production
   decisions. We focus on two forms of contracts that are widely used in
   such settings and are mirror images of one another: a rebates contract,
   which compensates the retailer for the units she sells to end consumers,
   and a returns contract, which compensates the retailer for the units
   that are unsold. We characterize the optimal rebates contracts and
   returns contracts. Under rebates, the retailer, manufacturer, and total
   system may benefit from the retailer having inferior forecasting
   technology; this never occurs under returns. Although one might
   conjecture that returns would be inferior because its provision of
   "insurance" would discourage the retailer from forecasting, we show that
   returns are superior.

   the ability of founders and venture capitalists to sell equity at IPO.
   In an analysis of 2,190 IPOs spanning from 1992 through 2002, we find
   that private owners are less likely to be observed selling their equity
   at IPO in ventures that are highly dependent on technical specialized
   knowledge as measured by the count of individuals with Ph.D.s in the top
   management team and board of directors. However, we find that this limit
   on the financial liquidity of founders and venture capitalists is
   alleviated when the venture's output has received greater market
   acceptance. Hence, the findings suggest that the financial liquidity of

AB As firms continue to abandon pensions in favor of employee-managed
   retirement plans, tremendous demands are being placed on the
   decision-making proficiency of future retirees. As reflected in the
   equity premium puzzle, individual investors tend to hold overly
   conservative portfolios that provide meager payoffs over time.
   Consequently, there is growing concern that the vast majority of
   retirement accounts might be insufficiently funded when employees reach
   retirement. Given that most retirement plans can now be managed online,
   a potential solution lies in designing a Web-based decision support
   system (DSS) that helps future retirees make more-profitable portfolio
   management decisions. This paper reports the results of a study in which
   159 retirement plan participants were asked to use an experimental
   website to manage a portfolio of retirement investments over a simulated
   30-year period. Using a psychological approach toward designing the DSS,
   myopic loss aversion is put forth as a theoretical explanation for the
   psychological mechanisms that encourage investors to hold overly
   conservative portfolios. Armed with this knowledge, three design
   features-information horizon, system restrictiveness, and decisional
   guidance-are implemented as part of an overarching design strategy
   targeted at increasing investors' willingness to take calculated risks.
   The results indicate that investor conservatism diminishes when the DSS
   presents prospective probabilities and payoffs over long time horizons.
   In contrast, short-term information horizons constitute a major
   stumbling block for investors. However, when confronted with short-term
   information horizons, risk aversion can be successfully counteracted by
   configuring a DSS to either restrict the frequency of decisions or to
   suggest a relatively aggressive portfolio allocation. These findings
   carry important implications for theory and practice.

AB A vertically integrated channel would prefer to coordinate the pricing
   of its products. In this paper, we investigate drivers of product line
   pricing decisions in a bilateral monopoly where a manufacturer produces
   and sells two substitutable or complementary products to a retailer. In
   a two-stage game, each firm commits credibly in the first stage to a
   pricing scheme within its own organization: product line pricing (PLP)
   or non-product line pricing (NPLP). In the second stage, depending on
   the relative balance of power in the supply chain, the firms engage in
   either a Nash or a leader-follower pricing game. We study the
   equilibrium of the two-stage game under a general symmetric demand
   function. With strategic interaction between firms, a firm may choose
   NPLP as the equilibrium pricing strategy. In particular, when the second
   stage is a leader-follower game, the price leader chooses PLP, and the
   follower may choose NPLP only if the inefficiency of using NPLP empowers
   the follower by increasing the demand sensitivity to the leader's
   margin. When the second stage is a vertical Nash game, whether NPLP
   occurs in equilibrium depends on the nature of coupling between demand
   interdependence and vertical strategic dependence: NPLP can be an
   equilibrium only if products are demand substitutes (complements) and
   vertical strategic dependencies are complementary (substitutable). We
   find that prisoner's dilemma exists in the first stage for both types of
   second-stage pricing games. In those cases, one firm may have the
   incentive to commit to a pricing scheme in the first stage prior to its
   channel partner and steer the supply chain away from prisoner's dilemma.

AB This paper employs numerical simulations to compare the relative
   performance of linear contracts with piecewise-linear-threshold
   contracts in the case where the agent chooses actions over time. These
   contracts are restricted to be functions of the ending value of
   aggregate output. We find strong evidence that only linear contracts
   need be considered in comparison with piecewise-linear-threshold
   contracts in the situation where cumulative output is only updated
   periodically and the agent's utility function is exponential. This
   finding holds even when there are only two periods and hence one change
   of action by the agent. However, we find that the best
   piecewise-linear-threshold contract is significantly superior to the

AB A key question for Internet commerce is the nature of competition with
   traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Although traditional retailers
   vastly outsell Internet retailers in most product categories, research
   on Internet retailing has largely neglected this fundamental dimension
   of competition. Is cross-channel competition significant, and if so, how
   and where can Internet retailers win this battle? This paper attempts to
   answer these questions using a unique combination of data sets. We
   collect data on local market structures for traditional retailers, and
   then match these data to a data set on consumer demand via two direct
   channels: Internet and catalog. Our analyses show that Internet
   retailers face significant competition from brick-and-mortar retailers
   when selling mainstream products, but are virtually immune from
   competition when selling niche products. Furthermore, because the
   Internet channel sells proportionately more niche products than the
   catalog channel, the competition between the Internet channel and local
   stores is less intense than the competition between the catalog channel
   and local stores. The methods we introduce can be used to analyze
   cross-channel competition in other product categories, and suggest that
   managers need to take into account the types of products they sell when
   assessing competitive strategies.

AB Using data generated from laboratory experiments, we test and compare
   the empirical accuracy of two models that focus on judgment errors
   associated with processing information from random sequences. We test
   for regime-shifting beliefs of the type theorized in Barberis et al.
   (Barberis, N., A. Shleifer, R. Vishny. 1998. A model of investor
   sentiment. J. Financial Econom. 49(3) 307-343) and for beliefs in the
   "law of small numbers" as modeled in Rabin (Rabin, M. 2002. Inference by
   believers in the law of small numbers. Quart. J. Econom. 117(3)
   775-816). In our experiments, we show subjects randomly generated
   sequences of binary outcomes and ask them to provide probability
   assessments of the direction of the next outcome. Inconsistent with
   regime-shifting beliefs, we find that subjects are not more likely to
   predict that the current streak will continue the longer the streak.
   Instead, consistent with Rabin (2002), subjects are more likely to
   expect a reversal following short streaks and continuation after long
   streaks. Results of a "test-of-fit" analysis based on structural
   estimation of each model also favor the model in Rabin. To provide more
   insight on Rabin, we use an additional experimental treatment to show
   that as the perception of the randomness of the outcome-generating
   process increases, subjects are more likely to predict reversals of
   current streaks.

AB The seller's threshold price in name-your-own-price auctions varies over
   time. However, consumers must bid without knowing when these variations
   occur because the threshold price is unobservable to them. This paper
   uses an analytical model and laboratory auctions to explore how the
   frequency of changes in the threshold price impacts consumer bidding
   behavior in name-your-own-price auctions. In particular, we consider how
   the frequency of these expected changes affects the optimal pattern of
   bid sequences (e.g., strictly increasing over time or following a
   nonmonotonic pattern). We find that when the probability of a price
   change is moderate, consumers may have an incentive to use nonmonotonic
   bidding patterns. Rather than steadily increasing their bids over time,
   consumers will, at some point in the bid sequence, decrease their bid.
   However, when the expected probability of a price change is very low or
   very high, consumers do not have an incentive to use nonmonotonic
   bidding patterns. Interestingly, impatient bidders are more likely to
   decrease their bids at some point in the bid sequence than patient
   bidders. Finally, we find that more frequent price changes may increase
   customer satisfaction.

   significant relation between volatility spreads and expected stock

   larger loss results in greater psychological value than does integrating
   them into a smaller loss. Using a generic prospect theory value
   function, we formalize this effect and derive conditions under which it
   should occur. We show analytically that if the gain is smaller than a
   certain threshold, segregation is optimal. This threshold increases with
   the size of the loss and decreases with the degree of loss aversion of
   the decision maker. Our formal analysis results in a set of predictions
   suggesting that the silver lining effect is more likely to occur when
   (i) the gain is smaller (for a given loss), (ii) the loss is larger (for
   a given gain), and (iii) the decision maker is less loss averse. We test

AB Specialization at work has been recognized as a key driver of learning
   and productivity since the days of Adam Smith. More recently,
   researchers have noted that exposure to task variety can enhance
   learning. We examine how exposure to specialization and variety jointly
   drive employee productivity in a real-life setting. We analyze a data
   set covering 88 individuals who worked on 5,711 maintenance tasks in an
   offshore software support services operation. We find that, as expected,
   specialization enhances productivity. However, exposure to variety has a
   nonlinear influence on productivity; i.e., "too much variety" can impede
   learning. We also find that achieving a proper balance between
   specialization and exposure to a variety leads to the highest
   productivity. We capture this balance using an adaptation of the
   Herfindahl-Hirschman Index from the economics literature. In addition,
   we examine how the productivity of individuals in a workgroup is
   affected by member entry and exit, with the latter specified in terms of
   the degree of specialized experience and the degree of variety
   experience lost from the workgroup when a member exits. Our analysis
   reveals that the degree of variety experience lost has a greater impact
   on productivity than the degree of specialized experience that is lost.

AB Since Osborn's Applied Imagination book in 1953 (Osborn, A. F. 1953.

   Charles Scribner's Sons, New York), the effectiveness of brainstorming
   has been widely debated. While some researchers and practitioners
   consider it the standard idea generation and problem-solving method in
   organizations, part of the social science literature has argued in favor
   of nominal groups, i.e., the same number of individuals generating
   solutions in isolation. In this paper, we revisit this debate, and we
   explore the implications that the underlying problem structure and the
   team diversity have on the quality of the best solution as obtained by
   the different group configurations. We build on the normative search
   literature of new product development, and we show that no group
   configuration dominates. Therefore, nominal groups perform better in
   specialized problems, even when the factors that affect the solution
   quality exhibit complex interactions (problem complexity). In
   cross-functional problems, the brainstorming group exploits the
   competence diversity of its participants to attain better solutions.
   However, their advantage vanishes for extremely complex problems.

AB State-of-the-art stochastic volatility models generate a "volatility
   smirk" that explains why out-of-the-money index puts have high prices
   relative to the Black-Scholes benchmark. These models also adequately
   explain how the volatility smirk moves up and down in response to
   changes in risk. However, the data indicate that the slope and the level
   of the smirk fluctuate largely independently. Although single-factor
   stochastic volatility models can capture the slope of the smirk, they
   cannot explain such largely independent fluctuations in its level and
   slope over time. We propose to model these movements using a two-factor
   stochastic volatility model. Because the factors have distinct
   correlations with market returns, and because the weights of the factors
   vary over time, the model generates stochastic correlation between
   volatility and stock returns. Besides providing more flexible modeling
   of the time variation in the smirk, the model also provides more
   flexible modeling of the volatility term structure. Our empirical
   results indicate that the model improves on the benchmark Heston
   stochastic volatility model by 24% in-sample and 23% out-of-sample. The
   better fit results from improvements in the modeling of the term
   structure dimension as well as the moneyness dimension.

AB We propose that ambiguity aversion, as introduced in the literature on
   decision making under uncertainty, drives a preference for established
   brands in multiattribute choices among branded alternatives. Established
   brands are those for which belief in quality is held with greater
   confidence, even if specific attributes might be inferior to those of
   competing, less-established brands. In five experiments, we examine the
   role of ambiguity aversion in the preference for dominated, established
   brands. We first show a correlation between ambiguity aversion (revealed
   through choices among monetary lotteries) and the preference for
   established brands. We then show that the preference for established
   brands is enhanced when ambiguity aversion is made more salient in
   unrelated preceding lottery choices. Thus, ambiguity aversion carries
   across choices. In addition, ambiguity aversion and the preference for
   established brands are both enhanced when subjects anticipate that
   others will evaluate their lottery choices. Finally, ambiguous
   information about brand attributes tends to increase the preference for
   established brands.

AB An important challenge in multiattribute decision analysis is the choice
   of an appropriate functional form for the utility function. We show that
   if a decision maker prefers more of any attribute to less and prefers to
   combine good lotteries with bad, as opposed to combining good with good
   and bad with bad, her utility function should be a weighted average (a
   mixture) of multiattribute exponential utilities ("mixex utility"). In
   the single-attribute case, mixex utility satisfies properties typically
   thought to be desirable and encompasses most utility functions commonly
   used in decision analysis. In the multiattribute case, mixex utility
   implies aversion to any multivariate risk. Risk aversion with respect to
   any attribute decreases as that attribute increases. Under certain
   restrictions, such risk aversion also decreases as any other attribute
   increases, and a multivariate one-switch property is satisfied. One of
   the strengths of mixex utility is its ability to represent cases where
   utility independence does not hold, but mixex utility can be consistent
   with mutual utility independence and take on a multilinear form. An
   example illustrates the fitting of mixex utility to preference
   assessments.

   investigate the performance of three commonly studied supply chain
   contracting mechanisms: the wholesale price contract, the buyback
   contract, and the revenue-sharing contract. The simplified setting we
   consider utilizes a two-echelon supply chain in which the retailer faces
   the newsvendor problem, the supplier has no capacity constraints, and
   delivery occurs instantaneously. We compare the three mechanisms in a
   laboratory setting using a novel design that fully controls for
   strategic interactions between the retailer and the supplier. Results
   indicate that although the buyback and revenue-sharing contracts improve
   supply chain efficiency relative to the wholesale price contract, the
   improvement is smaller than the theory predicts. We also find that
   although the buyback and revenue-sharing contracts are mathematically
   equivalent, they do not generally result in equivalent supply chain
   performance.

AB We consider sealed- and open-bid total-cost procurement auctions where
   two attributes are used for contract award decisions: price, which is
   bid by the supplier, and a fixed cost adjustment, which is included by
   the buyer to capture nonprice factors such as logistics costs. Suppliers
   know only their own true production cost and their own cost adjustment,
   and the buyer does not know the suppliers' true production costs but
   does know all suppliers' cost adjustments, which she herself sets in
   order to make an informed total-cost decision. The buyer, who seeks to
   minimize her total (price and cost adjustment) procurement cost, can
   choose to run a first-price sealed-bid auction, where suppliers' bids
   are affected by their beliefs about each other's total costs, or a
   descending open-bid auction, where only the actual realizations of
   suppliers' total costs drive the auction outcome. We characterize the
   buyer's choice between the two formats as a threshold decision over
   suppliers' cost adjustments and analyze the effect of supplier beliefs
   on her decision. We also study the impact of additional suppliers on the
   buyer's decision, the effect of correlation between suppliers'
   production costs and their cost adjustments, and additive as well as
   multiplicative total-cost functions. The results suggest that
   procurement managers can use their evaluations of suppliers' cost
   adjustments to make better auction format decisions.

   unneeded resources that could have been allocated for better uses. This
   paper studies the minimum committed budget required to implement a
   target audit probability when (i) the audit sample can be contingent on
   "red flags" due to signals of inspectees' private information (e.g.,
   from self-reporting) and (ii) the number of inspectees is large. It
   proposes an audit rule called bounded simple random sampling (SRS),
   which is shown to require no more committed budget to support than two
   other rules naturally generalized from the one-to-one analysis. When the
   number of inspectees is large enough, bounded SRS is nearly as good as
   any efficient audit rule, which demands the lowest committed budget
   necessary to implement the target audit probability. The results offer
   insights on how audit sampling plans may be formulated to reduce
   inefficiency and what budget usage ratios should be expected
   accordingly.

AB Estimating quantile sensitivities is important in many optimization
   applications, from hedging in financial engineering to service-level
   constraints in inventory control to more general chance constraints in
   stochastic programming. Recently, Hong (Hong, L. J. 2009. Estimating
   quantile sensitivities. Oper. Res. 57 118-130) derived a batched
   infinitesimal perturbation analysis estimator for quantile
   sensitivities, and Liu and Hong (Liu, G., L. J. Hong. 2009. Kernel
   estimation of quantile sensitivities. Naval Res. Logist. 56 511-525)
   derived a kernel estimator. Both of these estimators are consistent with
   convergence rates bounded by n(-1/3) and n(-2/5), respectively. In this
   paper, we use conditional Monte Carlo to derive a consistent quantile
   sensitivity estimator that improves upon these convergence rates and
   requires no batching or binning. We illustrate the new estimator using a
   simple but realistic portfolio credit risk example, for which the
   previous work is inapplicable.

AB We characterize the equilibrium behavior in a broad class of competition
   models in which the competing firms' market shares are given by an
   attraction model, and the aggregate sales in the industry depend on the
   aggregate attraction value according to a general function. Each firm's
   revenues and costs are proportional with its expected sales volume, with
   a cost rate that depends on the firm's chosen attraction value according
   to an arbitrary increasing function. Whereas most existing competition
   papers with attraction models can be viewed as special cases of this
   general model, we apply our general results to a new set of quality
   competition models. Here an industry has N suppliers of a given product,
   who compete for the business of one or more buyers. Each of the
   suppliers encounters an uncertain yield factor, with a given general
   yield distribution. The buyers face uncertain demands over the course of
   a given sales season. The suppliers compete by selecting key
   characteristics of their yield distributions, either their means, their
   standard deviations, or both. These choices have implications for their
   per-unit cost rates.

AB This paper uses the context of online banking to investigate the
   consequences of using self-service distribution channels to alter
   customer interactions with the firm. Using a sample of retail banking
   customers observed over a 30-month period at a large U.S. bank, we test
   whether changes in service consumption, cost to serve, and customer
   profitability are associated with the adoption of online banking. We
   find that customer adoption of online banking is associated with (1)
   substitution, primarily from incrementally more costly self-service
   delivery channels (automated teller machine and voice response unit);
   (2) augmentation of service consumption in more costly service delivery
   channels (branch and call center); (3) a substantial increase in total
   transaction volume; (4) an increase in estimated average cost to serve
   resulting from the combination of points (1)-(3); and (5) a reduction in
   short-term customer profitability. However, we find that use of the
   online banking channel is associated with higher customer retention
   rates over one-, two-, and three-year horizons. The documented
   relationship between the use of online banking and customer retention
   remains positive even after controlling for self-selection into the
   online channel. We also find evidence that future market shares for our
   sample firm are systematically higher in markets with high
   contemporaneous utilization rates for the online banking channel. This
   finding holds even after controlling for contemporaneous market share,
   suggesting it is not simply the result of increased market power leading
   to the acquisition of online banking customers.

AB This paper studies a monopolist firm selling a fixed capacity. The firm
   sets a price before demand uncertainty is resolved. Speculators may
   enter the market purely with the intention of resale, which can be
   profitable if demand turns out to be high. Consumers may strategically
   choose when to purchase, and they may also choose to purchase from the
   firm or from the speculators. We characterize equilibrium prices and
   profits and analyze the long-run capacity decisions of the firm. There
   are three major findings. First, the presence of speculators increases
   the firm's expected profits even though the resale market competes with
   the firm. Second, by facilitating resale, the firm can mimic dynamic
   pricing outcomes and enjoy the associated benefits while charging a
   fixed price. Third, speculative behavior may generate incentives for the
   seller to artificially restrict supply, and thus may lead to lower
   capacity investments. We also explore several model extensions that
   highlight the robustness of our results.

AB Are lone inventors more or less likely to invent breakthroughs? Recent
   research has attempted to resolve this question by considering the
   variance of creative outcome distributions. It has implicitly assumed a
   symmetric thickening or thinning of both tails, i.e., that a greater
   probability of breakthroughs comes at the cost of a greater probability
   of failures. In contrast, we propose that collaboration can have
   opposite effects at the two extremes: it reduces the probability of very
   poor outcomes-because of more rigorous selection processes-while
   simultaneously increasing the probability of extremely successful
   outcomes-because of greater recombinant opportunity in creative search.
   Analysis of over half a million patented inventions supports these
   arguments: Individuals working alone, especially those without
   affiliation to organizations, are less likely to achieve breakthroughs
   and more likely to invent particularly poor outcomes. Quantile
   regressions demonstrate that the effect is more than an upward mean
   shift. We find partial mediation of the effect of collaboration on
   extreme outcomes by the diversity of technical experience of team
   members and by the size of team members' external collaboration
   networks. Supporting our meta-argument for the importance of examining
   each tail of the distribution separately, experience diversity helps
   trim poor outcomes significantly more than it helps create
   breakthroughs, relative to the effect of external networks.

AB Monetary incentives, such as subsidies or bonuses, are often considered
   as a way to foster contributions to public goods in society and firms.
   This paper investigates experimentally the effect of private
   contribution incentives in the presence of a norm enforcement mechanism.
   Norm enforcement through peer punishment has been shown to be effective
   in raising contributions by itself. We test whether and how (centrally
   provided) private incentives interact with (decentralized) punishment,
   both of which affect subjects' monetary payoffs. The results of our
   experiment show that private incentives for contributors can reduce the
   effectiveness of the norm enforcement mechanism: Free riders are
   punished less harshly in the treatment with incentives, and as a
   consequence, average contributions to the public good are no higher than
   without incentives. This finding ties to and extends previous research
   on settings in which monetary incentives may fail to have the desired
   effect.

   Our approach furthermore allows designers to examine the change in the
   overall reliability of the organizational structure as the number of

   show how decision-making structures can be constructed so they maximize
   reliability for a given number of agents. Our model can be used directly
   for a qualitative assessment of decision-making structures. It is
   thereby useful for assessment of the many complicated hybrid structures
   that we see in actual decision-making organizations, such as banks,
   purchasing departments, and military intelligence. An application from a

AB Prior research documents performance improvements following the
   implementation of pay-for-performance (PFP) bonus plans. However, bonus
   plans typically pay for performance relative to a goal, and the manager
   whose performance is to be evaluated often participates in setting the
   goal. In these settings, PFP affects managers' incentive to influence
   goal levels in addition to affecting performance effort. Prior field
   research is silent on the effect of PFP on goals, the focus of this
   paper. Using sales and sales goal data from 61 stores of a U.S. retail
   firm over 10 quarters, we find that the introduction of a
   performance-based bonus plan with participative goal setting is
   accompanied by lower goals that are more accurate predictors of
   subsequent sales performance. Statistical tests indicate that increased
   goal accuracy is attributable to managers "meeting but not beating"
   goals and to new information being impounded in goals. We further
   investigate how differences among managers are associated with goal
   levels. We find significant "manager effects" but no "supervisor
   effects." In additional tests we find that cross-sectional differences
   among managers are related to differing marginal returns to
   slack-building effort. Turning to the role of new information on goals,
   we find that prior period performance has incremental power to explain
   goal levels in the postplan period. Our results provide field-based
   evidence that PFP and participative goal setting affect the level and
   accuracy of goals, effects that are associated with both information
   exchange and with managers' incentives to influence goals.

AB When designing a sourcing strategy in practice, a key task is to
   determine the average order rates placed to each source because that
   affects cost and supplier management. We consider a firm that has access
   to a responsive nearshore source (e.g., Mexico) and a low-cost offshore
   source (e. g., China). The firm must determine an inventory sourcing
   policy to satisfy random demand over time. Unfortunately, the optimal
   policy is too complex to allow a direct answer to our key question.
   Therefore, we analyze a tailored base-surge (TBS) sourcing policy that
   is simple, used in practice, and captures the classic trade-off between
   cost and responsiveness. The TBS policy combines push and pull controls
   by replenishing at a constant rate from the offshore source and
   producing at the nearshore plant only when inventory is below a target.
   The constant base allocation allows the offshore facility to focus on
   cost efficiency, whereas the nearshore facility's quick response
   capability is utilized only dynamically to guarantee high service. The
   research goals are to (i) determine the allocation of random demand into
   base and surge capacity, (ii) estimate corresponding working capital
   requirements, and (iii) identify and value the key drivers of dual
   sourcing. We present performance bounds on the optimal cost and prove
   that economic optimization brings the system into heavy traffic. We
   analyze the sourcing policy that is asymptotically optimal for
   high-volume systems and present a simple "square-root" formula that is
   insightful to answer our questions and sufficiently accurate for
   practice, as is demonstrated with a validation study.

AB Many companies offer websites that enable customers to design their own
   individual products, which the manufacturer can then produce to order.
   To date, the economic value of products self-designed using mass
   customization (MC) toolkits has been attributed to the two factors of
   preference fit achieved (which should be as high as possible) and design
   effort (which should be as low as possible). On the basis of literature
   on behavioral decision making, we suggest a third factor, namely the
   awareness of being the creator of the product design. In the course of
   five different studies, we provide experimental evidence that this "I
   designed it myself" effect creates economic value for the customer.
   Regardless of the two other factors, self-designed products generate a
   significantly higher willingness to pay. This effect is mediated by
   feelings of accomplishment and moderated by the outcome of the process
   as well as the individual's perceived contribution to the self-design
   process. These findings have important implications for MC companies: It
   is not enough merely to design MC toolkits in such a way that preference
   fit is maximized and design effort is minimized. To capture the full
   value of MC, toolkits should also elicit "I designed it myself"
   feelings.

   the product is highly perishable, retailers are biased toward excessive
   price competition and inadequate inventories. Vertical price floors or
   inventory buybacks (subsidies for unsold inventory) can coordinate
   incentives in both pricing and inventory decisions. When the product is

AB The pharmaceutical industry has always used sales representatives to
   target physicians (detailing), who are a key link in sales and market
   share for prescription pharmaceuticals. Since August of 1997, when the
   Food and Drug Administration eased the restrictions on
   direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), there has been a dramatic
   increase in the use of DTCA by pharmaceutical firms to target end
   customers (patients). DTCA seems to have two different effects on
   pharmaceutical markets. The first is to inform patients about the
   availability of drugs for some ailments, thus expanding the market
   (constructive). The second is to persuade patients to talk about
   specific brands when they meet physicians, with the objective of
   influencing market share (combative). We consider both effects of DTCA
   in the presence of a detailing program in a competitive environment. We
   incorporate the dynamics of physician-patient interaction in a
   game-theoretic model where firms decide on the form of DTCA to adopt
   (constructive or combative) and then compete in the marketplace by
   choosing detailing and DTCA levels. We answer four questions: What is
   the impact of adopting DTCA on competitive intensity? How do optimal
   detailing levels for a firm change with the adoption of DTCA? How should
   the DTCA strategy for a firm vary depending on whether it is stronger or
   weaker in its degree of influence in the physician's office? Finally,
   under what conditions would competing firms voluntarily decide to pursue
   constructive DTCA?

AB This paper introduces a method to measure regret theory, a popular
   theory of decision under uncertainty. Regret theory allows for
   violations of transitivity, and it may seem paradoxical to
   quantitatively measure an intransitive theory. We adopt the trade-off
   method and show that it is robust to violations of transitivity. Our
   method makes no assumptions about the shape of the functions reflecting
   utility and regret. It can be performed at the individual level, taking
   account of preference heterogeneity. Our data support the main
   assumption of regret theory, that people are disproportionately averse
   to large regrets, even when event-splitting effects are controlled for.
   The findings are robust: similar results were obtained in two
   measurements using different stimuli. The data support the reliability
   of the trade-off method: its measurements could be replicated using
   different stimuli and were not susceptible to strategic responding.

   using archival data from a manufacturing line. We show that workers do

   vary widely. Because workers are different both in speed and reaction,
   managerial implications are not straightforward. We model an optimal and

AB To date, optimization models of endogenous technological change commonly
   deal with uncertainty in technological learning with risk-factor
   methods, i.e., by adding expected risk costs resulting from
   overestimating technological learning rates into an objective function
   with a subjective risk factor. This paper argues that another way of
   coping with the uncertainty, risk-constrained methods that have been
   ignored in existing literatures, could be more practicable (at least as
   a supplement) for decision support. With a simplified model, this paper
   explores technology development paths generated by two risk-constrained
   methods, and compares the two risk-constrained methods with a
   risk-factor method. Our study shows that comparing with the risk-factor
   method, the two risk-constrained methods also generate an S-shaped
   technology diffusion pattern, which accords with historical
   observations, and they can result in earlier as well as later adoption
   of an advanced but currently expensive technology, depending on
   different combinations of uncertainty levels of the technology learning
   rate and the upper limit on the expected risk cost. Another finding of
   our research is that two totally different technology development paths
   can both be optimal solutions, which implies that with early policy
   interventions there is the possibility that an economy could be led to a
   low-carbon economy with little additional cost.

AB Automobile manufacturers in the U.S. supply chain exhibit significant
   differences in their days of supply of finished vehicles (average
   inventory divided by average daily sales rate). For example, from 1995
   to 2004, Toyota consistently carried approximately 30 fewer days of
   supply than General Motors. This suggests that Toyota's well-documented
   advantage in manufacturing efficiency, product design, and upstream
   supply chain management extends to their finished-goods inventory in
   their downstream supply chain from their assembly plants to their
   dealerships. Our objective in this research is to measure for this
   industry the effect of several factors on inventory holdings. We find
   that two factors, the number of dealerships in a manufacturer's
   distribution network and a manufacturer's production flexibility,
   explain essentially all of the difference in finished-goods inventory
   between Toyota and three other manufacturers: Chrysler, Ford, and
   General Motors.

AB To mitigate the threat that terrorists smuggle weapons of mass
   destruction into the United States through maritime containers, the U.
   S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspects containers
   upon entry to domestic ports. Inspection-driven congestion is costly,
   and CBP provides incentives to firms to improve security upstream in the
   supply chain, thereby reducing the inspection burden at U. S. ports. We
   perform an economic analysis of this incentive program, called
   Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), modeling in a
   game-theoretic framework the strategic interaction between CBP, trading
   firms, and terrorists. Our equilibrium results highlight the possibility
   that a properly run program can efficiently shift some of CBP's security
   burden to private industry. These results also suggest that CBP may have
   the opportunity to use strategic delay as an incentive for firms to
   join. Analysis of comparative statics shows that, with increasing
   capacity, membership in C-TPAT systematically declines.

AB In addition to the wireless telephony boom, a similar exponentially
   increasing trend in wireless data service for example, short message
   service (SMS)-is visible as technology advances. We develop a structural
   model to examine user demand for voice service and SMS. Specifically, we
   measure the own-and cross-price elasticities of these services. The
   cross-price elasticity is of significant importance because marketing
   activities are critically influenced by whether the goods are
   substitutes or complements. The research context poses significant
   econometric challenges due to three-part tariffs and sequential discrete
   plan choice and continuous quantity choice decisions. Using detailed
   individual consumption data of more than 6,000 customers, we find that
   SMS and voice service are small substitutes. A 10% increase in the price
   of voice minutes will induce about a 0.8% increase in the demand for
   SMS. The own-price elasticity of voice is also low, to the order of
   approximately -0.1. Younger users' demand is far more inelastic than
   that of older users. We then conduct counterfactual policy experiments
   that fully capture the effects of changes in key parameters on the
   firm's revenues. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of our
   framework.

AB We study how firms can use a knowledge management system to optimally
   leverage employee-generated know-how. In particular, we consider the
   following practical strategic questions for the manager of a
   knowledge-intensive firm: Should her firm develop a formal knowledge
   system? And if so, how should it be managed, particularly in terms of
   what information to record? We find that firms benefit more from a
   knowledge system when they are larger, face the same issues more
   frequently, have higher turnover, and face problems about which there is
   less general knowledge. In terms of what information to record, a key
   insight is that recording moderately successful practices can be
   counterproductive, because doing so may inefficiently reduce employees'
   incentives to experiment. This "strong-form competency trap" forces
   firms into an exploration exploitation trade-off. Firms that value a
   knowledge system most should also be most selective in recording
   information. We further find that recording successes is more valuable
   than recording failures, which supports firms' focus on best practice.
   Beyond these main principles, we also show that it may be optimal to
   disseminate know-how on a plant level but not on a firm level, and that
   recording backup solutions is most valuable at medium levels of
   environmental change.

AB We introduce a modi. cation of the discounted utility model that
   accounts for both satiation and habit formation in intertemporal choice.
   Preferences depend on the satiation level and the habitual consumption
   level. These two state variables, together with the shape of the value
   function, drive the properties of the model. One unique feature of our
   model is that it addresses the trade-off between seeking variety and
   maintaining acquired habits. We examine several properties of our model,
   such as the nontrivial patterns of desirability (willingness to pay) for
   an additional unit of consumption, or the effect of abstaining from
   consumption (craving). We explore the shape of optimal consumption
   patterns in discrete and continuous choice settings. If subjects
   underestimate the changes in satiation and habituation levels, as occurs
   under projection bias, our model explains why people buy more when
   hungry, or prefer variety in advance of consumption but stay with the
   same consumption good in actual use.

AB Firms collaborate to develop and deliver new products. These
   collaborations vary in terms of the similarity of the competencies that
   partnering firms bring to the alliance. In same-function alliances,
   partnering firms have similar competencies, whereas in cross-function
   alliances, partners have very different competencies. On examining
   managers' view of these alliances, we find that, on average,
   same-function alliances are expected to perform better than
   cross-function alliances, holding fixed the level of inputs. A
   game-theoretic analysis shows that this apprehension about
   cross-function alliances is consistent with a Pareto-inferior
   equilibrium. A Pareto-superior equilibrium, however, suggests that
   partners in cross-function alliances may invest more in their alliances
   than those in same-function alliances. It is also often believed that
   increasing the number of partnering firms is not conducive for
   collaborative effort. Our analysis shows that this belief is correct for
   same-function alliances, but not for cross-function alliances. We test
   these equilibrium predictions in an experiment where we exogenously vary
   the type of alliance and the number of partnering firms. The
   experimental results lend support for the Pareto-superior equilibrium.
   Partners in cross-function alliances invested more than their
   counterparts in same-function alliances, and this difference in
   investment levels increased with the number of partnering firms. We
   extend our model to consider alliances where firms have an opportunity
   to learn from their partners and later leverage this knowledge outside
   the scope of their alliance. Though such learning increases the
   resources committed by alliance partners in the learning phase, it
   decreases investment in the subsequent competition and also dampens the
   overall investment across the two stages. In addition, an increase in
   interalliance competition decreases investments in the focal alliance
   but increases investment in the competition outside the scope of the
   alliance.

AB We propose a new data perturbation method for numerical database
   security problems based on skew-t distributions. Unlike the normal
   distribution, the more general class of skew-t distributions is a
   flexible parametric multivariate family that can model skewness and
   heavy tails in the data. Because databases having a normal distribution
   are seldom encountered in practice, the newly proposed approach, coined
   the skew-t data perturbation (STDP) method, is of great interest for
   database managers. We also discuss how to preserve the sample mean
   vector and sample covariance matrix exactly for any data perturbation
   method. We investigate the performance of the STDP method by means of a
   Monte Carlo simulation study and compare it with other existing
   perturbation methods. Of particular importance is the ability of STDP to
   reproduce characteristics of the joint tails of the distribution in
   order for database users to answer higher-level questions. We apply the
   STDP method to a medical database related to breast cancer.

AB We consider two-part pricing of a service offered to risk-averse buyers
   subject to demand uncertainty. Buyers subscribe to the contract before
   resolution of the uncertainty. Sellers set two-part prices that trade
   off between insuring buyers against the uncertainty and the ex post
   deadweight loss from inefficient usage. If marginal and total benefits
   from the service are positively correlated (a sufficient condition is
   that the uncertainty not directly affect the buyer benefit), the usage
   charge should be set above the marginal cost of the service. If marginal
   and total benefits are negatively correlated, the usage charge should be
   set below the marginal cost. These results apply whether the seller has
   market power or is subject to competition. The difference between the
   profit-maximizing usage charge and marginal cost increases with buyer
   risk aversion. Our results can be extended to the case of the seller
   being more risk averse than the buyers. We discuss applications to

AB This paper studies the incentives behind the adoption of radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) in a supply chain. One prominent feature of RFID
   technology is that once RFID tags are attached on the items at an
   upstream site, the same tags can be reused at its downstream sites at
   lower or zero variable cost. This creates an interesting, one-sided
   "free-rider" problem, where the downstream would wait to free-ride on
   the upstream's first move, but not vice versa. Using a stylized
   game-theoretic model, we characterize the equilibrium strategies of the
   two firms. Compared to the first-best solution, firms in equilibrium
   tend to adopt too late. We then study the dual benefits of technology
   coordination between the two firms and find that it would not only save
   redundant costs of putting tags, but also speed up the downstream's RFID
   adoption. We also show that the equal-cost-split arrangement shifts the
   bene. t of free-riding to the upstream, thereby mitigating the negative
   impacts in many cases. But it may distort the market when it operates in
   the optimal manner. The general message of the model is that technology
   coordination and cost-split each contribute to the mitigation of the
   free-rider problem in RFID adoption.

AB Research on bidding in auctions has generally relied on the assumption
   of self-interested bidders. This work relaxes that assumption in the
   context of charity auctions. Because understanding charitable motives
   has important implications for auction design and charities' fundraising
   strategies, this study investigates bidders' specific types of
   charitable motives and the strength of these motives. We carry out three
   controlled field experiments consisting of real-life auctions conducted
   on a local Internet auction site. We use a novel design in which we
   simultaneously run charity and noncharity auctions for identical
   products and vary the percentage donated to charity. Results show that
   auctions with proceeds donated to charity lead to significantly higher
   selling prices, a result due to a higher bidding by bidders with
   charitable motives rather than to increased bidder entry. We also find
   that increased prices only occur when the charitable donation is a
   percentage of the auction revenue, and that a fixed charitable donation
   associated with each auction has no effect on prices. Furthermore, we
   find that prices are increasing in the percentage donated to charity. We
   find considerable support for a model of voluntary shill-like bidding,
   where charitable bidders try to increase proceeds in charity auctions.
   We also find that auctions with 25% of revenue donated to charity had
   higher net revenue than noncharity auctions. Hence, companies may be
   able to use charity auctions as part of a corporate social
   responsibility strategy and at the same time increase profitability even
   though they donate part of the proceeds to charity.

AB The practice of having Ph.D. graduates employed by the university that
   trained them, commonly called "academic inbreeding," has long been
   suspected to be damaging to scholarly practices and achievement. Despite
   this perception, existing work on academic inbreeding is scarce and
   mostly exploratory. Using data from Mexico, we find evidence that,
   first, academic inbreeding is associated with lower scholarly output.
   Second, the academically inbred faculty is relatively more centered on
   its own institution and less open to the rest of the scientific world.
   This navel-gazing tendency is a critical driver of its reduced
   scientific output when compared with noninbred faculties. Third, we
   reveal that academic inbreeding could be the result of an institutional
   practice, such that these faculty members contribute disproportionately
   more to teaching and outreach activities, which allows noninbred faculty
   members to dedicate themselves to the research endeavor. Thus, a limited
   presence of inbreds can benefit the research output of noninbreds and
   potentially the whole university, but a dominantly inbred environment
   will stifle productivity, even for noninbreds. Overall, our analysis
   suggests that administrators and policy makers in developing nations who
   aim to develop a thriving research environment should consider
   mechanisms to limit this practice.

AB Companies in a variety of industries (e.g., airlines, hotels, theaters)
   often use last-minute sales to dispose of unsold capacity. Although this
   may generate incremental revenues in the short term, the long-term
   consequences of such a strategy are not immediately obvious: More
   discounted last-minute tickets may lead to more consumers anticipating
   the discount and delaying the purchase rather than buying at the regular
   ( higher) prices, hence potentially reducing revenues for the company.
   To mitigate such behavior, many service providers have turned to opaque
   intermediaries, such as Hotwire.com, that hide many descriptive
   attributes of the service ( e. g., departure times for airline tickets)
   so that the buyer cannot fully predict the ultimate service provider.
   Using a stylized economic model, this paper attempts to explain and
   compare the benefits of last-minute sales directly to consumers versus
   through an opaque intermediary. We utilize the notion of rational
   expectations to model consumer purchasing decisions: Consumers make
   early purchase decisions based on expectations regarding future
   availability, and these expectations are correct in equilibrium. We show
   that direct last-minute sales are preferred over selling through an
   opaque intermediary when consumer valuations for travel are high or
   there is little service differentiation between competing service
   providers, or both; otherwise, opaque selling dominates. Moreover,
   contrary to the usual belief that such sales are purely mechanisms for
   disposal of unused capacity, we show that opaque selling becomes more
   preferred over direct last-minute selling as the probability of having
   high demand increases. When firms randomize between opaque selling and
   last-minute selling strategies, they are increasingly likely to choose
   the opaque selling strategy as the probability of high demand increases.
   When firms with unequal capacities use the opaque selling strategy,
   consumers know more clearly where the opaque ticket is from and the
   efficacy of opaque selling decreases.

AB This paper considers the so-called warehouse problem with both space and
   injection/withdrawal capacity limits. This is a foundational problem in
   the merchant management of assets for the storage of commodities, such
   as energy sources and natural resources. When the commodity spot price
   evolves according to an exogenous Markov process, this work shows that
   the optimal inventory-trading policy of a risk-neutral merchant is
   characterized by two stage and spot-price dependent basestock targets.
   Under some assumptions, these targets are monotone in the spot price and
   partition the available inventory and spot-price space in each stage
   into three regions, where it is, respectively, optimal to buy and
   inject, do nothing, and withdraw and sell. In some cases of practical
   importance, one can easily compute the optimal basestock targets. The
   structure of the optimal policy is nontrivial because in each stage the
   merchant's qualification of high (selling) and low (buying) commodity
   prices in general depends on the merchant's inventory availability. This
   is a consequence of the interplay between the capacity and space limits
   of the storage asset and brings to light the nontrivial nature of the
   interface between trading and operations. A computational analysis based
   on natural gas data shows that mismanaging this interface can yield
   significant value losses. Moreover, adapting the merchant's optimal
   trading policy to the spot-price stochastic evolution has substantial
   value. This value can be almost entirely generated by reacting to the
   unfolding of price uncertainty, that is, by sequentially reoptimizing a
   model that ignores this source of uncertainty.

AB Product architecture and organizational communication play significant
   roles in complex product development efforts. By using networks to
   characterize both product structure and communication patterns, we
   examine the impact of mismatches between these on new product
   development (NPD) performance. Specifically, we study the vehicle
   development process of a major auto company and use vehicle quality
   (warranty repairs) as our NPD performance metric. Our empirical results
   indicate that centrality in a product architecture network is related to
   quality according to an inverted-U relationship, which suggests that
   vehicle subsystems of intermediate complexity exhibit abnormally high
   levels of quality problems. To identify specific subsystems in danger of
   excessive quality problems, we characterize mismatches between product
   architecture and organizational structure by de. ning a new metric,
   called coordination deficit, and show that it is positively associated
   with quality problems. These results deepen our understanding of the
   impact of organizational structure and product architecture on the NPD
   process and provide tools with which managers can diagnose and improve
   their NPD systems.

AB W e describe a model examining how a firm might choose the package size
   and price for a product that deteriorates over time. Our model considers
   four factors: (1) the usable life of the product, (2) the rates at which
   consumers use the product, (3) the relation between package size and the
   variable cost of the product, and (4) the minimum quantities consumers
   seek to consume for each dollar they spend (we call these reservation
   quantities). We allow heterogeneity in the usage rates and reservation
   quantities for the consumers. We show that when the cost increases as a
   linear or convex function of the package size, the firm should make
   packages of the smallest possible size. Smaller packages reduce waste
   and allow consumers to more closely match their purchases with desired
   consumption. This in turn allows the firm to charge a higher unit price
   and also sell more unit volume. The results imply that in a market with
   multiple package sizes ( produced by the same or competing firms), at
   least one of the packages must have the smallest possible size, provided
   the fixed cost of making the product is sufficiently low. For concave
   cost functions, the firm may find it optimal to make larger than
   smallest-size packages.

AB Jordan and Graves (Jordan, W. C., S. C. Graves. 1995. Principles on the

   are most effective when positioned directly at the source of
   variability. However, although expected profit increases as logistics.
   exibility is positioned closer to the source of variability (i.e.,
   downstream for demand variability and upstream for supply variability),
   locating process. exibility anywhere except at the stage with
   variability leads to the same decrease in expected profit.

AB Decision makers sometimes have to choose between alternative options
   about which they have no preference: either they judge the options
   equally valuable (indifference) or they have no judgment about their
   relative value (noncomparability). Choosing randomly is generally
   considered a natural way to deal with such situations. This paper shows,
   however, that systematic randomization between noncomparable options may
   lead to a chain of decisions resulting in monetary losses (a money
   pump). Furthermore, these losses can be avoided by deliberately
   selecting one of the noncomparable options instead of randomizing. Thus,
   randomization among noncomparable options is costly relative to
   deliberate selection. On the other hand, randomization among indifferent
   options is costless relative to deliberate selection.

AB Technology transfer to low-cost locations offers global firms an
   opportunity to reduce their variable costs involved in serving emerging
   markets. However, such moves may also make imitation by local
   competitors easier. As a consequence, technology transfer may create
   competition in the local market. We introduce component-based technology
   transfer for the global firm as a means to deter or accommodate the
   imitators' entry, recognizing that components may differ in
   technological complexity. By choosing a subset of components to
   transfer, the global firm's decision has an impact not only on the
   imitators' fixed entry costs, but also on postentry competition based on
   variable costs. Our research identifies two different types of
   deterrence strategies-the barrier-erecting strategy and the
   market-grabbing strategy. In the former deterrence strategy, the global
   firm retains enough component technology in the home country to make the
   potential imitator's fixed entry costs so high that it is not worthwhile
   entering. In the latter deterrence strategy, the global firm transfers
   enough component technology to the emerging market, reducing the global
   firm's variable cost to make the potential imitator's revenues so low
   that it is not worthwhile entering. Which deterrence strategy the global
   firm should employ depends on the degree to which geographical proximity
   reduces imitation costs and the degree of differentiation between the
   local firm's and the global firm's products. Some other interesting and
   counterintuitive results arise. For example, it may benefit a global
   firm to transfer less technology for products with a higher emerging
   market potential.

AB The overuse of its currency processing facilities by depository
   institutions (DIs) has motivated the Federal Reserve (Fed) to impose its
   new cash recirculation policy. This overuse is characterized by the
   practice of cross-shipping, where a DI both deposits and withdraws cash
   of the same denomination in the same business week in the same
   geographical area. Under the new policy, which came into effect July
   2007, the Fed has imposed a recirculation fee on cross-shipped cash. The
   Fed intends to use this fee to induce DIs to effectively recirculate
   cash so that the societal cost of providing cash to the public is
   lowered. To examine the efficacy of this mechanism, we first
   characterize the social optimum and then analyze the response of DIs
   under a recirculation fee levied on cross-shipped cash. We show that
   neither a linear recirculation fee, which is the Fed's current practice,
   nor a more sophisticated nonlinear fee is sufficient to guarantee a
   socially optimal response from DIs. We then derive a fundamentally
   different mechanism that induces DIs to self-select the social optimum.
   Our mechanism incorporates a fairness adjustment that avoids penalizing
   DIs that recirculate their fair share of cash and rewards DIs that
   recirculate more than this amount. We demonstrate that the mechanism is
   easy to implement and tolerates a reasonable amount of imprecision in
   the problem parameters. We also discuss a concept of welfare-preserving
   redistribution wherein the Fed allows a group of DIs to reallocate
   (amongst themselves) their deposits and demand if such a possibility
   does not increase societal cost. Finally, we analyze the impact of
   incorporating the custodial inventory program, another component of the
   Fed's new policy.

AB It is common for a retailer to sell products from competing
   manufacturers. How then should the firms manage their contract
   negotiations? The supply chain coordination literature focuses either on
   a single manufacturer selling to a single retailer or one manufacturer
   selling to many (possibly competing) retailers. We find that some key
   conclusions from those market structures do not apply in our setting,
   where multiple manufacturers sell through a single retailer. We allow
   the manufacturers to compete for the retailer's business using one of
   three types of contracts: a wholesale-price contract, a
   quantity-discount contract, or a two-part tariff. It is well known that
   the latter two, more sophisticated contracts enable the manufacturer to
   coordinate the supply chain, thereby maximizing the profits available to
   the firms. More importantly, they allow the manufacturer to extract
   rents from the retailer, in theory allowing the manufacturer to leave
   the retailer with only her reservation profit. However, we show that in
   our market structure these two sophisticated contracts force the
   manufacturers to compete more aggressively relative to when they only
   offer wholesale-price contracts, and this may leave them worse off and
   the retailer substantially better off. In other words, although in a
   serial supply chain a retailer may have just cause to fear quantity
   discounts and two-part tariffs, a retailer may actually prefer those
   contracts when offered by competing manufacturers. We conclude that the
   properties a contractual form exhibits in a one-manufacturer supply
   chain may not carry over to the realistic setting in which multiple
   manufacturers must compete to sell their goods through the same
   retailer.

AB In a wide variety of settings, organizations generate a number of
   possible solutions to a problem-ideas-and then select a few for further
   development. We examine the effectiveness of two group structures for
   such tasks-the team structure, in which the group works together in time
   and space, and the hybrid structure, in which individuals first work
   independently and then work together. We define the performance of a
   group as the quality of the best ideas identified. Prior research has
   defined performance as the average quality of ideas or the number of
   ideas generated, ignoring what most organizations seek, a few great
   ideas. We build a theory that relates organizational phenomena to four
   different variables that govern the quality of the best ideas
   identified: (1) the average quality of ideas generated, (2) the number
   of ideas generated, (3) the variance in the quality of ideas generated,
   and (4) the ability of the group to discern the quality of the ideas. We
   test this theory with an experiment. We find that groups organized in
   the hybrid structure are able to generate more ideas, to generate better
   ideas, and to better discern the quality of the ideas they generate.
   Moreover, we find that the frequently recommended brainstorming
   technique of building on others' ideas is counterproductive; teams
   exhibiting such buildup neither create more ideas, nor are the ideas
   that build on previous ideas better.

AB Some luxury goods manufacturers offer limited editions of their
   products, whereas some others market multiple product lines. Researchers
   have found that reference groups shape consumer evaluations of these
   product categories. Yet little empirical research has examined how
   reference groups affect the product line decisions of firms. Indeed, in
   a field setting it is quite a challenge to isolate reference group
   effects from contextual effects and correlated effects. In this paper,
   we propose a parsimonious model that allows us to study how reference
   groups influence firm behavior and that lends itself to experimental
   analysis. With the aid of the model, we investigate the behavior of
   consumers in a laboratory setting where we can focus on the reference
   group effects after controlling for the contextual and correlated
   effects. The experimental results show that in the presence of strong
   reference group effects, limited editions and multiple products can help
   improve firms' profits. Furthermore, the trends in the purchase
   decisions of our participants point to the possibility that they are
   capable of introspecting close to two steps of thinking at the outset of
   the game and then learning through reinforcement mechanisms.

   optimal disclosure of proprietary information when firms compete in
   multiple markets. The analysis demonstrates that in the presence of
   multiple segments, the unraveling result applies at the firmwide level
   but not necessarily segment by segment. Instead, when the firm has an ex
   ante desire to withhold information and segments are sufficiently
   similar, the ex post disclosure equilibrium entails aggregation of
   segment details. Aggregation arises because any ex post temptation to
   disaggregate and reveal particularly favorable news in one segment
   entails revealing unfavorable news in another segment. A desire to
   balance profits across segments then leads a firm to disclose firmwide
   information (a temptation that cannot be avoided), but only in the
   aggregate.

AB Scientists and engineers in small firms are far more likely than their
   large firm counterparts to enter entrepreneurship. We label this
   phenomenon the small firm effect and explore its origins. In particular,
   we identify four classes of explanations for the small firm
   effect-preference sorting, ability sorting, opportunity cost, and the
   possibility that workers in small firms develop entrepreneurial human
   capital-and examine the empirical evidence for each. We find that
   preference sorting does play a role in generating the small firm effect:
   small firms attract those with prior preferences for autonomy who are
   similarly drawn into entrepreneurship. Similarly, ability sorting plays
   a role: those who ultimately become entrepreneurs may be drawn first to
   small firms because they offer tighter pay-for-performance links and can
   subsequently improve their expected earnings by becoming entrepreneurs,
   or because the skills required for success in small firms are also
   valuable in entrepreneurship. Evidence suggests that although those with
   the very least to lose do enter entrepreneurship with greater frequency,
   opportunity cost has at best a modest role to play in explaining the
   small firm effect. Finally, we interpret evidence that prior experience
   in small firms predicts positive performance outcomes in the early
   stages of entrepreneurship as suggesting that workers in small firms may
   develop entrepreneurial human capital that makes them better
   entrepreneurs. This effect may be largest among those of high ability.

AB We examine the role of information-based stock trading in affecting the

   into an optimal incentive contracting model, we analytically show that,
   apart from reducing incentives, a greater risk increases the level of
   information-based trading, which consequently enhances executive
   incentives and offsets the negative risk-incentive relation. We
   calibrate the model and find that the economic magnitude of this
   incentive-enhancement effect is significant. Our empirical test using
   real-world executive compensation data lends strong support to the model
   prediction. Our results suggest that principals (boards of directors)

AB The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a decision-making procedure
   widely used in management for establishing priorities in multicriteria
   decision problems. Underlying the AHP is the theory of ratio-scale
   measures developed in psychophysics since the middle of the last
   century. It is, however, well known that classical ratio-scaling
   approaches have several problems. We reconsider the AHP in the light of
   the modern theory of measurement based on the so-called separable
   representations recently axiomatized in mathematical psychology. We
   provide various theoretical and empirical results on the extent to which
   the AHP can be considered a reliable decision-making procedure in terms
   of the modern theory of subjective measurement.

AB Using administrative data for high-priority calls in Calgary, Alberta,
   we estimate how ambulance travel times depend on distance. We find that
   a logarithmic transformation produces symmetric travel-time
   distributions with heavier tails than those of a normal distribution.
   Guided by nonparametric estimates of the median and coefficient of
   variation, we demonstrate that a previously proposed model for mean fire
   engine travel times is a valid and useful description of median
   ambulance travel times. We propose a new specification for the
   coefficient of variation, which decreases with distance. We illustrate
   how the resulting travel-time distribution model can be used to create
   probability-of-coverage maps for diagnosis and improvement of system
   performance.

AB Increasing globalization has created tremendous opportunities and
   challenges for organizations and societies. Consequently, a broad range
   of information technologies to better support the collaboration of
   diverse, and increasingly distributed, sets of participants is ever more
   utilized. Arguably, the success of such technology-mediated
   collaboration is dependent upon the quality of each individual's
   contributions; however, although individuals' motivations to do their
   best could be significantly influenced by the design of a system's
   human-computer interface, this area has received little attention within
   the context of group collaboration environments. We fill this gap by
   integrating research from human-computer interaction, motivation, and
   technology-supported group work to theoretically derive mechanisms for
   increasing each individual's motivation within a collective setting.
   Specifically, we manipulate the interface of a computer-mediated idea
   generation system (a widely used collaboration tool) to enhance the
   system's motivational affordance, i.e., the system's properties that
   fulfill users' motivational needs. Results from two studies demonstrate
   that by embedding the theoretically derived mechanisms "providing
   feedback" and "designing for optimal challenge" into the collaboration
   environment, significant performance gains were realized. The results
   suggest that even slight manipulations of the human-computer interface
   can contribute significantly to the successful design of a wide variety
   of group collaboration environments.

AB The use of H-1B and other work visas to hire foreign information
   technology (IT) professionals in the United States has attracted
   significant controversy and policy debates. On one hand, hiring
   high-skill foreign IT professionals on work visas can be advantageous
   for U.S. firms and the overall economy. On the other hand, high-skill
   immigration can adversely impact the wages of foreign and American IT
   professionals. This study uses data on skills and compensation of more
   than 50,000 IT professionals in the United States over the period
   2000-2005 to study patterns in compensation of foreign and American IT
   professionals to inform these debates. Contrary to the popular belief
   that foreign workers are a cheap source of labor for U.S. firms,we find
   that after controlling for their human capital attributes, foreign IT
   professionals (those without U. S. citizenship and those with H-1B or
   other work visas) earn a salary premium when compared with IT
   professionals with U. S. citizenship. The salary premiums for non-U.S.
   citizens and for those on work visas fluctuate in response to supply
   shocks created by the annual caps on new H-1B visas. Setting lower and
   fully utilized annual caps results in higher salary premiums for
   non-U.S. citizens and those with work visas. We discuss implications of
   this study for crafting informed visa-and immigration-related policies
   by the U. S. government, for staffing practices of firms, and for human
   capital investments by IT professionals.

AB Retail store managers may not follow order advices generated by an
   automated inventory replenishment system if their incentives differ from
   the cost-minimization objective of the system or if they perceive the
   system to be suboptimal. We study the ordering behavior of retail store
   managers in a supermarket chain to characterize such deviations in
   ordering behavior, investigate their potential drivers, and thereby
   devise a method to improve automated replenishment systems. Using
   orders, shipments, and point-of-sale data for 19,417 item-store
   combinations over five stores, we show that (i) store managers
   consistently modify automated order advices by advancing orders from
   peak to nonpeak days, and (ii) this behavior is explained significantly
   by product characteristics such as case pack size relative to average
   demand per item, net shelf space, product variety, demand uncertainty,
   and seasonality error. Our regression results suggest that store
   managers improve upon the automated replenishment system by
   incorporating two ignored factors: in-store handling costs and sales
   improvement potential through better in-stock. Based on these results,
   we construct a method to modify automated order advices by learning from
   the behavior of store managers. Motivated by the management coefficients
   theory, our method is efficient to implement and outperforms store
   managers by achieving a more balanced handling workload with similar
   average days of inventory.

TI Reality Check: Combining Choice Experiments with Market Data to Estimate

AB Discrete choice models estimated using hypothetical choices made in a
   survey setting (i.e., choice experiments) are widely used to estimate
   the importance of product attributes in order to make product design and
   marketing mix decisions. Choice experiments allow the researcher to
   estimate preferences for product features that do not yet exist in the
   market. However, parameters estimated from experimental data often show
   marked inconsistencies with those inferred from the market, reducing
   their usefulness in forecasting and decision making. We propose an
   approach for combining choice-based conjoint data with individual-level
   purchase data to produce estimates that are more consistent with the
   market. Unlike prior approaches for calibrating conjoint models so that
   they correctly predict aggregate market shares for a "baseline" market,
   the proposed approach is designed to produce parameters that are more
   consistent with those that can be inferred from individual-level market
   data.
   The proposed method relies on a new general framework for combining two
   or more sources of individual-level choice data to estimate a
   hierarchical discrete choice model. Past approaches to combining choice
   data assume that the population mean for the parameters is the same
   across both data sets and require that data sets are sampled from the
   same population. In contrast, we incorporate in the model individual
   characteristic variables, and assert only that the mapping between
   individuals' characteristics and their preferences is the same across
   the data sets. This allows the model to be applied even if the sample of
   individuals observed in each data set is not representative of the
   population as a whole, so long as appropriate product-use variables are
   collected that can explain the systematic deviations between them. The
   framework also explicitly incorporates a model for the individual
   characteristics, which allows us to use Bayesian missing-data techniques
   to handle the situation where each data set contains different
   demographic variables. This makes the method useful in practice for a
   wide range of existing market and conjoint data sets. We apply the
   method to a set of conjoint and market data for minivan choice and find
   that the proposed method predicts holdout market choices better than a
   model estimated from conjoint data alone or a model that does not
   include demographic variables.

AB Fund managers have to decide the amount of a fund's assets that should
   be kept in cash, considering the trade-off between being able to meet
   shareholder redemptions and minimizing the opportunity cost from lost
   investment opportunities. In addition, they have to consider redemptions
   by individuals as well as institutional investors, the current
   performance of the stock market and interest rates, and the pattern of
   investments and redemptions that are correlated with market performance.
   We formulate the problem as a dynamic program, but this encounters the
   classic curse of dimensionality. To overcome this problem, we propose a
   provably convergent approximate dynamic programming algorithm. We also
   adapt the algorithm to an online environment, requiring no knowledge of
   the probability distributions for rates of return and interest rates. We
   use actual data for market performance and interest rates, and
   demonstrate the quality of the solution (compared to the optimal) for
   the top 10 mutual funds in each of nine fund categories. We show that
   our results closely match the optimal solution (in considerably less
   time), and outperform two static (newsvendor) models. The result is a
   simple policy that describes when money should be moved into and out of
   cash based on market performance.

AB The study of risky decision making has long used monetary gambles to
   study choice, but many everyday decisions do not involve the prospect of
   winning or losing money. Monetary gambles, as it turns out, may be
   processed and evaluated differently than gambles with nonmonetary
   outcomes. Whereas monetary gambles involve numeric amounts that can be
   straightforwardly combined with probabilities to yield at least an
   approximate "expectation" of value, nonmonetary outcomes are typically
   not numeric and do not lend themselves to easy combination with the
   associated probabilities. Compared with monetary gambles, the evaluation
   of nonmonetary prospects typically proves less sensitive to changes in
   the probability range (inside the extremes of certainty and
   impossibility), which, among other things, can yield preference
   reversals. Generalizing on earlier work that attributed similar findings
   to the role of affect in the evaluation process (Rottenstreich, Y., C.
   K. Hsee. 2001. Money, kisses, and electric shocks: An affective
   psychology of risk. Psych. Sci. 12(3) 185-190), we attribute the
   observed patterns to a fundamental difference in the evaluation of
   monetary versus nonmonetary outcomes. Potential pitfalls in the use of
   monetary gambles to study choice are highlighted, and implications and
   future directions are discussed.
