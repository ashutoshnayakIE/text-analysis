AB Subscription-based service providers (e.g., newspapers, internet
   services) often issue price-based incentives to recover from service
   failures. However, because considerable time may pass between when
   providers issue a recovery incentive and when service contracts are due
   for renewal, it is unclear whether recovery incentives can improve
   customer retention in the long run. The authors investigate this
   question by examining 6,919 contract renewal decisions of newspaper
   subscribers who received varying levels of recovery incentives after
   newspaper delivery failures. In contrast to conventional wisdom, they
   find that recovery incentives are associated with lower contract renewal
   likelihoods. They rationalize this finding using the economic theory of
   reference prices and further demonstrate that firms could mitigate the
   unintended consequence of recovery incentives by reminding subscribers
   of the original price at touch points following the recovery,
   discounting the renewal price, and prolonging the duration between the
   recovery and renewal. The authors also show that the intensity of
   promotions in the external environment at the time of administering
   recovery incentives, and that acquiring subscribers by communicating the
   value of the subscription service, can influence the long-term
   effectiveness of recovery incentives. For subscription-based service
   providers, the authors propose a decision support model to optimize
   recovery and renewal incentives and demonstrate its utility within this
   empirical context.

AB Influencer marketing is prevalent in firm strategies, yet little is
   known about the factors that drive success of online brand engagement at
   different stages of the consumer purchase funnel. The findings suggest
   that sponsored blogging affects online engagement (e.g., posting
   comments, liking a brand) differently depending on blogger
   characteristics and blog post content, which are further moderated by
   social media platform type and campaign advertising intent. When a
   sponsored post occurs on a blog, high blogger expertise is more
   effective when the advertising intent is to raise awareness versus
   increase trial. However, source expertise fails to drive engagement when
   the sponsored post occurs on Facebook. When a sponsored post occurs on
   Facebook, posts high in hedonic content are more effective when the
   advertising intent is to increase trial versus raise awareness. The
   effectiveness of campaign incentives depends on the platform type, such
   that they can increase (decrease) engagement on blogs (Facebook). The
   empirical evidence for these findings comes from real in-market customer
   response data and is supplemented with data from an experiment. Taken
   together, the findings highlight the critical interplay of platform
   type, campaign intent, source, campaign incentives, and content factors
   in driving engagement.

AB Many markets are liberalizing by opening up their economies to foreign
   competition, with the expectation that this will increase economic
   growth. While foreign competitors with superior technology and
   management practices pose serious threats to incumbent firms, they also
   provide them an opportunity to gain new marketing knowledge. How do
   incumbent firms respond to liberalization? Can incumbent firms'
   marketing-mix responses affect their performance following
   liberalization? Addressing these questions, the authors examine
   incumbent firms' marketing-mix responses to liberalization and the
   impact of these responses on performance, using the quasi-experiment of
   liberalization reforms in India. Estimation results from a panel of
   3,927 firms in the period 1989-2000 suggest that while all incumbent
   firms intensified their product and promotions in response to
   liberalization, only incumbent firms with greater domestic market
   knowledge intensified their advertising and distribution responses.
   Furthermore, incumbent firms' marketing-mix responses significantly
   affect their performance outcomes. The research's findings extend theory
   and provide practical guidelines on how incumbent firms can design
   marketing-mix responses to liberalization to improve performance.

AB Gift giving is an effective means to strengthen interpersonal

   relationships. Through a field study conducted with an international
   monobrand retailer of beauty products, a combination of propensity score
   matching with difference-in-differences estimations, and two
   experimental scenario studies, this research demonstrates that gift
   buyers spend 63% more in the year following a gift purchase than a
   matched sample of customers who purchase for their personal use.
   Specifically, gift buyers increase their purchase frequency (25%), spend
   more per shopping trip (41 %), and engage in more cross-buying (49%).
   The sales lift is particularly pronounced among new customers. Identity
   theory suggests customer gratitude and public commitment as mediating
   mechanisms. Gift purchase design characteristics (i.e., assistance
   during gift purchase and branded gift wrapping) influence the strength
   of the mediating mechanisms.

AB Many firms introduce both business-to-business service innovations
   (B2B-SIs) and business-to-consumer service innovations (B2C-SIs) and
   need to better allocate their resources. However, they are unsure about
   B2B-Sls' effects on firm value or risk, especially relative to those of
   B2C-SIs. The authors address this problem by developing hypotheses that
   relate the number of B2B-Sls and B2C-Sls to firm value and firm risk
   together with the moderators (the number of product innovations and
   customer-focus innovations). To test the hypotheses, the authors develop
   and estimate a model using unique panel data of 2,263 Sls across 15
   industries over eight years assembled from multiple data sources and
   controlling for firm- and market-specific factors, heterogeneity, and
   endogeneity. They analyze innovation announcements using natural
   language processing. The results show that B2B-SIs have a positive
   effect on firm value and an insignificant influence on firm risk.
   Importantly, the effect of a B2B-SI on firm value is significantly
   greater than that of a B2C-SI. Unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on
   firm value is greater when the firm has more product innovations.
   Surprisingly, unlike B2C-SIs, the effect of B2B-SIs on firm value is
   less positive when the SIs emphasize customers. These findings offer
   important insights about the relative value of B2B-SIs.

AB In business-to-government and business-to-business transactions,
   suppliers often have limited access to buyers during the buying process.
   The authors term these buyers "barricaded buyers." Despite the
   prevalence of barricaded buyers in practice, research has remained
   largely silent on the topic. Therefore, the authors combine insights
   from eight organizational purchasing case studies and individual
   interviews with signaling theory to advance a conceptual framework that
   highlights ways a supplier can increase its competitiveness (and,
   correspondingly, its selection likelihood) when selling to barricaded
   buyers. The framework reflects three distinct ways in which signaling
   occurs or influences the barricaded buying process: the seller signals
   to buyers (e.g., through novel solutions, explicit responding), the
   seller signals to competing sellers (e.g., through peacocking), and the
   buyer signals to sellers whose meaning is jammed (e.g., through
   supplier-specific capabilities and language). The framework invokes
   barricade restrictiveness as an important contingency variable that
   lends nuance to when the signaling activities are most likely to affect
   suppliers' competitiveness.

AB Despite the demonstrated importance of customer sentiment in social

   use of customer engagement initiatives, surprisingly few studies have
   investigated firms' ability to influence the sentiment of customers'
   digital engagement. Many firms track buyers' offline interactions,
   design online content to coincide with customers' experiences, and face
   varied performance during events, enabling the modification of
   marketer-generated content to correspond to the event outcomes. This
   study examines the role of firms' social media engagement initiatives
   surrounding customers' experiential interaction events in influencing
   the sentiment of customers' digital engagement. Results indicate that
   marketers can influence the sentiment of customers' digital engagement
   beyond their performance during customers' interactions, and for
   unfavorable event outcomes, informational marketer-generated content,
   more so than emotional content, can enhance customer sentiment. This
   study also highlights sentiment's role as a leading indicator for

AB Users of deal collectives coproduce "deals" that yield value beyond what
   a marketer intends when offering promotions. The authors develop an
   understanding of how this unintended value is coproduced through the
   combined actions of users in deal collectives. Users are drawn to deal
   collectives by a web of motivations that include subversive shopper
   feelings, which reflect a desire to outsmart firms and temporarily upend
   the market power structure. Uncovered transvaluation processes show that
   deal forums-due to their collective knowledge, creativity, and trust-are
   more effective than individual consumers at identifying, developing, and
   vetting opportunities to capture unintended value. The authors further
   reveal that unintended value can stem from untargeted promotions,
   pricing and promotion errors, and combinations or stacking of
   promotions. Strategies for monitoring deal collectives and either
   discouraging or supporting their activities are offered.

AB Companies frequently offer product recommendations to customers,
   according to various algorithms. This research explores how companies
   should frame the methods they use to derive their recommendations, in an
   attempt to maximize click-through rates. Two common framings-user-based
   and item-based-might describe the same recommendation. User-based
   framing emphasizes the similarity between customers (e.g., "People who
   like this also like horizontal ellipsis "); item-based framing instead
   emphasizes similarities between products (e.g., "Similar to this item").
   Six experiments, including two field experiments within a mobile app,
   show that framing the same recommendation as user-based (vs. item-based)
   can increase recommendation click-through rates. The findings suggest
   that user-based (vs. item-based) framing informs customers that the
   recommendation is based on not just product matching but also taste
   matching with other customers. Three theoretically derived and
   practically relevant boundary conditions related to the recommendation
   recipient, the products, and other users also offer practical guidance
   for managers regarding how to leverage recommendation framings to
   increase recommendation click-throughs.

AB Like Cinderella, many repurposed products involve a biographical
   transformation, from a tattered past identity (e.g., an old airbag) to a
   product with a valuable but different new identity (e.g., a backpack
   made from an airbag). In this article, the authors argue that marketers
   should help customers infer such product stories by highlighting the
   products' tattered past identities. Three field experiments and four
   controlled experiments show that making a product's past identity
   salient boosts demand across a variety of repurposed products. This is
   because past identity salience induces narrative thoughts about these
   products' biographies, which in turn allows customers to feel special.
   Results also suggest that this strategy of past identity salience needs
   to be particularly well-crafted for products with easily discernible
   past identities. These findings highlight a promising new facet of
   storytelling (i.e., stories that customers self-infer in response to
   minimal marketer input); create new opportunities for promoting products
   with a prior life; and deliver detailed guidance for the largely
   unexplored, growing market for upcycled and recycled products.

AB Consumers' postpurchase evaluations have received much attention due to
   the strong link between ratings and sales. However, less is known about
   how herding effects from reference groups (i.e., crowd and friends)
   unfold in online ratings. This research examines the role of divergent
   opinions, rater experience, and firm product portfolio in
   attenuating/amplifying herding influences in online rating environments.
   Applying robust econometric techniques on data from a community of board
   gamers, we find that herding effects are significant and recommend a
   more nuanced view of herding. Highlighting the role of rater experience,
   the positive influence of the crowd is weakened and friend influences
   are amplified as the rater gains experience. Furthermore, divergent
   opinions between reference groups create herding and differentiation
   depending on the reference group and the rater's experience level.
   Finally, firms can influence online opinion through their product
   portfolio in profound ways. A broad and deep product portfolio not only
   leads to favorable quality inferences but also attenuates social
   influence. Implications for online reputation management, rating system
   design, and firm product strategy are discussed.

AB Words are part of almost every marketplace interaction. Online reviews,

   other interactions create a wealth of textual data. But how can
   marketers best use such data? This article provides an overview of
   automated textual analysis and details how it can be used to generate
   marketing insights. The authors discuss how text reflects qualities of
   the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and
   impacts the audience or text recipient. Next, they discuss how text can
   be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e.,
   insights). Then, the authors overview methodologies and metrics used in
   text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally,
   they further highlight some common metrics and challenges and discuss
   how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity.
   They conclude with a discussion of potential areas for future work.
   Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the
   tribes of marketing. While most marketing problems are
   interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills
   and ideas from each of the subareas of marketing, text analysis has the
   potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and

AB Companies often feature positive consumer reviews on their websites and
   in their promotional materials in an attempt to increase sales. However,
   little is known about which particular positive reviews companies should
   leverage to optimize sales. Across four lab studies involving both
   hypothetical and real choices as well as field data from a retailer's
   website (Sephora), the authors find that consumers are more likely to
   purchase a product if it is recommended by a reviewer who has (vs. has
   not) made a prior purchase mistake. The authors define a purchase
   mistake as a self-identified suboptimal decision whereby people purchase
   a product that subsequently fails to meet a threshold level of expected
   performance. This persuasive advantage emerges because consumers
   perceive reviewers who admit a purchase mistake as having more expertise
   than even reviewers whose purchase experience has not been marred by
   mistakes. As a result, in marketers' attempts to increase the persuasive
   influence of reviews featured in their promotional materials, they may
   inadvertently decrease it by omitting the very information that would
   lead consumers to be more likely to purchase recommended products.

AB Personal relationships between salespeople and customers are essential
   for the success of business-to-business relationships, and research has
   shown that a change of the salesperson can severely harm financial
   performance. However, such interpersonal relationship disruptions may
   also have positive effects by encouraging vitalizing reexplorations of
   the relationship. Using multilevel loyalty theory and relationship life
   cycle theory, the authors offer a comprehensive conceptualization of
   potentially countervailing consequences of relationship disruptions. In
   particular, disruptions may have different effects on resale revenue
   (from previously sold products) versus new sale revenue (from newly sold
   products), contingent on both the history and expected future
   development of the relationship. Therefore, this study examines
   moderators on the firm-level relationship prior to disruption and
   salesperson relationship management afterward. Longitudinal data from
   2,040 customers of an international business-to-business firm reveal
   that a disruption can increase overall performance by more than 29%,
   depending on the firm-level relationship before disruption and the new
   salesperson's relationship management. Managers can use these findings
   proactively to evaluate and manage the risks and opportunities involved
   in relationship disruptions.

   customization, preordering), they have lower purchase intentions for
   products made with unethical processes (e.g., pollution, underpaid
   labor) than if they had no role in production (i.e., buying what is
   already in inventory). This effect reverses, however, with positive
   ethical production (e.g., recycled materials). Because consumers have
   direct responsibility for whether a product is made, feelings of
   anticipated guilt or gratification result depending on the ethicality of
   the production process. This work also proposes a novel threefold
   conceptualization of responsibility that can be used as managerial
   levers: direct responsibility, diffusion of responsibility, and broad
   responsibility. Field studies using Facebook's advertising platform
   demonstrate positioning strategies for fair-trade brands and advocacy
   groups.

AB Facing competitive and commoditization threats, many companies shift to
   solution offerings, albeit with mixed results. With a qualitative
   analysis of dyadic data (suppliers and customers), this article
   investigates an important, often overlooked reason for such mixed
   outcomes: the complex, dynamic role of governance matching. This study
   identifies a series of tensions arising from solution-specific exchange
   conditions and the matched governance mechanisms actors use to address
   them: temporary asset colocation, network closure, knowledge-based
   boundary objects, rights allocation agreements, and liaison champions.
   It also reveals the dynamic nature of governance matching. Solutions
   evolve in three phases-experimentation, integration, and evolution-in
   which single mechanisms have different functions (safeguarding and/or
   coordination), provide contingent and transient benefits, and can be
   used in combination to address complex tensions. This study also
   identifies two decision points, mutual commitment and balanced power,
   that separate the three phases; their outcomes help explain why certain
   solution efforts do not take off, others stall, and still others revert
   to mere spot exchanges. Beyond contributing to solutions literature,
   these findings provide actionable insights to marketing managers.

AB To prevail in the fierce competition of in-store experiences, some firms
   have focused on providing pleasant ambient scents. However, equivocal
   results on scent effects make generalizations and managerial guidance
   uncertain. While efforts to consolidate research findings have been
   conducted, a comprehensive quantitative integration is notably lacking.
   In this meta-analysis, the authors integrate 671 available effects from
   ambient scent experiments and show that exposure to pleasant ambient
   scents on average produces a substantial increase in the level of
   customer responses (3%-15%). The effects of ambient scent depend on
   situational contingencies and are, for example, positively related to
   congruency, unidimensional aroma structure, ascribed familiarity of a
   scent, service exchange, proportion of female participants in the
   sample, and imagined (vs. fictitious) offering. Thus, the authors
   estimate expenditures would increase by 3% and 23% for an average and a
   most favorable condition, respectively. The authors also examine effect
   patterns, identifying, for example, ambient scent as more cognitive than
   affective and nonlinear effects of perceived concentration. Using the
   insights, they develop a research agenda and provide clear strategic
   guidance to leverage ambient scent effects.

AB Consumer research often fails to have broad impact on members of the
   marketing discipline, on adjacent disciplines studying related
   phenomena, and on relevant stakeholders who stand to benefit from the
   knowledge created by rigorous research. The authors propose that impact
   is limited because consumer researchers have adhered to a set of
   implicit boundaries or defaults regarding what consumer researchers
   study, why they study it, and how they do so. The authors identify these
   boundaries and describe how they can be challenged. By detailing five
   impactful articles and identifying others, they show that
   boundary-breaking, marketing-relevant consumer research can influence
   relevant stakeholders including academics in marketing and allied
   disciplines as well as a wide range of marketplace actors (e.g.,
   business practitioners, policy makers, the media, society). Drawing on
   these articles, the authors articulate what researchers can do to break
   boundaries and enhance the impact of their research. They also indicate
   why engaging in boundary-breaking work and enhancing the breadth of
   marketing's influence is good for both individual researchers and the
   fields of consumer research and marketing.

AB Technological advances have resulted in a hyperconnected world,
   requiring a reassessment of branding research from the perspectives of
   firms, consumers, and society. Brands are shifting away from single
   ownership to shared ownership, as heightened access to information and
   people is allowing more stakeholders to cocreate brand meanings and
   experiences alongside traditional brand owners and managers. Moreover,
   hyperconnectivity has allowed existing brands to expand their geographic
   reach and societal roles, while new types of branded entities (ideas,
   people, places, and organizational brands) are further stretching the
   branding space. To help establish a new branding paradigm that accounts
   for these changes, the authors address the following questions: (1) What
   are the roles and functions of brands?, (2) How is brand value
   (co)created?, and (3) How should brands be managed? Throughout the
   article, the authors also identify future research issues that require
   scholarly attention, with the aim of aligning branding theory and
   practice with the realities of a hyperconnected world.

AB E-negotiations, or sales negotiations over email, are increasingly
   common in business-to-business (B2B) sales, but little is known about
   selling effectiveness in this medium. This research investigates
   salespeople's use of influence tactics as textual cues to manage buyers'
   attention during B2B e-negotiations to win sales contract award. Drawing
   on studies of attention as a selection heuristic, the authors advance
   the literature on mechanisms of sales influence by theorizing buyer
   attention as a key mediating variable between the use of influence
   tactics and contract award. They use a unique, longitudinal panel
   spanning more than two years of email communications between buyers and
   salespeople during B2B sales negotiations to develop a validated corpus
   of textual cues that are diagnostic of salespeople's influence tactics
   in e-negotiations. These e-communications data are augmented by
   salesperson in-depth interviews and survey, archival performance data,
   and a controlled experimental study with professional salespeople. The
   obtained results indicate that the concurrent use of compliance or
   internalization-based tactics as textual cues bolsters buyers' attention
   and is associated with greater likelihood of contract award. In
   contrast, concurrent use of compliance and internalization-based tactics
   is prone to degrade buyer attention and likely to put the salesperson at
   a disadvantage in closing the contract award.

AB Online virality has attracted the attention of academics and marketers

   sharing. This article adds to this body of research by examining the
   phenomenon of improvised marketing interventions (IMIs)-social media
   actions that are composed and executed in real time proximal to an
   external event. Using the concept of quick wit, and theorizing that the
   effect of IMIs is furthered by humor and timeliness or unanticipation,
   the authors find evidence of these effects on both virality and firm
   value across five multimethod studies, including quasiexperiments,
   experiments, and archival data analysis. These findings point to the
   potential of IMIs in social media and to the features that firms should
   proactively focus on managing in order to reap the observed online
   sharing and firm value benefits.

AB In response to pressure to defend their stand sales against discounters,
   grocery retailers started engaging in retailer-themed super saver
   events: promotional events (1) specific to the retailer, in which they
   (2) mass advertise (3) unusually deep, immediate deals (4) across a
   broad range of categories (5) under a common savings theme and deal
   format. Given these characteristics, such events are expected to
   generate higher awareness and interest than typical day-to-day
   promotions, thereby enhancing visits and purchases during the event but
   also reducing them before and after. The authors evaluate these effects
   by analyzing 44 retailer-themed super saver events operated by the
   largest Dutch grocery retailers over four years. They find a substantial
   increase in visits and total purchases during the event, especially
   among nonprimary customers and hard-discount shoppers. The larger part
   of this lift stems from the use of an overarching event theme. Consumers
   buy less in anticipation of the event and visit the store more often
   afterward, but for smaller baskets-typically leading to a null effect in
   terms of profit. Finally, our results suggest that rather than the deal
   depth or advertising budget, the number of items and media resonance of
   the theme are key drivers of event success.

AB In their initial recovery efforts after a service failure, service
   providers need to decide what to communicate to consumers to restore
   their satisfaction. Prior work has primarily examined apology (saying
   "sorry") as a symbolic recovery strategy; the current research suggests
   appreciation (saying "thank you") as an alternative, often more
   effective strategy. Drawing from research on linguistic framing and
   self-view, the authors reason that the shift of focus in the service
   provider-consumer interaction, from emphasizing service providers' fault
   and accountability (apology) to spotlighting consumers' merits and
   contributions (appreciation), can increase consumers' self-esteem and,
   in turn, postrecovery satisfaction. Across multiple service failure
   contexts, Studies 1a-1e establish the superiority of appreciation in
   redressing service failures. By measuring and manipulating self-esteem
   and examining the moderating role of narcissism and recovery timing,
   Studies 2-5 provide converging evidence for consumers' state self-esteem
   as the underlying mechanism. Studies 6 and 7 go beyond examining
   appreciation in isolation and show that it is as effective as recovery
   messages that combine appreciation and apology (Study 6) and that its
   superiority over apology holds when service providers combine symbolic
   and utilitarian recovery (Study 7).

AB Patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer should
   undergo semiannual screening tests to facilitate early detection,
   effective treatment options at lower cost, better recovery prognosis,
   and higher life expectancy. Health care institutions invest in
   direct-to-patient outreach marketing to encourage regular screening.
   They ask the following questions: (1) Does the effectiveness of outreach
   vary among patients and over time?; (2) What is the return on outreach?;
   and (3) Can patient-level targeted outreach increase the return? The
   authors use a multiperiod, randomized field experiment involving 1,800
   patients. Overall, relative to the usual-care condition, outreach alone
   (outreach with patient navigation) increases screening completion rates
   by 10-20 (13-24) percentage points. Causal forests demonstrate that
   patient-level treatment effects vary substantially across periods and by
   patients' demographics, health status, visit history, health system
   accessibility, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, thereby
   facilitating the implementation of the targeted outreach program. A
   simulation shows that the targeted outreach program improves the return
   on the randomized outreach program by 74%-96% or $1.6 million to $2
   million. Thus, outreach marketing provides a substantial positive payoff
   to the health care system.

AB Companies are increasingly held accountable for their corporate social
   irresponsibility (CSI). However, the extent to which a CSI event damages
   the firm largely depends on the coverage of this event in high-reach
   news media. Using the theory of news value developed in communications
   research, the authors explain the amount of media coverage by
   introducing a set of variables related to the event, the involved brand,
   and media outlet. The authors analyze a sample of 1,054 CSI events that
   were reported in 77 leading media outlets in five countries in the
   period 2008-2014. Estimation results reveal many drivers. For example,
   the number of media covering the story may be 39% higher for salient and
   strong brands. 80% more media report the event if a foreign brand is
   involved in a domestic CSI event. When a brand advertises heavily or
   exclusively in a news medium, this reduces the likelihood of the news
   medium to cover negative stories about the brand. The average financial
   loss at the U.S. stock market due to a CSI event amounts to US$321
   million. However, the market reacts to the event only if 4 or more U.S.
   high-reach media outlets report on the event.

AB Nonprofit organizations often rely on individuals to execute their
   mission of addressing unmet societal needs. Indeed, one of the most
   significant challenges facing such organizations is that of enlisting
   individuals to provide support through the volunteering of time or
   donation of money. To address this challenge, prior studies have
   examined how promotional messages can be leveraged to motivate
   individuals to support the missions of nonprofit organizations. Yet
   promotional messages are only one aspect of the marketing mix that may
   be employed. The present study examines how donor-based nonprofit
   organizations can employ the marketing mix-product, price, promotion,
   place, process, and people-to influence the experiences of sacrifice
   associated with donation. The authors do so through an ethnographic
   study of individuals participating in living organ donation. First, they
   identify the manifestation of sacrifice in donation. Next, they define
   three complementary and interactive types of sacrifice: psychic,
   pecuniary, and physical. Then, they articulate how the marketing mix can
   be employed to mitigate experiences of sacrifice that emerge through the
   donation process. The authors conclude by discussing implications for
   marketing practice and identifying additional research opportunities for
   sacrifice in the realm of donation.

AB Cultural products are a major component of the world economy and are
   responsible for a growing share of U.S. exports. The authors examine
   brand name strategies when cultural products are marketed in foreign
   countries. Incorporating the unique characteristics of these products,
   the authors develop a theoretical framework that integrates similarity,
   which focuses on how the translated brand name relates to the original
   brand name, and informativeness, which focuses on how the translated
   brand name reveals product content, to study the impact of brand name
   translations. The authors analyze Hollywood movies shown in China from
   2011 to 2018. The results show that higher similarity leads to higher
   Chinese box office revenue, and this effect is stronger for movies that
   perform better in the home market (i.e., the United States). When the
   translated title is more informative about the movie, the Chinese box
   office revenue increases. The informativeness effect is stronger for
   Hollywood movies with greater cultural gap in the Chinese market.
   Moreover, both similarity and informativeness effects are strongest when
   the movie is released and reduce over time. This research provides
   valuable guidance to companies, managers, and policy makers in cultural
   product industries as well as those in international marketing.

AB Firms often attribute their service employees' competent performance to
   either dedicated effort or natural talent. However, it is unclear how
   such practices affect customer evaluations of service employees and
   customer outcomes. Moreover, prior work has primarily examined
   attributions of one's own performance, providing little insight on the
   impact of attributions of others' performance. Drawing on research
   regarding the warmth-competence framework and performance attributions,
   the current research proposes and finds that consumers expect a more
   communal-oriented and less exchange-oriented relationship when a service
   employee's competent performance is attributed to dedicated effort
   rather than natural talent, as effort (vs. talent) attribution leads
   consumers to perceive the employee as warmer. The authors further
   propose customer helping behaviors as downstream consequences of
   relationship expectations, finding that effort (vs. talent) attribution
   is more likely to induce customers' word-of-mouth and idea provision
   behaviors. The findings enrich existing literature by identifying
   performance attributions as a managerially meaningful antecedent of
   relationship expectations and offer practical guidance on how marketers
   can influence consumers' relationship expectations and helping
   behaviors.

   sales and marketing-mix elasticities, accounting for supply-side
   constraints. The authors study 205 announcements in the automotive
   industry using a difference-in-differences model. They find that,
   following collective layoff announcements, layoff firms experience
   adverse changes in sales, advertising elasticity, and price elasticity.
   They explore the moderating role of announcement characteristics on
   these changes and find that collective layoff announcements by domestic
   firms and announcements that do not mention a decline in demand as a
   motive are more likely to be followed by adverse marketing-mix
   elasticity changes. On average, sales for the layoff firm in the layoff
   country are 8.7% lower following a collective layoff announcement than
   their predicted levels absent the announcement. Similarly, advertising
   elasticity is 9.8% lower and price elasticity is 19.2% higher than
   absent the announcement. Conversely, layoff firms typically decrease
   advertising spending in the country where collective layoffs have
   occurred, yet they do not change prices. These findings are relevant to
   marketing managers of firms undergoing collective layoffs and to
   analysts of collective layoff decisions.

AB Results from three large-scale field studies and two controlled
   experiments show that consumers tend to be more self-disclosing when
   generating content on their smartphone versus personal computer. This
   tendency is found in a wide range of domains including social media
   posts, online restaurant reviews, open-ended survey responses, and
   compliance with requests for personal information in web advertisements.
   The authors show that this increased willingness to self-disclose on
   one's smartphone arises from the psychological effects of two
   distinguishing properties of the device: (1) feelings of comfort that
   many associate with their smartphone and (2) a tendency to narrowly
   focus attention on the disclosure task at hand due to the relative
   difficulty of generating content on the smaller device. The enhancing
   effect of smartphones on self-disclosure yields several important
   marketing implications, including the creation of content that is
   perceived as more persuasive by outside readers. The authors explore
   implications for how these findings can be strategically leveraged by
   managers, including how they may generalize to other emerging
   technologies.

AB Marketing excellence is a foundational principle for the discipline that
   is gaining increasing attention among managers and investors. Despite
   this, the nature of marketing excellence and its effectiveness remain
   unclear. This research offers insight by addressing two questions: (1)
   How do managers understand and exercise marketing excellence? and (2)
   How do investors evaluate marketing excellence? Study 1 merges insights
   from 39 in-depth interviews with senior executives and secondary data
   from 150 firm strategies to find that marketing excellence is a strategy
   type focused on achieving organic growth by executing priorities related
   to the marketing ecosystem, end user, and marketing agility. Study 2
   quantifies the impact of marketing excellence on firm value by using a
   machine learning algorithm and text analysis through an original
   dictionary to classify the text from 8,317 letters to shareholders in
   1,727 U.S. firm annual reports. Calendar-time portfolio models reveal
   abnormal one-year returns of up to 8.58% for marketing
   excellence-returns that outpace those associated with market orientation
   and marketing capabilities. Findings offer guidance to managers,
   educators, and investors regarding how marketing excellence
   manifests-paving the way for the allocation of firm resources to ensure
   that marketing drives organic growth.

AB Although scholars have established that customer satisfaction affects
   different dimensions of firm financial performance, a managerially
   important but overlooked aspect is its effect on a firm's future cost of
   selling (COS), that is, expenditures associated with persuading
   customers and providing convenience to them. Accordingly, this study
   presents the first empirical and theoretical examination of the impact
   of customer satisfaction on future COS. The authors propose that while
   higher customer satisfaction can lower future COS, the degree to which a
   firm realizes this benefit depends on its strategy and operating
   environment. Analyzing almost two decades of data from 128 firms, the
   authors find that customer satisfaction has a statistically and
   economically significant negative effect on future COS. While the
   negative effect of customer satisfaction on future COS is weaker for
   firms with higher capital intensity and financial leverage, this effect
   is stronger for more diversified firms and for firms operating in
   industries with higher growth and labor intensity. The authors also find
   that these effects may vary across two components of COS, cost of
   persuasion and convenience.

AB Customer experience management research is increasingly concerned with
   the long-term evolution of customer experience journeys across multiple
   service cycles. A dominant smooth journey model makes customers' lives
   easier, with a cyclical pattern of predictable experiences that builds
   customer loyalty over time, also known as a loyalty loop. An alternate
   sticky journey model makes customers' lives exciting, with a cyclical
   pattern of unpredictable experiences that increases customer involvement
   over time, conceptualized here as an involvement spiral. Whereas the
   smooth journey model is ideal for instrumental services that facilitate
   jobs to be done, the sticky journey model is ideal for recreational
   services that facilitate never-ending adventures. To match the flow of
   each journey type, firms are advised to encourage purchases during the
   initial service cycles of smooth journeys, or subsequent service cycles
   of sticky journeys. In multiservice systems, firms can sustain customer
   journeys by interlinking loyalty loops and involvement spirals. The
   article concludes with new journey-centered questions for customer
   experience management research, as well as branding research, consumer
   culture theory, consumer psychology, and transformative service
   research.

AB Given the positive bias toward attractive people in society, online
   sellers are justifiably apprehensive about perceptions of their profile
   pictures. Although the existing literature emphasizes the "beauty
   premium" and the "ugliness penalty," the current studies of seller
   profile pictures on customer-to-customer e-commerce platforms find a
   U-shaped relationship between facial attractiveness and product sales
   (i.e., both beauty and ugliness premiums and, thus, a "plainness
   penalty"). By analyzing two large data sets, the authors find that both
   attractive and unattractive people sell significantly more than
   plain-looking people. Two online experiments reveal that attractive
   sellers enjoy greater source credibility due to perceived sociability
   and competence, whereas unattractive sellers are considered more
   believable on the basis of their perceived competence. While a beauty
   premium is apparent for appearance-relevant products, an ugliness
   premium is more pronounced for expertise-relevant products and for
   female consumers evaluating male sellers. These findings highlight the
   influence of facial appearance as a key vehicle for impression formation
   in online platforms and its complex effects in e-commerce and marketing.

AB This research documents how negative reviews, when perceived as unfair,
   can activate feelings of empathy toward firms that have been wronged.
   Six studies and four supplemental experiments provide converging
   evidence that this experienced empathy for the firm motivates supportive
   consumer responses such as paying higher purchase prices and reporting
   increased patronage intentions. Importantly, this research highlights
   factors that can increase or decrease empathy toward a firm. For
   instance, adopting the reviewer's perspective when evaluating an unfair
   negative review can reduce positive consumer responses to a firm,
   whereas conditions that enhance the ability to experience empathy-such
   as when reviews are highly unfair, when the identity of the employee is
   made salient, or when the firm responds in an empathetic manner-can
   result in positive consumer responses toward the firm. Overall, this
   work extends the understanding of consumers' responses to word of mouth
   in the marketplace by highlighting the role of perceived (un)fairness.
   The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the
   findings for better management of consumer reviews.

AB When advertising products to consumers, firms sometimes conceal key
   aspects in an effort to arouse consumer curiosity. This research
   investigates when and how visual concealment tactics may benefit or hurt
   aesthetic product evaluations. The authors propose that when consumers
   are only able to view a portion of an aesthetic product, assessments of
   its appeal will be influenced by two interrelated mechanisms: curiosity
   to see the item completed and inferences about the item's fully
   disclosed appearance. The authors show that heightened curiosity
   triggers feelings of positive affect that are transferred to the product
   itself, a process that may inflate preferences and choice likelihoods
   for products beyond what would occur if the full image were known. This
   transference effect, however, has an important boundary: it works only
   when initial consumer inferences about the appeal of the product are
   positive or emotionally congruent with the positive affect triggered by
   curiosity. The key implication is that, ironically, the products likely
   to benefit most from concealment tactics are those that have the least
   to hide. The authors provide evidence for these effects and the
   underlying mechanism using six experiments that manipulate concealment
   in a variety of task settings.

   perspective, an important categorization of consumption purpose. Taking
   a retailer-category viewpoint to measure the H/U characteristics of 20
   product categories at 40 different retailers, this study combines
   large-scale secondary clickstream and primary survey data to offer
   actionable insights for retailers in a competitive landscape. The data
   reveal that, when making hedonic purchases (e.g., toys), consumers
   employ social media and on-site product pages as early as two weeks
   before the final purchase. By contrast, for utilitarian purchases (e.g.,
   office supplies), consumers utilize third-party reviews up to two weeks
   before the final purchase and make relatively greater usage of search
   engines, deals, and competitors' product pages closer to the time of
   purchase. Importantly, channel usage is different for sessions in which
   no purchase is made, indicating that consumers' information channel
   choices vary significantly with the H/U characteristics of purchases.

AB This work introduces the concept of contract ambiguity from the law
   literature into the interorganizational governance literature. Within
   the context of franchising, the authors present a three-study
   multimethod design empirically establishing the construct of contract
   ambiguity of franchisor obligations, providing new insights into the
   strategic design of contracts and their outcomes. In Study 1, the
   authors establish construct validity by demonstrating that contract
   ambiguity of franchisor obligations is distinct from contract
   specificity and contract completeness of franchisor obligations, with
   differential outcomes. In Studies 2 and 3, the authors demonstrate that
   contract ambiguity of franchisor obligations increases an interest-based
   (vs. a rights-based) conflict solving approach, implying greater
   cooperation and joint problem solving, and reduces franchisee-initiated
   litigation. The findings also indicate that while contract ambiguity of
   franchisor obligations decreases franchisee-initiated litigation, this
   effect is amplified by higher levels of franchisor training programs but
   mitigated by the presence of a franchisee association. The article
   closes with a discussion of implications for academics and

AB Stakeholders have long pressured firms to provide societal benefits in
   addition to generating shareholder wealth. Such benefits have
   traditionally come in the form of corporate social responsibility.
   However, many stakeholders now expect firms to demonstrate their values
   by expressing public support for or opposition to one side of a partisan
   sociopolitical issue, a phenomenon the authors call "corporate
   sociopolitical activism" (CSA). Such activities differ from commonly
   favored corporate social responsibility and have the potential to both
   strengthen and sever stakeholder relationships, thus making their impact
   on firm value uncertain. Using signaling and screening theories, the
   authors analyze 293 CSA events initiated by 149 firms across 39
   industries, and find that, on average, CSA elicits an adverse reaction
   from investors. Investors evaluate CSA as a signal of a firm's
   allocation of resources away from profit-oriented objectives and toward
   a risky activity with uncertain outcomes. The authors further identify
   two sets of moderators: (1) CSA's deviation from key stakeholders'
   values and brand image and (2) characteristics of CSA's resource
   implementation, which affect investor and customer responses. The
   findings provide new and important implications for marketing theory and

AB Advertising and research and development (R&D) benefit firms by
   increasing sales and shareholder value. However, when a firm is in
   bankruptcy, the cumulative effects of its past advertising and R&D can
   be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they increase the firm's
   expected future cash flow, which increases the likelihood that the
   bankruptcy court will decide the firm can survive. On the other hand,
   they increase the liquidation value of the firm's assets, which
   decreases the likelihood that the bankruptcy court will decide that the
   firm can survive. The author argues that the ability of advertising and
   R&D to either increase or decrease bankruptcy survival is contingent on
   the influence that the firm's suppliers have, relative to other
   creditors, on the bankruptcy court's decision. Advertising and R&D
   increase (decrease) bankruptcy survival when suppliers have a high (low)
   level of influence. Empirical analyses, conducted on 1,504 bankruptcies,
   show that advertising (R&D) increases bankruptcy survival when at least
   35%-38% (18%-21%) of the bankrupt firm's debt has been borrowed from
   suppliers, whereas it decreases bankruptcy survival below this point.
   Out-of-sample machine learning validation shows that the ability to
   predict whether a bankrupt customer will survive is substantially
   improved by considering the firm's advertising and R&D.

AB Firms often aim to develop markets as part of their long-term
   strategies. Conventionally, research in marketing has explained this
   complex process by stressing firms' efforts to outdo their peers. While
   this emphasis is valuable, it overlooks the role of another major force
   in market evolution: collective action among peer firms. To address this
   oversight, this article conceptualizes "collaborative market driving,"
   defining it as the collective strategy in which peer firms consistently
   cooperate among themselves and with other actors to develop markets in
   ways that increase their overall competitiveness. This conceptualization
   includes the triggers that lead peer firms to mobilize for collective
   action and coalesce with other market actors; it also identifies how
   this coalition converts collective resources into market-driving power.
   These theoretical contributions, based on a multimethod analysis of the
   rise of U.S. craft breweries, offer an alternative course of action for
   firms interested in driving new markets when they lack adequate
   resources to do so individually.

AB New products can evoke anticipatory emotions such as hope and anxiety.
   On the one hand, consumers might hope that innovative offerings will
   produce goal-congruent outcomes; on the other hand, they might also be
   anxious about possible outcomes that are goal-incongruent. The authors
   demonstrate the provocative and counterintuitive finding that strong
   anxiety about potentially goal-incongruent outcomes from a new product
   actually enhances (vs. weakens) consequential adoption intentions (Study
   1) and actual adoption (Studies 2 and 3) when hope is also strong. The
   authors test action planning (a form of elaboration) and perceived
   control over outcomes as serial mediators to explain this effect. They
   find that the proposed mechanism holds even after they consider
   alternative explanations, including pain/gain inferences, confidence in
   achieving goal-congruent outcomes, global elaboration, affective
   forecasts, and motivated reasoning. Managerially, the findings suggest
   that when bringing a new product to market, new product adoption may be
   greatest when hope and anxiety are both strong. The findings also point
   to ways in which marketers might enhance hope and/or anxiety, and they
   suggest that the use of potentially anxiety-inducing tactics such as
   disclaimers in ads and on packages might not deter adoption when hope is
   also strong.

AB Firms spend substantial resources responding to customer complaints, and
   the marketing profession has a long history of supporting that
   enterprise to promote customer loyalty. The authors question whether
   this response is always warranted or whether its effectiveness instead
   depends on economic, industry, customer-firm, product/service, and
   customer segment factors that may alter the firm's incentives to compete
   on complaint management. To consider this question, they integrate
   economic and marketing theories and investigate factors that influence
   the complaint recovery-customer loyalty relationship via a sample of
   35,597 complaining customers spanning a ten-year period across economic
   sectors, industries, and firms. Overall, the authors find that the
   recovery-loyalty relationship is stronger in faster-growing economies,
   for industries with more competition, for luxury products, and for
   customers with higher satisfaction and higher expectations of
   customization. Conversely, the recovery-loyalty relationship is weaker
   when customers' expectations of product/service reliability are higher,
   for manufactured goods, and for men compared with women. The authors
   discuss implications of these results for managers, policy makers, and

AB Digital ads often display video content in which immobile products are
   presented as if they are moving spontaneously. Six studies demonstrate a
   speed-based scaling effect, such that consumers estimate the size of an
   immobile product to be smaller when it is animated to move faster in
   videos, due to the inverse size-speed association they have learned from
   the domain of animate agents (e.g., animals, humans). Supporting a
   cross-domain knowledge transfer model of learned size-speed association,
   this speed-based scaling effect is (1) reduced when consumers perceive a
   product's movement pattern as less similar to animate agents' movement
   patterns, (2) reversed when a positive size-speed association in the
   base domain of animate agents is made accessible, (3) attenuated for
   consumers who have more knowledge about the target product domain, and
   (4) mitigated when explicit product size information is highlighted.
   Furthermore, by decreasing assessed product size, fast animated movement
   speed can either positively or negatively influence willingness to pay,
   depending on consumers' size preferences.

AB Although reacquiring customers can lead to beneficial outcomes,
   reacquisition processes are often unpleasant for employees, who may be
   required to admit and address failures. Because many organizational
   environments reward success and punish failure, companies need to
   understand how to create an organizational environment that stimulates
   customer reacquisitions. This study investigates the impact of
   failure-tolerant cultures and formal reacquisition policies on
   successful customer reacquisition management. Drawing on organizational
   design theory and psychological ownership theory, the authors find that
   failure-tolerant cultures have an inverted U-shaped effect on
   reacquisition performance because moderate failure tolerance increases
   reacquisition attempts while not inducing more failures or increasing
   their severity. Formal reacquisition policies, in contrast, have a
   positive linear relationship. Notably, formal reacquisition policies do
   not conflict with failure-tolerant cultures but enhance the beneficial
   effects of failure tolerance on reacquisition performance; formal
   reacquisition policies provide guidance for reacquisition attempts that
   failure-tolerant cultures inspire. Finally, results show that customer
   reacquisition performance is positively related to overall firm
   financial performance, a finding that emphasizes the managerial and
   organizational-level importance of reacquisition management.

TI When Less Is More: How Mindset Influences Consumers' Responses to

AB Marketing communications often describe a reduction in a product's
   negative attributes (e.g., "our mineral water now uses 34% less
   plastic"). This claim may be interpreted as a trend of improving
   relative to previous state. However, such a claim may also call
   attention to a negative product feature that might have otherwise been
   overlooked. The authors suggest that whether consumers are positively or
   negatively influenced by such claims depends on whether the claims are
   interpreted through an incremental or entity mindset. When a reduction
   in negative attributes is viewed through an incremental mindset-the
   tendency to think of attributes as malleable-a trend-based
   interpretation results in improved product evaluations. In contrast, an
   entity mindset that emphasizes attributes are unlikely to change
   produces a negative effect for the claim. Four experiments and a field
   survey (N = 2,543) across food, pharmaceuticals, and plastic bottle
   products confirm the effects and indicate that the effects diminish when
   consumers believe the attribute is easy to eliminate or when the
   attribute has extremely threatening consequences. The opposite is
   observed for claims of reduced positive attributes, such that an entity
   mindset produces more positive evaluations. The findings offer marketers
   consumer insights to guide the communication of negatively framed
   attributes.

AB "Facts Up Front" nutrition labels are a front-of-package (FOP) nutrition
   labeling system that presents key nutrient information on the front of
   packaged food and beverage products in an easy-to-read format. The
   authors conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine the effect of
   adoption of FOP labeling on products' nutritional quality. The authors
   assemble a unique data set on packaged food products in the United
   States across 44 categories over 16 years. By using a
   difference-in-differences estimator, the authors find that FOP adoption
   in a product category leads to an improvement in the nutritional quality
   of other products in that category. This competitive response is
   stronger for premium brands and brands with narrower product line
   breadth as well as for categories involving unhealthy products and those
   that are more competitive in nature. The authors offer evidence
   regarding the role of nutrition information salience as the underlying
   mechanism; they also perform supplementary analyses to rule out
   potential self-selection issues and conduct a battery of robustness
   checks and falsification tests. The authors discuss the implications of
   the findings for public policy makers, consumers, manufacturers, and
   food retailers.

AB Peer-to-peer (P2P) business models have become increasingly prevalent in
   the marketplace. However, little is known about what factors influence
   consumer perceptions of purchases from firms using these models. The
   authors propose that features inherent to the P2P model lead consumers
   to perceive high provider-firm independence, where providers are viewed
   as relatively independent from the platform on which they offer
   goods/services. Across a series of studies, the authors show that when
   P2P brands use provider-focused (vs. platform-focused) marketing
   communications, consumers perceive a purchase as helping an individual
   provider to a greater extent, which increases consumers' willingness to
   pay and their likelihood of both making a purchase and downloading the
   brand's app. This is because provider-focused marketing communications
   in this context lead consumers to think about their purchase from the
   provider's perspective, thus adopting an "empathy lens." The authors
   further show that this effect does not extend to other business models.
   This work thus identifies provider- (vs. platform-) focused marketing
   communications as a way for marketing managers of P2P brands to drive
   important purchase-related outcomes.

AB Although creativity is often considered a key success factor in
   advertising, the marketing literature lacks a systematic empirical
   account of when and how advertising creativity works. The authors use a
   meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on advertising creativity and
   test different theoretical explanations for its effects. The analysis
   covers 93 data sets taken from 67 papers that provide 878 effect sizes.
   The results show robust positive effects but also highlight the
   importance of considering both originality and appropriateness when
   investing in advertising creativity. Moderation analyses show that the
   effects of advertising creativity are stronger for high- (vs. low-)
   involvement products, and that the effects on ad (but not brand)
   reactions are marginally stronger for unfamiliar brands. An empirical
   test of theoretical mechanisms shows that affect transfer, processing,
   and signaling jointly explain these effects, and that originality mainly
   leads to affect transfer, whereas appropriateness leads to signaling.
   The authors also call for further research connecting advertising
   creativity with sales and studying its effects in digital contexts.

AB Charities often include low-value monetary (e.g., coins) and nonmonetary
   (e.g., greeting cards) pregiving incentives (PGIs) in their donation
   request letters. Yet little is known about how donors respond to this
   marketing strategy. In seven studies, including two large-scale field
   experiments, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of PGIs
   depends on the organization's goals. People are more likely to open and
   read a letter containing a monetary PGI (vs. a nonmonetary PGI or no
   PGI). In addition, monetary PGIs increase response rates in donor
   acquisition campaigns. However, the return on investment for direct mail
   campaigns drops significantly when PGIs are included. Furthermore,
   average donations for appeals with a nonmonetary PGI or no PGI are
   similar, while those with a monetary PGI are actuallylowerthan when a
   nonmonetary PGI or no PGI is included. This is because monetary PGIs
   increase exchange norms while decreasing communal norms. This effect
   remains significant when accounting for alternative explanations such as
   manipulative intent and the anchoring and adjustment heuristic.

AB Persistent high failure rates of new product alliances call for
   identification of factors that might improve alliance outcomes. In this
   research, the authors identify two attributes of alliance network
   asymmetry that affect alliance performance and performance uncertainty:
   differences in the number of prealliance direct ties, which can create
   asymmetry in the volume of resources of the two firms, and differences
   in the interconnectivity among prealliance indirect ties, which leads
   the firms to possess different types of resources. The authors theorize
   that absolute levels of such asymmetries have curvilinear effects on
   alliance performance and performance uncertainty, which materialize as a
   focal firm's abnormal returns and risk, respectively. They demonstrate
   that direct tie asymmetry has an inverted U-shaped effect on the focal
   firm's abnormal returns and a U-shaped effect on its risk. Indirect tie
   asymmetry also has a U-shaped effect on the focal firm's risk. However,
   the focal firm's innovation quality and preexisting ties with its
   partner flatten these curvilinear effects. The findings have
   implications for partner selection in new product alliances.

AB For brands to thrive, they must understand consumer sentiment; if
   consumers' likelihood of sharing their opinion is a function of their
   attitude toward a brand, then brands' perception of consumer sentiment
   may be systematically biased. While research in consumer-to-consumer
   sharing (i.e., word of mouth) suggests that those with extreme attitude
   are more likely to share than those with neutral attitude (a U-shaped
   relationship), the relationship between consumers' attitude toward a
   brand and their propensity to sharewith a brandis unknown. In contrast
   to the U-shaped pattern observed in word of mouth, the authors find a
   hockey stick-shaped relationship between attitude and sharing with
   brands ("__/"). Those with positive attitude (vs. neutral attitude) are
   more likely to share their opinion, but those with negative attitude do
   not show a similar increase in sharing. The authors show that this
   pattern emerges because, among consumers with positive (vs. neutral)
   attitude toward a brand, reciprocity norms drive increased sharing, but
   among consumers with negative (vs. neutral) attitude, competing
   mechanisms drive behavior: the desire to vent increases sharing, but at
   the same time an aversion to criticize others directly deters sharing.
   The authors test these ideas using a series of studies, including a
   field study.

AB The role of culture in consumers' price search and behavior has received
   limited attention in the literature. In the present research, the
   authors examine how the cultural dimension of power distance belief
   (PDB)-the extent to which people accept and endorse hierarchy-influences
   consumers' price sensitivity. The authors propose that consumers high
   (vs. low) in PDB are less price sensitive because they have a higher
   need for closure, which motivates them to "seize and freeze" on a
   current offer and quickly arrive at the final purchase decision rather
   than search for a better price. Accordingly, the relationship between
   PDB and price sensitivity is moderated by variables that alter
   consumers' need for closure, such as social density. Six studies (and
   five more summarized in the WebAppendices) using a variety of
   operationalizations of the key variables provide robust support for the
   relationship between PDB and price sensitivity and shed light on the
   underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions. Theoretical and
   managerial implications are discussed.

AB Managers often use music as a marketing tool. For example, in
   advertising, they use music to intensify emotions; in service settings,
   they use slow music to boost relaxation and classical music to convey
   sophistication. In this article, the authors posit a novel
   effect-higher-pitched music can boost healthier choices. Recognizing
   that many perceptual characteristics of higher pitch (e.g., lighter,
   elevated) are conceptually associated with morality, they theorize that
   listening to higher- (vs. lower-) pitched music can cue morality.
   Furthermore, thoughts about morality can prompt moral self-perceptions
   and, in turn, thoughts about "good" behaviors, including healthy
   choices. Thus, listening to higher-pitched music may increase healthier
   choices. Employing field settings and online studies, the authors find
   that listening to higher-pitched music increases consumers' likelihood
   to choose healthy options (Studies 1, 3, and 5), choose lower-calorie
   foods (Study 2), and engage in health-boosting activities (Study 4).
   This effect arises because high pitch raises the salience of morality
   thoughts (Studies 4 and 5). The article concludes with a discussion of
   theoretical and managerial implications.

AB Changes in the way customers shop, accompanied by an explosion of
   customer touchpoints and fast-changing competitive and technological
   dynamics, have led to an increased emphasis on agile marketing. The
   objective of this article is to conceptualize and investigate the
   emerging concept of marketing agility. The authors synthesize the
   literature from marketing and allied disciplines and insights from
   in-depth interviews with 22 senior managers. Marketing agility is
   defined as the extent to which an entity rapidly iterates between making
   sense of the market and executing marketing decisions to adapt to the
   market. It is conceptualized as occurring across different
   organizational levels and shown to be distinct from related concepts in
   marketing and allied fields. The authors highlight the firm challenges
   in executing marketing agility, including ensuring brand consistency,
   scaling agility across the marketing ecosystem, managing data privacy
   concerns, pursuing marketing agility as a fad, and hiring marketing
   leaders. The authors identify the antecedents of marketing agility at
   the organizational, team, marketing leadership, and employee levels and
   provide a roadmap for future research. The authors caution that
   marketing agility may not be well-suited for all firms and all marketing
   activities.

AB When customers journey from a need to a purchase decision and beyond,
   they rarely do so alone. This article introduces the social customer
   journey, which extends prior perspectives on the path to purchase by
   explicitly integrating the important role that social others play
   throughout the journey. The authors highlight the importance of
   "traveling companions," who interact with the decision maker through one
   or more phases of the journey, and they argue that the social distance
   between the companion(s) and the decision maker is an important factor
   in how social influence affects that journey. They also consider
   customer journeys made by decision-making units consisting of multiple
   individuals and increasingly including artificial intelligence agents
   that can serve as surrogates for social others. The social customer
   journey concept integrates prior findings on social influences and
   customer journeys and highlights opportunities for new research within
   and across the various stages. Finally, the authors discuss several
   actionable marketing implications relevant to organizations' engagement
   in the social customer journey, including managing influencers, shaping
   social interactions, and deploying technologies.

AB Omnichannel marketing is often viewed as the panacea for one-to-one
   marketing, but this strategic path is mired with obstacles. This article
   investigates three challenges in realizing the full potential of
   omnichannel marketing: (1) data access and integration, (2) marketing
   attribution, and (3) consumer privacy protection. While these challenges
   predate omnichannel marketing, they are exacerbated in a digital
   omnichannel environment. This article argues that advances in machine
   learning and blockchain offer some promising solutions. In turn, these
   technologies present new challenges and opportunities for firms, which
   warrant further academic research. The authors identify both recent
   developments in practice and promising avenues for future research.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to
   consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with
   recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and
   convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although
   AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and
   accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual
   challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to
   bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the
   value that embedding AI technology into products and services can
   provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and
   integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of
   the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing
   so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1)
   data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This
   approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to
   address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in
   organizations' investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future
   research.

AB Marketing is the functional area primarily responsible for driving the
   organic growth of a firm. In the age of digital marketing and big data,
   marketers are inundated with increasingly rich data from an
   ever-expanding array of sources. Such data may help marketers generate
   insights about customers and competitors. One fundamental question
   remains: How can marketers wrestle massive flows of existing and nascent
   data resources into coherent, effective growth strategies? Against such
   a backdrop, the Marketing Science Institute has made "capturing
   information to fuel growth" a top research priority. The authors begin
   by discussing the streetlight effect-an overreliance on readily
   available data due to ease of measurement and application-as
   contributing to the disconnect between marketing data growth and firm
   growth. They then use the customer equity framework to structure the
   discussion of six areas where they see substantial undertapped
   opportunities: incorporating social network and biometric data in
   customer acquisition, trend and competitive interaction data in customer
   development, and unstructured and causal data in customer retention. The
   authors highlight challenges that obstruct firms from realizing such
   data-driven growth opportunities and how future research may help
   overcome those challenges.

AB Technological innovations are creating new products, services, and
   markets that satisfy enduring consumer needs. These technological
   innovations create value for consumers and firms in many ways, but they
   also disrupt psychological ownership--the feeling that a thing is
   "MINE." The authors describe two key dimensions of this
   technology-driven evolution of consumption pertaining to psychological
   ownership: (1) replacing legal ownership of private goods with legal
   access rights to goods and services owned and used by others and (2)
   replacing "solid" material goods with "liquid" experiential goods. They
   propose that these consumption changes can have three effects on
   psychological ownership: they can threaten it, cause it to transfer to
   other targets, and create new opportunities to preserve it. These
   changes and their effects are organized in a framework and examined
   across three macro trends in marketing: (1) growth of the sharing
   economy, (2) digitization of goods and services, and (3) expansion of
   personal data. This psychological ownership framework generates future
   research opportunities and actionable marketing strategies for firms
   aiming to preserve the positive consequences of psychological ownership
   and navigate cases for which it is a liability.
