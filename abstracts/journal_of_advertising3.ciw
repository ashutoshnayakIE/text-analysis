AB Interactions with and between customers in digital, social, and mobile
   environments are commonly recorded, producing behavioral data that have
   the potential to advance advertising research. This article provides an
   accessible guide on how to leverage such data for advertising
   researchers who may have thus far relied mostly on lab experiment or
   survey data. Specifically, we suggest potential sources for behavioral
   data and present a process for analyzing and interpreting behavioral
   data. Each step of the process is discussed: exploring, understanding
   and preparing data; specifying and estimating models; and interpreting
   and presenting the results. Some fundamental issues with using multiple
   regression to analyze such data are covered, including standardization,
   outliers, transformations, multicollinearity, and the omitted variable
   bias. We also discuss issues that are especially problematic with using
   behavioral data in advertising research, including endogeneity, count
   data, data with many zeros, and grouped data. More advanced versions of
   regression that address these issues are surveyed, including
   instrumental variables, propensity scoring, generalized linear models,
   and mixed models. General advice for thinking about behavioral data is
   provided.

AB The big data of user-generated content (UGC) on social media are laden
   with potential value for brand managers. However, there are many
   obstacles to using big data to answer brand-management questions. This
   article presents a framework that automatically derives latent brand
   topics and classifies brand sentiments. It applies text mining with
   latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and sentiment analysis on 1.7 million
   unique tweets for 20 brands across five industries: fast food,
   department store, footwear, electronics, and telecommunications. The
   framework is used to explore four brand-related questions on Twitter.
   There are three main findings. First, product, service, and promotions
   are the dominant topics of interest when consumers interact with brands
   on Twitter. Second, consumer sentiments toward brands vary within and
   across industries. Third, separate company-specific analyses of positive
   and negative tweets generate a more accurate understanding of Twitter
   users' major brand topics and sentiments. Our findings provide brand
   managers with actionable insights in targeted advertising, social
   customer relationship management (CRM), and brand management.

AB Though research literature addresses a broad range of advertising impact
   models, studies on the channel preferences of online purchasers have
   received little attention, regarding both multichannel settings and
   channel interplay in click sequences. To provide advertisers a method
   for better evaluating customer channel preference, this study
   investigates the path to purchase by building on four multichannel
   clickstream data sets from three industries, recorded with
   cookie-tracking technologies. Applying a Cox model and clustering
   techniques supports delineation of empirical generalizations and
   industry-specific findings on channel exposure, including their
   antecedents and distinct channel click sequences. Across data sets,
   online users show idiosyncratic channel preferences for a limited set of
   one or two channels rather than multiple online vehicles. Both channel
   homogeneous click sequences and combinations of two channels (including
   branded contacts) are effective as purchase predictors. Our study also
   presents industry-specific results regarding the influence of click
   sequences on purchase intent, thereby providing insights for advertising
   research, particularly as are suited to optimization of online
   advertising activities.

AB Trust is an important factor, particularly in viral/social advertising,
   and computing trust scores for individual users of a social network is
   crucial for several applications in the advertising research and
   practice. However, research on trust in the advertising field has been
   limited, and the application of computational trust to advertising
   research using big data is rare. Addressing the gap in the research
   literature, this study proposed and empirically tested a new social
   media analytics method, the Trust Scores in Social Media (TSM)
   algorithm, for measuring individual users' trust levels in a social
   network. TSM proposes the concept of negatively reinforced trust scores
   and introduces two complementary measures of trust, trustingness, and
   trustworthiness. Another unique and important element in the TSM
   algorithm is the incorporation of trust-decision involvement to adjust
   trust scores depending on the level of trust-decision involvement of
   different networks. Using small survey data and big data from social
   networks, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the TSM
   algorithm. Various applications of the TSM algorithm to viral/social
   advertising research and practice are also discussed.

AB We propose that consumers appropriate brand symbolism that comes from
   celebrity endorsements to construct and communicate their self-concepts.
   We also argue that consumers with high need to belong (NTB) look to
   celebrities to a greater extent than those who have lower needs to
   belong, because high-NTB consumers are more likely to look to
   celebrities for cues about which brands may aid these consumers'
   attempts to meet their affiliation needs. High-NTB consumers are also
   prone to develop one-sided (parasocial) relationships with celebrities,
   and these parasocial relationships mediate the celebrity endorsement
   effect on self-brand connections. Three studies support these proposed
   relationships. Furthermore, the third study also manipulates the degree
   to which the celebrity's image matches that of the brand being
   advertised, revealing that a symbolic match between the celebrity image
   and brand image is important for consumers who do not form parasocial
   relationships with celebrities (i.e., low-NTB consumers).

AB Prior meta-analyses have found evidence for differences in the
   third-person effect across message types, indicating that the
   third-person effect is a communication context-specific phenomenon.
   These meta-analyses do not explain why effects of the perceptual
   hypothesis in advertising are smaller when compared to communication in
   general; they do not address the broad range of consumer behavior
   variables that are affected by third-person perceptions; and they have
   not investigated whether the perceived effects on the self or on others
   are better predictors for behavioral responses than third-person
   perceptions in advertising. This meta-analysis addresses these issues
   and investigates the perceptual and behavioral hypotheses of the
   third-person effect in an advertising context. Findings indicate that
   third-person perceptions in product advertising are weaker when compared
   to other communication messages due to developments over time and the
   mixed gratifications provided by product advertising messages.
   Third-person perceptions in advertising can increase or decrease
   consumer behavior depending on whether the behavior is self related
   (e.g., body-related responses) or other related (e.g., support for
   regulation). Furthermore, perceived effects on self or on others are
   better behavioral predictors than third-person perceptions, providing
   managerial implications for advertising campaign pretesting.

   almost eight decades of findings from more than 100,000 participants.
   Variables analyzed include the degree to which the public believes
   billboards are informative, entertaining, irritating, and helpful to the
   economy; in need of more regulation; and beneficial overall. Results
   suggest that, both historically and currently, consumers view billboards
   positively, and a strong majority do not support billboard bans.
   Moreover, the overall results are more supportive of the notion that the
   public subscribes to the Advertising = Information school of thought as

   mind-set (i.e., competition versus collaboration) on narrowcasting and
   broadcasting intentions and actual behaviors. The results show that a
   collaborative mind-set promotes narrowcasting, whereas a competitive
   mind-set encourages broadcasting. Further, self-affirmation moderates
   the relationship between consumer mind-set and broadcasting. Our
   findings provide important insights into investment prioritization and

AB This study postulates that people's beliefs about their own
   susceptibility to persuasion efforts can influence advertising effects.
   It thus represents the first explication of the process by which
   self-beliefs determine advertising effects, through their influence on
   the subjective experience of the ease of being persuaded. Integrating
   three research streams (metacognition, persuasion knowledge, and
   cognitive correction), the current study proposes a model of three
   influence patterns, which are contingent on whether people perceive the
   advertising message to be high in manipulative intent and whether people
   are motivated to be accurate in their judgments. If advertising messages
   are low in manipulative intent, such that the persuasion seems
   acceptable, susceptibility self-beliefs influence people's attitudes
   toward the advertised products or issues (i.e., expected effects). If
   advertising messages are high in manipulative intent, such that
   persuasion seems unacceptable, people exhibit suppression (no effects)
   if they have weak accuracy motives, but they exhibit overcorrection
   (opposite effects) if they are strongly motivated to be accurate. Five
   studies test these predictions and reveal some demographic
   characteristics associated with self-beliefs about susceptibility to
   persuasion. The findings thus have important implications for
   advertising practitioners.

AB Mixed-race representations have become increasingly evident in marketing
   communications through the use of celebrity spokespersons like Misty
   Copeland and Halle Berry. This study explores the sociocultural
   ramifications of the ways in which marketers represent multiracial
   identity. Through an interdisciplinary review of pertinent literature,
   the authors create a theoretical framework for understanding the
   limitations of visual representations. A temporal model for discerning
   visual representations of the multiracial identity emerged by combining
   critical discourse analysis (CDA) techniques to investigate multiracial
   advertising depictions in eight popular U.S. magazines with interviews
   of multiracial women and advertising professionals. Findings suggest
   that marketers use mixed-race representations as cultural currency by
   mythologizing mixed-race bodies as the new beauty standard and as
   representing a racial bridge, physically and culturally tailored to
   ameliorate perceived racial divides. While visual representations in
   marketing communication have served to legitimatize and normalize
   mixed-race identity, these images generally ignore mundane consumption
   practices, obscure the relationships and processes that bring about
   multiracial bodies, and are devoid of sociopolitical context. The
   authors offer a framework through which scholars can systematically
   analyze the sociocultural significance of a wide range of identity
   coordinates utilized in advertisements and other forms of marketing
   communication.

AB Sponsorship congruence refers to the extent to which associations held
   for a property are perceived as sharing content and meaning with those
   held for a brand. Congruence has been shown to enhance the benefits
   derived from sponsorship. Consequently, it is important for an
   incongruent sponsor to articulate how it is related to a property.
   Analogical articulation represents a creative way of resolving
   perceptions of incongruity. A contribution of the current research is
   that it is the first to distinguish sponsorship effects on the basis of
   articulation type. Across four studies in which analogical articulations
   of incongruent sponsorships are compared to unarticulated and
   nonanalogical articulations (for both congruent and incongruent
   sponsorships), we find that analogical articulations improve perceptions
   of an incongruent sponsor's fit with a property and also perceptions of
   the sponsorship alignment's creativity. Analogical articulations also
   elicited a more pronounced "aha" moment of insight, which was found to
   mediate the effect of analogical articulation on perceptions of fit and
   creativity. Finally, analogical articulations yielded greater recall of
   the sponsorship.

   uphold their hypothesis that cultural differences determine whether

   1 demonstrates that Americans are less receptive to an assertive
   recycling message using imperatives such as should, must, and ought and
   more receptive to a nonassertive message using could, might, and worth.
   South Koreans do not show the reactance response. Study 2, an
   energy-saving campaign, conceptually replicates the findings and further
   shows that perceived threat to freedom mediates the effects. Study 3
   uses a realistic setting (i.e., online magazine) to further support the
   hypothesis that cultural differences affect attitudes toward assertive

   outperformed panel data procured from two separate professional
   marketing research companies across various measures of data quality.
   The MTurk data were also compared to two different student samples, and
   results show the data were at least comparable in quality. While
   researchers may consider MTurk samples as a viable alternative to
   student samples when testing theory-driven outcomes, precautions should
   be taken to ensure the quality of data regardless of the source. Best
   practices for ensuring data quality are offered for advertising
   researchers who utilize MTurk for data collection.

   application of SEM in 1983 through 2015, and discuss important
   methodological issues related to the following aspects: confirmatory
   factor analysis (CFA), causal modeling, multiple group analysis,
   reporting, and guidelines for interpretation of results. Moreover, we
   summarize some issues related to varying terminology associated with
   different SEM methods. Findings indicate that the use of SEM in the JA
   contributes greatly to conceptual, empirical, and methodological
   advances in advertising research. The assessment contributes to the
   literature by offering advertising researchers a summary guide to best
   practices and a reminder of the basics that distinguish the powerful and

AB Advertising research is a scientific discipline that studies artifacts
   (e.g., various forms of marketing communication) as well as natural
   phenomena (e.g., consumer behavior). Empirical advertising research
   therefore requires methods that can model design constructs as well as
   behavioral constructs, which typically require different measurement
   models. This article presents variance-based structural equation
   modeling (SEM) as a family of techniques that can handle different types
   of measurement models: composites, common factors, and causal-formative
   measurement. It explains the differences between these types of
   measurement models and clears up possible ambiguity regarding formative
   endogenous constructs. The article proposes confirmatory composite
   analysis to assess the nomological validity of composites, confirmatory
   factor analysis (CFA) and the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of
   correlations (HTMT) to assess the construct validity of common factors,
   and the multiple indicator, multiple causes (MIMIC) model to assess the
   external validity of causal-formative measurement.

   examined to identify the structure of scientific knowledge, the extent
   of social exchange and the scientific status of the field. Bibliometric
   analysis is used to identify who is citing our research and who we
   cited. Cocitation patterns for the leading advertising journals (Journal
   of Advertising [JA], Journal of Advertising Research [JAR],
   International Journal of Advertising [IJA], Journal of Interactive
   Advertising [JIA], and Journal of Current Issues and Research in
   Advertising [JCIRA]) and the top 50 citing and cited journals with
   citation relationships from 2005 to 2014 were examined. Findings
   revealed that advertising is citing advertising scholarship the most,
   followed by marketing, consumer research, psychology, and communication.
   This suggests a maturing field where scholars look within the
   discipline's body of knowledge. In turn, advertising research is cited
   by advertising, marketing, business (general), communication, and
   psychology. The overall citing-to-cited ratio suggests that advertising
   is more a receiver than provider of knowledge to other disciplines;
   however, there is variation across the advertising journals. The
   positioning of advertising journals in the larger disciplinary framework
   shows close relationships to consumer research and interactive
   communication. The most common focus among the top-cited articles is
   digital media, with few articles focusing on traditional advertising.
   The implications of our findings for the field of advertising are

   into media content, actively engaging children with the commercial
   content, and increasing the number of commercial messages children are

   children cope with embedded advertising. This conceptual article aims to
   develop a theoretically grounded framework for investigating how
   children process embedded advertising. More precisely, it sheds light on
   previous research and conceptualizations of advertising literacy and
   provides suggestions for future research. The article examines
   conceptual and methodological issues and discusses the need for research
   on how to improve children's coping with embedded advertising by
   emphasizing the value of persuasive intent priming and implementation
   intentions. To conclude, future research directions are discussed
   regarding strategies to strengthen children's coping skills and their

   and affective beliefs related to advertising) and situational (i.e.,
   actual recognition of and critical reflection on advertising)

AB The application of neurophysiological methods to study the effects of
   advertising on consumer purchase behavior has seen an enormous growth in
   recent years. However, little is known about the role social settings
   have on shaping the human brain during the processing of advertising
   stimuli. To address this issue, we first review previous key findings of
   neuroscience research on advertising effectiveness. Next, we discuss
   traditional advertising research into the effects social context has on
   the way consumers experience advertising messages and explain why
   marketers, who aim to predict advertising effectiveness, should place
   participants in social settings, in addition to the traditional ways of
   studying consumer brain responses to advertising in social isolation.
   This article contributes to the literature by offering advertising
   researchers a series of research agendas on the key indicators of
   advertising effectiveness (attention, emotion, memory, and preference).
   It aims to improve understanding of the impact social context has on
   consumers' neurophysiological responses to advertising messages.

AB Advertisers are increasingly monitoring people's online behavior and
   using the information collected to show people individually targeted
   advertisements. This phenomenon is called online behavioral advertising
   (OBA). Although advertisers can benefit from OBA, the practice also
   raises concerns about privacy. Therefore, OBA has received much
   attention from advertisers, consumers, policymakers, and scholars.
   Despite this attention, there is neither a strong definition of OBA nor
   a clear accumulation of empirical findings. This article defines OBA and
   provides an overview of the empirical findings by developing a framework
   that identifies and integrates all factors that can explain consumer
   responses toward OBA. The framework suggests that the outcomes of OBA
   are dependent on advertiser-controlled factors (e.g., the level of
   personalization) and consumer-controlled factors (e.g., knowledge and
   perceptions about OBA and individual characteristics). The article also
   overviews the theoretical positioning of OBA by placing the theories
   that are used to explain consumers' responses to OBA in our framework.
   Finally, we develop a research agenda and discuss implications for
   policymakers and advertisers.

AB Pre-roll advertising is a novel form of online video advertising that
   provides consumers with an option to skip after viewing a brief forced
   segment. Pre-roll ads are unique from other forms of online advertising
   because pre-roll ads play in exactly the space in which consumers are
   expecting to view their intended content. Such interruption and
   obstruction not only heightens consumer irritation but also causes
   attention-getting tactics, which are redundant in a highly attentive
   state, to backfire. For these reasons, existing ad avoidance literature
   may not adequately address this unique format. Employing a large
   industry data set of pre-roll ads representing multiple countries and
   product categories, we empirically examine skipping behavior using a
   broader range of ad characteristics than previous research. We propose
   that less complex affective ad characteristics increase skipping by
   failing to engage cognitive resources and therefore leaving cognitive
   resources available to experience irritation. We further posit that, in
   a pre-roll context, attention-getting ad characteristics are not only
   superfluous but actually increase the likelihood consumers recognize
   pre-roll content as advertising and skip. Our empirical findings support
   these assertions, identifying new factors driving ad avoidance, and
   calling into question the applicability of attention-getting advertising
   approaches in the novel pre-roll environment.

   participants primed with shame express higher conservation intention
   after they view a loss-framed ad. Study 2 replicates and supports the
   proposed matching hypothesis using nonstudent adults. In Study 3,
   participants react to a recycling ad as they did in Studies 1 and 2 when
   they expend high effort by transcribing the recycle pledge before they
   view the ad, but not when they expend low effort by reading the pledge
   first. The findings overall provide converging evidence for the

AB The use of multiple screens, also known as multiscreening, is assumed to
   have detrimental consequences for advertising outcomes. However, many
   people are engaging in this form of media multitasking on a daily basis.
   Therefore, it is important to focus on how to improve the effectiveness
   of advertisements when multiscreening. The aim of this study is to
   examine a key facilitator of advertising effects when multiscreening,
   namely task relevance. In two separate experiments-an online study (n =
   280) and a laboratory (n = 185) study-we showed that people who engage
   in related multiscreening have better brand memory and more positive
   brand attitudes than people who engage in unrelated multiscreening via
   attention and subsequent program involvement. The results of the current
   study contribute to our understanding of multiscreening and advertising
   effects by showing that multiscreening does not always have to be
   detrimental to advertising effects. Furthermore, this study is unique
   because it combines two methodological approaches of multiscreening
   research.

   provincial norms (versus general norms) are more effective in
   encouraging consumers to participate in a sustainability campaign when
   paired with low-construal-level messages; but provincial norms are no
   longer superior to general norms when both norms are presented with
   high-construal-level messages. The findings collectively indicated that
   the congruence between types of descriptive norms and construal level
   messages leads to consumers' attitudinal and behavioral changes.

   narrative transportation is negatively moderated by advertising
   disclosure that elicits persuasion knowledge. Finally, the negative

   can be reversed by introducing sniffing cues in the ad. Thus, the use of
   a multimethod approach, combining behavioral and neuroscience
   experiments, provides insight into the effectiveness of advertising
   strategies in consideration of individual differences in consumer
   olfactory sensitivity. This article provides support for advertisers to
   consider incorporating sniffing cues (to trigger positive
   scent-associated emotions) in the construction of scent-relevant ads to
   enhance positive ratings of ads.

AB Drawing from the affect-reason-involvement model, we examine how
   misleading advertising about the environmental features of products, or
   greenwashing, affects how consumers perceive ads and brands. Using data
   from two experimental studies with quota-based samples in the United
   States (N = 486) and Germany (N = 300), we compare nondeceptive claims
   with two types of claims often used in greenwashing: vague claims and
   false claims. We also identify the presence of pleasant nature-evoking
   images and test for interaction effects with two types of environmental
   involvement: environmental concern and environmental knowledge. Results
   indicate that while vague claims do not enhance consumers' perceived
   greenwashing regardless of their environmental knowledge or concern,
   false claims do, which consequently harms consumers' attitudes toward
   those ads and brands. In the United States, consumers' environmental
   knowledge moderates that effect, whereas all consumers in Germany could
   identify false claims as attempts at greenwashing. Moreover, associating
   greenwashing claims with nature-evoking images activates an affective
   persuasive mechanism that appeals to consumers' affinity for nature,
   which not only positively influences their evaluations of ads and brands
   but also influences their attitudes toward ads and brands more strongly
   than perceived greenwashing. In closing, we discuss the theoretical and
   practical implications of these findings.

AB As the United States faces low savings rates and an aging population,
   examining messages that encourage saving behavior is critical. Adding to
   this need is growth in ethnic minority groups (e.g., Hispanic Americans)
   that tend to experience greater saving challenges. The current study
   tested framing effects (i.e., loss/gain), in tandem with message
   orientation (i.e., self/family) and the moderating role of collectivism,
   on ad response variables after exposure to public service advertisements
   about saving. Results across three experiments confirm that matching the
   level of collectivism with orientation impacted the effect of framing on
   the outcome measures but that individual differences in collectivism
   impacted the results more than membership in an ethnic group. Loss
   framing for both low and high collectivistic individuals, when matched
   with a self-oriented appeal in the former and a family-oriented appeal
   in the latter, were most effective. Gain framing was more effective when
   level of individual collectivism was not matched with self/family
   message orientation. Important theoretical issues are addressed as well
   as implications for advertisers who engage in saving behavior messaging.

AB This research examined how implicit attitudes are associated with
   cognitive processing and self-reported evaluation of advertisements
   featuring same-sex couples. Hypotheses were posited using the
   theoretical framework of social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner 1986)
   and perspectives on implicit attitudes. In Study 1, participants watched
   and evaluated 10 television advertisements while physiological measures
   of cognitive and affective processing were collected. Ads varied such
   that half used same-sex couples as protagonists while the other half
   used other-sex couples. Participants demonstrated less positive
   responses to ads featuring same-sex couples. Physiological and
   self-reported responses were associated with implicit attitudes toward
   homosexuality Negative implicit attitudes toward homosexuality were
   associated with more negative affect, less attention, less positivity,
   and less liking for ads featuring same-sex couples. Two subsequent
   studies replicated these findings in nonstudent samples, indicating that
   participants preferred ads with other-sex couples (Study 2) and that
   implicit attitudes were associated with this response (Study 3). This
   research suggests that implicit attitudes affect processing and
   evaluation of ads featuring same-sex couples in ways unaccounted for by
   explicitly measured attitudes. Results are discussed in terms of
   advancing theory, furthering understanding of the dynamic processing of
   ads featuring in-group and out-group members, and practical
   implications.

AB We examine the impact of consumers' competitive tendencies on responses
   to comparative advertising appeals and the underlying role of
   schadenfreude: pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others.
   Consistent with our theory that the depiction of others' misfortunes is
   compatible with more-competitive consumers' concerns for distinguishing
   themselves via competition, our studies show that comparative ads are
   associated with greater schadenfreude, as well as more favorable
   attitudes and a greater willingness to pay (WTP), among more- (versus
   less-) competitive consumers. Further results indicate that such
   relatively more favorable responses among consumers with greater
   competitive tendencies are limited to comparative ads depicting
   misfortunes involving brands whose choice is more deserving of failure
   (i.e., lower-quality brands). Importantly, even less-competitive
   consumers are revealed to respond favorably to comparative ads and to
   experience more schadenfreude when they are assured that they will not
   suffer the depicted misfortune.

AB Advertisers need to optimize their efforts on social networks to engage
   consumers effectively. Existing literature on this topic has not yet
   explained how social network advertising (SNA) can be categorized into
   different content types and how to conceptualize and operationalize
   digital consumer engagement (DCE) in social networks. Thus, we derive
   seven content categories for social network advertising and a four-level
   model for DCE based on consumers' intermediate mind-set responses. We
   propose the impact of different SNA categories as an antecedent of DCE.
   Our results confirm a significant but unequal impact of at least four
   content categories on various engagement metrics. We therefore distill
   the successful content strategies and content attributes for specific
   types of engagement and confirm intermediate responses to advertising in
   a real market situation.

   affects a company's business performance from a digital engagement
   perspective, this study examines how user comments on company Facebook
   posts influence company revenue. S&P 500 companies' revenue information
   in a five-year time span (from 2010 to 2015) is collected, and this
   information is matched to more than 24 million user comments directed at
   these companies' Facebook posts. The hypotheses are tested using static
   (fixed effects [FE] and random effects [RE]) as well as dynamic
   (generalized method of moments [GMM]) panel data analyses in econometric
   methods. The estimation results indicate that digital engagement volume,
   defined as the total number of Facebook comments a company received, has
   a significant and positive effect on revenue. In addition, digital
   engagement valence, defined as the average tone of Facebook comments
   directed toward a company, also has a significant and positive effect on
   revenue. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

   Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat and their experiences with and
   evaluations of advertising on these platforms. Our findings show that
   engagement is highly context specific; it comprises various types of
   experiences on each social media platform such that each is experienced
   in a unique way. Moreover, on each platform, a different set of

AB This research investigates whether donors' beliefs in changeability
   influence the persuasiveness of charity ads for less and more
   controllable health conditions. Across three studies and using different
   health conditions, we show that fixed-mindset consumers' beliefs about
   immutability lead them to donate more to less (vs. more) controllable
   causes. The results show that this effect is driven by their tendency to
   blame people with more controllable health conditions. Conversely,
   controllability does not influence consumers with growth mindsets, who
   believe in the changeability of health conditions. Moreover, we examine
   benefit framing as a potential persuasive factor encouraging donations
   of consumers with growth mindsets. Specifically, we find that in less
   controllable cases, consumers with growth mindsets are more persuaded to
   donate by other-benefit appeals (focusing on how donating enhances
   others' lives and makes others feel better); in more controllable
   conditions, they are more persuaded by self-benefit appeals (focusing on
   how donating enhances their own lives and makes them feel better). The
   perceived efficacy of donation drives this effect. Meanwhile, consumers
   with fixed mindsets are more willing to donate to less (vs. more)
   controllable causes regardless of benefit frames used in the charity ad.
   This research offers managerial implications for advertisers and
   marketers.

AB To date, the use of taboos in advertising has produced mixed results.
   Such discrepancies require explanation. Relying on construal-level
   theory and the concept of psychological distance, this research focuses
   on taboo ads' effects on consumers' responses. The findings from three
   studies show that for different product categories (Study 1: perfume;
   Studies 2 and 3: alcohol) and across different taboo types (sex,
   violence, and a mixture of sex and violence), different distance
   dimensions (Study 1: spatial; Study 2: social), and different
   construal-level manipulations (low, high), an increase in the
   psychological distance (or construal) level attenuates consumers'
   unfavorable attitudinal and behavioral reactions while a decrease in the
   psychological distance (or construal) level intensifies consumers'
   responses. Furthermore, response intensity varies depending on the taboo
   type used, such that both violent and mixed taboo types produce more
   negative responses. Finally, gender has an impact, such that women react
   more negatively than men to different taboos, both across distance
   dimensions and across distance (construal) levels. A discussion of these
   findings and their implications, as well as suggestions for future
   research, concludes the article.

   moderators to the relationship between entitativity and viewing
   intentions within two sponsorship contexts, namely, sponsors investing
   financial versus nonfinancial resources in properties. We use factorial
   survey designs and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the model
   across two studies. The results are consistent. Entitativity is
   positively related to the likelihood of viewing a sponsored property,
   and viewing intention is positively related to purchase intention. The
   entitativity-viewing intention relationship is moderated by sponsor
   sincerity in the context of sponsors investing products/services but not
   sponsors investing financial resources. Findings are discussed, and

AB In advertising agencies, insight is frequently sought to solve
   advertising problems. However, the ideation process of the account
   planner is not well understood. Viewing account planning through a lens
   of absorptive capacity suggests that planning is about identifying and
   assimilating external information about consumers for use in the
   creative process. Account planners thus need to search deliberately for
   insight and work hard to express it to the creatives, who then exploit
   it to develop powerful creative ideas. The study adopts an in-depth
   grounded theory investigation of the insight phenomenon among 20
   Sydney-based account planners. The findings reveal that identifying and
   applying insight is a highly creative process. The account planner uses
   research, personal knowledge domains, challenging conventions, borrowed
   sources, and central narrative extension to search for insights.
   However, because not all insights are equal, this study also uncovered
   what account planners consider quality insight. These include attributes
   of originality, relatability, usability, and vision. These findings
   provide guidelines for marketers and account planners who seek insight
   in framing an advertising message.

   multiple media formats. First, cocreation workshops with 24 children
   (ages eight to 11 years old) were held to determine a selection of
   disclosure designs based on insights from the target group. Second, two
   eye-tracking studies among 32 children (ages six to 12 years old) were
   conducted to test which of these disclosure designs attracted the most
   attention when the disclosures were integrated into a media context.
   These studies led to the selection of the final advertising disclosure:
   a black rectangular graphic with the word Reclame! (i.e., Dutch for
   "Advertising!) in yellow letters. Finally, a two-by-two,
   between-subjects experimental study (disclosure design: existing versus
   child-inspired advertising disclosure; advertising format: brand
   placement versus online banner advertising) with 157 children (ages 10
   and 11 years old) was performed to test the effectiveness of the

   not only showed that children recognized, understood, and liked the
   child-inspired disclosure better than the existing ones, but they were
   also better able to recognize advertising after exposure to this

AB Despite the highly touted potential for synergies in cross-media
   advertising, much has yet to be discovered about how the effects of
   multiple media combine to shape sales response. Two challenges related
   to the investigation of media interaction effects are their complex
   nature and their specification in a sales response model. The authors
   adopt a flexible modeling approach, multivariate adaptive regression
   splines (MARS), which captures parsimoniously complex interaction
   effects and facilitates their measurement and interpretation. Analysis
   of multiple data sets on brand sales and media spending points to the
   following typology of media interaction effects: (1) synergistic
   (positive interactions), (2) antagonistic (negative interactions), and
   (3) asymmetric, where each medium does not contribute equally to the
   interaction. The findings show that 44% of media spend produces
   synergistic effects, whereas 21% produces antagonistic effects. Hence
   synergy is not the de facto outcome of cross-media advertising.
   Interestingly, low-budget media play a key role in producing interaction
   effects.

AB Sponsored vlogs (video blogs that embed advertising) are increasingly
   targeting young adolescents and challenging their abilities to
   critically process advertising. This study examined the impact of an
   advertising disclosure on young adolescents' advertising literacy (i.e.,
   advertising recognition and affective advertising literacy) for
   sponsored vlogs. In addition, the underlying mechanisms, including
   advertising literacy and influencer effects (i.e., influencer
   trustworthiness and parasocial interaction [PSI]), that can explain the
   influence on advertising effects (i.e., purchase intention) were
   examined. Finally, the moderating impact of a peer-based advertising
   literacy intervention was investigated through an informational vlog
   about advertising. The results of a 2x2 between-subjects experimental
   study (advertising disclosure: no disclosure versus disclosure;
   peer-based advertising literacy intervention: regular versus
   informational vlog) with 160 young adolescents (ages 11 to 14) showed
   that an advertising disclosure increased young adolescents' recognition
   of advertising and their affective advertising literacy for sponsored
   vlogs, and that only affective advertising literacy negatively affected
   influencer effects (influencer trustworthiness and PSI) and subsequently
   purchase intention. Regarding the moderating role of this peer-based
   advertising literacy intervention, this study showed that an advertising
   disclosure can also have positive effects on the influencer and
   subsequently on advertising effects when young adolescents are informed
   about advertising through an informational vlog.

AB The Children's Advertising Review Unit's recent press releases involving
   child influencer unboxing videos expressed concern that they did not
   appropriately disclose sponsorship. Placement of pre-roll advertising
   was also cited as contributing to the blurring between content and
   advertising. This study investigated parents' understanding of and
   responses to sponsored child influencer unboxing videos. We conducted a
   2x3 online experiment among 418 parents that examined the influence of
   sponsorship text disclosure (present or absent) and sponsor pre-roll
   (sponsor pre-roll, nonsponsor pre-roll, and no pre-roll) on conceptual
   persuasion knowledge, perceptions of sponsorship transparency, and
   several outcome measures. We also tested the potential moderating
   variable of parental mediation. We found that sponsor pre-roll
   advertising positively impacted parents' perceptions of sponsorship
   transparency, which in turn mediated attitudinal and perceptual
   outcomes. In addition, high levels of parental mediation conditionally
   impacted the indirect effect of a sponsor pre-roll advertisement via
   sponsorship transparency on perceptions of the unboxing video and
   attitudes toward the sponsor. Based on the findings, we discuss
   theoretical, managerial, and public policy implications.

AB Advertising literacy education can be developed based on three literacy
   components: content, grammar, and structure literacy. Content literacy
   refers to an understanding of the content of ads (e.g., themes and
   ideas), grammar literacy concerns an understanding of the grammar of ads
   (e.g., visual techniques) used for persuasion, and structure literacy
   refers to an understanding of the social and economic structure of the
   media industry that affects production of ads (e.g., ownership and
   revenue models). This study tested the immediate and delayed effects of
   different literacy education components in an ad literacy program on
   children's advertising knowledge and criticism, and the moderating role
   of age in these effects. To do so, we conducted an experiment based on a
   3 literacy component (content literacy, content+grammar literacy, and
   content+grammar+structure literacy) x 2 age (third versus fifth graders)
   x 2 time (immediate test versus one-year delayed test) design. Results
   showed that adding the structure literacy component resulted in greater
   knowledge for fifth graders (ages 10 and 11) but not for third graders
   (ages eight and nine). In addition, adding the structure literacy
   component resulted in lower criticism. Theoretical and practical
   implications are discussed.

AB This study examines the effectiveness of media literacy education (MLE)
   in fostering critical attitudes toward advertising in both traditional
   and newer, more embedded forms (e.g., product placement or in social
   media), as well as toward gender stereotypes and violence in
   advertising. It uses pre- and post-MLE comparisons following a
   four-hour, four-week in-school program conducted with a sample of 117
   participating students (average age =10.53) at a location in the United
   States, exploring whether advertising literacy outcomes differ by
   gender. Results suggest stronger dislike of ads and a stronger critique
   of the lack of realism in ads upon completion of the MLE program among
   participants as a whole. Stronger unfavorable attitudes toward
   stereotypical portrayals of boys and girls in advertising as well as
   toward violence in advertising were found only among girls. No support
   was registered for increased scrutiny of the practice of hidden or
   embedded advertising. Implications of MLE for the ways in which children
   can be encouraged to approach advertising from a critical point of view
   are discussed.

AB Despite research on the influence of homophone priming on consumer
   judgments and behaviors in adults (e.g., the homophone bye primes
   purchase; target: buy), there is no research to date on the
   effectiveness of homophone priming on children's judgments and
   behaviors. We examine the priming effect of homophonous devices in
   advertising on children's (aged six to 13) judgments and behaviors
   (i.e., the use of the word meet in advertising primes children's desire
   to eat chicken; target: meat). Across three studies we provide evidence
   that homophonous priming effects decrease with age, whereby younger and
   less skilled child readers focus on the phonology of words, which
   results in homophone priming. We show that older and more skilled child
   readers are better able to process the orthography (spelling) of a word
   and the meaning of the prime, resulting in homophone priming
   suppression. We illustrate that facilitating, or prompting, spelling
   verification in younger children results in their ability to
   disambiguate the word's meaning and, subsequently, suppress the
   irrelevant homophone. This research has implications for advertisers in
   terms of the execution of their advertisements to influence young
   children's judgments and behaviors.

AB Entertainment narratives targeting youth frequently include favorable
   portrayals of risky behaviors, such as drinking alcohol. Countermessages
   (e.g., epilogues and public service announcements) may correct the
   influence of positive media portrayals and reduce the likelihood of
   exposed youth to engage in such risky behaviors. A common assumption of
   this approach is that countermessages reverse or remove the positive
   influence of the favorable depiction in the entertainment narrative. In
   contrast, this research finds that a countermessage can create an
   ambivalent belief structure (i.e., the coexistence of positive and
   negative beliefs). Study 1 shows that a countermessage delivered by a
   character from the narrative as an epilogue creates ambivalence relative
   to a condition in which no epilogue is presented, and the creation of
   ambivalence is linked to greater likelihood to engage in risky
   behaviors. Study 2 demonstrates that a standard public service
   announcement reduces ambivalence and risky attitudes and intentions
   relative to the counterepilogue condition.

AB The children's magazine Jack and Jill is commonly perceived to have been
   adless from its first issue in 1938 until 1963. Through historical
   analysis, this research examines the editorial and publication forces
   that guided Jack and Jill's approach amid other contemporaneous
   children's magazines that did contain advertising. While the findings
   recognize that the magazine's editors actively protected readers from
   commercial pressure, an examination of early issues of Jack and Jill
   identify that the magazine included previously unacknowledged adlike
   content throughout World War II that may have influenced young readers.
   The content, part of the U.S. Treasury's War Bonds and Stamps Drive, an
   agency-avowed advertising initiative, began with Jack and Jill's
   involvement in the magazine industry's United We Stand campaign in July
   1942 and was inserted intermittently through March 1945. The findings of
   this study demonstrate the value of historical research in understanding
   commercial influences on children and identify how definitions of
   advertising have evolved to accommodate nontraditional practices as
   media has advanced. This research also suggests that such nontraditional
   practices have existed and effectively engaged child audiences for more
   than half a century, despite not being formally recognized as
   advertising by the broader media and the general public.

AB Media multitasking (MMT) is now a common way to engage with media.
   Flexibility in devices and content allow people to actively manage their
   attention but also to become distracted from their original goals.
   Advertising messages are commonly delivered within this environment, yet
   much advertising research still studies advertising under full
   attention. Research on MMT (also called multiscreening, dual-screen,
   cross-screen, divided attention, and social TV) can provide some
   guidelines on what to consider and expect for messages exposed during
   multitasking. However, there are also several areas of caution and many
   unknowns. We discuss theories used to study multitasking effects,
   theories that might provide some new directions, and the importance of
   identifying elements related to the audience, tasks, medium, and ad.
   Advertising effects that were established under direct attention should
   be revisited within a multitasking context, and we highlight areas that
   could be particularly affected by multiple media use. Overall,
   (in)attention as context for message effects will help us to better
   understand and predict how advertising is perceived in the new normal
   way of engaging with media.

AB Research on gender roles in advertising revolves around three main
   topics: the assessment and occurrence of gender roles, the advertising
   effectiveness of gender roles, and the social effects of gender roles on
   consumers and society. The current knowledge of each topic reveals
   several gaps. To fill these gaps and increase the general knowledge
   regarding gender roles, future research should address several points.
   The first point includes the improvement of assessing gender roles in
   advertising. Here, researchers should use a broader concept of gender,
   explore new ways to characterize and operationalize gender roles,
   develop a meaningful standard of comparison to decide about
   stereotyping, and explore differences in gender roles across media and
   advertising formats. Regarding advertising effects, researchers should
   investigate moderators to determine how negative effects of advertising
   with gender roles can be avoided. As for social effects on consumers and
   society, researchers should investigate the relationship between social
   and brand-related effects of gender roles. Finally, future research
   should develop an overarching framework for stereotype-prone portrayals
   in advertising and discuss the responsibility of advertisers who use
   stereotype portrayals.

   literature of visuospatial attention and grounded cognition, we show
   that products with their images facing toward the left (versus right) in
   advertising are evaluated more favorably when consumers' temporal focus
   is on the past, whereas the reverse holds true when consumers focus on
   the future. Furthermore, we establish that the impact of facing
   direction on product evaluations exists regardless of the horizontal
   position of product images. In addition, we demonstrate that for
   products higher on desirability features, a mismatch (versus match)
   between facing direction and consumers' temporal focus leads to higher

AB This research examines how heterosexual consumers react to advertising
   featuring same-sex couples. Across three studies, we find that
   heterosexual consumers report higher levels of disgust in response to
   advertising featuring same-sex couples in comparison to mixed-sex
   couples, which results in more negative attitudes toward the
   advertisement and the advertised brand. We also find that moral-identity
   priming reduces disgust elicited by advertising featuring same-sex
   couples and improves attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand.
   However, we find that moral-identity priming is ineffective for
   consumers with high social dominance orientation. For these consumers,
   portraying same-sex couples as possessing Protestant work ethic traits
   decreases disgust and improves attitudes toward the advertisement and
   the brand.

AB Consumers across the globe increasingly engage with user-generated
   content about brands on social networking sites (i.e., brand-related
   user-generated content [Br-UGC]). As online consumer behavior does not
   occur in a cultural void, the present study extends earlier research by
   explicitly examining how the collectivism-individualism dimension, both
   at the national and at the personal level, influences consumers'
   engagement (liking, commenting on, and sharing) with different types of
   Br-UGC created by different sources. Results based on a diverse sample
   of participants from South Korea, Thailand, the Netherlands, and the
   United States (N=812) suggest that collectivism-individualism at the
   national level moderates the effects of content characteristics and
   social relationships on Br-UGC engagement. Moreover, consumers who hold
   the same values as others in their national culture are more comfortable
   sharing informative Br-UGC.

AB Emotions play a central role in advertising. Starting from the extensive
   and ever-developing literature on the role of emotions in human
   information processing and behavior, as studied within general
   psychology, we discuss how advertising literature has tackled this topic
   throughout the years. This review reveals that the potential of direct
   behavioral effects of discrete integral emotions, meaning specific
   emotions evoked by an advertising message, has remained underexploited.
   After specifying this research gap, we outline the theoretical rationale
   behind this behavioral approach and sketch challenges and opportunities
   to address the potential of discrete emotions and their
   advertising-relevant behavioral outcomes. We thereby take advantage of
   the nature of digital media environments and recent methodological
   advances in this context. We provide guidelines to apply this rationale
   in advertising research, discuss its strength in comparison with current
   practice and its potential to extend to incidental emotions, and
   consider the ethical implications of our proposal.

AB In light of increasing awareness of environmental issues, advertisers
   around the world have developed numerous campaigns to communicate
   environmentally friendly attributes. The aim of this article is to
   review the existing literature to identify research gaps and future
   directions. It is suggested that content analytical research should be
   expanded to audiovisual media and comparative research designs. Greater
   analytical precision is needed for the detection of greenwashing in
   advertising messages. Effects research is called to use more complex and
   especially audiovisual stimuli, employ behavioral measures, and examine
   long-term effects of environmental messages. To push the boundaries of
   environmental advertising research, this article suggests a novel
   organizing framework. Based on this framework, it is suggested to focus
   more on explaining advertising exposure as well as attention allocation.
   Also, the consideration of implicit attitudes as independent, dependent,
   and moderating variables marks a particularly pressing and promising
   avenue for future research.

AB In donation contexts, many advertising appeals focus on the benefits
   that those in need will receive as the result of donations. Yet little
   is known about the effect that benefit information has on willingness to
   give. In this research, we differentiate between two types of benefits
   typically emphasized in appeals: emotional (which focus on the positive
   emotions beneficiaries experience as the result of donations) and
   functional (which focus on the basic needs met as the result of
   donations). We conduct three experiments and find that appeals focusing
   on emotional benefits increase willingness to donate relative to appeals
   that focus on functional benefits. We also provide evidence that
   visualization of benefits mediates the effect of benefit type on
   willingness to donate and introduce relevant moderators. In addition to
   contributing to theoretical understanding of donation behavior, this
   research also provides managers with practical tools to encourage
   donations.

AB Many advertisements use unrealistic images of products (e.g., hand
   drawings, digital illustrations, rotoscoped animation) instead of actual
   product images. However, while unrealistic product images are widely
   used in advertisements, little is known about their possible impact on
   product evaluation. We propose that because products in unrealistic
   images look unconsumable or unusable, unrealistic product images (1)
   suppress consumers' mental simulation of consuming or using those
   products and (2) increase uncertainty in the judgment of these products'
   characteristics. As a result, unrealistic images attenuate the judgment
   of a product's characteristics (both benefits and drawbacks). That is,
   the same characteristics are judged less intensely when a product is
   presented as an unrealistic image instead of a realistic image. Through
   seven studies, we demonstrate this effect for food items (e.g., bread,
   cupcakes, hamburgers, and chips) and durable goods (e.g., automobiles),
   finding support for the underlying processes. We further demonstrate
   that the impact of unrealistic images is not restricted to product
   evaluation but also extends to actual consumption.

AB Ad blocker proliferation threatens the revenue streams of many websites
   and raises fears about the viability of digital advertising as a whole.
   Although industry initiatives have increasingly aimed to mitigate ad
   blocking, surprisingly little research addresses the problem. It remains
   largely unknown which factors drive ad blocking or help unblocking or
   "whitelisting" of select websites. This article presents an exploratory
   survey study of 1,634 ad blocker users and uncovers the main factors
   driving ad blocking and conditions for unblocking select websites. The
   conditions suggest changes to online advertising in line with current
   industry initiatives, as well as opportunities for direct appeals to ad
   blocker users. A field experiment with 294,331 users tests whether
   banner appeals can reduce ad blocking. The results show that these
   appeals reduce ad blocking among 1% of the ad blocker users, and among
   frequent visitors who encounter repeated banner appeals, this percentage
   increases to 2%. However, repeated banners also lead to fewer website
   visits of users not conforming to the appeal, which suggests a trade-off
   between reducing ad blocking among some users and further increasing
   avoidance behaviors among others.

AB Using another media screen while watching television has become a part
   of people's daily routines. The topic of multiscreening has thus
   received increased attention from advertising scholars in recent years.
   To gain a better theoretical understanding of the circumstances under
   which multiscreening effects occur and to offer practical guidelines to
   advertisers, the current study synthesizes the results of past studies
   on multiscreening and advertising and examines the direct effects of
   multiscreening on both cognitive and affective advertising outcomes, the
   possible moderators of those effects, and the underlying mechanisms of
   multiscreening with regard to advertising outcomes. The results indicate
   a negative direct effect of multiscreening on cognitive outcomes. The
   effect is weakened, however, by factors related to research,
   advertising, and media. In addition, the results show no direct or total
   effect of multiscreening on affective advertising outcomes, but this
   again depends on various media-, advertising-, and research-related
   factors. Finally, the results show that attention, enjoyment, and
   resistance constitute the underlying mechanisms that explain the effect
   of multiscreening on memory and persuasion.

AB Rising support for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
   community, paired with the considerable buying power of this group, has
   triggered increasing interest from marketers in the gay and lesbian
   market. Many companies have developed advertising with homosexual
   imagery to better target this group as well as the mainstream market.
   The findings on the persuasive effects of homosexual imagery are mixed
   and do not provide insights on whether and when homosexual imagery in
   advertising supports persuasion. To resolve the inconsistencies in
   findings of prior research, this article presents a meta-analysis on the
   effects of homosexual imagery. The integrated effect size suggests that
   the net persuasive effect between homosexual and heterosexual imagery
   does not differ. We find, however, that homosexual consumers show
   negative responses to heterosexual imagery. Furthermore, the moderator
   analysis suggests that incongruence between imagery, consumer
   characteristics, cultural values, explicitness of imagery, endorser
   gender, and product type results in unfavorable responses to homosexual
   advertising imagery. These findings provide guidelines for future
   research and implications for advertisers who intend to address
   consumers of various sexual orientations.

AB Advertising is central to creating brand meaning by endowing brands with
   symbolic values and embedding them within their broader sociocultural
   context. This study analyzes how the symbolic meaning of luxury brands
   is constructed in print advertisements. In particular, the study shows
   how brand communications of luxury brands systematically differ from
   those of premium and mass-market brands. Through a comparative analysis
   of thematic and formal characteristics of 208 print advertising
   campaigns consisting of about 1,700 individual ads from the primary
   advertising campaigns of four luxury brands, four premium brands, and
   four mass-market brands, this study identifies three distinguishing
   factors of luxury brand communication: enrichment, distancing, and
   abstraction. First, luxury brand advertising enriches the communication
   content by using more complex campaign templates that make more frequent
   use of symbolism, rhetorical structures, and storytelling. Second,
   luxury brand advertising systematically uses distancing techniques, such
   as temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical distancing. Third, luxury
   brand ads use higher-level discourses that allow for different
   interpretations of brand advertisements. Therefore, this study provides
   insights into the construction of brand identity in the luxury field, as
   well as the broader sociocultural construction of luxury and the
   evolution of its core symbolic constituencies.

AB In this article, we expand the concept of programmatic advertising to
   include programmatic creative as a vital component. While artificial
   intelligence (AI) has already automated the media buying process, the
   advertising creative process still requires extensive human efforts.
   Such discrepancy calls for AI to transform the advertising creative
   process. We provide a framework for understanding and investigating
   programmatic creative by drawing evidence from the advertising industry
   in China. We specifically discuss how big data and machine learning
   algorithms underpin programmatic advertising. We argue that AI will
   integrate programmatic buying and programmatic creative in the future.
   We also discuss the technological, regulatory, and legal challenges
   faced by programmatic creative. We argue that new theories and methods
   are needed to conduct research in this area and provide guidance for the
   advertising industry.

AB Artificial intelligence in programmatic advertising constitutes fertile
   grounds for marketing communication with tremendous opportunities. Yet,
   despite its touted benefits, contemporary implementations of
   programmatic advertising do not harness self-generative technologies so
   much so that different consumers are exposed to identical content.
   Consequently, we advance a smart generation system of personalized
   advertising copy (SGS-PAC) that can automatically personalize
   advertising content to align with the needs of individual consumers.
   Analytical results from a user experiment involving about 80 subjects
   underscore that personalized advertising copies generated by SGS-PAC can
   bolster click rate in online advertising platforms. Findings from this
   study bear significant implications for the application of artificial
   intelligence in online advertising.

AB Retailing and media platforms recommend two types of items to their
   users: sponsored items that generate ad revenue and nonsponsored ones
   that do not. The platform selects sponsored items to maximize ad
   revenue, often through programmatic auctions, and nonsponsored items to
   maximize user utility with a recommender system (RS). We develop a
   binary integer programming model to allocate sponsored recommendations
   considering dual objectives of maximizing ad revenue and user utility.
   We propose an algorithm to solve it in a computationally efficient way.
   Our method is a form of postfiltering to a traditional RS, making it
   widely applicable in two-sided markets. We apply the algorithm to data
   from an online grocery retailer and show that user utility for the
   recommended items can be improved while reducing ad revenue by a small
   amount. This multiobjective approach unifies programmatic advertising
   and RS and opens a new frontier for advertising and RS research. We
   provide an extended discussion of future research topics.

AB Knowing that the demand for advertising in a growing e-commerce market
   cannot be sufficiently addressed in a traditional advertising operation
   model, advertisers and e-commerce platforms apply artificial
   intelligence (AI) technologies in advertising to improve efficiency and
   meet the market demand. From observations in the Chinese advertising
   market over the past five years, the authors gain insight into how AI
   technologies are applied in the advertising process and propose that the
   advertising process powered by AI technologies is composed of four
   steps: consumer insight discovery, ad creation, media planning and
   buying, and ad impact evaluation. This new advertising process, which is
   supported by a data-based platform with algorithms at its core, is tool
   based, synchronized, and highly efficient. AI has reorganized and
   upgraded the traditional advertising process and improved advertising
   efficiency; however, the new process is still born out of the
   traditional process and is not yet a reengineered one.

AB This article contributes to research on advertising effectiveness by
   investigating the combined influence of ad headlines and visual patterns
   in the ad on consumer product evaluations. Headlines can convey motion
   (e.g., "move," "quick"); when the associated ad features a regular
   visual pattern, it evokes stronger product evaluations than if it
   depicts an irregular visual pattern. Thus, the way the advertised
   products are aligned visually represents critical decisions for ad
   designers. As Study 1 reveals, if the regular visual pattern of an
   advertisement combines with verbal information conveying motion,
   stronger product evaluations result compared with the use of an
   irregular visual pattern. Study 2 extends these findings by
   demonstrating that a regular pattern creates mental simulation, such
   that consumers imagine themselves experiencing the product, which
   mediates the relationship between visual patterns and product
   evaluations. Study 3 uses text mining and image annotation analyses to
   provide ecological validity for the findings, corroborating them in the
   context of brand messages on Twitter.

AB This study examines how guanxi (relationships, connections) between
   advertising agencies and their clients impact their creative performance
   and implementation by integrating both Chinese guanxi and Western
   relationship quality constructs into a conceptual framework. Using a
   multimethod approach, Study 1 and Study 2 used surveys to examine the
   influence of the three guanxi aspects-ganqing (emotional bonding,
   affection), renqing (exchange of favors), and xinren (interpersonal
   trust)-on agency performance from both agencies' and clients'
   perspectives. Study 3 used dyadic interviews to gather qualitative
   insights on advertising client-agency relationships in China. Results
   show similar patterns in the relationships between the three guanxi
   dimensions and agency performance in both agency and client data sets.
   Specifically, ganqing was found to associate positively with cooperation
   in both data sets. The impact of renqing on cooperation was significant
   in the agency data but not in the client data. On the other hand, xinren
   was found to contribute positively to cooperation in the client data but
   not in the agency data. In both data sets, cooperation was positively
   related to satisfaction, which leads to agency creativity and the
   implementation of advertising campaigns in China. The results of this
   study are important for further understanding the Chinese advertising
   market and providing insights on how guanxi influences agency
   performance across Asian countries.

AB Language plays an important role in consumers? perceptions and behavior.
   East Asian languages, such as Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, are unique
   in that they can be written horizontally and vertically. In this
   research, we take China as a case example and explore the downstream
   consequences of writing direction on Chinese consumers? time-related
   perceptions and brand/product evaluations. Using three studies, we find
   that a description presenting context from the past is perceived as
   having a longer past temporal distance when written in a vertical
   (versus horizontal) orientation. In advertising, writing direction can
   serve as an effective cue to invoke Chinese consumers? specific
   time-related perceptions of brands/products. A brand/product is
   perceived to be more traditional and antique (versus modern and
   contemporary) when its description is written vertically (versus
   horizontally). In addition, we demonstrate that an advertisement
   presented in a vertical (horizontal) direction results in enhanced
   persuasiveness and more favorable brand/product attitudes when matched
   with a traditional (modern) brand/product. Our findings enrich theories
   and implications of language studies in different cultures and elucidate
   the effects of writing direction in Asian advertising.

AB In light of a growing consumer and media outcry against using
   unrealistically thin models in advertisements, global brands are
   featuring more inclusive model images in their campaigns, including
   using average-sized models. However, do consumers from different
   cultures have varying preferences for model size? To investigate the
   impact of using an average-sized model (versus a thin model) in apparel
   ads, we first conducted experiments in both an individualistic culture
   (i.e., United States) and a collectivistic culture in Asia (i.e.,
   Singapore). Our findings demonstrate that U.S. women expressed increased
   purchase intentions upon seeing an average-sized model (versus a thin
   model). Their perceived user-imagery congruity (UIC) also mediates the
   link between model size and purchase intentions. However, Singaporean
   women did not differ in their responses upon seeing the ad with an
   average-sized model (versus a thin model). A further investigation among
   Singaporean women reveals that their societal view of thinness moderates
   the impact of model size on purchase intentions, with UIC as the
   underlying mechanism. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
   implications for cross-cultural advertising and advance the literature
   on Asian advertising.

AB The Japanese retail market has a high degree of competition among many
   small stores that use promotional (high-low) pricing strategies. Because
   store advertisement flyers are effective tools for such retailers, they
   play a very important role in Japan. However, despite the large impact
   made by flyers of competitive retail chains in various trade areas, the
   effects of advertising flyers has not been investigated in Japan, nor
   has this advertising strategy been investigated in Western countries. In
   this study, we obtained store traffic information using global
   positioning system (GPS) data from shoppers? smartphones, with flyer
   information from 80 retail chain stores located in different trading
   areas. We found that while own-store flyers had a positive effect on
   that store?s performance, competitors? flyers had negative effects on
   performance; indeed, these negative effects were of a magnitude that
   should not be ignored. Store-specific factors and trading area
   demographics also affect the effectiveness of store flyers. Furthermore,
   we found that high-low shoppers are more sensitive to competitors?
   flyers than are customers who purchase at everyday low prices (EDLP).
   The results can help EDLP chains stop the practice of designating a loss
   leader brand.

AB Domestic violence is an ongoing health issue affecting women around the
   world. Bystander intervention is one way to help minimize occurrences of
   domestic violence in the future. However, bystanders tend to be
   apathetic toward the victims they happen to encounter or observe. In the
   current study, we explored the effectiveness of negative emotions (i.e.,
   guilt and shame) on attitude toward the ad and reporting intention of
   bystanders in India. Drawing from fluency in processing theory and
   conceptualizing guilt and shame from an Eastern perspective, we found
   that ads featuring emotional appeals strengthened reporting intention
   more than control ads did. We also found that self-construal affected
   the process. Multiple regressions revealed that shame was more effective
   for individuals with an interdependent self-view and that individuals
   with an independent self-view were indifferent to the presence or
   absence of negative emotions in ads. Theoretical and managerial
   implications are discussed.

AB Previous research has documented a positive effect of nonconformity on
   the inference of higher status in Western cultures. In Western culture,
   nonconformity is associated with high status, which is attributed to
   competence and autonomy. The present research extends research on
   nonconformity and status perception to the East Asian context by
   investigating how cultural tightness-the degree to which social norms
   are strict and deviance from norms is intolerable-at the personal level
   and national level jointly affects the evaluation of advertisements
   featuring nonconformity in two East Asian nations: Japan and China.
   Based on recent studies showing perceived level of tightness being
   higher in Japan than in China, we posit that consumers' evaluations of
   nonconformity in advertisements may differ between Japan and China,
   despite the two countries sometimes being grouped into a homogenous
   "East Asian" culture. Through four studies, we showed that Chinese
   consumers with low personal tightness had favorable attitudes toward ads
   portraying nonconformity and perceived products in these ads as having
   high status, whereas Chinese consumers with high personal tightness
   showed favorable attitudes toward ads portraying conformity. In
   contrast, Japanese consumers showed relatively harsher judgments for
   nonconforming behavior than Chinese consumers.

AB Femvertising messages are advertisements aimed at empowering women
   through pro-female messages, and they are celebrated by the industry.
   But recent critical research has found femvertisements that use
   postfeminist discourses, which both incorporate and repudiate feminist
   ideals, neutralizing feminism's political force. Using qualitative (N =
   26) and quantitative content analyses (N = 106), this study analyzed
   postfeminist articulations in award-winning femvertisements. Results
   showcase six commonly utilized discourses and elements of postfeminism:
   commodity feminism, individualization, self-surveillance, a new lens on
   the embrace of femininity, confidence cult(ure), and love your body. Two
   studies show how and how often disempowering discourses appear in female
   empowerment advertising.

AB The use of cause-related marketing (CRM), which occurs when company
   donations are tied to consumer transactions, has increased significantly
   in recent years. Traditionally, marketers seeking to advertise
   charitable support have used guilt appeals. More recently, however,
   positive appeals such as pride have emerged as viable alternatives. This
   research explores the effectiveness of guilt and pride appeals in CRM
   advertising through an application of regulatory focus theory. Across
   three studies, it is demonstrated that pride appeals are effective for
   individuals with promotion regulatory orientations. These findings are
   replicated and explained through the mediating variable of
   self-efficacy. In addition, the effectiveness of guilt appeals does not
   differ based on regulatory orientation. This work offers novel findings
   on the understudied emotion of pride, as well as a more robust
   understanding of guilt appeals in CRM advertising.

AB Health appeals to promote wellness and healthful choices can be framed
   individually or socially (benefit to self/others). Across three studies,
   the authors identify the influence of self-construal and cultural
   identity on health appeals and find that Hispanic consumers display
   identity-incongruent attitudes toward healthy eating appeals.
   Specifically, the authors show that Hispanics exhibit more positive
   responses to self-framed versus social-framed healthy eating appeals.
   Cultural perceptions of healthy eating are highlighted as the underlying
   mechanism and message framing as moderator of these effects. The
   findings of this research integrate message framing, cultural identity
   and self-construal theory as part of the conceptual model to explain the
   process behind these contradictory yet novel effects.

AB Three studies were conducted using nonstudent samples to empirically
   test the impact of paternal engagement and paternal sentiment (PS) on
   customer evaluations of advertising content. Paternal investment theory
   (PIT), an extension of attachment theory, states that the quality of
   fathering that a daughter receives provides important information about
   others and society. Paternal sentiment, the global perception of one's
   father, is defined and introduced to the advertising literature in this
   project. Both constructs are examined for males and females within a
   marketing context for the first time. An experiment is conducted in
   Study 1 to establish that low paternal investment (PI) and negative
   paternal sentiment lead to high customer evaluations for ads with
   maternal referents. Results from a second experiment suggest that
   customers with low paternal investment are more responsive to ads with
   maternal referents, particularly when combined with self-focus
   messaging. In Study 3, subjects participate in a field study. The
   findings suggest that when negative paternal sentiment and low paternal
   investment are primed, females are more prone to emotionally regulate
   than males. These research outcomes should inspire advertisers to
   consider the father-child relationship within the family structure as a
   possible basis for brand positioning.

AB Conveying the environmental friendliness of a product is both crucial

   using brand names as a way to signal environmental friendliness. Linking
   research in sound symbolism and metaphor cognition, the current research
   suggests that silent consonants in brand names (e.g., Etopal), compared
   to voiced consonants (e.g., Edopal), are more effective in conveying
   environmental friendliness. A series of four studies conducted online
   and in the field show that brands with silent consonants are perceived
   as more environmentally friendly than voiced brand names because silent
   consonants in brand names convey human characteristics that are
   metaphorically associated with environmental friendliness (e.g.,
   good-heartedness, humility). Marketing implications for green product
   branding and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Research and market evidence indicate that positioning a brand as an
   underdog can be an effective marketing strategy. Interestingly, if
   successful, this strategy could result in brands outgrowing their
   underdog status. In such situations, the current research finds it is
   critical for underdogs to be perceived as authentic to maintain
   long-term consumer support. The importance of authenticity is revealed
   by depth interviews with underdog supporters and three experiments. The
   experiments reveal that a successful underdog brand is perceived as more
   authentic and maintains stronger consumer support if the founders do not
   sell out to a larger company (Experiments 1, 2, and 3). This effect is
   robust across "vote-for" and "vote-against" underdogs, and continued
   founder involvement with the company after selling out has limited
   effectiveness for maintaining perceptions of authenticity and consumer
   support (Experiment 2). When an underdog does sell out to a larger
   company, a communion-focused motivation can mitigate negative effects on
   consumer support (Experiment 3). Consumer perceptions of the brand's
   authenticity mediate the relationship between the decision to sell out
   and consumer support. Our findings have implications for managing brands
   that have been positioned as underdogs but outgrow their disadvantaged
   standing.

AB Despite frequent reports that they favor products with environmental
   benefits, consumers often purchase conventional alternatives. One reason
   for this is the performance liability associated with green products, in
   which consumers perceive them as being less effective. This research
   examines the concept of "green understatement" (i.e., communication of
   implicit green signals) compared with "green emphasis" (i.e.,
   communication of explicit green signals) in green product advertising as
   a strategy to enhance performance evaluations. We test whether, why, and
   when an implicit (versus explicit) advertising strategy leads to higher
   performance evaluation for green products. We suggest and show that
   implicit green signals are more effective in conditions under which
   consumers have more concerns about the product's performance or have
   lower expectations about its greenness. More specifically, the results
   of two experimental studies show that implicit (versus explicit)
   communication about greenness leads to higher performance evaluations
   for products that are less commonly green (Study 1) and for products
   that have an optional green mode (Study 2). The findings aid in the
   understanding of how a green product advertising strategy may influence
   performance evaluations and provide managerial implications for green
   product promotion.

AB A significant number of ads showcase products with their shadows cast in
   the background. Given that shadows are characteristically dark and that
   previous research documents a positive link between darkness and
   heaviness, the current work proposes and documents that consumers
   evaluate a product to be heavier when it is advertised with (versus
   without) its shadow. Particularly, when heaviness is a desired product
   attribute, consumers exhibit a greater preference for the product
   advertised with (versus without) its shadow due to enhanced product
   heaviness perceptions. However, when heaviness is an undesirable product
   attribute, presence (versus absence) of the product shadow in an ad
   lowers consumers' product preference. Also, the authors show that when
   heaviness is a desirable product attribute, the positive effect of
   shadow on consumer product preference attenuates when explicit
   associations of product heaviness are provided using verbal cues.
   Findings from the current research provide actionable guidelines for
   managers to help them use product shadows effectively in advertising for
   an intended impact on consumer product preferences.

AB Customer acquisition and retention are central components of customer

   profit. However, our understanding of the relative impact of
   user-generated content (UGC) and traditional media and their synergies
   on customer acquisition and retention is still underdeveloped. Thus, the
   purpose of this research is to address two key questions: What is the
   effect of UGC relative to that of traditional media on customer
   acquisition and retention? Is there any interaction effect between UGC
   and traditional media on both customer acquisition and retention? To
   understand the differential impacts of these media, we develop a
   conceptual framework and propose several hypotheses. We test our
   hypotheses using data from the automobile and mobile game industries.
   Our findings indicate that UGC is much more effective in acquiring
   customers, while traditional media is more important for customer
   retention. Moreover, the volume of UGC and traditional media have a
   synergistic effect on customer retention. This research therefore
   contributes to the acquisition-retention literature while also providing
   important insights to managers.

AB We suggest that thematic ad-medium congruency versus incongruency evokes
   distinct effects on consumer evaluations through different underlying
   mechanisms. Specifically, we propose congruency largely has positive
   effects on consumer evaluations due to a relatively automatic fluency
   process, whereas incongruency evokes a more conscious and negative
   persuasion knowledge (PK) process that leads to negative evaluations.
   Study 1 showed that consumers were more attentive to incongruence than
   congruence, particularly when the ad-medium combination was presented
   with other ads or materials. Studies 2A and 2B confirmed that congruency
   led to positive evaluations through perceived fluency, whereas
   incongruency led to negative-PK thoughts involving manipulative intent
   and more negative evaluations. Studies 3A and 3B provided causal
   evidence for the role of PK by showing that positive PK attenuated the
   negative effects the incongruency tactic had otherwise. Overall, these
   findings suggest the common practice of directly comparing congruent and
   incongruent media tactics confounds two very different processes.
   Managerial implications for advertising and media marketing are

AB Social experience (i.e., social inclusion versus exclusion) is an
   important factor that influences consumer behaviors but has not been
   adequately examined in advertising research. To fill this gap, we
   conducted three experiments to investigate how consumers' social
   experiences affect their responses to promotion-focused versus
   prevention-focused advertisements. Our findings indicated that consumers
   who experienced being included or being ignored responded more favorably
   to promotion-focused advertisements than prevention-focused
   advertisements. However, these effects were due to different underlying
   mechanisms. Consumers who experienced being rejected were indifferent to
   advertisements' regulatory focus, but they preferred promotion-focused
   advertisements once they received a self-esteem boost. These findings
   are believed to provide meaningful contributions to both advertising

   measures. Advertisers are required to trust that self-regulation efforts

   propose an approach for tracking key display impression metrics by
   embedding a light JavaScript code in the ad to collect the necessary
   information to help detect fraudulent activities. We explain these
   metrics using the campaign cost per thousand (CPT) and the number of
   impressions per publisher. We test the approach through six display ad
   campaigns. Our results provide a counterargument against the industry
   claim that it is effectively filtering out display fraud and show the
   utility of our approach for advertisers.

   when consumers see an ad featuring an object moving in a left-to-right,
   rather than a right-to-left, direction, their trust toward the featured
   brand increases. This effect is mediated by an enhanced sense of
   "feeling right" resulting from the fit between how Western consumers are
   accustomed to envisioning action and information unfolding (from left to
   right), and the direction of implied motion in the ad. The authors
   identify stereotypical gender associations of the brand as a

AB The amount of literature on the effects of disclosing sponsored content
   has increased greatly in recent years. Although the literature provides
   valuable insights into the effects of disclosing sponsored content,
   several research gaps remain, such as inconclusive findings, boundary
   conditions, and the mechanisms that explain how disclosures work. This
   article offers a meta-analysis of 61 papers that use 57 distinct data
   sets to address these research gaps. The results showed that disclosing
   sponsored content reduced brand attitudes, credibility, and source
   evaluation but increased recognition, persuasion knowledge, and
   resistance. Disclosure content, timing, and awareness, as well as
   product and sample characteristics, provide boundary conditions for the
   positive and negative effects of disclosures. A path model that tested
   the mechanism of disclosing sponsored content showed that, as suggested
   by memory priming effect, recognition of sponsored content increased
   memory but did not influence evaluation. Moreover, the understanding of
   sponsored content influenced evaluation, but memory remained unaffected,
   which corresponds to the flexible correction approach (i.e., consumers
   try to correct their answer to limit persuasive effects).

AB Many people experience financial constraints in their lives that affect
   their well-being and behaviors. This raises the question of whether
   individuals' financial constraints will affect their responses to
   positive approach-framed (versus negative avoidance-framed) messages in
   ads. We examined the effects of consumers' financial constraints on
   their responses to ads that had positive approach-framed (versus
   negative avoidance-framed) messages. We hypothesized that consumers with
   financial constraints would have more positive responses to an ad that
   had a positive approach-framed (versus a negative avoidance-framed)
   message and that the depth of information processing would mediate their
   responses to an ad that had a positive approach-framed message. Across
   six studies, including field and online experiments, these findings
   supported the predictions. The findings advance the literature on both
   message framing in ads and financial constraints, and they generate
   actionable guidelines for marketing practice and public policy.

AB Over the past 40 years, we have witnessed seismic shifts in advertising
   planning and buying processes. Due in no small part to the emergence of
   digital media, consumer choices have mushroomed, while advertisers
   understand much more about target audiences. Advertising activities have
   been drastically transformed by the possibilities that technology
   creates for targeting and measurement, automation of activities via
   programmatic advertising, and an overall computational approach in which
   algorithmic, data-driven decisions dominate. In this era, what does it
   mean to "do media planning" and to do it well? The present article
   argues for planning decisions to move away from simply purchasing
   exposure to instead focusing on fostering engagement through meaningful
   and sustained interactions with consumers. It provides an overview of
   the digital ecosystem that makes computational advertising possible,
   updates the notion of consumer engagement for this context, and reviews
   how measurement becomes more central to media planning decisions.
   Ethical and normative considerations and computational advertising as an
   adaptive learning system are discussed as crosscutting issues, followed
   by a proposed research agenda.

   with and about brands by creating, amplifying, and interacting with
   brand-related messages. These user activities generate large volumes of
   structured and unstructured data that advertisers can mine to understand

   from the user-generated content literature through the computational
   advertising lens to offer a road map for future research. Specifically,
   we discuss three roles that users play-as creators, metavoicers, and
   propagators. For each role, we present key research areas that can
   benefit from a computational approach, identify the opportunities and
   challenges, and propose questions for future research. We also discuss
   the practical implications of applying computational methods to study
   users and user-generated content for advertisers.

AB Computational advertising (CA) is a rapidly growing field, but there are
   numerous challenges related to measuring its effectiveness. Some of
   these are classic challenges where CA offers a new aspect to the
   challenge (e.g., multi-touch attribution, bias), and some are brand-new
   challenges created by CA (e.g., fake data and ad fraud, creeping out
   customers). In this article, we present a measurement system framework
   for CA to provide a common starting point for advertising researchers to
   begin addressing these challenges, and we also discuss future research
   questions and directions for advertising researchers. We identify a
   larger role for measurement: It is no longer something that happens at
   the end of the advertising process; instead, measurements of consumer
   behaviors become integral throughout the process of creating, executing,
   and evaluating advertising programs.

AB Dynamic imagery (e.g., frozen motion images) is widely used in
   high-imagery ads to enhance consumer engagement. However, little is
   known as to whether and how product presentation dynamism influences the
   effectiveness of ads with other visual stimuli. Given that different
   visual elements compete for finite attentional resources, this article
   proposes that product presentation dynamism interacts with contextual
   backgrounds and advertising slogans in a visual ad. Study 1 reveals that
   dynamic product presentation diverts attentional resources away from the
   background image, making contextual backgrounds less effective in
   enhancing imagery fluency than a plain background. Study 2 extends these
   findings by exploring the complicating effect of the presence of a
   slogan and revealing important product category differences. For hedonic
   products, congruent (incongruent) slogan-background meanings increase
   imagery fluency under stationary (dynamic) product presentation, which
   further increases purchase intentions. For utilitarian products,
   incongruent slogan-background meanings increase purchase intentions
   under dynamic product presentation. The conceptual and practical
   implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Advertising both builds upon and benefits from the relationship between
   consumers and brands. In three longitudinal studies this research
   explores the cultivation and effects of this relationship and
   demonstrates that, when consumers are in an exchange relationship with a
   brand, ownership duration leads to higher self-brand connection, which
   subsequently translates into heightened brand valuation. In contrast,
   this effect is not observed for consumers in a communal brand
   relationship (Study 1). Further, results show that brand
   singularization, operationalized as content strategies that engage
   consumers to provide product reviews (Study 2) or to create
   consumer-generated advertisements (Study 3), enhances the effect of
   brand relationship norms, especially when the norm is exchange in
   nature. Our findings provide important insights to help advertisers
   design advertising campaigns that use brand relationship norms and
   singularization to engage consumers and subsequently increase brand
   valuation.

AB Despite the importance of persuasion knowledge (PK) for understanding
   how individuals cope with persuasion, there is little research
   addressing how PK can be developed and sustained. We explore
   dispositional PK (consumers' confidence in their knowledge about
   marketer agents' persuasion tactics) and coping skills (i.e., critical
   thinking about media: skepticism, understanding bias, scrutinizing
   source) among families in Jamaica after an intervention and at a delay.
   We randomly assigned 62 mother-adolescent pairs to an intervention (two
   workshops) or control group: all participants completed questionnaires
   four times (baseline, after Workshop 1, after Workshop 2, 10 to 11 weeks
   after Workshop 2). Workshop 1 provided information related to PK, and
   then families completed "subvertising" homework. Subvertising allows
   audiences to critically evaluate media content and to construct
   subversive narratives, often through parody. In Workshop 2, families
   discussed and presented their subvertisements. Results of the
   multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) revealed time x condition
   interaction effects for skepticism (mothers), bias (adolescents), and
   source (adolescents), offering support for the efficacy of the
   intervention. In addition, adolescents and mothers in the intervention
   group increased their PK after the intervention with mothers' PK
   sustained over time.

   greater creativity than others while the process-performance paradox
   literature predicting they will demonstrate equivalent or less
   creativity. We compare the performance of agency creatives with agency
   noncreatives and a general population sample on three creativity
   assessments: a general divergent thinking test (Alternative Uses Task),
   a general convergent thinking test (Remote Associates Test), and an
   advertising domain-specific creativity test (scenario-based tagline
   generation). Creatives did not outperform noncreatives on any of the
   tests but did outperform the general population in terms of the
   elaboration and originality aspects of divergent thinking. The general
   population outperformed both agency samples on the convergent thinking
   test. No differences were found in the domain-specific creativity test.
   Overall, this exploratory study finds more evidence supporting the

   First, rather than solely optimizing consumer data for enhanced impact
   of automated content, we submit, and provide extra key variables to
   further illustrate, that there is a desirable balance of both consumer
   and brand data as inputs to algorithms to serve short- and long-term
   impact goals. Second, this article guides research by addressing
   tensions between understanding the relationship between inputs and
   desired impacts (both short and long term) and proposing a research

   from the advertising of hospitality services. Specifically, we
   investigate how different types of franchised hotel outlets, each
   targeting a different customer segment, moderate the effects of various
   advertising expenditures on unit-level profitability. Our unique data
   set allows us to examine the impact of unit-level advertising
   expenditure allocations using line items from the profit and loss
   statements of more than 9,000 franchised U.S. hotel properties from 2007
   to 2018. We consider the effects of investing in varied advertising
   activities, including the franchise advertising assessment, loyalty
   programs, local sales force, and local media advertising. As
   hypothesized, we find differential effects of advertising for outlets
   targeting different customer segments. Relative to traditional
   full-service hotels, those focused on destination-driven customer
   segments (i.e., destination hotels) and price-sensitive customer
   segments (i.e., limited-service hotels) benefit less from investing in
   the franchise advertising assessment, loyalty programs, and local media
   advertising. We also find that local sales force expenditures positively
   moderate performance for destination hotels. We highlight the moderating
   effects of hotel type as a key situational factor and provide more
   nuanced insight into managing the tension arising from advertising
   allocation at franchised hotel chains.

AB Prior research in behavioral economics has examined the effects of
   nudging and the diverse aspects of choice on individuals' decisions and
   behaviors. Based on this premise, the current research offers a novel
   and timely view by examining how communication messages in public
   service advertisements (PSAs) can alter the perception of threat under
   uncertain situations such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic. This
   article investigates the role of additional relative statistical
   information on the perception of threat and stockpiling intention.
   First, we examine whether there is a reduction in the perceived threat
   of the coronavirus if information about the potential severity of an
   alternative threat (car accidents) is activated, when compared to
   offering only statistics on the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is
   known as COVID-19. Furthermore, we established the mediating role of a
   perceived threat in consumers' decisions and behavior in times of severe
   crisis. This suggests that organizations and policymakers can influence
   individuals by increasing or decreasing their perceived level of threat
   depending on the desired outcomes (e.g., respecting authorities'
   recommendations or avoiding stockpiling). This research offers a deeper
   understanding of how consumers can be "nudged" toward desired behavior
   in the context of public health and safety.

   behavior. Study 2 shows that joint brand advertising stimulates product
   interest, which in turn increases tourists' intention to visit. The
   mediating role of product interest disappears when a destination brand
   forms a partnership with a lesser-reputed travel intermediary brand. The
   research provides implications for theory development in the area of
   tourism advertising, while also identifying best practices for
   advertisers on how to optimize the effectiveness of their campaigns.

AB Despite the ubiquitous use of taste-focused and health-focused
   advertising messages, the existing advertising literature offers little
   guidance on how the persuasiveness of such messages might be enhanced
   through design elements such as color. To address this gap, the current
   research examines the new congruency of a visual design element (i.e.,
   color) and a verbal design element (i.e., message type) and explores how
   color may facilitate the persuasion of taste-focused versus
   health-focused advertising messages. The message-color congruency effect
   is examined across two studies with between-subjects experimental
   designs utilizing an Amazon's Mechanical Turk (Mturk) consumer panel.
   The findings suggest that taste-focused advertising messages combined
   with color imagery and health-focused advertising messages combined with
   black-and-white (BW) imagery can effectively boost consumer responses,
   including attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the restaurant,
   purchase intention, and willingness to pay (WTP). Furthermore, mediation
   analyses demonstrate that the proposed message-color congruency effect
   is driven by consumers' subjective experience of "feeling right" during
   information processing. Implications for designing advertisements are
   discussed.

AB Brand endorsers can contribute to a brand's success or failure (in the
   case of endorser transgressions). Recent advancements in technology have
   produced new, nonhuman alternatives to traditional celebrity endorsers.
   These new endorsers rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to interact
   with and influence consumers. Two studies demonstrate that AI
   influencers can produce positive brand benefits similar to those
   produced by human celebrity endorsers. Moreover, just like their human
   counterparts, AI influencers can also commit transgressions that result
   in degradation of the endorsed brand. Importantly, though, AI
   influencers differ from human celebrity endorsers in that consumers are
   less likely to view them as unique entities (as tested in a pilot
   study). Thus, consumers are more likely to perceive a transgression
   committed by an AI influencer as behavior applicable to all AI
   influencers, but they are less likely to view celebrity endorser
   behaviors as interchangeable. As such, after an AI influencer has
   committed a transgression, replacing the AI influencer with a celebrity
   endorser attenuates negative brand perceptions, an effect which cannot
   be realized if the replacement is another AI influencer.

AB In a gradually more hypercompetitive global tourism arena, destination
   marketers are increasingly seeking effective ways to promote places
   through appealing place brand messages. Local residents can be valuable
   ambassadors for the place, as well as co-creators of place-related brand
   communication. However, research focusing on place advertising from the
   residents' perspective is scant. To address this gap, this work
   identifies three main antecedents of residents' intention to share a
   place brand message online: place attachment, place ad-brand congruity,
   and self-expressiveness. A model is developed and tested on a sample of
   current and former residents of a Swedish city. Structural equation
   model results support that these antecedents have a positive influence
   on current as well as former residents' intention to share a place brand
   ad online. Place attachment also has a significant indirect influence on
   intention to share, with place ad-brand congruity and
   self-expressiveness as partial mediators. Furthermore, place ad-brand
   congruity partially mediates the relationship between place attachment
   and self-expressiveness.

AB Practitioners and scholars increasingly employ social media listening
   platforms (SMLPs) driven by artificial intelligence (AI) to extract
   actionable insights from large amounts of social media data informing
   research questions and brand strategy. Due to their proprietary nature,
   AI tools within SMLPs are "black boxes" that force users to accept
   results on blind faith, a source of concern in industry and academia.
   This study seeks to provide greater understanding of the strengths and
   weaknesses of SMLPs by assessing the AI-based results of leading SMLP
   Crimson Hexagon (now Brandwatch Consumer Research) against those of a
   standard human content analysis and an analysis conducted using
   Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Analyzing a random 10,000-post
   sample of the conversation around the Nike "Dream Crazy" ad featuring
   Colin Kaepernick, findings reveal Crimson Hexagon's AI tools to be
   woefully unreliable in terms of brand identification as well as
   detection of post and brand sentiment polarity, specific emotions, and
   brand outcomes, demonstrating the hazards of blindly relying upon
   conclusions drawn from black-box social media listening platforms.
   Findings highlight the need for researchers to examine algorithm
   documentation and training data sets, as well as assess AI-generated
   data prior to use in research models and decisions.

AB This article proposes and tests a dual-route and dual-effect model to
   explain the ways in which branded videos can inspire consumers and
   thereby produce further effects. Inspiration entails both
   being-inspired-by and being-inspired-to routes. Through a persuasion
   effect, derived from the be-inspired-by route, inspiring branded videos
   motivate consumers to find meaning in life. In turn, they feel gratitude
   for such inspiring content and its source, which leads to more favorable
   video and brand attitudes and a more positive persuasion effect. Through
   a personal growth effect, derived from the be-inspired-to route,
   inspiring branded videos motivate consumers to appreciate the meaning of
   life. In turn, they seek out important personal goals and enter into a
   high hope state, which benefits their subjective well-being. The
   findings of three studies support this proposed model, in which
   inspiring, self-transformative branded videos evoke positive outcomes
   for both consumers and brands.

AB Imagine a beer advertisement next to an article about drunk driving, or
   a coupon for a free dinner embedded in an article about food poisoning.
   While humans are quite good at seeing the error in these examples, the
   machine-learning algorithms that place advertisements online continue to
   struggle with this type of contextual nuance. We argue that this
   shortcoming stems from the manner in which these machines are taught
   about semantic relatedness-the conceptual distance between words in the
   human mind. Specifically, we hypothesize that there is a difference in
   how humans view semantic relatedness when context is present versus when
   it is absent and that this difference is missing from the data used by
   machines to place advertisements online. To test this hypothesis, we
   adapt existing best practices to create a new, context-aware database
   and then compare it to the current state of the art. We find substantial
   differences in the distribution of semantic relatedness scores for
   context-aware versus context-free databases. We also find that the
   nature and scope of these differences are likely to lead to the types of
   mistakes observed in practice.

AB This research theorizes and empirically investigates the concept of
   brand anthropomorphism in the context of tourist destinations, namely,
   destination anthropomorphism. First, we demonstrate that
   anthropomorphizing a culturally distant tourist destination (e.g.,
   Tokyo, Japan; Hanoi, Vietnam) leads to consumers' lower intentions to
   travel to the destinations, whereas this negative destination
   anthropomorphism effect is attenuated for culturally close tourist
   destinations (e.g., London, United Kingdom; Sydney, Australia). In
   contrast, as anticipated, this research reveals that destination
   anthropomorphism leads to positive consumer reactions for destinations
   within the same culture (e.g., Seward, Alaska, USA). As such, we provide
   insights into the effects of anthropomorphizing in-group versus
   out-group entities in the realm of tourism and travel. Specifically, we
   show the negative downstream effects of anthropomorphizing entities that
   belong to a different group (i.e., out-group), which results in
   tourists' heightened perceptions of a key perceived travel risk, social
   risk, that manifests as lower intentions to visit that destination.
   Finally, this research provides critical managerial recommendations that
   can be incorporated into advertising strategies not only to enhance
   communication effectiveness but also to avoid negative repercussions of
   destination anthropomorphism.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated the marketing landscape and

   With AI coming under the spotlight, we know surprisingly little about
   its impact on consumers' patronage likelihood. This research attempts to
   address this void by investigating the "just-walk-out" retail technology
   in cohort with in-store communication. Across three studies, conducted
   online and in the field, the authors demonstrate that, compared to
   self-service checkouts, AI-enabled checkouts lead to significantly
   higher consumers' patronage likelihood. Furthermore, sensory stimulation
   stemming from in-store communication (environmental cues including
   assortment, advertising, and technology) underlies this impact.
   Importantly, the extent to which consumers perceive AI technology to be
   threatening is revealed as a boundary condition to these effects. These
   findings advance our understanding of how AI-enabled checkouts and
   in-store communication influence consumers' patronage likelihood and the
   boundary condition that moderates their impact.

AB The authors propose a creative advertising system (CAS) for the
   generation and testing of advertising creative ideas, founded on
   artificial intelligence (AI) principles. The proposed system emerges
   from a conceptual framework where advertising creativity is more broadly
   defined as a search process, the outcomes of which should be evaluated
   based on a set of rules. This broader definition provides a generative
   perspective and extends current approaches to advertising creativity
   that are mainly based on outcome measures such as perceived novelty and
   appropriateness (value). The framework is flexible enough to accommodate
   existing advertising concepts such as advertising templates and explain
   why executional advertising elements are not consistently effective
   across different ads. The proposed system can be used both as a
   reflection and a generation tool for advertising creators and offers
   promising opportunities for interdisciplinary research. Fundamentally,
   it can help aspiring and established creators understand that creativity
   is not an elite privilege but rather a systematic process which can be
   aided by data and computation.

AB The phenomenon of brands making sarcastic and sometimes rude comments

   unexplored behavior, and research in this area is scarce. How consumers
   perceive the use of humor in brand-to-brand dialogue may have meaningful
   managerial implications for companies and important theoretical
   implications for existing theory. Thus, to understand the dyadic
   relationship between two brands who engage with each other on social
   media, we explore two different types of humorous comments (low
   aggression and high aggression) and how the type of humor employed
   affects consumers' perceptions of both the brand initiating the dialogue
   and the brand that responds. Interestingly, we find that the safest
   strategy for brands that elect to interact with other brands on social
   media is to refrain from either type of humor, thus avoiding perceptions
   of manipulative intent. However, for brands that elect to respond to
   other brands, the type of humor employed can vary based on the tone of
