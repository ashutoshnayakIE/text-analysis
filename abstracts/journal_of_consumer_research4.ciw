TI Hedonic Eating Goals and Emotion: When Sadness Decreases the Desire to

AB This article uses the functionalist perspective of emotion to
   demonstrate that the influence of sadness on indulgent consumption
   depends on the presence of a hedonic eating goal. Sadness heightens a
   persons sensitivity to the potentially harmful consequences of indulgent
   consumption, which decreases indulgence when a hedonic eating goal is
   salient. As sadness is often associated with a loss, this protective
   function is geared toward preventing future losses. The execution of
   this function is mitigated by feelings of safety, a counterforce to
   concerns about the harmful consequences of goal pursuit. Alternatively,
   when a hedonic eating goal is not salient, or a salient goal does not
   have harmful consequences, sadness results in emotion regulation (i.e.,
   indulging as a means of feeling better). This conceptualization and
   findings show that the effects of emotions on indulgent consumption can
   be goal-dependent, and that emotions can aid consumers in the balancing
   of long-term goals and well-being

AB The current research investigates the role of fear in the creation of
   emotional attachment to a brand. Previous research examining the
   influence of incidental negative emotions on brand evaluations has
   generally found that negative emotions lead to negative evaluations. The
   current research suggests that for fear, the relationship may be more
   positive. Since people cope with fear through affiliation with others,
   in the absence of other individuals, consumers may seek affiliation with
   an available brand. This, in turn, will enhance emotional attachment to
   that brand. Four studies demonstrate that consumers who experience fear
   in the presence of a brand feel greater emotional brand attachment than
   consumers who experience other emotions such as happiness, sadness, or
   excitement. The findings from the research advance understanding of
   consumer-brand relationships by demonstrating that relationships between
   consumers and brands are not merely metaphorical. Rather, under certain
   circumstances, brands can actually fulfill interpersonal psychological
   needs.

AB ocr issue Building on an action-orientation perspective of power,
   original hypotheses regarding power and consumer switching behavior are
   presented. Because high power is associated with a readiness to act, and
   switching behavior often requires taking action in some form, inducing
   consumers to feel powerful is hypothesized to increase consumer
   switching. Multiple experiments provide support for this perspective
   along with evidence for the process via both moderation and mediation.
   This works contributes to the consumer switching literature by
   demonstrating power as a new psychological catalyst for switching
   behavior. This work also adds to the power literature by distinguishing
   between goal priming and semantic priming accounts of the action
   orientation of high power. Specifically, consistent with a goal priming
   account, engaging in action is found to sate consumers subsequent need
   for action as opposed to maintain or increase consumers desire to act,
   as might be predicted from a semantic priming account.

AB Consumers value word-of-mouth communications in large part because
   customer reviews are more likely to include negative information about a
   product or service than are communications originating from the
   marketer. Despite the fact that negative information is frequently
   valued by those receiving it, baldly declaring negative information may
   come with social costs to both communicator and receiver. For this
   reason, communicators sometimes soften pronouncements of bad news by
   couching them in dispreferred markers, including phrases such as, "I'll
   be honest," "God bless it," or "I don't want to be mean, but ..." The
   present work identified and tested a phenomenon termed the dispreferred
   marker effect, in which consumers evaluate communicators who use
   dispreferred markers as more credible and likable than communicators who
   assert the same information without dispreferred markers. The
   dispreferred marker effect can spill over to evaluations of the product
   being reviewed, increasing willingness to pay and influencing
   evaluations of the credibility and likability of the evaluated product's
   personality.

DI 10.1086/675738

PY 2014
AB To date the effectiveness of inducing lower-calorie choices by providing
   consumers with calorie information has yielded mixed results. Here four
   controlled experiments show that adding dish-specific calorie
   information to menus (calorie posting) tends to result in lower-calorie
   choices. However, additionally grouping low-calorie dishes into a single
   low-calorie category (calorie organizing) ironically diminishes the
   positive effects of calorie posting. This outcome appears to be caused
   by the effect that grouping low-calorie options has on consumers
   consideration sets. When choosing from a calorie-organized menu,
   consumers are more likely to filter out low-calorie options in the early
   noncompensatory screening stages of the decision process and,
   consequently, are less likely to choose low-calorie options. This result
   disappears when consumers deliberate longer before choosing. These
   results are important for consumer welfare as well-intentioned
   restaurateurs (policy makers) may be tempted to institute (mandate) the
   calorie organization of menus, inadvertently resulting in consumers
   choosing higher-calorie meals.

AB Could power distance, which is the extent that inequality is expected

   to engage in prosocial behavior, including donations of both money and
   time? This research proposes that higher power distance results in
   weaker perceptions of responsibility to aid others, which decreases
   charitable behavior. Both correlational and causal evidence is provided
   in a series of five studies that examine country-level power distance as
   well as individual and temporarily salient power distance belief.
   Consistent with the mediating role of perceived responsibility, results
   reveal that uncontrollable needs and communal relationship norms are
   boundary conditions that overcome the negative effect of power distance
   on charitable behavior. These results explain differences in charitable
   giving across cultures and provide implications for nonprofit

AB Consumers prefer brands positioned around identities they possess.
   Accordingly, the consumer identity literature emphasizes the importance
   of a clear fit between brands and target identities, suggesting that
   identity marketing that explicitly links brands to consumer identity
   should be most effective. In contrast, five studies demonstrate that
   explicit identity-marketing messages can backfire. Messages that
   explicitly connect a particular brand to consumer identity increase the
   salience of external determinants of behavior, reducing consumers'
   perceptions of agency in identity expression. Hence, compared to
   messages that merely reference consumer identity, messages that
   explicitly define identity expression reduce purchase likelihood,
   despite more clearly conveying identity relevance. These findings
   highlight the need to consider consumers' need for agency in addition to
   their drive for self-definition and expression through consumption,
   offering a foundation to examine both the risks and the rewards of
   identity marketing.

   this work investigates the conditions under which these non-core users
   enhance rather than dilute the brand image. A distinction between two
   types of non-core users based on how they are perceived by current users
   of core products is introduced: "brand immigrants" who claim to be part
   of the in-group of core users of the brand and "brand tourists" who do
   not claim any membership status to the brand community. A series of
   studies show that core consumers respond positively to non-core users
   when they are perceived as brand tourists. The brand tourism effect is
   mediated by core users' pride and moderated by brand patriotism and

AB This research investigates the experience of systemic restricted choice
   and its impact on self-concept among racial and ethnic minority
   consumers seeking financing. Choosing loans is an involved consumer
   choice journey, and encountering systemic, chronic, and uncontrollable
   restrictions on choice at any level of the goal/choice hierarchy limits
   and even prohibits minorities' ability to make desired choices. Across a
   multimethod investigation, these three studies demonstrate that
   minorities experiencing systemic restricted choice endure deleterious
   impacts to self-concept, including framing the self as fettered, alone,
   discriminated, and subservient, as well as marked reductions in
   self-esteem, self-autonomy, and self-efficacy. Minority consumers also
   frame themselves as striving in a world of limited resources and
   fighting uphill, often losing battles. Juxtaposing the experiences of
   racial/ethnic minorities against the choice journeys of educationally
   and economically similar white consumers puts those minority experiences
   in sharp relief. The theoretical and transformative consumer research
   implications of these findings are discussed.

AB This research examines how oral haptics (due to hardness/softness or
   roughness/smoothness) related to foods influence mastication (i.e.,
   degree of chewing) and orosensory perception (i.e., orally perceived
   fattiness), which in turn influence calorie estimation, subsequent food
   choices, and overall consumption volume. The results of five
   experimental studies show that, consistent with theories related to
   mastication and orosensory perception, oral haptics related to soft (vs.
   hard) and smooth (vs. rough) foods lead to higher calorie estimations.
   This "oral haptics-calorie estimation" (OHCE) effect is driven by the
   lower mastication effort and the higher orosensory perception for soft
   (vs. hard) and smooth (vs. rough) foods. Further, the OHCE effect has
   downstream behavioral outcomes in terms of influencing subsequent food
   choices between healthy versus unhealthy options as well as overall
   consumption volume. Moreover, mindful calorie estimation moderates the
   effects of oral haptics on consumption volume.

   also bias predictions when the number of categories is fixed.
   Specifically, five experiments document a category size bias in which
   consumers perceive an outcome as more likely to occur when it is
   categorized with many rather than few alternative possibilities, even
   when the grouping criterion is irrelevant and the objective probability
   of each outcome is identical. For example, participants in one study
   irrationally predicted being more likely to win a lottery if their
   ticket color matched many (vs. few) of the other gamblers' tickets-and
   wagered nearly 25% more as a result. These findings suggest that

AB This article examines the extent to which consumers engage in more
   indulgent consumption when they are exposed to whimsically cute products
   and explores the process by which such products affect indulgence. Prior
   research on kindchenschema (baby schema) has found that exposure to cute
   babies or baby animals leads to more careful behavior (see the study by
   Sherman, Haidt, and Coan), suggesting restraint. The present research
   uncovers the opposite: consumers become more indulgent in their behavior
   after exposure to whimsically cute products. Drawing from research on
   cognitive priming, kindchenschema, anthropomorphization, indulgence, and
   regulatory focus, this research posits that exposure to whimsically cute
   products primes mental representations of fun, increasing consumers'
   focus on approaching self-rewards and making consumers more likely to
   choose indulgent options. These effects do not emerge for kindchenschema
   cute stimuli, since they prime mental representations of vulnerability
   and caretaking. Four empirical studies provide evidence for the proposed
   effects and their underlying process.

AB Consumer choice is often based on the relative visual appeal of
   competing products. Lay intuition, common marketing practice, and extant
   literature all suggest that more visual impressions help consumers
   distinguish products. This research shows that the opposite can occur.
   Rather than highlighting differences, seeing more pictures of products
   being compared can obfuscate perceptions, reduce distinctiveness and
   attractiveness of products, and increase choice uncertainty. Six
   experiments demonstrate that this "product-agnosia" effect is driven by
   shifts in the perceptual focus level of visual information processing.
   More visual impressions increased component-oriented and decreased
   gestalt-oriented perceptual focus, which undermined the distinctiveness
   of products distinguished on a gestalt level (e.g., by style). The
   effect reversed for products distinguished on a component level (e.g.,
   by technical features). Overall, the efficacy of "showing more" depended
   on matching consumers' visual-processing style and the level (gestalt
   vs. component) at which products are differentiated.

AB Can we rely on our high self-control friends to help us make better
   joint spending and diet decisions? The current research reports seven
   studies showing that in joint decisions, homogeneous high self-control
   pairs make less indulgent choices than both homogeneous low self-control
   and mixed pairs. However, there is no difference in the self-regulatory
   patterns of the latter two dyad types: having one high self-control
   partner in a dyad does not lead to more restraint than having none. The
   authors argue that this pattern exists because higher self-control
   individuals tend to prioritize prorelationship behaviors over their
   personal preference for restraint. Therefore, they assent to the lower
   self-control partner's more indulgent preferences. Consistent with this
   explanation, results suggest that interventions that change individuals'
   prorelationship motivation can alter this pattern. Given the range of
   decisions consumers may make in couples or pairs, this research has
   implications for consumers, marketers, and public-policy makers.

AB Power transforms consumer behavior. This research introduces a critical
   theoretical moderator of power's effects by promoting the idea that
   power is accompanied by both an experience (how it feels to have or lack
   power) and expectations (schemas and scripts as to how those with or
   without power behave). In some cases, the psychological experience of
   power predisposes people to behave one way, whereas attention to the
   expectations of power suggests behaving in another way. As a
   consequence, power's effects for consumer behavior can hinge on
   consumers' focus. Specifically, a focus on the experience or
   expectations of power critically moderates how power affects both
   information processing and status seeking. However, as the experience of
   power incites a desire to act, and the powerful are expected to act,
   power produces more action regardless of focus. These findings provide a
   new lens on power and have important implications for consumer behavior.

   they engage in such imagery (e. g., a goal to construct a story of the

   different perspectives are provided, those trying to imagine themselves

   visual perspectives in order to imagine the entire experience. This
   shift in visual perspective can increase processing difficulty and
   decrease evaluations of the product or service being described. When

AB The research examines how the attractiveness of children in need affects
   the empathy they evoke and the subsequent help they receive from
   unrelated adults. The authors find that attractive children are
   attributed desirable characteristics related to social competence, which
   is consistent with the "beautiful is good" stereotype. Ironically, the
   authors find that these attributions reduce the empathy evoked by
   attractive children and the help they receive from unrelated adults as
   long as their need is not severe. These effects are demonstrated in four
   experiments. The research identifies a significant cost of being
   beautiful and an important exception to the beautiful is good
   stereotype. The results also have practical implications for how
   children are portrayed in promotional materials for disaster relief
   agencies, children's hospitals, and other charities.

AB Existing inquiry on self-control reveals an inconsistency. The
   mainstream research on myopic behavior suggests that consumers' use of a
   high versus low construal level should lead them to exhibit less
   indulgence. However, more recent work on hyperopia implies the opposite.
   This research attempts to resolve this discrepancy. In particular, it is
   proposed and demonstrated that the level at which a consumer construes
   information (i.e., abstract vs. concrete), interacts with his or her
   self-focus, and both factors jointly determine a consumer's indulgence
   level. When the self is not salient, outcomes implied by the myopia
   literature ensue. But when the self is focal, the opposite outcomes
   anticipated by the hyperopia literature obtain.

AB Although most consumer self-control decisions are made individually,
   they are rarely made in isolation. Temptations are often simultaneously
   encountered by multiple members of a group or dyad and thereby
   susceptible to social influence. However, little is known about these
   "parallel" self-control decisions or the resulting social consequences.
   In a series of studies spanning the domains of money, time management,
   and food consumption, consumers demonstrated a tendency to bond over
   matched self-control decisions through "coindulgence" or "coabstinence."
   The perceived severity of choosing vice over virtue influenced when each
   of these matched outcomes produced greater affiliation. When indulgence
   threatened to seriously hinder goal progress, consumers bonded through
   moral support evidenced by joint abstention. When the consequences were
   perceived as relatively less severe, consumers found friendship through
   partnering in crime by both indulging. Throughout, guilt underlies the
   relationship between self-control behaviors and social outcomes, as peer
   compliance reduces guilt and thus improves affiliation.

   consumers perceive the same enhancing products as embellishing users'
   abilities to a greater extent when other people use them than when they

   believe that it is less fair for others to use ability-boosting products

AB Recent research in consumer behavior has documented the phenomenon of
   compensatory consumption, whereby individuals respond to information
   about deficits in their abilities, skills, status, and so forth by
   consuming products that symbolically compensate for the self-deficits.
   However, the examination of factors that might lead individuals to take
   more productive action in response to self-deficit information is
   limited. This article identifies self-acceptance as a moderator of when
   individuals engage in compensatory consumption versus adaptive
   consumption (i.e., consumption intended to help the individual improve
   in the area of deficit) in response to self-deficit information. Three
   studies show that, through self-acceptance, individuals reduce
   compensatory consumption and are more likely to engage in adaptive
   consumption to address self-deficits. Evidence suggests that
   self-acceptance affects individuals' responses to self-deficit
   information by changing their appraisal of self-deficits from harmful to
   benign to their self-worth. We distinguish self-acceptance from the
   related constructs of self-esteem, self-affirmation, and apathy.

AB Despite assertions that coolness sells products, little is known about
   what leads consumers to perceive brands as cool. This research uses an
   experimental approach to examine the empirical relationship between
   consumers' inferences of autonomy and perceived coolness. Six studies
   find that behaviors expressing autonomy increase perceived coolness, but
   only when the autonomy seems appropriate. Autonomy seems appropriate,
   and hence increases perceptions of coolness, when a behavior diverges
   from a norm considered unnecessary or illegitimate, when the autonomy is
   bounded (i.e., deviations are small or occasional rather than large or
   perpetual), and when the consumer views social norms as being overly
   repressive. A final experiment further supports the connection between
   autonomy and coolness and illustrates that coolness is distinct from
   liking by showing that whether a consumer has a goal to express autonomy
   moderates preference for cool brands.

AB This research examines how incidental pride may increase consumers'
   tendency to seek uniqueness, depending on how they attribute the
   pride-inducing experience. Specifically, people who attribute their felt
   pride to personal traits (i.e., hubristic pride) are more likely to
   prefer unique options in unrelated situations, compared to tho'se who
   attribute pride to effort (i.e., authentic pride). This effect is driven
   by a heightened need for uniqueness (studies 1-3). Importantly,
   consumers' lay theories of achievement determine these contrasting
   attributions: consumers who hold an entity (vs. incremental) theory tend
   to attribute their felt pride to their traits (vs. efforts), and this
   motivates them to seek uniqueness (studies 4-5). Consumers who feel
   proud due to effort, but believe the effort was special to themselves,
   seek similarly high levels of uniqueness as those who attribute pride to
   their traits-which demonstrates further evidence for our proposed
   process (study 6). Implications and possible extensions are discussed.

AB Nostalgia has a strong presence in the marketing of goods and services.
   The current research asked whether its effectiveness is driven by its
   weakening of the desire for money. Six experiments demonstrated that
   feeling nostalgic decreased people's desire for money. Using multiple
   operationalizations of desire for money, nostalgia (vs. neutral)
   condition participants were willing to pay more for products (experiment
   1), parted with more money but not more time (experiment 2), valued
   money less (experiments 3 and 4), were willing to put less effort into
   obtaining money (experiment 5), and drew smaller coins (experiment 6).
   Process evidence indicated that nostalgia's weakening of the desire for
   money was due to its capacity to foster social connectedness
   (experiments 5 and 6). Implications for price sensitivity, willingness
   to pay, consumer spending, and donation behavior are discussed.
   Nostalgia may be so commonly used in marketing because it encourages
   consumers to part with their money.

AB Defaults effects can be created by social contexts. The observed choices

   Social default effects are a novel form of social influence not due to
   normative or informational influence: participants were more likely to
   mimic observed choices when choosing in private than in public
   (experiment 1) and when stakes were low rather than high (experiment 2).
   Like other default effects, social default effects were greater for
   uncertain rather than certain choices (experiment 3) and were weaker
   when choices required justification (experiment 4). Social default
   effects appear to occur automatically as they become stronger when
   cognitive resources are constrained by time pressure or load, and they

AB Many companies offer products with social benefits that are orthogonal
   to performance (e. g., green products). The present studies demonstrate
   that information about a company's intentions in designing the product
   plays an import role in consumers' evaluations. In particular, consumers
   are less likely to purchase a green product when they perceive that the
   company intentionally made the product better for the environment
   compared to when the same environmental benefit occurred as an
   unintended side effect. This result is explained by consumers' lay
   theories about resource allocation: intended (vs. unintended) green
   enhancements lead consumers to assume that the company diverted
   resources away from product quality, which in turn drives a reduction in
   purchase interest. The present studies also identify an important
   boundary condition based on the type of enhancement and show that the
   basic intended (vs. unintended) effect generalizes to other types of

AB Responsible consumption conventionally stems from an increased awareness
   of the impact of consumption decisions on the environment, on consumer
   health, and on society in general. We theorize the influence of
   moralistic governance regimes on consumer subjectivity to make the
   opposite case: responsible consumption requires the active creation and
   management of consumers as moral subjects. Building on the sociology of
   governmentality, we introduce four processes of consumer
   responsibilization that, together, comprise the P. A. C. T. routine
   (personalization, authorization, capabilization, and transformation).
   After that, we draw on a longitudinal analysis of problem-solving
   initiatives at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to
   explore the role of P. A. C. T. in the creation of four, now
   commonplace, responsible consumer subjects: the bottom-of-the-pyramid
   consumer, the green consumer, the health-conscious consumer, and the
   financially literate consumer. Our analysis informs extant macro-level
   theorizations of market and consumption systems. We also contribute to
   prior accounts of responsibilization, marketplace mythologies, consumer
   subjectivity, and transformative consumer research.

   experiences of disaffected members of a religious institution and
   consumption field. Consumers face severe crises of identity and the need
   to rebuild their self-understandings in an unfamiliar marketplace of
   identity resources. Unable to remain comfortably in the field of their
   primary socialization, they are nevertheless bound to it by investments
   in field-specific capital. In negotiating this dilemma, they demonstrate

   work, this article investigates tidiness from the angle of symbolic

   symbolic pollution described at a macro-social level, tidiness depends
   on two conditions, namely, a set of classifications and the dangerous
   transgression of these classifications. However, at a micro-social
   level, individuals negotiate boundaries between classifications in order
   to cope with symbolic pollution. Consumers define their domestic
   classifications through a juxtaposition of micro-practices, which does
   not necessarily create a hierarchically ordered system but which enables
   these consumers to avoid anomalies and transgressions. Furthermore,
   respondents are willing to break tidiness rules on specific occasions
   because the danger-beliefs associated with transgression are
   context-dependent. This analysis of tidiness gives new insights into
   materiality, emphasizing the cultural meaning of ordering one's

AB In response to consumers' complaints that they feel rejected in and thus
   avoid luxury stores, retailers have encouraged sales personnel to be
   more friendly. However, prior research on social rejection supports the
   idea that rejection encourages people to elevate their perceptions of
   their rejecters and strengthens their predilection to affiliate with
   them. Four studies examine the circumstances in which consumers increase
   their regard and willingness to pay after brand rejection. In a retail
   context, the data reveal that after threat, consumers have more positive
   attitudes and higher willingness to pay when (1) the rejection comes
   from an aspirational (vs. nonaspirational) brand, (2) the consumer
   relates the brand to his/her ideal self-concept, (3) s/he is unable to
   self-affirm before rejection, (4) the salesperson delivering the threat
   reflects the brand, and (5) the threat occurred recently. The
   substantive implications of these findings for retailers are discussed,

AB Marketers, educators, and caregivers often refer to instrumental
   benefits to convince preschoolers to eat (e. g., "This food will make
   you strong"). We propose that preschoolers infer that if food is
   instrumental to achieve a goal, it is less tasty, and therefore they
   consume less of it. Accordingly, we find that preschoolers (3-5.5 years
   old) rated crackers as less tasty and consumed fewer of them when the
   crackers were presented as instrumental to achieving a health goal
   (studies 1-2). In addition, preschoolers consumed fewer carrots and
   crackers when these were presented as instrumental to knowing how to
   read (study 3) and to count (studies 4-5). This research supports an
   inference account for the negative impact of certain persuasive messages
   on consumption: preschoolers who are exposed to one association (e. g.,

AB Spending that exhausts a budget is shown to decrease satisfaction with
   purchased products relative to spending when resources remain in the
   budget. Six studies, including those in which participants earn and
   spend real resources and evaluate real products, explore this bottom
   dollar effect. This research contributes to prior mental accounting
   research regarding how costs influence decision making (e. g., bundling,
   coupling, sunk costs) and to the satisfaction literature. Supporting the
   role of pain of payment in this process, we show that the bottom dollar
   effect increases as effort required to earn budgetary resources
   increases, decreases in the presence of windfall gains, and decreases
   when there is less time between budget exhaustion and replenishment.
   Mediation analyses further demonstrate the role of payment pain in the
   bottom dollar effect. Implications are discussed in the context of
   behavioral research, marketing promotions management, and public policy.

AB Donating to charitable causes is generally perceived as a moral,
   prosocial behavior, but this may not always be the case. Although moral
   identity tends to have a positive effect on prosocial behavior, moral
   identity does not unconditionally enhance charitable giving. Four
   studies demonstrate that moral identity decreases donations when
   recipients are responsible for their plight. Mediation analysis reveals
   that empathy and justice underlie these effects such that moral identity
   increases donations for recipients with low plight responsibility
   through increased empathy, but moral identity decreases donations to
   recipients with high plight responsibility due to perceptions of
   justice. Importantly, donations to recipients who are responsible for
   their plight can be enhanced when donors' immorality is made salient,
   evoking empathy for recipients, particularly among donors with high
   moral identity. This research makes theoretical contributions in
   addition to providing implications for nonprofit organizations whose
   recipients may be perceived as responsible for their plight.

   in helping consumers pursue their goals (e. g., losing weight,
   maintaining a clean home)? Across five studies, we challenge the
   traditional view that low control is detrimental to effort and
   demonstrate that consumers prefer products that require them to engage
   in hard work when feelings of control are low. Such high-effort products
   reassure individuals that desired outcomes are possible while also
   enabling them to feel as if they have driven their own outcomes. We also
   identify important boundary conditions, finding that both the nature of
   individuals' thoughts about control and their perceived rate of progress

AB Misuse of pharmacological products is a major public health concern.
   Seven studies provide evidence of a rapid wear-off bias in judgments of
   pharmacological products: consumers infer that duration of product
   efficacy is dependent on concurrent task difficulty, such that
   relatively more difficult tasks lead to faster product wear-off. This
   bias appears to be grounded in consumers' incorrect application of a
   mental model about substance wear-off based on their experiences with,
   and beliefs about, various physical and biological phenomena. Results
   indicate that the rapid wear-off bias affects consumption frequency and
   may thus contribute to overdosing of widely available pharmacological
   products. Further, manufacturers' intake instructions in an interval
   format (e. g., "Take one pill every 2-4 hours") are shown to signal that
   efficacy is task dependent and reinforce the bias. Debiasing
   mechanisms-interventions to reduce the rapid wear-off bias and its
   impact-along with implications for consumers, marketers, and public
   health officials, are discussed.

AB Hedonic experiences that involve real, immediate events (such as reading
   about a recent, real-life tragic event) naturally evoke strong affective
   reactions. When these events are instead fictional or removed in time,
   they should be perceived as more psychologically distant and evoke
   weaker affective reactions. The current research shows that, while
   consumers' intuitions are in line with this prediction, their actual
   emotional experiences are surprisingly insensitive to the distancing
   information. For instance, readers of a sad story overestimated how much
   their emotional reaction would be reduced by knowing that it described a
   fictional event. Similarly, game participants overestimated how much
   their excitement about winning a prize would be dampened by knowing that
   the prize would only be available later. We propose that actual readers
   and prize winners were too absorbed by the hedonic experience to
   incorporate the distancing information, resulting in surprisingly strong
   affective reactions to fictional stories and delayed prizes.

AB It could be argued that success in life is a function of a consumer's
   ability to get things done. The key step in getting things done is to
   get started. This research explores the effect of the categorization of
   time on task initiation. Specifically, we theorize that consumers use a
   variety of cues to categorize future points in time (events) into either
   events that are like the present event or those that are unlike the
   present event. When the deadline of a task is categorized in a
   like-the-present category, it triggers the default implemental mind-set
   and hence results in a greater likelihood of task initiation. A series
   of field and lab studies among farmers in India and undergraduate and
   MBA students in North America provided support to this theorizing. Our
   findings have implication for goal-striving strategy and choice

AB From outrage at corporations to excitement about innovations,
   marketplace sentiments are powerful forces in consumer culture that
   transform markets. This article develops a preliminary theory of
   marketplace sentiments. Defined as collectively shared emotional
   dispositions, sentiments can be grouped into three function-based
   categories: contempt for villains, concern for victims, and celebration
   of heroes. Marketplace actors such as activists, brands, and consumers
   have a variety of motives and methods for producing and reproducing
   sentiments. Activists plant, amplify, and hyper-perform sentiments to
   recruit consumers and discipline institutions. Brands carefully select,
   calibrate, and broadcast sentiments to entertain consumers and promote
   products. Consumers learn, experience, and communicate sentiments to
   commune and individuate in society. The emergent theory of marketplace
   sentiments (1) advances a sociocultural perspective on consumer emotion,
   (2) elevates the theoretical significance of emotional observations in
   cultural studies, (3) offers a sentiment-based understanding of the
   power of ideology, (4) indicates how activist sentiments can
   paradoxically benefit from brand co-optation, and (5) calls for human
   input in big data sentiment analysis. More broadly, the article proposes
   that cultures are systems of discourses, sentiments, and practices
   wherein discourses legitimize sentiments and practices, sentiments
   energize discourses and practices, and practices materialize discourses
   and sentiments.

AB Affect toward countries can be generated by people's personal

   designed to create positive affect toward the country. In four
   experiments, this research examines the effect of country-related affect
   (CRA) on the evaluations of products originating from the country.
   Country-related affect (CRA) systematically influences product
   evaluations depending on the valence as well as the warmth or competence
   associations of CRA. Positive CRA enhances evaluations of products with
   favorable country-related product (CRP) associations, but it boomerangs
   and decreases evaluations of products with unfavorable CRP associations.
   Positive CRA engenders high (vs. low) construal processing that directs
   consumer attention to CRP associations under low (vs. high) arousal
   conditions (experiments 1 and 2). Experiments 3 and 4 establish that CRA
   is a unique type of incidental affect that influences product
   evaluations based on its warmth or competence associations. The

   analyzes the public discourse surrounding the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989

   that media coverage of such events ultimately contains the anxieties

   myths generated by media coverage frame public discourse in ways that
   help to reestablish consumers' trust in expert systems while also
   insulating corporations and governmental institutions from more
   systematic critiques. This analysis contributes to a macrolevel
   theorization of the institutional and ideological structures that shape

   effects that operate in concert with the more commonly discussed

   almost any caregiving activity (e. g., nannies, potty training, birthday
   party planning). Sociologists document a care deficit-resulting from
   dual-earner households and distance from extended family-coupled with
   rising consumerism to account for outsourcing. These studies, as well as
   those in consumer research, clarify outsourcing motivations, but stop
   short of explaining the differential impacts of outsourcing tensions
   parents regularly face when assembling care. As such, consumer
   researchers know little about how parents navigate such tensions when
   deciding what is acceptable to outsource. Based on depth interviews with
   23 families, our analysis uncovers complex care assemblages that are
   shaped by parenting discourses and tensions of control, intimacy, and
   substitutability. The resulting framework explains parents' strategies
   for minimizing outsourcing tensions, reveals processes for (re)
   assembling different types of care resources, and challenges what is
   known about the relationship between the market and family life.

AB How does nonconsumption shape desire? The proposed model suggests that
   desire depends on the length of nonconsumption of a good and the
   presence of salient alternatives, and that desire is at least partially
   constructed. In the absence of salient alternatives, a longer
   nonconsumption period results in stronger desire for the unconsumed
   good. However, in the presence of salient alternatives, individuals
   infer that they have developed new tastes, and thus a longer
   nonconsumption period results in a weaker desire for the unconsumed
   good. Five studies support this model across nonconsumption of various
   goods: food from home when attending college (study 1); chametz food
   during the Passover holiday (study 2); social media (i.e., abstaining
   from Facebook; study 3); and cultural foods (i.e., forgoing Japanese
   food, study 4; and Thai food, study 5). We discuss implications of our

   savoring individual events or distribute appealing and unappealing
   events across time to maximize happiness. Building on this work, the
   current research shows that consumers track not just individual events
   but also "categories" of events. Consequently, a person who visits a
   modern art gallery, a classic art gallery, the opera, and a symphony
   concert could either construe these as four distinct experiences or as
   two categories of experiences (art galleries and musical performances).
   Consumers seem to naturally consider experiential categories. For
   positive experiences, consumers are reluctant to choose in a way that
   eliminates categories, but the opposite is true for negative
   experiences. People may do this because eliminating categories leads to
   a greater subjective feeling of making progress in a hedonic experience.

   to more extreme price-based quality predictions. This finding suggests
   that quality inferences do not only stem from what consumers have
   learned about the average level of quality at different price points
   through exemplar memory or rule abstraction. Instead, quality
   predictions are also based on learning about the covariation between
   price and quality. That is, consumers inappropriately conflate the

AB Marketing communications (e.g., advertising, packaging) can be either

   absence of color affects consumer information processing. Drawing from
   construal-level and visual perception theory, five experiments test the
   hypothesis that black-and-white (BW) versus color imagery is cognitively
   associated with high-level versus low-level construal, respectively.
   Experiment 1 establishes this association via an Implicit Association
   Test. On the basis of this association, experiments 2 and 3 show that BW
   (vs. color) imagery promotes high-level (vs. low-level) construal,
   leading to sorting objects on the basis of high-level (vs. low-level)
   features, segmenting behaviors into broader (vs. narrower) units, and
   interpreting actions as ends (vs. means). Extending this effect into
   consumer decision making, experiments 4 and 5 further show that
   consumers presented with BW (vs. color) product pictures weight primary
   and essential (vs. secondary and superficial) product featuresmore and

   relative to those who were shame-laden, adopted lower levels of
   construal. In subsequent unrelated judgments, guilt increased reliance
   on feasibility over desirability attributes and emphasized secondary
   rather than primary features. Shame led to the opposite pattern. Guilt's
   tendency to draw behavior-specific appraisals activates local appraisal
   tendencies and endows lower construal levels, whereas shame's tendency
   to implicate the entire self activates global appraisal tendencies and
   endows consumers with higher construal levels. As a boundary condition
   to the core effect, the results showed that the differences between
   guilt and shame only held when the emotions arose from actions rather
   than from inaction situations. These findings provide insight into when
   and why guilt and shame have different effects on subsequent decisions.

AB This research explores how loyal customers, those who have invested
   relatively high amounts of effort with a firm in the form of past
   purchases, respond to randomly determined marketing outcomes (e. g.,
   winning a prize in a random drawing). Across five studies, participants
   exhibit a "lucky loyalty" effect, in which they believe that greater
   effort (e. g., dollars spent at a retailer or number of nights stayed at
   a hotel) results in greater likelihood of obtaining randomly determined
   promotional outcomes. Loyal customers report these higher subjective
   likelihoods for randomly determined outcomes because they feel they
   deserve special treatment from the firm. Theoretically, this work
   demonstrates that individuals appear to believe that they can earn
   "unearnable" outcomes through effort, even when the effort and outcome
   are unrelated. Boundary conditions for the lucky loyalty effect are
   presented, and the implications of the findings are discussed along with
   opportunities for future research.

AB New products are often incongruent with consumer expectations.
   Researchers have shown that consumers prefer moderately incongruent
   products, while being adverse to extremely incongruent products.
   Evidence from three studies suggests that this phenomenon is highly
   influenced by a consumer's state of arousal. Specifically, low arousal
   decreases preference for moderate incongruity while increasing
   preference for extreme incongruity, whereas high arousal decreases
   preference for any form of incongruity. Underlying these effects are
   discrete emotional states brought on by a physiological response to
   incongruity. Varying arousal subsequently varies the severity of the
   emotion, be it negative (anxiety) or positive (curiosity), which in turn
   varies evaluations for the product. This suggests that creating
   excitement around a product launch may be good for incremental
   innovation, but it may not be a good idea for something truly
   innovative.

AB Three experimental studies demonstrate that evaluation mode influences
   the assessment of product bundles. Consumers' preferences for product
   bundles are more pronounced in a joint evaluation mode, where the bundle
   is directly contrasted to its single counterpart (i.e., the bundle
   without its add-on), than in a separate evaluation mode, where the
   bundle is evaluated in isolation. An attentional explanation is
   suggested: consumers pay more attention to the unique features of a
   product bundle (i.e., the add-on) and, therefore, prefer the bundle more
   strongly in joint rather than in separate evaluation. This account bears
   relevance for Weaver, Garcia, and Schwarz's presenter's paradox,
   according to which presenters (i.e., people deciding what to offer to
   others) prefer bundle options, whereas evaluators (i.e., people deciding
   what to get for themselves) prefer single options. In the original
   research, presenters and evaluators provided judgments in joint and
   separate evaluation, respectively. Disentangling role (presenter vs.
   evaluator) and evaluation mode, our results show that, independent of
   role, people prefer bundle over single options in joint evaluations and
   are largely indifferent in separate evaluations. Thus, a substantial
   part of the original findings is attributable to evaluation mode. The
   presenter's paradox is revised in light of the current account.

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that more concrete and detailed information
   is helpful in evaluating new products. The current research, however,
   demonstrates that when consumers use visualization to evaluate new
   products, the value of concrete versus abstract visualization is
   dependent on the temporal perspective taken by the consumer.
   Specifically, concrete information is beneficial when product
   visualization is retrospective in nature (i.e., focused on the past),
   whereas abstract information is found to be more helpful when product
   visualization is anticipatory in nature (i.e., geared toward the
   future). This occurs because the match between visualization aids and
   consumers' temporal construal facilitates the extent of imagery
   processing realized, which, in turn, enhances new product evaluation.
   When the new product is very difficult to visualize, this pattern of
   effects is attenuated. Further, the effect is reversed when the product
   is highly familiar (i.e., not a new product), as preexisting memories
   are shown to hinder imagery processing. Theoretical and practical
   implications are discussed.

AB Can a reward of an uncertain magnitude be more motivating than a reward
   of a certain magnitude? This research documents the
   motivating-uncertainty effect and specifies when this effect occurs.
   People invest more effort, time, and money to qualify for an uncertain
   reward (e.g., a 50% chance at $2 and a 50% chance at $1) than a certain
   reward of a higher expected value (e.g., a 100% chance at $2). This
   effect arises only when people focus on the process of pursuing a
   reward, not when they focus on the outcome (the reward itself). When the
   focus is on the process of reward pursuit, uncertainty generates
   positive experience such as excitement and hence increases motivation.
   Four studies involving real rewards lend support to the
   motivating-uncertainty effect. This research carries theoretical
   implications for research on risk preference and motivation and
   practical implications for how to devise cost-efficient consumer
   incentive systems.

AB Consumers often pursue goals (e.g., losing weight) where the chance of
   attaining the goal increases with some behaviors (e.g., exercise) but
   decreases with others (e.g., eating). Although goal monitoring is known
   to be a critical step in self-control for successful goal pursuit,
   little research investigates whether consumers accurately monitor goal
   progress. Seven experiments demonstrate that consumers tend to show a
   progress bias in goal monitoring, perceiving that goal-consistent
   behaviors (e.g., saving $45) help progress more than goal-inconsistent
   behaviors of the equivalent size (e.g., spending $45) hurt it.
   Expectations of goal attainment moderate the progress bias; reducing the
   expectation that the goal will be reached reduces the tendency to
   perceive goal-consistent behaviors to have a larger impact on goal
   progress than equivalent goal-inconsistent behaviors. A study on
   exercise and eating shows that although the progress bias can increase
   initial goal persistence, it can also lead to premature goal release due
   to poor calibration of overall progress.

AB Although complaints document dissatisfaction, some are also humorous.
   The article introduces the concept of humorous complaining and draws on
   the benign violation theory-which proposes that humor arises from things
   that seem simultaneously wrong yet okay-to examine how being humorous
   helps and hinders complainers. Six studies, which use social media and
   online reviews as stimuli, show that humorous complaints benefit people
   who want to warn, entertain, and make a favorable impression on others.
   Further, in contrast to the belief that humor is beneficial but
   consistent with the benign violation theory, humor makes complaints seem
   more positive (by making an expression of dissatisfaction seem okay),
   but makes praise seem more negative (by making an expression of
   satisfaction seem wrong in some way). Finally, a benign violation
   approach perspective also reveals that complaining humorously has costs.
   Because being humorous suggests that a dissatisfying situation is okay,
   humorous complaints are less likely to elicit redress or sympathy from
   others than nonhumorous complaints.

AB This research proposes that because rounded numbers are more fluently
   processed, rounded prices (e.g., $200.00) encourage reliance on
   feelings. In contrast, because nonrounded numbers are disfluently
   processed, nonrounded prices (e.g., $198.76) encourage reliance on
   cognition. Thus, rounded (nonrounded) prices lead to a subjective
   experience of "feeling right" when the purchase decision is driven by
   feelings (cognition). Further, this sense of feeling right resulting
   from the fit between the roundedness of the price number and the nature
   of decision context can make positive reactions toward the target
   product more positive and negative reactions more negative, a phenomenon
   referred to as the rounded price effect in the current research. Results
   from five studies provide converging evidence for the rounded price
   effect. Findings from the current research further show that merely
   priming participants with rounded (nonrounded) numbers in an unrelated
   context could also lead to the rounded price effect. Finally, this
   research provides process support by showing that the rounded price
   effect is mediated by a sense of feeling right. This is the first
   research examining the differential impact of roundedness of prices on

   demonstrate that within-domain compensation impairs subsequent

AB When consumers perceive that a resource is limited and may be
   insufficient to accomplish goals, they recruit and enact plans to cope
   with the shortage. We distinguish two common strategies: efficiency
   planning yields savings by stretching the resource, whereas priority
   planning does so by sacrificing less important goals. Using a variety of
   methods to explore both financial and time planning, we investigate how
   the two types of planning differ, how they vary with constraint, and how
   they interrelate. Relative to efficiency planning, priority planning is
   perceived as yielding larger one-time savings, but it feels more costly
   because it requires trade-offs within-resource (e.g., money for money)
   as opposed to cross-resource (e.g., time for money). As constraint
   increases and greater resource savings are required, prioritization
   becomes more likely. However, the shift to prioritization is often
   insufficient, and consumers tend to react to insufficient prioritization
   dysfunctionally, making a bad situation worse. Budgeting helps consumers
   behave more adaptively. Budgeters respond to constraint with more
   priority planning than nonbudgeters, and they report fewer dysfunctional
   behaviors, like overspending and impulsive shopping.

AB Corporate social responsibility is commonly viewed solely as a tool for
   enhancing company reputations and engendering goodwill among customers.
   In contrast, this research shows that the impact of corporate social
   responsibility can extend beyond public relations and customer goodwill
   to influence the way consumers evaluate a company's products.
   Specifically, this research documents that acts of social goodwill-even
   when they are unrelated to the company's core business, as in the case
   of charitable giving-can alter product perceptions, such that products
   of companies engaged in prosocial activities are perceived as performing
   better. More important, the data show that inferences drawn from a
   company's prosocial actions are strong enough to alter the product
   evaluations even when consumers can directly observe and experience the
   product. The data further show that this effect is a function of the
   moral undertone of the company's motivation for engaging in socially
   responsible behavior and is attenuated when consumers believe that the
   company's behavior is driven by self-interest rather than by
   benevolence. By documenting that social goodwill can benefit consumer
   perceptions of product performance, these findings show that doing good
   can indeed translate into doing well.

   consumers to assess not only the opinions of others about products and
   services, but also the extent to which those opinions are consistent or
   dispersive. Despite long-standing calls for greater understanding of
   mixed opinions, existing evidence is inconclusive regarding effects of
   WOM dispersion, and theoretical accounts have relied primarily on the
   notion of reference dependence. Extending prior work, this research
   proposes an attribution-based account, in which consumer interpretation
   of WOM dispersion depends on the extent to which tastes in a product
   domain are perceived to be dissimilar, so that dispersion can be
   attributed to inconsistency in reviewer preferences rather than the
   product itself. Across four experimental studies, participants presented
   with online rating distributions were more tolerant of dispersion in
   taste-dissimilar product domains than taste-similar product domains, and
   the difference was driven by underlying attributions. Together, these
   findings expand current understanding of WOM, social distributions, and
   risk perception, by revealing distinct pathways through which consumers
   respond to differences of opinion. In addition, they suggest the
   opportunity to proactively influence the manner in which dispersion is
   perceived, highlighting its positive connotations while diminishing its
   association with risk.

AB This research introduces the concept of material parenting, in which
   parents use material goods to express their love or to shape children's
   behavior. Despite the common use of material goods for these purposes,
   possible long term effects of material parenting practices have not been
   studied. This article addresses this oversight by examining the
   potential effects of material parenting on the material values of
   children once they're grown. This research proposes and tests a material
   parenting pathway, in which warm and supportive parents provide children
   with material rewards that in the long run foster materialism in
   adulthood. An insecurity pathway to materialism, previously proposed in
   the literature, is also examined. Results from three survey studies
   provide support for both pathways. Results also suggest that material
   parenting may influence children's material values by (possibly
   unintentionally) encouraging them to use possessions to shape and
   transform the self.

AB This research shows that consumers select a different product when they
   look down versus up. Because (1) people are accustomed to looking down
   to process nearby stimuli and to looking up to process distant stimuli,
   and because (2) perceived distance is linked to concrete versus abstract
   processing, the association between moving one's eyes or head down or up
   and concrete versus abstract processing has become overly generalized. A
   series of three experiments highlights that downward (upward) head and
   eye movements evoke more concrete (abstract) processing because downward
   (upward) head or eye movements have come to serve as a proximity
   (distance) cue. Two additional experiments indicate downstream
   behavioral consequences of moving one's eyes or head down versus up.
   Consumers choose more for feasible versus desirable products when
   looking down and vice versa when looking up. They also tend to be more
   preference-consistent when looking down versus up.

AB Previous research finds that ovulation-the time each month when women
   are most fertile-can shift women's mating psychology and increase their
   desire for new options in men. However, might ovulation also increase
   women's desire for new products? Four studies find that women select a
   greater number of unique options from consumer product sets at high
   fertility. This effect is especially strong for women in committed
   relationships. Additional findings show that the fertility shift in
   desire for variety in products is driven by the fertility shift in
   desire for new options in men activating a variety-seeking mind-set.
   Subsequently, loyalty to a romantic partner, whether manipulated or
   measured, moderated the effect of fertility on consumer variety seeking.
   This research contributes to the literature by revealing when, why, and
   how fertility influences desire for variety in consumer choice and
   highlights the mating motives that underlie this effect.

   compared to an interdependent self-construal, an independent
   self-construal increases the relative preference for affectively
   superior options as opposed to cognitively superior options (experiments
   1A and 1B) and strengthens the effects of incidental mood on evaluations
   (experiment 2). Further, valuations of the decision outcome increase
   when independent (interdependent) consumers adopt a feeling-based
   (reason-based) decision strategy (experiment 3). Finally, these effects
   are moderated by decision focus (whether the decision is made for
   oneself or for others; experiment 4) and need for justification during

   operationalize our research within the context of warning sign icons and
   show how subtle differences in iconography can affect human behavioral
   response. Across five studies incorporating multiple methodologies and
   technologies (click-data heat maps, driving simulations, surveys,
   reaction time, and eye tracking), we show that warning sign icons that
   evoke more (vs. less) perceived movement lead to a quicker propensity to
   act because they suggest greater risk to oneself or others and increase
   attentional vigilance. Icons used in our studies include children
   crossing signs near schools, wet floor signs in store settings, and
   shopping cart crossings near malls. Our findings highlight the
   importance of incorporating dynamic elements into icon design to promote
   imagery and thereby elicit desired and responsible consumer behavior.

   the important psychological properties that define your current self are
   preserved in the person you will be in the future-helps motivate
   consumers to make far-sighted choices by changing their valuation of
   future outcomes (e.g., discount factors). However, this change only
   reduces spending when opportunity costs are considered. Correspondingly,
   cues that highlight opportunity costs reduce spending primarily when

AB While the importance of the temporal dimension for both positive and
   negative consumption experiences has been well understood, no general
   theory exists to explain how consumers' temporal experiences come about.
   We theorize temporal experiences as an effect of performing consumption
   practices in order to move from assessing isolated contextual variables
   to a more holistic understanding. The timeflow of a practice is defined
   as its ability to evoke an experienced temporality that cannot be
   reduced to either subjective "inner" time or cosmic "outer" time. On the
   basis of a longitudinal ethnography of temporality in two lifestyle
   sports-freeskiing and paintball-we find that five practice elements
   shape temporal experience: material set-up, bodily routines and skills,
   teleoaffective structures, rules, and cultural understandings.
   Misalignments of practice elements induce experiences of temporal drag
   or rush associated with experiences such as boredom and stress. We
   contribute to prior research on consumption experiences, waiting, and
   servicescapes.

   Using text mining, we uncover the key phrases associated with consumer
   research. We use a topic modeling procedure to uncover 16 topics that
   have been featured in the journal since its inception and to show the
   trends in topics over time. For example, we highlight the decline in
   family decision-making research and the flourishing of social identity
   and influence research since the journal's inception. A citation
   analysis shows which JCR articles have had the most impact and compares
   the topics in top-cited articles with all JCR journal articles. We show
   that methodological and consumer culture articles tend to be heavily
   cited. We conclude by investigating the scholars who have been the top
   contributors to the journal across the four decades of its existence.
   And to better understand which schools have contributed most to the
   knowledge of consumer research over this history, we provide an analysis
   of where these top-performing scholars were trained. Our approach shows
   that the JCR archives can be an excellent source of data for scholars
   trying to understand the complicated, challenging, and dynamic field of

AB This research examines how self-construal (i.e., independent vs.
   interdependent) and goal type (i.e., attainment vs. maintenance) are
   conceptually linked and jointly impact consumer behavior. The results of
   five experiments and one field study involving different
   operationalizations of self-construal and goal pursuit activities
   suggest that attainment (maintenance) goals can be more motivating for
   participants with a more independent (interdependent) self-construal and
   that differences in salient knowledge about pursuing the goals are one
   potential mechanism underlying this effect. This interaction effect was
   found within a single culture, between cultures, when self-construal was
   experimentally manipulated or measured, and when potential confounding
   factors like regulatory focus were controlled for. The effect was also
   found to impact consumer behavior in real life-self-construal, as
   reflected by the number of social ties consumers had, impacted the
   likelihood that they opted to reduce versus maintain their bodyweight.
   Further, after setting their goal, consumers who were more independent
   exhibited more (less) motivation, as measured by the amount of money
   they put at stake, when their goal was weight reduction (maintenance).
   These findings shed light on the relationship between self-construal and
   goal type, and offer insights, to both consumers and managers, on how to
   increase motivation for goal pursuit.

AB Recent consumer research has examined contexts where market-based
   exchange, gift-giving, sharing, and other modes of exchange occur
   simultaneously and obey several intersecting logics, but consumer
   research has not conceptualized these so-called hybrid economic forms
   nor explained how these hybrids are shaped and sustained. Using
   ethnographic and netnographic data from the collaborative network of
   geocaching, this study explains the emergence of hybrid economies.
   Performativity theory is mobilized to demonstrate that the hybrid status
   of these economies is constantly under threat of destabilization by the
   struggle between competing performativities of market and nonmarket
   modes of exchange. Despite latent tension between competing
   performativities, the hybrid economy is sustained through
   consumer-producer engagements in collaborative consumption and
   production, the creation of zones of indeterminacy, and the enactment of
   tournaments of value that dissipate controversies around hybrid
   transactions. Implications are drawn for consumer research on the
   interplay between market and nonmarket economies.

   collectives of scholars from many social sciences and methodological
   orientations. While a few articles have reviewed the level of diversity
   within the journal and among its peers, none to date has taken an
   expansive look at what is studied, how it is examined, and which
   consumers are used to determine the validity of our theoretical

AB This article examines explanation type in online word of mouth (WOM),
   focusing on what individuals explain: their actions ("I chose this
   product because ...") or their reactions ("I love this product because
   ..."). Results show that review writers explain their actions more than
   their reactions for utilitarian products, but they explain their
   reactions more than their actions for hedonic products. They do so to be
   helpful to review readers, who find explained actions more helpful for
   utilitarian products and explained reactions more helpful for hedonic
   products. Explained actions and reactions are differentially helpful
   across product type because they increase readers' ability to predict
   their attitude toward the reviewed product: explained actions increase
   attitude predictability for utilitarian products, whereas explained
   reactions increase attitude predictability for hedonic products. These
   increases in attitude predictability and review helpfulness ultimately
   increase readers' choice of the product in question. This article
   contributes to the explaining and the WOM literatures by focusing on
   what individuals explain, rather than on how they explain, by
   identifying product type as a novel moderator of what review writers
   explain (actions or reactions), and by examining when and why review

   partnerships that feature brands with either complementary or similar
   attribute levels, both of which are common in the marketplace. The
   results of six experiments show that consumers' evaluations vary as a
   function of concept combination interpretation strategy (property
   mapping or relational linking) and whether cobranded partners have
   complementary or similar attributes. Specifically, when consumers use
   property mapping, they evaluate cobranded partnerships with
   complementary (vs. similar) attribute levels more favorably. In
   contrast, when using relational linking, they evaluate cobranded
   partnerships with complementary (vs. similar) attribute levels less
   favorably. The results also reveal that the breadth of the host brand

AB Consumers with limited discretionary money face important trade-offs
   when deciding how to spend it. In the current research, we suggest that
   feelings of financial constraint increase consumers' concern about the
   lasting utility of their purchases, which in turn increases their
   preference for material goods over experiences. The results of seven
   studies confirm that the consideration of financial constraints shifts
   consumers' preferences toward material goods (rather than experiences),
   and that this systematic shift is due to an increased concern about the
   longevity of the purchase. This preference shift persists even when the
   material goods are more frivolous than the experiences, indicating that
   the effect is not driven by an increased desire for sensible and
   justifiable purchases. However, the shift toward material purchases
   disappears when the material good is unusually short lived, further
   implicating concern about longevity as the key driver of the effect.
   Finally, the consideration of financial constraints increases preference
   for material purchases even when the potential memories that experiences
   can provide are made explicitly salient. Together, these results
   indicate that financially constrained consumers spend their
   discretionary money on material purchases as a means of securing
   long-term consumption utility.

   1994), the symbolic power of brands (Holt 2004, 2006; McCracken 1986),
   and system justification theory (Jost and Banaji 1994), the current
   research explores (1) what values define America's dominant ideology,
   (2) which consumers subscribe to these values, and (3) implications for
   brands that reflect versus do not reflect the dominant ideology. It is
   proposed that consumers vary in their satisfaction with American society
   and their endorsement of America's defining values, and thus differ in
   the values they endorse versus reject in brands. Five experiments
   manipulate whether or not the values signaled by a brand are in
   alignment with the dominant ideology. Consumers more versus less
   satisfied with American society respond differently to the values a

AB Consumer research commonly conceptualizes consumer acculturation as a
   project that immigrants pursue when adjusting their consumer identities
   and practices to unfamiliar sociocultural environments. This article
   broadens this prevailing view by conceptualizing consumer acculturation
   as a relational, interactive adaptation process that involves not only
   immigrant consumption practices but also indigenes who interpret and
   adjust to these practices, thereby shaping the paths of possibility for
   mutual adaptation. Based on a Fiskenian relational configuration
   analysis, the study shows how indigenes in a rural European town
   interpret certain immigrant consumption practices as manifestations of a
   gradual sell-out of the indigenous community, a crumbling of their
   authority, a violation of equality rules, and of indigenes being torn
   between contradictory micro-and macro-social morals. The article
   contributes a broader conceptualization of consumer acculturation,
   highlights four sources of ethnic group conflict in a consumer
   acculturation context, and demonstrates the epistemic value of Fiskenian
   relational configuration analysis for consumer culture theory.

AB Using a semiotic square to study placeway rituals, we theorize one
   particular sanctuary, a secular ritual we term vestaval-and
   specifically, its manifestation in the form of tailgating-as a site of
   popular communion. Vestaval demonstrates the power of consumption to
   stimulate social and civic engagement. We employ an ethnographic team
   methodology to describe and analyze the phenomenon. We theorize the
   eversion mechanism that animates vestaval and sets it apart from other
   social forms including spectacle, festival, and carnival well known to
   consumer research. We explore how vestaval turns the domestic world
   inside out and offers a template both for the temporary suspension and
   potential remaking of the social relations of market and polity. We
   detail a set of practices within four themes-location, construction,
   customization, and inhabitation-that enables the conversion of private
   space to public place and the creation of community from a confederacy
   of consumption encampments. These dynamics are presented as a Mobius
   strip to emphasize not only the simultaneity of stages, but also the
   constant sharing of energy. By examining how midwestern American
   tailgaters in a collegiate setting personalize public place and
   publicize personal place, we demonstrate how individuals negotiate two
   of the fundamental consumption ideologies of public space.

AB We examine how anthropomorphizing a temptation impacts consumer
   self-control. Six studies show that anthropomorphizing a tempting
   product impairs self-control not by boosting desire strength but by
   decreasing consumers' experience of conflict toward consuming the
   product-an alarm that signals a need for self-control. As a result,
   consumers are less likely to initiate self-control and are more likely
   to indulge in the product. This process occurs because an
   anthropomorphized product acts as another agent in the self-control
   dilemma, which decreases the extent to which consumers attribute the
   cause of and responsibility for their consumption to themselves (i.e.,
   internal attribution).

AB Ten studies are used to document that time is valued in accordance with
   a double-kinked value function. There is a zone of indifference for
   small time gains (losses), increasing marginal utility (disutility) for
   moderate time gains (losses), and diminishing marginal utility
   (disutility) for large time gains (losses). Moderate amounts of time
   exhibit increasing marginal utility (disutility) because larger blocks
   of time provide a more diverse set of usage opportunities. It is only
   when it is difficult to imagine how more (less) time would be beneficial
   (detrimental) that there is diminishing marginal utility (disutility)
   for time. Thus time valuation shows increasing marginal utility when
   there is a time deficit, but diminishing marginal utility when there is
   a time surplus. These findings have implications for how other resources
   might be valued.

AB This article is about social space and material objects for sale within
   that space. We draw primarily on Goffman's (1971) concepts of use space
   and possession territories to predict that as the social density of a
   given space increases, inferences of the subjective social class and
   income of people in that space fall. Eight studies confirm that this is
   indeed the case, with the result holding even for stick figures, thus
   controlling for typical visual indicators of social class such as
   clothing or jewelry. Furthermore, these social class inferences mediate
   a relationship between social density and product valuation, with
   individuals assessing both higher prices and a greater willingness to
   pay for products presented in less crowded contexts. This effect of
   inferred class on product valuation is explained by status-motivated
   individuals' desire to associate with higher-status people. To the best
   of our knowledge, this research is the first to reveal the link between
   social density, status inferences, and object valuations. As such, it
   makes a novel contribution to what has come to be known in sociology as
   the topological turn: a renewed focus on social space.

AB At every waking moment, one's mode of attention is situated at some
   point on a spectrum ranging from experiencing, where attention is
   directed toward perceptions and cognitions related to the immediate
   physical environment, to mind-wandering, where attention is directed
   toward thoughts, feelings, and daydreams that are decoupled from the
   environment. Across five studies, the authors propose and find that
   people in an experiencing (vs. mind-wandering) mode place more
   importance on detecting change in their environment, which leads them to
   prioritize attention toward changeable stimuli (like price) and
   subsequently afford such stimuli greater weight in judgments and
   decisions. The research not only uncovers a novel stimuli
   characteristic-changeability-important in both the domain of attention
   modes and judgments but also diverges from the typical characterization
   of price as a salient cue or heuristic to generate a unique set of
   findings based on price's inherently changeable nature. More broadly,
   the findings highlight a way in which consumers' fundamental judgment
   and decision-making processes are shaped by cognitive mechanisms
   designed for the physical world.

AB This study analyzes the marketplace performances that are enacted in the
   field of women's flat track roller derby using the theoretical lens of
   gender performativity. Rather than treating the roller derby field as an
   autonomous enclave of gender resistance, this study focuses on the
   interrelationships between derby grrrls' resignifying performances of
   femininity and the gender constraints that have been naturalized in
   their everyday lives. The market-mediated nature of derby grrrls'
   ideological edgework enables them to challenge orthodox gender
   boundaries, without losing sociocultural legitimacy. This analysis casts
   new theoretical light on the gendered habitus and reveals key
   differences to the outcomes that would follow from Bourdieusian
   assumptions about the deployment of cultural capital in zero-sum status
   competitions. The concept of ideological edgework also presents a
   theoretical alternative to critical arguments, such as the commodity
   feminism thesis, that assume an inherently paradoxical and, ultimately
   co-opting, relationship exists between practices of countercultural
   resistance and marketplace performances. We further argue that
   ideological edgework redresses some of the conceptual ambiguities that
   can lead gender researchers to conflate gender performativity with
   social performances.

AB The present research demonstrates that consumers often feel inhibited
   from engaging in hedonic activities alone, especially when these
   activities are observable by others. When considering whether to engage
   in a hedonic and public activity such as going to a movie alone,
   individuals anticipate negative inferences from others about their
   social connectedness that reduce their interest in engaging in the
   activity. Notably, consumers seem to overestimate how much their
   enjoyment of these activities depends on whether they are accompanied by
   a companion. Cues that attenuate consumers' anticipation of negative
   inferences by making an activity seem more utilitarian or by reducing
   the anticipated number of observers systematically increases interest in
   engaging in unaccompanied public activities.

AB Although considerable attention has been paid to the "brand-as-partner,"
   the current research shows that the "brand-as-servant" is embraced by
   consumers whose value system facilitates a master-servant relationship
   in the quasi-social experiences provided by brand anthropomorphism. Four
   studies evince that differences in hierarchical structure inherent in
   brands working with (i.e., partner brands) versus working for (i.e.,
   servant brands) consumers engender materialism to play a systematic role
   in determining consumer responses to being an equal partner versus
   dominating master in consumer-brand relationships. In particular,
   materialists respond more favorably to a servant brand than to a partner
   brand when the brand is anthropomorphized (vs. objectified), and they
   respond more favorably to an anthropomorphized servant brand than do
   nonmaterialists. This effect is actualized through traits of
   materialists, moderated by brand status and mediated by an activated
   desire to dominate the servant brand. This finding shows that
   partnership may not be the only meaningful relationship that consumers
   form with their brands.

AB Marketers often seek to minimize or eliminate interruptions when they
   deliver persuasive messages in an attempt to increase consumers'
   attention and processing of those messages. However, in five studies
   conducted across different experimental contexts and different content
   domains, the current research reveals that interruptions that
   temporarily disrupt a persuasive message can increase consumers'
   processing of that message. As a result, consumers can be more persuaded
   by interrupted messages than they would be by the exact same messages
   delivered uninterrupted. In documenting this effect, the current
   research departs from past research illuminating the negative effects of
   interruptions, and delineates the mechanism through which and conditions

AB A consistent finding in the attitude literature is that strong attitudes
   are products of effortful cognitive elaboration (Petty and Cacioppo
   1984; Petty and Wegener 1999). The current research extends this by
   incorporating the construct of implicit self-theory. Specifically, it
   finds that that individuals who believe in fixed traits of personality
   (entity theorists) form strong attitudes without effortful cognitive
   elaboration. They form attitudes more quickly and with less effort but
   hold these attitudes more strongly than incremental theorists, whereas
   those who believe in malleable traits (incremental theorists) can form
   strong attitudes only with a high level of elaboration. The current
   research suggests that effortful cognitive elaboration is a sufficient
   but not necessary condition for attitude strength. The underlying
   mechanism for this strength without elaboration effect is also traced.

AB Consumers sometimes prefer to repeat their past choices; at other times
   the same consumer prefers to try something new. We demonstrate that a
   consumers' situational future outlook, that is, local optimism or
   pessimism about an imminent outcome, can systematically affect the
   sequential consistency of consumer choices. Specifically, local optimism
   increases sequential choice consistency, whereas local pessimism
   increases sequential variety seeking. We test this foresight effect in
   two experimental paradigms, using both real and hypothetical consumer
   choices, across six studies. We first establish the basic effect of
   situational future outlook on sequential choice consistency (studies 1
   and 2). Then we provide evidence that differences in the preference for
   self-continuity underlie the effect (studies 3, 4, and 5). Last, we
   extend this effect to choices between broadly defined usual and novel
   consumer products (study 6). Across the studies, we rule out differences
   in mood, causal attribution, and perceived control as alternative
   explanations. These findings have theoretical implications on the
   relationship between future-oriented cognition and consumer behaviors,
   as well as broad managerial implications for when consumers will be more
   apt to repeat past purchases or more open to novel product adoption.

AB Through collective engagement in consumption rituals, group members
   reinforce intragroup relationships and the boundaries of the group. Yet,
   paradoxically, as intragroup diversity increases, dominant rituals
   deployed for this relational work, can run counter to the ideologically
   rooted identities of some members. Using a sociological lens, this
   article focuses on the complexities of not celebrating a dominant
   collective consumption ritual by focusing on people who do not celebrate
   Christmas in America. The qualitative data analysis finds that
   non-celebrants use a set of ritual strategies that are grounded in their
   conflicting goals of protecting their ideologically rooted identities
   but also doing relational work with celebrators. It shows how
   non-celebrants deploy consumptive elements of the dominant ritual as
   symbolic resources to enact each strategy, foregrounding or
   backgrounding the symbolic boundary between themselves and celebrators.
   Beyond the context, contributions to the study of symbolic boundaries,
   identity politics, and collective consumption rituals are discussed.

AB This research examines the notion that guilt, the negative emotion
   stemming from a failure to meet a self-held standard of behavior, leads
   to preferences for products enabling self-improvement, even in domains
   unrelated to the original source of the guilt. Examining consumer
   responses to real products, this research shows that such effects arise
   because guilt-by its focus on previous wrongdoings-activates a general
   desire to improve the self. This increase in desire for self-improvement
   products is only observed for choices involving the self (not others),
   is not observed in response to other negative emotions (e.g., shame,
   embarrassment, sadness, or envy), and is mitigated when people hold the
   belief that the self is nonmalleable. Building on past work that focuses
   on how guilt often leads to the motivation to alleviate feelings of
   guilt either directly or indirectly, the current research demonstrates
   an additional, novel downstream consequence of guilt, showing that only
   guilt has the unique motivational consequence of activating a general
   desire to improve the self, which subsequently spills into other domains
   and spurs self-improving product choices. These findings are discussed
   in light of their implications for research on the distinct motivational
   consequences of specific emotions and on consumer well-being.

AB Prior research indicates that a stimulus can reinforce an action if the

   information. The current research finds that if a stimulus is perceived
   as a reaction to an action, it can reinforce the action even if the
   stimulus is a priori nonpositive and noninformative. Mere reactions are
   reinforcing. Specifically, eight experiments, including a field
   experiment, demonstrate that individuals are more likely to repeat an
   action (e.g., insertingmoney in a donation box or typing a message in a
   textbox) if the action is followed by a stimulus (e.g., the emission of
   a sound or the flash of an image) than if it is not, even if the
   stimulus is a priori negative (e.g., an annoying sound or an aversive
   image) and carries no useful information. Moreover, the effect just
   described will occur only if the stimulus is contingent on (immediately
   follows) the action and perceived as a reaction to the action. Finally,
   by serving as a reaction, an a priori nonpositive stimulus can become
   positive. The present work yields theoretical implications for
   stimulus-response relationships and practical implications for designs

AB Although parents often try not to favor one child, we examine whether
   specific environmental factors might bias parents to favor children of
   one sex over the other. This research draws on theory in evolutionary
   biology suggesting that investment in female versus male offspring
   depends on resource availability. Applying this to consumers, a series
   of experiments show that poor economic conditions favor resource
   allocations to daughters over sons. For example, poor conditions led
   people to bequeath more assets to girls in their will, and to choose
   girls to receive a US Treasury bond and a beneficial extracurricular
   activity. It is proposed that this happens because spending on children
   represents a reproductive investment, and that boys' and girls' relative
   reproductive value varies with economic conditions. Supporting this
   account, perceptions of which child will have more children
   statistically mediates the effect of economic conditions on preferences
   for girls. Consequently, the effect is strengthened as a child
   approaches reproductive age, and it is moderated by individual
   differences (risk aversion and monogamy) directly related to our
   theoretical model. This research contributes to the consumer behavior
   literature by revealing how, why, and when environmental factors
   influence spending on girls versus boys.

AB Prior literature has proposed two process explanations for the positive
   effect of source similarity (i.e., similarity between adviser and advice
   taker) on persuasion. One explanation is that similar others are
   perceived to have preferences that are correlated with one's own, and
   this makes their advice more diagnostic. The other is that similar
   others are liked more so people follow their advice to maintain
   connectedness with them. We propose a more general explanation that
   incorporates the advice taker's processing goals. To process any advice,
   advice takers activate a mentalizing goal, which is to understand the
   adviser's mental states. Similarity creates a perception of such an
   understanding and induces a feeling of certainty (i.e., a feeling of
   knowing) that validates the advice as a decision input and increases
   persuasion. A mentalizing explanation accounts for the effect even when
   similarity cannot lead to perceptions of correlated preferences or to
   interpersonal liking. Four studies show that the effect attenuates if
   advice takers are less likely to mentalize, are already primed to feel
   certain, or misattribute their feeling of certainty to a source other
   than the advice. Furthermore, the feeling of certainty emanating from
   similarity even influences decisions unrelated to the advice.

AB When social and economic conditions change dramatically, status
   hierarchies in place for hundreds of years can crumble as marketization
   destabilizes once rigid boundaries. This study examines such changes in
   symbolic power through an ethnographic study of a village in North
   India. Marketization and accompanying privatization do not create an
   independent sphere where only money matters, but due to a mix of new
   socioeconomic motives, they produce new social obligations, contests,
   and solidarities. These findings call into question the emphasis in
   consumer research on top-down class emulation as an essential
   characteristic of status hierarchies. This study offers insights into
   sharing as a means of enacting and reshaping symbolic power within a
   status hierarchy. A new order based on markets and consumption is
   disrupting the old order based on caste. As the old moral order
   dissolves, so do the old status hierarchies, obligations, dispositions,
   and norms of sharing that held the village together for centuries. In
   the microcosm of these gains and losses, we may see something of the
   broader social and economic changes taking place throughout India and
   other industrializing countries.

AB Prior research has demonstrated that while people experience pride after
   an accomplishment, its experience can both encourage and discourage
   subsequent regulatory behavior. The current research shows that this
   seemingly contradictory influence can be accounted for by considering
   the information about the event that generated the pride (i.e.,
   appraisal information) and whether or not a self-regulatory goal is
   active. In the absence of a self-regulatory goal, appraisal information
   concerning the locus of control (e.g., "I contributed to this
   achievement; it was not luck") can be used to make positive inferences
   about one's self-concept that reinforce further self-regulation. In the
   presence of a self-regulatory goal, appraisal information concerning
   personal agency (e.g., "This was my achievement, not someone else's
   achievement") can be used to make positive inferences about one's
   progress toward self-regulation that, in turn, licenses indulgence. Thus
   appraisal information and the presence of self-regulatory goals is
   critical to how a self-conscious emotion like pride influences
   subsequent behavior. Implications and potential extensions in the areas
   of self-conscious emotions, goals, and self-regulation are discussed.

AB Attractive service providers are often assumed to elicit favorable
   consumer reactions and to increase purchase intentions. However, this
   may not always be true. A pilot study and five field and laboratory
   experiments show that when a self-presentation concern is made salient,
   consumers react less positively to highly attractive providers than to
   less attractive ones. This concern can be influenced by chronic social
   anxiety or can be aroused by unrelated experiences that consumers have
   before being exposed to the service interactions. In addition, it can be
   activated by the type of product being sold, that is, a product that is
   likely to cause embarrassment. Thus the attractiveness of a service
   provider can have either positive or negative effects on consumers'
   reactions to a consumption experience and their consequent purchase
   intentions, depending on the type of product under consideration. These
   effects occur when the service provider is both of the opposite sex and
   the same sex. However, self-presentation concerns when an opposite-sex
   provider is attractive are driven by sexual motives, whereas these
   self-presentation concerns when a same-sex target is attractive are
   stimulated by social comparison processes.

AB Emotion and rationality are fundamental elements of human life. They are
   abstract concepts, often difficult to define and grasp. Thus throughout
   the history of Western society, the head and the heart, concrete and
   identifiable elements, have been used as symbols of rationality and
   emotion. Drawing on the conceptual metaphor framework, we propose that
   people understand the abstract concepts of rationality and emotion using
   knowledge of a more concrete concept-the vertical difference between the
   head and heart. In six studies, we show a deep-seated conceptual
   metaphorical relationship linking rationality with "up" or "higher" and
   emotion with "down" or "lower." We show that the association between
   verticality and rationality/emotion affects how consumers perceive
   information and thereby has downstream consequences on attitudes and
   preferences. We find the association to be most influential when
   consumers are unaware of it and when it applies to an unfamiliar
   stimulus. Because all visual formats-from the printed page to screens on
   a television, computer, or smartphone-entail a vertical placement, this
   association has important managerial implications. Our studies implement
   multiple methodologies and technologies and use manipulations of logos,
   websites, food advertisements, and political slogans.

AB Decision making often entails conflict. In many situations, the symptoms
   of such decisional conflict are conspicuous. This article explores an
   important and unexamined question: How does observing someone else
   experiencing decisional conflict impact our own preferences? The authors
   show that observing others' emotional conflict and agony over an
   impending decision makes the observer's preferences converge to those of
   the conflicted actor (i.e., choose similarly). Thus this article
   contributes to the social influence literature by demonstrating that
   observers' preferences are not only influenced by an actor's ultimate
   choice, but also by the process leading to this choice. For example, in
   one experiment, participants' real monetary donations to one of two
   charities converged to those of a paid confederate who agonized over the
   decision. Six studies demonstrate this effect and show that it is
   triggered by empathy and a greater sense of shared identity with the
   conflicted actor. Accordingly, the studies show the effect is more
   pronounced for individuals with a greater tendency to empathize with
   others, and that convergence occurs only if participants deem the
   actor's conflict warranted given the decision at hand. The authors also
   demonstrate important implications of this effect in contexts of group
   decision making.

AB The marketplace affords consumers various modalities to express their
   preferences (e.g., by pressing a button on a vending machine or making
   an oral request at a restaurant). In this article, we compare speaking
   to manual preference expression modalities (button-pressing, writing,
   and taking) and study their effect on self-control dilemmas. Based on
   studies of the Stroop task and on neuroscientific evidence, we predict
   that speaking is less likely than motor movement to evoke self-control.
   Our prediction relies on the observation that different expression
   modalities activate different regions of the anterior cingulate cortex
   and hence may influence the extent to which emotions rather than
   cognitions determine an individual's decision. In six studies conducted
   both in the lab and the field, we show that speaking prompts more
   indulgent choice than manual modalities (studies 1a, 1b, 2, 3, and 4)
   but not when individuals speak in a foreign language (study 5).

AB While past research has suggested that consumers have fundamentally
   different responses to thinking about money versus time, the current
   work clarifies an important nuance in terms of how consumers construe
   these two resources. We demonstrate that, in the domain of charitable
   giving, money is construed relatively more concretely, whereas time is
   construed relatively more abstractly. This difference in the construal
   of these two resources has implications for how appeals for charitable
   contributions or money versus time should be framed. When the construal
   level at which the consumer considers the cause is aligned (misaligned)
   with the construal level of the resource being requested, contribution
   intentions and behaviors increase (decrease). In addition, the
   moderating role of resource abundance is examined. In particular, when
   money is considered abundant (vs. nonabundant), consumers no longer
   exhibit more concrete thoughts in response to money compared to time.
   Finally, when the donation request makes consumers think of money in a
   more abundant manner, monetary donations can be successfully motivated
   with a more abstract call for charitable support. The theoretical and
   practical implications for marketers and charitable organizations are
   discussed.

AB Repeated consumption of products and experiences leads to a reduction in
   enjoyment over time, a phenomenon that is commonly referred to as
   "satiation." Three studies show that consumers satiate more slowly to
   products that are consistent with a currently active identity. Because
   satiation is a natural human response when consuming a product
   repeatedly, all consumers are likely to feel the pull downward on their
   product enjoyment over time. This drop in enjoyment produces dissonance
   in consumers with an activated identity because reduced enjoyment with
   identity-consistent products conflicts with their identity. Resisting
   this drop results in lowered levels of satiation, and these satiation
   differences are even reflected in subsequent consumption behavior. These
   results have theoretical implications both for the nascent research area
   of satiation in consumer behavior and for developing a fuller sense of
   the relationship between consumer identity and consumption.

AB This article emphasizes the role of categorization in mental accounting
   and proposes that once a mental account is established, purchases that
   are highly congruent with the purpose of the mental account (i.e.,
   typical category members) will be more preferred in selection decisions
   compared to purchases that are less congruent (i.e., atypical category
   members). This hypothesis is tested in the context of gift cards. Six
   studies find that people shopping with a retailer-specific gift card-and
   so, the authors argue, possessing a retailer-specific mental
   account-express an increased preference for products more typical of the
   retailer compared to those shopping with more fungible currency. This
   pattern is found to occur for both well-known retailers, where people
   already possess product-typicality knowledge, and fictional retailers,
   where product-typicality cues are provided. An alternative account based
   on semantic priming is not supported by these data. These results both
   broaden the contemporary understanding of how mental accounting
   influences preferences and provide retailers deeper insight into their
   customers' decision processes.

AB Consumers often encounter reminders of resource scarcity. However,
   relatively little is known about the psychological processes that such
   reminders instantiate. In this article, we posit that reminders of
   resource scarcity activate a competitive orientation, which guides
   consumers' decision making towards advancing their own welfare. Further,
   we reveal that this tendency can manifest in behaviors that appear
   selfish, but also in behaviors that appear generous, in conditions where
   generosity allows for personal gains. The current research thus offers a
   more nuanced understanding of why resource scarcity may promote
   behaviors that appear either selfish or generous in different contexts,
   and provides one way to reconcile seemingly conflicting prior findings.

   leads to a preference for a self-benefiting package when this package
   also offers greater total benefit to the self-other collective (studies
   1 and 2). We propose that a friendly intention (i.e., concern for the
   total benefit) underlies the friendly taking effect; therefore, people
   both take more from and give more to a close (vs. distant) other when
   doing so offers greater benefits in total (study 3), and people are
   cognitively tuned in to (e.g., acquire, remember) information about the
   total benefit more when choosing a package for themselves and a close

   the total benefit mediates the impact of closeness on people's

AB Five experiments document that the mere circularity and angularity of a
   brand logo is powerful enough to affect perceptions of the attributes of
   a product or company. It is theorized and shown that circular-versus
   angular-logo shapes activate softness and hardness associations,
   respectively, and these concepts subsequently influence product/ company
   attribute judgments through a resource-demanding imagery-generation
   process that utilizes the visuospatial sketchpad component of working
   memory. There are no logo shape effects on attribute judgments when the
   visuospatial sketchpad component of working memory is constrained by
   irrelevant visual imagery, when people have a lower disposition to
   generate imagery when processing product information, and when the
   headline of the ad highlights a product attribute that differs from the
   inference drawn from the logo shape. Further, there are shape effects
   even when the shape is incidentally exposed beforehand using a priming
   technique rather than being a part of the logo itself, demonstrating the
   generalizability of our findings. When taken together, the results have
   implications for working memory, consumer imagery, and visual marketing.

AB The concept of brand community has been used to understand how consumers
   create value around brands online. Recently consumer researchers have
   begun to debate the relevance of this concept for understanding
   brand-related communication on social media. Based on a data set of 8949
   tweets about Louis Vuitton gathered on Italian Twitter in 2013, this
   article addresses these discussions by developing the alternative
   concept of brand publics that differ from brand communities in three
   important ways. First, brand publics are social formations that are not
   based on interaction but on a continuous focus of interest and
   mediation. Second, participation in brand publics is not structured by
   discussion or deliberation but by individual or collective affect.
   Third, in brand publics consumers do not develop a collective identity
   around the focal brand; rather the brand is valuable as a medium that
   can offer publicity to a multitude of diverse situations of identity.
   The conclusion suggests that brand publics might be part of a social
   media-based consumer culture where publicity rather than identity has
   become a core value.

   purchases are nonessential and purchase volume is small. Based on the
   theory of purchase value (Grewal, Monroe, and Krishnan 1998; Thaler
   1983), we argue that offering a low price discount for nonessential
   purchases decreases perceived transaction value that in turn lowers
   consumers' purchase propensity. However, this boomerang effect reverses
   when purchase volume is larger or when the purchase is essential. We
   demonstrate this effect with secondary scanner panel data sets (with six
   different product categories) and in five laboratory experiments (with

AB Consumers demonstrate a robust preference for items with earlier serial
   numbers (e.g., No. 3/100) over otherwise identical items with later
   serial numbers (e.g., No. 97/100) in a limited edition set. This
   preference arises from the perception that items with earlier serial
   numbers are temporally closer to the origin (e.g., the designer or
   artist who produced it). In turn, beliefs in contagion (the notion that
   objects may acquire a special essence from their past) lead consumers to
   view these items as possessing more of a valued essence. Using an
   archival data set and five lab experiments, the authors find the
   preference for items with earlier serial numbers holds across multiple
   consumer domains including recorded music, art, and apparel. Further,
   this preference appears to be independent from inferences about the
   quality of the item, salience of the number, or beliefs about market
   value. Finally, when serial numbers no longer reflect beliefs about
   proximity to the origin, the preference for items with earlier serial
   numbers is attenuated. The authors conclude by demonstrating boundary
   conditions of this preference in the context of common marketing
   practices.

AB Does the way that individuals pay for a good or service influence the
   amount of connection they feel after the purchase has occurred?
   Employing a multi-method approach across four studies, individuals who
   pay using a relatively more painful form of payment (e.g., cash or
   check) increase their post-transaction connection to the product they
   purchased and/or the organization their purchase supports in comparison
   to those who pay with less painful forms of payment (e.g., debit or
   credit card). Specifically, individuals who pay with more painful forms
   of payment increase their emotional attachment to a product, decrease
   their commitment to nonchosen alternatives, are more likely to publicly
   signal their commitment to an organization, and are more likely to make
   a repeat transaction. Moreover, the form of payment influences
   post-transaction connection even when the objective monetary cost
   remains constant and when the psychological cost is indirect (i.e.,
   donating someone else's money). Increasing the psychological pain of
   payment appears to have beneficial consequences with respect to
   increasing downstream product and brand connection.

AB Many nutrition labeling studies only consider how consumers process
   health information about a single food product (i.e., in a
   noncomparative processing context). However, consumers also often
   comparatively evaluate many different food products at once in more
   complex shopping environments (i.e., in comparative processing
   contexts). Directly addressing these important differences, the results
   of two online studies and two retail laboratory studies demonstrate that
   the effects of different types of front-of-package nutrition cues
   (objective vs. evaluative) vary across consumers' processing contexts
   (comparative vs. noncomparative). When consumers evaluate a single food
   item in a noncomparative context, objective nutrition cues that offer
   specific quantitative information lead to higher evaluations and
   intentions to purchase healthier products than do evaluative nutrition
   cues (which provide interpretive information about a product's overall
   healthfulness and/or nutrients). However, these effects are reversed
   when consumers evaluate multiple food items simultaneously in a
   comparative context, such that evaluative cues have a more positive
   impact on evaluations and purchase intentions of healthier products. The
   authors integrate processing fluency and resource matching theoretical
   frameworks to explain why evaluative (objective) front-of-package cues
   are more influential in comparative (noncomparative) processing
   contexts. Implications for consumer health, the food and retail grocery
   industries, and public policy are offered.

AB This research examines how a general sense of resource availability
   influences consumers' product use creativity. The authors propose and
   demonstrate that the salience of resource scarcity versus abundance
   enhances the novelty of product use solutions in independent consumption
   environments. An investigation of the underlying process finds that
   scarcity salience activates a constraint mindset that persists and
   manifests itself through reduced functional fixedness in subsequent
   product usage contexts (i.e., makes consumers think beyond the
   traditional functionality of a given product), consequently enhancing
   product use creativity. This work advances the extant creativity
   literature, currently limited to examining the effects of
   context-specific resource constraints, by establishing a
   context-independent linkage between resource availability and product
   use creativity. Furthermore, this research contributes to the scarcity
   literature, which has primarily focused on investigating the quantity
   and frequency of consumption, by examining the impact of scarcity on the
   quality of consumption solutions.

AB External cues regularly override physiological cues in food consumption
   resulting in mindless eating. In a series of experiments, this study
   shows that mindfulness, an enhanced attention state, improves consumers'
   reliance on physiological cues across consumption episodes. Consumers
   who are chronically high in mindfulness (study 1) or who receive a short
   mindfulness training that focuses attention on the body (study 2)
   compensate more for previous food intake in their subsequent
   consumption. Moreover, after a mindful body meditation, consumers are
   more aware of physiological cues that develop after consumption (study
   3), rather than of the amount they have previously eaten (study 4).
   Furthermore, we argue and show that the focus of mindfulness matters:
   mindfulness trainings that focus attention on the environment or on the
   body similarly elicit state mindfulness, but only mindful attention with
   a focus on the body stimulates compensation for previous consumption and
   awareness of satiety cues. Finally, practicing mindfulness and
   specifically paying mindful attention to body sensations is related to a
   more constant body weight in a sample of the general population (study
   5).

   extent to which consumers trust them as indicators of objective quality.
   Analyses of a data set covering 1272 products across 120 vertically
   differentiated product categories reveal that average user ratings (1)
   lack convergence with Consumer Reports scores, the most commonly used
   measure of objective quality in the consumer behavior literature, (2)
   are often based on insufficient sample sizes which limits their
   informativeness, (3) do not predict resale prices in the used-product
   marketplace, and (4) are higher for more expensive products and premium
   brands, controlling for Consumer Reports scores. However, when forming
   quality inferences and purchase intentions, consumers heavily weight the
   average rating compared to other cues for quality like price and the
   number of ratings. They also fail to moderate their reliance on the
   average user rating as a function of sample size sufficiency. Consumers'
   trust in the average user rating as a cue for objective quality appears
   to be based on an "illusion of validity."

AB Despite the prevalence of single-serve and multi-serve package formats
   in the pharmaceutical and functional food and beverage industries, prior
   research has yet to explore the effects of such package formats on
   consumers' perceptions of product efficacy. Building on the resource
   availability, product packaging, and psychological closure literature,
   the authors demonstrate across seven studies that when processing
   capacity is low, consuming a particular serving/dosage of a product from
   a smaller resource inventory (i.e., the entirety of a single-serve
   package) may subjectively feel more adequate than consuming the same
   amount from a larger resource inventory (i.e., a multi-serve package,
   namely one in which additional servings/doses remain after consumption).
   Results indicate that differences in felt consumption closure underlie
   perceptions of product adequacy. Importantly, perceived product adequacy
   is shown to affect consumers' actual product efficacy experiences (i.e.,
   task performance), expectancies, and judgments. The implications of this
   research for marketers, consumers, and the public health community are

AB Pursuing personal goals for delayed rewards (e.g., exercising to improve
   health) often provides consumers with immediate rewards (e.g., a fun
   workout) in addition to the delayed rewards they receive. With regard to
   health and academic goals, we find that attending to the immediate
   rewards of health and academic activities increases persistence in these
   activities to a greater extent than attending to delayed rewards, even
   though these activities are selected for the delayed rewards they
   provide. Specifically, bringing immediate rewards into activity
   choice-for example, having participants choose the most enjoyable rather
   than the most useful exercise or the tastier rather than healthier bag
   of carrots-increases persistence and consumption. Similarly, adding
   external immediate rewards to activity pursuit-for example, playing
   music in a high school classroom-increases persistence. Across these
   studies, immediate rewards are stronger predictors of activity
   persistence than delayed rewards. This research suggests that marketers
   and consumers can harness immediate rewards to increase persistence in
   long-term goals.

AB This article examines perceptions of low-income consumers receiving
   government assistance and the choices they make, showing that this group
   is viewed differently than those with more resources, even when making
   identical choices. A series of five experiments reveal that ethical
   purchases polarize moral judgments: whereas individuals receiving
   government assistance are perceived as less moral when choosing ethical
   (vs. conventional) products, income earners, particularly high-income
   individuals, are perceived as more moral for making the identical
   choice. Price is a central component of this effect because equating the
   cost of ethical and conventional goods provides those receiving
   government assistance some protection against harsh moral judgments when
   choosing ethically. Moreover, earning one's income drives perceptions of
   deservingness, or the right to spend as one desires. Those who receive
   assistance via taxpayer dollars are under greater scrutiny (frequently
   resulting in harsher moral judgments) by others. In addition to
   influencing perceptions of individual consumers, the results demonstrate
   that such attributions extend to groups who make ethical choices on
   others' behalf, and that these attributions have real monetary
   consequences for nonprofit organizations.

   This work documents how creative control, the extent to which the same

   impacts which products are singled out for recognition but does not play
   a comparable role in determining what consumers like and thus purchase.
   Using real-world data, study 1 demonstrates how songs by performers who
   write their own material are more likely to garner acclaim but do not
   excel in terms of sales. Study 2 replicates the pattern of results in
   the lab. Study 3 reproduces the effect in a new domain (beer) using
   different measures of recognition. Study 4 shows creative authenticity,
   the extent to which a product is considered a faithful execution of its
   creator's vision, mediates the effect of creative control on
   recognition. Further, study 4 highlights the contingent role played by
   the perceived trustworthiness of the creator on this relationship.
   Finally, study 5 presents a boundary condition such that when consumers
   do not feel confident in their appraisals of an experience, creative
   control's impact on recognition and liking runs in parallel.

AB Consumers frequently evaluate their own traits before making consumption
   decisions (e.g., "Am I thin enough for skinny jeans?"). The outcome of
   these self-evaluations depends on the standard consumers use and on
   whether they evaluate "self" in assimilation or contrast to that
   standard. Previous self-judgment research has focused on self-standards
   that arise from social aspects of the environment including people and
   groups. We propose that self-judgment is sometimes made relative to
   other standards that originate from different aspects of the
   environment, namely material objects, including products and goods. Two
   experiments demonstrate that consumers classify products they own as
   "self" and products they do not own as "not-self." Consequently,
   consumers judge their own physical and personal traits (e.g., height,
   sincerity) in assimilation to traits of products they own, but in
   contrast to traits of products they do not own, even following imposed
   ownership, when a person acquires an object they may not have chosen
   themselves. Extending this paradigm, experiment 3 shows that simply
   wearing products can evoke ephemeral felt ownership, leading to
   consumers taking on product traits. We discuss implications for modern
   consumers, who often acquire objects inadvertently through gifts and are
   frequently exposed to products they do not own through advertisements.

   Five field and laboratory studies demonstrate that this performance

   whereas this effect emerges only when there is an expectation that the
   performance branded product affects outcomes, consumers attribute gains
   to themselves. The performance brand placebo is due to a lowering of
   task-induced anxiety, driven by heightened state self-esteem. Several
   theoretically relevant boundaries are revealed. Stress mindset moderates
   the effect, strengthening with the belief that stress is debilitating
   and weakening (to the point of reversal) with the belief that stress is
   enhancing. Moreover, those consumers lower in preexisting domain

   to more information about their behavior than ever before. The appeal of
   personal quantification seems clear. By better understanding our
   behavior, we can make the necessary changes to live happier, healthier
   lives. But might the new tools people are using-quantifying life-rob
   them of some of the benefits of engaging in those activities? Six
   experiments demonstrate that while measurement increases how much of an
   activity people do (e.g., walk or read more), it can simultaneously
   reduce how much people enjoy those activities. This occurs because
   measurement can undermine intrinsic motivation. By drawing attention to
   output, measurement can make enjoyable activities feel more like work,
   which reduces their enjoyment. As a result, measurement can decrease
   continued engagement in the activity and subjective well-being. Even in
   the absence of explicit external incentives, measurement itself can thus
   have similar effects. The findings have implications for measurement's
   use, as well as for the psychology of external incentives and intrinsic
   motivation.

AB Previous research has examined how people resolve self-control dilemmas
   in which goal-congruent and goal-incongruent choices are both present.
   In the present research, however, the participants were asked to choose
   between two hedonically appealing options that were equally detrimental
   to a health goal. Six experiments show that activating a health goal
   decreases the choice share of the more salient, goal-incongruent option,
   leading the less salient alternative to be chosen instead. This effect
   occurs without appreciable cognitive deliberation and is evident even
   when the participants have the option of choosing nothing at all. The
   potential processes that underlie this effect are discussed.

AB People often share word of mouth with others, and such social sharing is
   an integral part of everyday life. But the content (e.g., stories, news,
   information) that people transmit can be acquired in different ways.
   Sometimes people find content themselves, and other times people receive
   content from others (e.g., via email or conversation). Might these
   different acquisition methods impact subsequent sharing, and if so, how?
   Six studies demonstrate that acquisition method can impact transmission
   through changing how content is processed. Compared to received content,
   people are more likely to associate found content with themselves, which
   decreases processing. Reduced processing, in turn, lowers sensitivity to
   diagnostic content characteristics (e.g., whether content is interesting
   or well written), which reduces these characteristics' impact on
   sharing. Thus while receivers are more likely to share interesting (than
   boring) content, the difference is attenuated (and in some cases,
   disappeared) among finders. These findings deepen insights into the
   psychological drivers of word of mouth and shed light on how contextual
   factors, content characteristics, and the self interact to drive social
   transmission.

AB Would laterally displaying a healthy item to the left versus right of an
   unhealthy item influence choice and consumption? The results of seven
   studies demonstrate that displaying healthy items to the left (vs.
   right) of unhealthy items enhances preference for the healthy options.
   In addition, consumption volume of a healthy item (visa-vis an unhealthy
   item) is higher when it is placed to the left (vs. right) of the
   unhealthy item. We propose that a " healthy-left, unhealthy-right" (vs.
   healthy-right, unhealthy-left) lateral display pattern is congruent with
   consumers' mental organization of food items varying in healthfulness,
   which enhances ease of processing and in turn enhances self-control,
   thereby leading to a relatively higher likelihood of choosing healthy
   options. While prior studies have examined the role of several factors
   in influencing choices between healthy and unhealthy options, the
   present research is the first to demonstrate the effects of lateral
   display positions of healthy/unhealthy options on choice and healthful
   consumption. The findings of our research have important implications
   for designing retail food displays and restaurant menus as well as for
   conducting research studies involving healthy and unhealthy food
   displays.

AB The present research investigates why, when, and how feelings of
   personal control influence the way consumers process product
   information. Four studies were conducted. The results show that under
   baseline conditions, consumers who believe they can control the
   environment (internal locus of control) show greater confidence in their
   emerging preference in a choice process and demonstrate higher levels of
   preference-supporting bias than consumers who believe the environment
   controls their fate (external locus of control). However, the opposite
   relationship between locus of control and confirmatory information
   processing occurs when a threat to personal control is encountered. When
   threatened, consumers with an internal (external) locus of control
   activate an accuracy (defense) goal that results in lower (higher)
   levels of confidence in their emerging preference and confirmatory
   information processing than consumers with an external (internal) locus
   of control. These findings are integrated within a general framework
   that accounts for the impact of personal control on information
   processing. The framework predicts and empirical evidence confirms that
   the alternative strategies adopted to process information at different
   levels of personal control affect both product choice and willingness to
   pay for a new product.

AB This study explores how heirlooms, usually regarded as objects of family
   identity and stability, can also become objects of evolving personal
   identities and change. Our approach is based on the role of materiality
   (as well as meanings) and multitemporality in heirloom consumption. The
   data generated through interviews, visual sources, and media documents
   reveal three rejuvenation processes that, given particular boundary
   conditions, renew heirlooms: uncovering, refreshing, and reconciliation.
   Our study also distinguishes three types of heirloom essence that can
   survive the heirloom's material and compositional transformations.
   Rejuvenation reintegrates the heirloom into the heir's life trajectory
   by imbuing it with a zeitgeist value and the heir's presence, helping
   the heir to better navigate her imaginaries of the past, present, and
   future. Beyond the ritualistic consumption or curation of heirlooms, our
   findings reveal a creative, playful, and proactive relation with
   heirlooms, evocative of craftwork. Moreover, the market, within
   particular boundaries, can help authenticate heirloom objects and
   facilitate their inalienability rather than necessarily destroying their
   authenticity. Our study has implications for the role of heirloom
   consumption in consumers' negotiations of continuity and change, the
   interaction of the symbolic and the material in heirlooms, and the
   inalienability- market relation.

AB Although self-enhancement has recently been established as a central
   motive for sharing word-of-mouth information, little is known about the
   impact of self-enhancing assertions (e.g., boasting) on persuasion. We
   theorize, and demonstrate in three studies, that although boasting is
   perceived negatively, such immodest self-presentations can either impede
   or enhance social perceptions and persuasion. The valence of the
   persuasion outcome depends heavily on trust cues that change the meaning
   of boasting to the word-of-mouth recipient. Boasting in the presence of
   low trust cues activates heightened vigilance (e.g., valenced thoughts)
   about the source's motives, leading to decreased persuasion. However,
   when given reason to trust the source specifically or people generally,
   boasting is readily accepted as a signal of source expertise, leading to
   increased persuasion. Implications for consumer decision making and
   firms seeking to manage consumer social influence are discussed.

AB Across four studies, the authors demonstrate that consumers intuitively
   link disconfirmation, specifically sensory disconfirmation (when touch
   disconfirms expectations by sight), to a brand's personality. Negative
   disconfirmation is often associated with negative posttrial evaluations.
   However, the authors find that when negative sensory disconfirmation is
   introduced by an exciting brand, the source of disconfirmation can
   sometimes be perceived positively. This occurs because consumers
   intuitively view disconfirmation as more authentic of an exciting
   personality. Similarly, despite the wealth of literature linking
   positive disconfirmation to positive posttrial evaluations, the authors
   find that sensory confirmation is more preferred for sincere brands
   because consumers intuitively view confirmation as more authentic of a
   sincere personality. The authors conclude by demonstrating the intuitive
   nature of this phenomenon by showing that the lay belief linking brand
   personality to disconfirmation does not activate in a context where
   sensory disconfirmation encourages a more deliberative assessment of the
   product.

AB The current research offers a new theoretical perspective on the
   relationship between power and persuasion. An agentic-communal model of
   power is presented that proposes power affects both the messages
   generated by communicators and the messages that persuade audiences.
   Compared to low-power states, highpower states produce a greater
   emphasis on information that conveys competence. As a consequence,
   high-power communicators generate messages with greater competence
   information, and high-power audiences are persuaded more by competence
   information. In contrast to high-power states, low-power states produce
   a greater emphasis on information that conveys warmth. As a result,
   lowpower communicators generate messages with greater warmth
   information, and low-power audiences are persuaded more by warmth
   information. Because of these two outcomes, a power-matching effect
   occurs between communicator and audience power: high-power communicators
   are more effective in persuading high-power audience members, whereas
   low-power communicators are more effective in persuading low-power
   audience members. Four experiments find support for these effects in
   oral and written contexts with three distinct manipulations of power.
   Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the persuasiveness of
   messages can be affected by the alignment between the psychological
   sense of power of the communicator and the audience.

AB Contemporary consumer behavior research largely conceptualizes
   post-decision evaluation processes in terms of decision confidence,
   anticipated regret and satisfaction, and decision and consumption
   satisfaction. The current research broadens this view, arguing that
   people additionally experience varying degrees of decision comfort that
   are distinct from other post-decision evaluations. The authors argue
   that comfort is a soft-positive emotion thus far unexamined in relation
   to decision processes and present nine studies that (1) develop and
   validate two scales to measure decision comfort, (2) demonstrate the
   discriminant validity of decision comfort relative to numerous other
   post-decision constructs, and (3) examine the unique downstream
   consequences of decision comfort. The results show that an individual
   may be quite comfortable with a decision despite being uncertain about
   the optimality and/or the anticipated consequences of that decision (e.
   g., satisfaction or regret). It is demonstrated that decision comfort
   responds to affect-relevant cues and tends to rely less on comparisons
   between the chosen and foregone options (i. e., it tends to be a less
   comparative evaluation). Decision comfort is also shown to account for a
   sizable proportion of consumers' overall decision evaluations and to
   have meaningful downstream consequences on marketing-relevant variables
   (e. g., choice commitment and the likelihood of recommending).

AB A low savings rate is a persistent social issue with significant present
   and future ramifications. As an alternative to conceptualizing saving
   money as goal-directed behavior, the present research examines the
   chronic tendencies of people to save money in a consistent and sustained
   manner through a personal saving orientation (PSO). Drawing upon
   theorizing on action control and research on forming and maintaining
   habits, the PSO emphasizes consistent, sustainable saving activities and
   incorporating them into one's lifestyle. In a set of nine studies, the
   PSO scale is developed and its nomological, test-retest, discriminant,
   and predictive validities are established. The results also show that
   the PSO moderates the relationship between consumers' financial
   knowledge and their accumulated savings. Additionally, low-PSO consumers
   are responsive to an intervention to help them save money. The PSO
   offers an effective method for understanding differences between
   consumers in their financial decision making and behaviors, and it can
   be used as a guide to encourage consistent and sustained saving
   practices.

AB "Behavioral targeting" is an Internet-based targeting strategy that
   delivers digital ads to individuals based on their online behavior
   (e.g., search, shopping). This research explores the unique ways in
   which consumers respond to ads using this type of targeting (vs. to ads
   that use more traditional forms of targeting), demonstrating that a
   behaviorally targeted ad can act as a social label even when it contains
   no explicit labeling information. Instead, when consumers recognize that
   the marketer has made an inference about their identity in order to
   serve them the ad, the ad itself functions as an implied social label.
   Across four studies, behaviorally targeted ads lead consumers to make
   adjustments to their self-perceptions to match the implied label; these
   self-perceptions then impact behavior including purchase intentions for
   the advertised product and other behaviors related to the implied label.
   Importantly, these effects only hold when the label is plausibly
   connected to consumers' prior behavior (i. e., when the targeting is at
   least moderately accurate).

   inform judgments of value: the amount of knowledge creation and the
   amount of knowledge appreciation. Implicit in our view is the idea that
   researchers should know how to create valuable knowledge and be able to
   anticipate how much stakeholders will appreciate that knowledge. In this
   tutorial, we discuss knowledge creation, knowledge appreciation, and a
   framework that jointly represents these two sources of value. We hope
   that this framework will encourage scholars to engage in research

AB Does variety increase happiness? Eight studies examine how the variety

   subsequent happiness. The studies demonstrate that whether variety
   increases or decreases happiness depends on the perceived duration of
   the time within which the activities occur. For longer time periods
   (like a day), variety does increase happiness. However, for shorter time
   periods (like an hour), variety instead decreases happiness. This
   reversal stems from people's sense of stimulation and productivity
   during that time. Whereas filling longer time periods with more varied
   activities makes the time feel more stimulating (which increases
   happiness), filling shorter time periods with more varied activities
   makes the time feel less productive (which decreases happiness). These
   effects are robust across actual and perceived variety, actual and
   perceived time duration, and multiple types of activities (work and
   leisure, selfselected and imposed, social and solo). Together the
   findings confirm that " variety is the spice of life"-but not of an

AB What drives consumers to invest repeated efforts to acquire rewards?
   This research shows that the temporal arrangement of effort investment
   and reward dispensation can affect people's motivation to earn more
   rewards. Two procedures for acquiring rewards are examined: a piecemeal
   procedure, whereby rewards are acquired gradually through repeated small
   efforts, and a lump-sum procedure, whereby a number of rewards are
   acquired all at once after a longer period of work. Holding constant the
   total quantity of acquired rewards and the effortreward exchange rate,
   the piecemeal procedure is more motivating than the lumpsum procedure
   (experiment 1) because the former results in a greater sense of
   achievement (experiment 2). If the sense of achievement is curtailed by
   preventing people from accumulating the rewards they have earned
   (experiment 3), by providing rewards that are different from the
   already-earned rewards (experiment 4), or by breaking the association
   between effort and rewards (experiment 5), the piecemeal procedure is no
   more motivating than the lump-sum procedure. The effect is also
   diminished when consumers are satiated with the rewards (experiment 6).
   Taken together, these experiments provide converging evidence that
   acquiring rewards piece by piece motivates people to continue earning
   them.

AB It has been known for some time that consumers' identities influence
   purchasing decisions and people form strong identity connections, or
   "links," with products and brands. However, research has yet to
   determine whether identity-linked products are differentially treated at
   disposal in comparison to products that are not identity linked. Across
   seven studies, the current research shows that when an everyday product
   (e.g., paper, cups, aluminum cans) is linked to a consumer's identity,
   it is less likely to be trashed and more likely to be recycled. Further,
   the tendency to recycle an identity-linked product increases with the
   strength and positivity of the connection between the consumer and
   product (or brand). Finally, the disposal behavior can be explained by
   consumers' motivation to avoid trashing a product that is linked to the
   self because it is viewed as an identity threat. In sum, consumers will
   be more likely to recycle (rather than trash) a product if the product
   is linked to a consumer's identity. This occurs because placing an
   identity-linked product in the trash is symbolically similar to trashing
   a part of the self, a situation consumers are motivated to avoid.

AB This research proposes the relationship between power distance belief
   (PDB) and status consumption is moderated by the salience of others and
   their associated status (others' status). When others' status is not
   superior (similar or inferior), high-PDB consumers are more likely to
   engage in status consumption than lowPDB consumers. However, when
   others' status is superior, high-PDB consumers are less likely to engage
   in status consumption. Both signaling effectiveness and need for status
   underlie the effect of PDB on status consumption. Need for status
   mediates the effect of PDB only when others' status is not superior,
   whereas signaling effectiveness mediates the effect of PDB on status
   consumption when others' status is superior, similar, or inferior.
   Compared to low-PDB consumers, high-PDB consumers perceive greater
   signaling effectiveness when others' status is inferior or similar, but
   they perceive less signaling effectiveness, and therefore engage in less
   status consumption, when others' status is superior. When status goods
   are consumed in private, and therefore not effective at signaling
   status, the interaction of others' status and PDB is mitigated. This
   research articulates the nuanced effect of PDB on status consumption
   depending on others' status as well as the multiple mechanisms
   underlying status consumption.

   assistants and their subsequent influence on consumers' game enjoyment.
   To fill this gap, the current study examined the effect of
   anthropomorphic representations of computerized helpers in computer
   games on game enjoyment. In the current research, consumers enjoyed a
   computer game less when they received assistance from a computerized
   helper imbued with humanlike features than from a helper construed as a
   mindless entity. We offer a novel mechanism that the presence of an
   anthropomorphized helper can undermine individuals' perceived autonomy
   during a computer game. Across six experiments, we show that the
   presence of an anthropomorphized helper reduced game enjoyment across
   three different games. By measuring participants' perceived autonomy
   (study 1) and employing moderators such as importance of autonomy
   (studies 2, 3, and 4), we also provide evidence that the reduced feeling
   of autonomy serves as the mechanism underlying the backfiring effect.
   Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of anthropomorphism on game
   enjoyment can be extended to other game-related outcomes, such as
   individuals' motivation to persist in the game (studies 4 and 5).

AB Marketing communications often contain numerical information that can be
   expressed more or less precisely. Earlier research has identified a
   number of ways in which consumers respond differently to precise versus
   round numbers. The current research attempts to enrich this literature
   by introducing a new theoretical perspective. Drawing on recent findings
   in the numerical cognition literature, this work proposes that
   individuals project gendered meanings to precise versus round numbers,
   with precise numbers seen as more masculine relative to round ones.
   Seven studies provided convergent evidence for this proposition and
   demonstrated its marketing implications. Studies 1, 2, and 3, employing
   various approaches, show that participants do subscribe to this
   precision-masculinity intuition, at both implicit and explicit levels.
   Study 4 suppresses this effect by priming participants with examples
   where precision is connected to femininity. Building on these findings,
   subsequent studies demonstrate that marketing communications using
   precise (round) numbers lead to more favorable evaluations when the
   products or attributes are positioned as masculine (feminine).

AB The role of cultural factors in influencing price perceptions is not
   understood well in the literature. The present research seeks to fill
   this gap by examining the link between power distance belief-the
   acceptance and endorsement of power disparities in society-and the
   tendency to use the price of a product to judge its quality, the
   underlying processes, and boundary conditions. Three studies show that
   consumers high (vs. low) in power distance belief have a greater
   tendency to use price to judge quality because they have a greater need
   for structure, which makes them more likely to discriminate between
   brands and rank them based on price. The relationships held regardless
   of whether the price-to-quality relation was assessed using a standard
   self-report scale or via actual product judgments, and whether power
   distance belief was measured or manipulated. The effect was found to be
   independent of self-construal, holistic thinking, and risk aversion, was
   mediated by a need for structure, and disappeared when the tendency to
   order was facilitated (impeded) by making price more (less) salient.
   Theoretical implications are discussed.

AB This research examines the implications of consumers' belief in
   karma-the belief that the universe bestows rewards for doing right and
   exacts punishments for doing wrong-in the context of prosocial behavior.
   Although intuitively, believing in karma should result in greater
   intentions to do right by supporting a charity, karmic beliefs are found
   to facilitate prosocial behavior only in contexts not associated with
   selfgains. A series of experiments shows that those with strong (vs.
   weak) beliefs in karma actually respond less favorably to charitable
   appeals that rely on common marketing tools meant to enhance consumer
   responses but that also cue self-gains by offering incentives or by
   highlighting self-benefits. However, these effects are only obtained for
   donations of time, which represent a means to enhance social
   connections, but not for donations of money. Consistent with the
   proposition that prosocial behaviors motivated by self-gains do not
   engender karmic rewards, lower intentions to do right among those with
   strong karmic beliefs are driven by a shift from other-focused to
   self-focused attention following appeals that cue self-gains, as
   compared to appeals that do not. Results imply that marketers need to
   take into account consumers' karmic beliefs when seeking to incentivize
   prosocial behavior.

AB Individual decision makers show robust tendencies toward choosing
   compromise options. But what happens when consumers make choices with
   someone else? This article examines the choice of compromise options in
   joint dyadic decisions. Findings reveal that preferences for compromise
   alternatives replicate in mixedgender and female-female dyads as among
   individuals but are attenuated when two males make a choice together.
   Moreover, when two males make joint choices, their tendency to choose
   the compromise alternative decreases not only relative to other types of
   pairs but also to male and female individual decision makers. Evidence
   is presented that this happens because male-male dyadic contexts cue
   gender dichotomization, behavior that is consistent with masculine but
   not feminine gender norms. Because the extremity in decision making is
   maximally consistent with masculine but not feminine gender role norms,
   male-male dyads exhibit lower preferences for compromise options.
   However, if men have an opportunity to signal masculinity to one another
   prior to making joint compromise choices, male-male dyads prefer
   compromise options at proportions no different from female-female dyads.
   This work brings together the judgment and decisionmaking literature
   with insights from the social psychology literature, identifying a case
   when gender role norms have profound influences on classic judgment and
   decision-making effects.

AB Five experiments examine the nature of different coping strategies and
   their subsequent effects on the effectiveness of health messages. We
   theorize that the two strategies of problem-focused versus
   emotion-focused coping are systematically associated with distinct
   construal levels (lower vs. higher), and thus messages cast at different
   levels of construal are differentially effective when a particular
   coping strategy is being activated. Specifically, we demonstrate that
   consumers primed with problem-focused strategies are more persuaded by
   messages presented at lower levels of construal, whereas consumers
   primed with emotionfocused strategies are more persuaded by messages
   presented at higher levels of construal. In addition, we posit that
   matching with each different type of coping strategy (problem-focused
   vs. emotion-focused coping) is driven by distinct types of efficacy
   processes. In particular, we demonstrate that the effects of a match
   with problem-focused coping are driven by self-efficacy, and the effects
   of a match with emotion-focused coping are driven by response efficacy.
   These findings make a significant contribution by building bridges
   between three theoretical traditions: coping, construal level, and
   efficacy in the context of health messaging.

AB Nostalgia, which is induced by reminiscing about a positive past
   experience, can counteract loneliness and promote prosocial behavior.
   However, the process of recalling and thinking about a nostalgic
   experience can have quite different effects. Because nostalgic
   experiences rarely reoccur, people are motivated to savor them by
   prolonging the time they reminisce about them. The tendency to savor
   these experiences generalizes to situations that participants encounter
   later, thus increasing consumer patience. For this effect to emerge,
   however, consumers must be aware that waiting will be beneficial to the
   attainment of a benefit. Moreover, the relationship between nostalgia
   and consumer patience is diminished when people perceive a nostalgic
   experience to be repeatable or when they intensify their memory of the
   experience rather than prolonging it. Eight studies confirmed these
   effects and processes that underlie them.

AB Hedonic escalation is the increased liking of each additional bite of a
   palatable food. Hedonic escalation is more likely to occur when (1) a
   palatable food consists of a complex combination of flavors, and (2) a
   person is motivated to taste additional flavors on each successive bite.
   Consequently, hedonic escalation is more prevalent when people can
   identify more flavors (pilot study), attend to additional flavors on
   each taste trial (study 1), have an opportunity to identify an
   additional flavor on each taste trial (study 2), and isolate distinct
   flavors on each taste trial (study 3). Changes in hedonic escalation can
   be attributed to increased sensitization to flavors as opposed to
   changes in the rate of habituation (study 4). Hedonic escalation can
   also increase consumption (study 5) and influence food choices (study
   6). Collectively, these studies show that hedonic escalation is enabled
   by the opportunity to identify an additional source of hedonic
   experience on each successive taste of a food.

AB Even though 80% of a shopper's time in the store is spent moving from
   place to place, little is known about managing the pace of in-store
   traffic flow. Based on the store atmospherics literature, this article
   introduces interventions to optimize the pace of locomotion. A series of
   lab and field experiments demonstrates that changes in flooring affect
   customers' walking speed. The number, the nature, and the relative
   salience of progress markers along a walking path toward a physical
   location communicate goal progress and thus the motivation to reach a
   particular destination. Consistent with a goal gradient account,
   customers walk faster when fewer progress markers are placed along the
   walking path to the goal. The effect of the number of progress markers
   diminishes when the markers are unrelated to the goal and reverses when
   the markers are relatively more salient than the goal. This article
   contributes to the goal literature by showing how markers affect
   perceptions of goal progress (i. e., level vs. rate of progress) and
   provides concrete insights to speed up and slow down customers' walking

   alternative more than focusing on similarities between them. Whether
   consumers were dieting, listening to songs, or consuming snacks in the
   lab, focusing on differences reduced their desire for the unattained
   alternative-and subsequent consumption of this item after consuming the

AB Many indebted consumers carry multiple credit cards with significant
   balances and do not generate enough income to pay off these balances in
   full at the end of each repayment period. In managing their debt over
   time, these consumers must decide how to allocate repayments across
   their debt accounts. This research examines how different monthly
   repayment allocations, varying from entirely concentrated into one debt
   account (i.e., a concentrated strategy) to equally dispersed across all
   debt accounts (i.e., a dispersed strategy), influence consumers'
   motivation to repay their debts. Evidence from a field study of indebted
   consumers with multiple debt accounts and from three experiments shows
   that concentrated (vs. dispersed) repayment strategies tend to boost
   consumers' motivation to become debt free, leading them to repay their
   debts more aggressively. Importantly, this motivating effect is most
   pronounced when the repayments are concentrated into consumers' smallest
   accounts because consumers tend to infer overall progress in debt
   repayment from the greatest proportional balance reduction (proportion
   of starting balance repaid) within any one account. These findings
   advance our understanding of how consumers repay their debts and help
   pinpoint the psychological process by which debt repayment strategies
   affect consumers' motivation to get out of debt.

AB A core assumption underlying brand logo design is that inferences
   generated from a logo's design are applied to the consideration target
   (e. g., product or brand) to which the logo is attached, and designs
   should therefore reflect the beliefs one wishes to promote about the
   target. The current work demonstrates an important case in which
   consideration targets are resistant to particular inferences, which
   leads such inferences to be applied instead to one's environment.
   Specifically, when considering safety-oriented products, consumers
   exposed to unstablelooking brand logos infer the presence of unsafe
   conditions, and because safetyoriented products are resistant to
   inferences that they are unsafe, the inference is instead applied to the
   environment (i. e., " the environment is unsafe"). This process
   subsequently increases the perceived utility of safety-oriented
   products. Five experiments collectively demonstrate the core effect,
   uncover the underlying inferential mechanism, and demonstrate the
   crucial role of inference resistance in the process. Overall, the
   present findings suggest that in some cases, a logo design that is
   opposed to desired product or brand beliefs may ironically help in
   boosting demand.

AB Extant research tends to adopt a community perspective when examining
   value creation in consumer collectives that limits the understanding of
   how value is created in loosely organized, dynamic, and heterogeneous
   networks. This study expands research on value creation by adopting a
   circulation-centric perspective that explains how value is created
   systemically in collaborative consumer networks. Inspired by
   anthropological theories of value creation, this study examines how
   circulation enables the systemic creation of value by connecting
   networked participants, their actions, objects, and value outcomes.
   Ethnographic and netnographic data were collected on the collaborative
   network of geocaching, in which consumers promote the circulation of
   objects known as travel bugs. The systemic creation of value in
   collaborative consumer networks is composed of four subprocesses
   triggered by object circulation-enactment, transvaluation, assessment,
   and alignment-that may happen concurrently and in multiple iterations.
   This process explains how geographic dispersion can coexist with the
   cultural situatedness of value creation and helps integrate prior
   research on value creation and value outcomes through the development of
   a systemic framework that explains value creation in terms of both
   individual actions and collective outcomes. Moreover, the findings
   motivate discussion on the affordances of physical and digital objects

AB This article demonstrates that a loss of personal control leads to an
   increase in self-regulatory behavior. This occurs because a loss of
   control puts consumers at a deficit relative to one of the major lessons
   they learn during their childhood, which is to have control over the
   outcomes of their actions. This deficit triggers a compensatory process
   focused on following other lessons that consumers believe they learned
   during their childhood. Because exerting self-regulation is another
   major lesson parents emphasize, consumers engage in self-regulatory
   behavior to compensate for a loss of personal control. However, when
   consumers believe their parents emphasized self-regulation less strongly
   during childhood (i. e., they believe their parents had a more
   permissive style), a loss of control can reduce self-regulatory
   behavior. These findings have implications for what we know about the
   effects of childhood experiences on adult consumer behavior, the
   importance of individuals' beliefs about childhood experiences in
   determining adult behavior, the consequences of low personal control,
   and the antecedents of self-regulatory behavior.

AB This research examines how situational factors influence the symbolic
   associations generated from visual design elements and their downstream
   consequences in terms of consumption intent. Specifically, this research
   focuses on a common and yet little studied brand design element: logo
   frames. The authors propose that a logo frame may be perceived as either
   protecting or confining, depending on the level of risk associated with
   a purchase. A high perception of risk increases the accessibility of a
   logo frame's association with protection and increases purchase intent,
   whereas a low perception of risk increases the accessibility of a logo
   frame's association with confinement and decreases purchase intent. The
   authors also propose that the logo frame effect may, under certain
   situations, extend to secondary brand identifiers (e. g., brand slogans)
   but will not extend to elements unrelated to brand identity (e. g.,
   product descriptions). Six studies provide support for these
   propositions. The findings of this research contribute to the literature
   on symbolic associations by demonstrating the contingent nature of the
   symbolic associations triggered from a visual design element and by
   showing that design features can mitigate (and under certain
   circumstances reverse) the negative effect of increased risk perceptions
   on purchase intent.

AB Why are men less likely than women to embrace environmentally friendly
   products and behaviors? Whereas prior research attributes this gender
   gap in sustainable consumption to personality differences between the
   sexes, we propose that it may also partially stem from a prevalent
   association between green behavior and femininity, and a corresponding
   stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are more
   feminine. Building on prior findings that men tend to be more concerned
   than women with gender-identity maintenance, we argue that this
   greenfeminine stereotype may motivate men to avoid green behaviors in
   order to preserve a macho image. A series of seven studies provides
   evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively
   linked and shows that, accordingly, consumers who engage in green
   behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive
   themselves as more feminine. Further, men's willingness to engage in
   green behaviors can be influenced by threatening or affirming their
   masculinity, as well as by using masculine rather than conventional
   green branding. Together, these findings bridge literatures on identity
   and environmental sustainability and introduce the notion that due to
   the green-feminine stereotype, genderidentity maintenance can influence
   men's likelihood of adopting green behaviors.

TI Why Does Psychological Distance Influence Construal Level? The Role of

AB The influence of psychological distance on construal level has been
   extensively documented in both social psychology and consumer research,
   with proximal (distal) events shown to induce low-level (high-level)
   construals. However, the extant literature takes a black box approach,
   as it were, to this effect by viewing it in terms of a direct
   association between distance and construal level, without specifying any
   intervening variables. The current research seeks to unpack this black
   box and provide more detailed process insights by identifying such an
   intervening variable: processing mode. We argue that people tend to rely
   more on visual processing when construing proximal events while engaging
   in a greater degree of verbal processing with regard to distal targets;
   in turn, visual processing is more likely to yield concrete (low-level)
   representations, whereas verbal processing facilitates abstract
   (high-level) representations. This unpacked formulation not only
   provides additional theoretical insight into a classic effect but also
   yields implications that are novel to the literature. In particular,
   emphasizing the role of processing mode (1) enables an identification of
   boundary conditions for the distanceconstrual effect, and (2) indicates
   when and why well-established consequences of psychological distance on
   consumer preferences can be reversed. Results from five studies provide
   convergent support for our key proposition and its corollaries.

AB People can make decisions by choosing or by rejecting alternatives. This
   research shows that changing a task from choice to rejection makes
   people more likely to rely on deliberative processing, what we label the
   task-type effect. To demonstrate this effect, we use a set of
   established decision biases that can be attenuated under deliberative
   processing. We show that changing a task from choice to rejection makes
   people express more consistent preferences between safe and risky
   options in the Asian disease problem (study 1A) and in financial
   decision making (study 1B), even with real monetary consequences (study
   1C). Further, switching a task from choice to rejection increases the
   quality of consideration sets in the context of hotel reviews (study 2)
   and leads to more rational decisions in the context of cell phone plan
   selection (study 3). Studies 4 and 5 tap into the process underlying the
   effect of task type. We demonstrate that a rejection task produces
   decisions similar to those observed in a choice task when decision
   makers are cognitively depleted (study 4) or encouraged to rely on their
   feelings (study 5). The findings provide insight into the effect of task
   type on deliberation and decision outcomes.

AB Can socioeconomic status in childhood influence desire for health
   coverage in adulthood? We develop and test a model that yielded two sets
   of findings across five experiments. First, people who grew up poor were
   generally less interested in health coverage compared to those who grew
   up wealthy. This effect was independent of people's current level of
   socioeconomic status, emerged most strongly when adults were
   experiencing financial threat, and was mediated by differences in
   willingness to take risks between people from poor versus wealthy
   childhoods. Second, we show that this effect reverses when people are
   provided with baserate information about disease. When information about
   the average likelihood of getting sick is made available, people who
   grew up poor were consistently more likely to seek health coverage than
   people who grew up wealthy. This effect was again strongest when people
   felt a sense of financial threat, and it was driven by people from poor
   versus wealthy childhoods differing in their perceptions of the
   likelihood of becoming sick. Overall, we show how, why, and when
   childhood socioeconomic status influences desire for health coverage.

AB New websites and smartphone applications provide easy-click checking
   opportunities that can help consumers in many domains. However, this
   technology is not always used effectively. For example, many consumers
   skip checking Terms and Conditions links even when a quick evaluation of
   the terms can save them money, but they check their smartphone while
   driving even though this behavior is illegal and dangerous. Four
   laboratory experiments clarify the significance of one contributor to
   such contradictory deviations from effective checking. Studies 1, 2, and
   3 show that, like basic decisions from experience, checking decisions
   reflect underweighting of rare events, which in turn is a sufficient
   condition for the coexistence of insufficient and too much checking.
   Insufficient checking emerges when most checking efforts impair
   performance even if checking is effective on average. Too much checking
   emerges when most checking clicks are rewarding even if checking is
   counterproductive on average. This pattern can be captured with a model
   that assumes reliance on small samples of past checking decision
   experiences. Study 4 shows that when the goal is to increase checking,
   interventions that increase the probability that checking leads to the
   best possible outcome can be far more effective than efforts to reduce
   the cost of checking.

AB How is consumer desire transformed by contemporary technology? Most
   extant theory holds that technology rationalizes and reduces passion. In
   our investigation of networks of desire-complex open systems of
   machines, consumers, energy, and objects-we find technology increasing
   the passion to consume. Effects depend upon participation in the
   network, which can be private, public, or professional. Private
   participation tends to discipline passion into interests reflecting
   established cultural categories. Public and professional participation
   build new connections between extant desires and a wider network,
   decentering ties and deterritorializing flows that limit hungers to
   emplaced bodies. Public and professional participation drive consumption
   passion to transgressive extremes. We use ethnography and netnography to
   study online food image sharing, a broad field that includes everything
   from friend networks to food bloggers. Using and extending Deleuze and
   Guattari's desire theory, we conceptualize desire as energetic,
   connective, systemic, and innovative. Critically examining the role of
   technocapitalism in the realm of consumption passion, we question the
   emancipatory possibilities of unfettered desire. Networks of desire
   create a passionate new universe of technologically enhanced desire, one
   that challenges the way we think about consumer collectives, capitalism,
   emancipation, and posthuman consumption.

   is limited in availability. The present research shows conditions under
   which the mere exposure to such advertising can activate actual
   aggression that manifests even outside the domain of the good being
   promoted. Further, we document the process underlying this effect:
   exposure to limited-quantity promotion advertising prompts consumers to
   perceive other shoppers as competitive threats to obtaining a desired
   product and physiologically prepares consumers to aggress. Seven studies
   using multiple behavioral measures of aggression demonstrate this
   deleterious response to scarcity promotions.

AB This research investigates the effect of temporal distance on how
   consumers "see" the future through their mind's eye. Drawing from
   construal-level and visual perception theories, we propose that shape
   (vs. color) is a high-level (vs. low-level) visual feature. Because
   construal of the distant (vs. near) future generally focuses on
   high-level (vs. low-level) features, when consumers visualize the
   distant (vs. near) future, they should engage in processing that
   captures shape (vs. color): namely, imagery that is relatively more
   black and white (vs. colorful). Experiment 1 establishes that shape is a
   constant focus of visualization regardless of the temporal distance of
   future events, whereas the focus on color decreases as temporal distance
   increases. Using image matching, image reconstruction, and behavioral
   response time measures, respectively, experiments 2A, 2B, 2C, 3, and 4
   test and find that participants' visualization of the distant (vs. near)
   future is increasingly less colorful (i.e., more black and white).
   Experiment 5 establishes the underlying mechanism, showing that
   experimentally directing attention to high-level (vs. low-level)
   features directly promotes visualization that is less colorful (i.e.,
   more black and white). Experiments 6A and 6B apply these findings to
   visual communications, suggesting that marketing messages about distant
   (vs. near) future events lead to greater willingness to pay when
   presented alongside black-and-white (vs. color) images.

AB Since industrialization, both beauty and refinement have been
   highlighted in many consumer markets, including home decoration,
   clothing, and fine foods and beverages. Consumers whose habitus
   resonates with these markets often formulate the goal of developing
   aesthetic expertise in them; they learn complex systems of taste
   evaluation to judge their aesthetic experiences. Extant research shows
   these systems' effects on many aspects of consumer behavior, from
   information search and memory to strategies for participating in status
   games. This study extends consumer research by illuminating how these
   taste evaluation systems are constituted in consumers, after habitus has
   instilled generic dispositions in them. The multimethod ethnography
   studies US middle-class, male craft beer aficionados seeking to become
   connoisseurs. This work makes two main contributions to consumer
   research. First, it places the often-neglected world of the senses at
   the center of taste theorizing. It details three learning practices
   (benchmarking, autodidactics, and scaffolding) that consumers use to
   bind together the sensory and discursive dimensions of social practices.
   Second, it reveals interconsumer cooperation as a key mechanism in
   building consensus on social practices that involve ambiguous aesthetic
   experiences. This theorization complements prior research on status
   competition as a dominant type of sociality in taste-centered
   consumption domains.

   Unfortunately, however, those positive experiences are not always
   guaranteed, and defects creep into the consumer experience. Though its
   assertion runs counter to most prescriptions, the current research
   proposes that exposing consumers to the mere possibility of negative
   experiences occurring in a consumption sequence increases consumers'
   happiness with those experiences over time. Six studies demonstrate this
   effect and further show that it is driven by hedonic responses as a
   result of favorable uncertainty resolution. That is, with the mere
   possibility of a negative experience, a consumer who actually
   experiences a positive outcome is likely to feel relief or pleasure from
   not having to experience the negative outcome. This research enriches
   existing literature on hedonic adaptation and uncertainty and has
   significant implications for consumer behavior.

AB The authors show that the value of a risky option decreases upon
   addition of risky prospects of the same valence. For instance, a medical
   drug with a potential side effect of seizures is viewed as less
   threatening when it also has smaller potential side effects, such as
   congestion and fatigue; travel insurance covering serious injury is
   viewed as less attractive when it also covers minor ailments; a lottery
   offering a chance to win an iPad is viewed as less attractive when it
   also offers a chance to win smaller prizes. As a result, consumers can
   perceive normatively more dangerous (beneficial) options to be less
   dangerous (beneficial) and normatively less dangerous (beneficial)
   options to be more dangerous (beneficial). This effect arises because
   people believe that larger prospects (e.g., seizures) are less likely
   than smaller prospects (e.g., congestion). Therefore, inclusion of
   smaller prospects by contrast makes a larger prospect appear less
   likely, which in turn reduces the perceived value of the risky option.
   Thus, this effect arises only when smaller prospects are added to a
   larger prospect, and only when the prospects are probabilistic.
   Cognitive load and feelings of personal control also moderate the
   effect.

   intensity differentially affects two fundamental dimensions of social
   judgments-warmth and competence. A marketer displaying a broad smile,
   compared to a slight smile, is more likely to be perceived by consumers
   as warmer but less competent. Furthermore, the facilitative effect of
   smile intensity on warmth perceptions is more prominent among
   promotion-focused consumers and in low-risk consumption contexts, while
   the detrimental effect of smile intensity on competence perceptions is
   more likely to occur among prevention-focused consumers and in high-risk
   consumption situations. Field observations in a crowdfunding context
   further indicate that the effects of smile intensity on warmth and

AB With rapid biotechnological advances in specialty drugs and
   direct-to-consumer advertising, consumers are under tremendous pressure
   to look, perform, feel, and live better. This is often accomplished
   through the use of life-enhancing products, sometimes referred to as
   performance-enhancing products, which can be accessed only through a
   gatekeeper, such as a physician. Integrating consumer and medical
   research, this article investigates how physicians make trade-offs
   between objective medical and nonmedical factors to determine consumers'
   access to life-enhancing products by examining US pediatric
   endocrinologists' prescription decisions for growth hormone (GH) for
   healthy but short children. The results of a conjoint study indicate
   that consumer medical criteria have less impact on a physician's
   decision to prescribe GH if the consumer requests a prescription or the
   physician believes in the intangible product benefits, and more impact
   when the product is more expensive. A physician's length of experience
   increases the impact of consumer medical criteria and decreases the
   influence of a consumer's preference for a prescription on the decision
   to prescribe. Overall, this research shows that not all consumers have
   equal access to lifeenhancing products; their access depends on a
   complex combination of medical and nonmedical factors related to the
   consumer, product, and the physician.

AB Childhood obesity is a serious global health challenge. Families and
   consumption are at the nexus of the problem, as childhood weight issues
   depend significantly on family-related influences (genetic
   predispositions, physical activities, and household food consumption
   practices). This article focuses on how a family socializes a child
   toward or away from obesity. It advances a family consumer socialization
   framework to characterize key elements and processes. Biological
   predispositions, parent/family inputs, elements of child development,
   parent-child interactions, and intergenerational transfer are all major
   contributors to weight status and life course potentials. Time is also a
   crucial component, here represented in two forms-linear and cyclical.
   Drawing on extensive research from other disciplines and related
   consumer research, five " foundational properties" are distilled,
   representing fundamental tenets underpinning the family's role in this
   problem. Each property is then used to chart promising opportunities for
   consumer researchers and others interested in advancing knowledge on
   this pressing concern.

AB Deciphering consumers' sentiment expressions from big data (e.g., online
   reviews) has become a managerial priority to monitor product and service
   evaluations. However, sentiment analysis, the process of automatically
   distilling sentiment from text, provides little insight regarding the
   language granularities beyond the use of positive and negative words.
   Drawing on speech act theory, this study provides a fine-grained
   analysis of the implicit and explicit language used by consumers to
   express sentiment in text. An empirical text-mining study using more
   than 45,000 consumer reviews demonstrates the differential impacts of
   activation levels (e.g., tentative language), implicit sentiment
   expressions (e.g., commissive language), and discourse patterns (e.g.,
   incoherence) on overall consumer sentiment (i.e., star ratings). In two
   follow-up studies, we demonstrate that these speech act features also
   influence the readers' behavior and are generalizable to other social
   media contexts, such as Twitter and Facebook. We contribute to research
   on consumer sentiment analysis by offering a more nuanced understanding
   of consumer sentiments and their implications.

AB As defined by Friestad and Wright (1994), "persuasion knowledge" is
   personal knowledge about persuasion attempts that consumers develop and
   use whenever they believe they are targets of persuasion. A significant
   majority of research on persuasion knowledge has suggested that
   persuasion knowledge and skepticism invariably go hand in hand, and that
   accessing persuasion knowledge therefore leads consumers to evaluate the
   agent and its offering less favorably. Across four studies, the authors
   demonstrate the novel effect that persuasion knowledge access can lead
   to greater credibility (rather than greater skepticism), a finding that
   they argue is theoretically consistent with Friestad and Wright's (1994)
   Persuasion Knowledge Model. Further, the authors demonstrate that when a
   persuasive agent uses a credible tactic, persuasion knowledge access can
   lead consumers to evaluate the agent and its offering more (rather than
   less) favorably. They also develop and test a new approach for
   increasing persuasion knowledge access in lab experiments, which can
   facilitate the investigation of other occasions where persuasion
   knowledge access increases trust and belief in a persuasive message.

AB Marketers and researchers alike typically regard products as
   differentiated by quality (modeled via vertical differentiation) or
   taste (modeled via horizontal differentiation). This research examines
   consumer beliefs about product differentiation. For a wide variety of
   product pairs, different consumers hold divergent beliefs about whether
   each pair is a matter of quality (such that one product is objectively
   better) or taste (such that one product is a better match with their own
   personal preferences). These beliefs have meaningful consequences. When
   consumers believe their chosen products are objectively better rather
   than better matches with their preferences: (1) they are willing to pay
   more for the chosen product over the alternative; (2) they
   self-reference less when explaining their choices; and (3) they are more
   likely to make transitive inferences from choices across other
   consumers. Observing others' contradictory choices increases the
   likelihood of believing those products differ by taste rather than
   quality. Understanding consumer beliefs about product differentiation
   has implications for understanding consumer decision delegation and
   decisions that are made in group contexts and for strategic decisions
   including customer segmentation, product positioning, and pricing
   policies.

AB Understanding consumer decision making about what to eat is both
   complex, as multiple factors can drive food choice, and important, as
   food choice impacts overall health. This research examines an intuition
   at the crossroads of two important criteria for food decision
   making-healthiness and price-finding that consumers believe that
   healthier food is more expensive than less healthy food. While this
   relationship may be accurate in some cases, consumers overgeneralize
   this belief to contexts and product categories where it is not
   objectively true. As a result, the healthy = expensive intuition
   influences consumer decision making by impacting inferences of missing
   attributes and choice between alternatives. Further, consistent with
   dual process models, the intuition acts as a bias in shaping how
   consumers process information about health and price when consumers are
   processing heuristically, including altering both perceptions of how "
   healthy" a given ingredient is as a function of product price and the
   amount of information search consumers engage in when evaluating health
   claims, such that consumers have a higher standard of evidence when
   evaluating intuition-inconsistent claims. Overall, the healthy =
   expensive intuition has a powerful influence on consumer decision
   making, with significant implications for both consumers and marketers.

AB A typical behavioral research paper features multiple studies of a
   common phenomenon that are analyzed solely in isolation. Because the
   studies are of a common phenomenon, this practice is inefficient and
   forgoes important benefits that can be obtained only by analyzing them
   jointly in a single-paper meta-analysis (SPM). To facilitate SPM, we
   introduce meta-analytic methodology that is userfriendly, widely
   applicable, and specially tailored to the SPM of the set of studies that
   appear in a typical behavioral research paper. Our SPM methodology
   provides important benefits for study summary, theory testing, and
   replicability that we illustrate via three case studies that include
   papers recently published in the Journal of Consumer Research and the
   Journal of Marketing Research. We advocate that authors of typical
   behavioral research papers use it to supplement the single-study
   analyses that independently examine the multiple studies in the body of
   their papers as well as the " qualitative meta-analysis" that verbally
   synthesizes the studies in the general discussion of their papers. When
   used as such, this requires only a minor modification of current
   practice. We provide an easy-to-use website that implements our SPM
   methodology.

AB Interpersonal relationships are essential to well-being, and gifts are
   often given to cultivate these relationships. To inform gift givers of
   what to give and to gain insight into the connecting function of gifts,
   this research investigates what type of gift is better at strengthening
   relationships according to gift recipients-material gifts (objects for
   recipients to keep) or experiential gifts (events for recipients to live
   through). Experiments examining actual gift exchanges in real-life
   relationships reveal that experiential gifts produce greater
   improvements in relationship strength than material gifts, regardless of
   whether the gift giver and recipient consume the gift together. The
   relationship improvements that recipients derive from experiential gifts
   stem from the intensity of emotion that is evoked when they consume the
   gifts, rather than when the gifts are received. Giving experiential
   gifts is thus identified as a highly effective form of prosocial
   spending.

AB When planning future consumption, individuals are known to opt for large
   virtue quantities and small vice quantities as a means of self-control.
   We argue that such planning may also involve the time window within
   which a given quantity needs to be consumed because the final objective
   is to plan for a desired consumption rate (i.e., quantity/time window)-
   a high virtue rate and a low vice rate. Five studies reveal that, when
   quantity is held constant, a short window (i.e., high rate) nudges
   individuals toward virtues, and a long window (i.e., low rate) toward
   vices. We find this effect for hypothetical and real virtue-vice
   choices, preferences, and willingness to extend a time window.
   Furthermore, these effects are mediated by the pursuit of long-term
   health goals, and are moderated such that the effect of time windows is
   stronger for those who need more help in meeting their self-control
   goals-that is, impulsive individuals. While these effects are consistent
   with self-control, we discuss a blend of mechanisms that may be working
   in conjunction, particularly at the stage that we focus on: planning
   rather than consuming. Our results offer strong theoretical implications
   and important consequences for the marketplace where expiration periods
   and other time windows are ubiquitous.

AB In consumer research, the relationship between memory work and
   forgetting remains largely unexplored, and the "forgetful" role that
   souvenirs can play in remembering is misunderstood, even denigrated. The
   present study explores the connections between memory work, forgetting,
   and material culture. Drawing on contemporary material culture studies,
   it offers a reflection on the memory practices of New Yorkers in the
   wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11,
   2001. Based on ethnographic research conducted in New York City, it
   provides evidence that remembering and forgetting can coexist and
   interconnect in complex ways. Uncovering the mechanics of forgetting in
   memory practices with souvenirs, it takes the research on memory and
   material culture beyond the semiotic analysis of signs and symbols, and
   shows that souvenirs can play a fundamental role in the process of
   obliterating and/or compartmentalizing aspects of past experiences.
   Although it may be true that New Yorkers-especially those who personally
   experienced 9/11-have no need of souvenirs to remember, many of them
   have memory practices that involve using souvenirs to forget.

AB The present research finds that anthropomorphism, or attributing human
   characteristics to nonhuman objects, increases consumers' preference for
   products with superior appearance. This effect occurs because consumers
   apply the belief of "beautiful is good," a pervasive stereotype in
   person perception, to the judgment of anthropomorphized products. Seven
   experiments test the propositions. The results show that product
   anthropomorphism (vs. nonanthropomorphism) leads consumers to spend more
   time and money searching for information about appearance attributes
   (experiments 1 and 2), to indicate greater preference for products with
   superior appearance (experiments 4, 6, and 7), and to purchase products
   with superior appearance (experiments 3 and 5). The experiments also
   show that the effect of anthropomorphism on consumer preference is
   mediated by consumers' conviction of "beautiful is good" in person
   perception. This effect is alleviated when consumers' beliefs about the
   association between the attractive physical appearance of a person and
   the positive personal traits of this person are challenged. These
   results are robust across a wide range of product categories and
   consumers. Theoretical contributions and marketing implications are
   discussed.

AB This research investigates how the fundamental desire for control
   affects product acquisition. The authors propose that consumers
   compensate for a loss of perceived control by buying utilitarian
   products (e.g., household cleaning agents) because of these products'
   association with problem solving, a quality that promotes a sense of
   control. Study 1 demonstrates this basic effect in a field setting
   involving real purchases, while studies 2 and 3 show that framing a
   product as utilitarian (vs. hedonic) moderates the effect of control on
   purchase intentions. Study 4 shows that a generalized problem-solving
   tendency mediates the effect of control on eagerness to pursue
   utilitarian consumption. Given the pervasiveness and ease of using
   product acquisition as a means to cope with psychological threat, this
   research has important implications for theory and practice.

AB How do psychological states of uncertainty influence the way people make
   decisions? We propose that such states increase the reliance on
   affective inputs in judgments and decisions. In accord with this
   proposition, results from six studies show that the priming of
   uncertainty (vs. certainty) consistently increases the effects of a
   variety of affective inputs on consumers' judgments and decisions.
   Primed uncertainty is shown to amplify the effects of the pleasantness
   of a musical soundtrack (study 1), the attractiveness of a picture
   (study 2), the appeal of affective attributes (studies 3 and 4),
   incidental mood states (study 6), and even incidental states of disgust
   (study 5). Moreover, both negative and positive uncertainty increase the
   influence of affect in decisions (study 4). The results additionally
   show that the increased reliance on affective inputs under uncertainty
   does not necessarily come at the expense of a reliance on descriptive
   attribute information (studies 2 and 5), and that the increased reliance
   on affect under uncertainty is distinct from a general reliance on
   heuristic or peripheral cues (study 6). The phenomenon may be due to
   uncertainty threatening the self, thereby encouraging a reliance on
   inputs that are closer to the self and have high subjective validity.

AB How can we comprehend people who pay for an experience marketed as
   painful? On one hand, consumers spend billions of dollars every year to
   alleviate different kinds of pain. On the other hand, millions of
   individuals participate in extremely painful leisure pursuits. In trying
   to understand this conundrum, we ethnographically study a popular
   adventure challenge where participants subject themselves to electric
   shocks, fire, and freezing water. Through sensory intensification, pain
   brings the body into sharp focus, allowing individuals to rediscover
   their corporeality. In addition, painful extraordinary experiences
   operate as regenerative escapes from the self. By flooding the
   consciousness with gnawing unpleasantness, pain provides a temporary
   relief from the burdens of self-awareness. Finally, when leaving marks
   and wounds, pain helps consumers create the story of a fulfilled life.
   In a context of decreased physicality, market operators play a major
   role in selling pain to the saturated selves of knowledge workers, who
   use pain as a way to simultaneously escape reflexivity and craft their
   life narrative.

AB In a world of increasing global mobility, we investigate how feelings of
   cultural distinctiveness-feelings of being different and separated from
   the surrounding cultural environment-influence consumers' preferences
   for brands that symbolize a related cultural group (i.e., a group that
   is geographically proximal and/or shares sociohistorical and cultural
   roots with one's own cultural group). Results from seven studies
   demonstrate that consumers experiencing cultural distinctiveness are
   likely to evaluate favorably and prefer brands associated with a related
   cultural group, in a choice set or consumption situation, even if they
   are not the favored option in the choice set. This pro-in-group bias for
   culturally related brands is driven by a heightened desire to connect
   with "home," which prompts consumers to expand their in-group boundaries
   to include the related cultural group within a broadened definition of
   home. However, this pro-in-group bias is attenuated when the salience of
   intergroup rivalries is high, where experiencing cultural
   distinctiveness can backfire and result in less favorable evaluations of
   brands associated with a related cultural group. This research is the
   first to demonstrate that cultural consumption is a dynamic process, and
   that in-group boundaries can be malleable and expandable, depending upon
   the motivation of the consumer.

   rating poles (1 = good, 5 = bad). Seven experiments document how
   implicit memory for the bigger-is-better format-where larger numbers
   typically connote something is better-can systematically bias consumers'
   judgments without their awareness. This rating polarity effect is the
   result of proactive interference from culturally determined numerical
   associations in implicit memory and results in consumer judgments that
   are less sensitive to differences in numeric ratings. This is an
   implicit bias that manifests even when people are mindful and focused on
   the task and across a range of judgment types (auction bids, visual
   perception, purchase intent, willingness to pay). Implicating the role
   of reliance on implicit memory in this interference effect, the rating
   polarity effect is moderated by (1) cultural norms that define the
   implicit numerical association, (2) construal mindsets that encourage
   reliance on implicit memory, and (3) individual propensity to rely on
   implicit memory. This research identifies a new form of proactive
   interference for numerical associations, demonstrates how reliance on

AB While research on conspicuous consumption has typically analyzed how
   people spend money on products that signal status, this article
   investigates conspicuous consumption in relation to time. The authors
   argue that a busy and overworked lifestyle, rather than a leisurely
   lifestyle, has become an aspirational status symbol. A series of studies
   shows that the positive inferences of status in response to busyness and
   lack of leisure time are driven by the perceptions that a busy person
   possesses desired human capital characteristics (e.g., competence and
   ambition) and is scarce and in demand in the job market. This research
   uncovers an alternative kind of conspicuous consumption that operates by
   shifting the focus from the preciousness and scarcity of goods to the
   preciousness and scarcity of individuals. Furthermore, the authors
   examine cultural values (perceived social mobility) and differences

AB Communal consumption is often described as inherently playful; previous
   research focuses mainly on successful ludic communal experiences and
   largely disregards their potential pitfalls. Moreover, the marketer is
   usually seen as the primary facilitator of ludic experiences, which has
   marginalized the role of the consumer. This article explores how
   consumers produce and sustain ludic consumption community experiences in
   the face of growing instrumental costs. It assumes a practice theory
   lens and is based on an ethnographic inquiry into cosplay, a time-and
   resource-intensive form of pop culture masquerade and craft consumption.
   Prolonged engagement in the cosplay community leads to growing
   emotional, material, temporal, and competence-related costs, which
   hinder playful experiences. Consumers practice modularization,
   reinforcement, and collaboration to overcome these costs and maintain
   the important ludic sensations that motivate communal engagements.

AB Skilled advertisers often cause a diverse set of consumers to feel
   similarly about their product. We present a method for measuring neural
   data to assess the degree of similarity between multiple brains
   experiencing the same advertisements, and we demonstrate that this
   similarity can predict important marketing outcomes. Since neural data
   can be sampled continuously throughout an experience and without effort
   and conscious reporting biases, our method offers a useful complement to
   measures requiring active evaluations, such as subjective ratings and
   willingness-to-pay (WTP) scores. As a case study, we use portable
   electroencephalography (EEG) systems to record the brain activity of 58
   moviegoers in a commercial theater and then calculate the relative
   levels of neural similarity, cross-brain correlation (CBC), throughout
   13 movie trailers. Our initial evidence suggests that CBC predicts
   future free recall of the movie trailers and population-level sales of
   the corresponding movies. Additionally, since there are potentially
   other (i.e., non-neural) sources of physiological similarity (e.g.,
   basic arousal), we illustrate how to use other passive measures, such as
   cardiac, respiratory, and electrodermal activity levels, to reject
   alternative hypotheses. Moreover, we show how CBC can be used in
   conjunction with empirical content analysis (e.g., levels of visual and
   semantic complexity).

AB Three studies examine the relation between power distance belief (PDB),
   the tendency to accept and expect inequalities in society; power, the
   control one has over valued resources; and charitable giving. Results
   suggest that the effect of PDB depends on the power held by the donor.
   In low-PDB contexts, people high (vs. low) in psychological power tend
   to be more self-focused (vs. other-focused), and this leads them to be
   less charitable. In high-PDB contexts, however, people high (vs. low) in
   psychological power tend to be more other-focused (vs. self-focused),
   and this leads them to be more charitable. The authors also explore
   several boundary conditions for these relationships and conclude with
   the implications of these findings.

AB Data collection in consumer research has progressively moved away from
   traditional samples (e.g., university undergraduates) and toward
   Internet samples. In the last complete volume of the Journal of Consumer
   Research (June 2015-April 2016), 43% of behavioral studies were
   conducted on the crowdsourcing website Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
   The option to crowdsource empirical investigations has great efficiency
   benefits for both individual researchers and the field, but it also
   poses new challenges and questions for how research should be designed,
   conducted, analyzed, and evaluated. We assess the evidence on the
   reliability of crowdsourced populations and the conditions under which
   crowdsourcing is a valid strategy for data collection. Based on this
   evidence, we propose specific guidelines for researchers to conduct
   high-quality research via crowdsourcing. We hope this tutorial will
   strengthen the community's scrutiny on data collection practices and
   move the field toward better and more valid crowdsourcing of consumer
   research.

AB This tutorial provides evidence that character misrepresentation in
   survey screeners by Amazon Mechanical Turk Workers ("Turkers") can
   substantially and significantly distort research findings. Using five
   studies, we demonstrate that a large proportion of respondents in paid
   MTurk studies claim a false identity, ownership, or activity in order to
   qualify for a study. The extent of misrepresentation can be unacceptably
   high, and the responses to subsequent questions can have little
   correspondence to responses from appropriately identified participants.
   We recommend a number of remedies to deal with the problem, largely
   involving strategies to take away the economic motive to misrepresent
   and to make it difficult for Turkers to recognize that a particular
   response will gain them access to a study. The major short-run solution
   involves a two-survey process that first asks respondents to identify
   their characteristics when there is no motive to deceive, and then
   limits the second survey to those who have passed this screen. The
   long-run recommendation involves building an ongoing MTurk participant
   pool ("panel") that (1) continuously collects information that could be
   used to classify respondents, and (2) eliminates from the panel those
   who misrepresent themselves.

AB An outsized focus on the explanatory value of conscious thought can
   constrain opportunities to more rigorously examine the influence of less
   obvious drivers of consumer behavior. This article proposes a more
   precise, disaggregated, and minimized perspective on consciousness,
   distinguishing it from other higher-order mental processes
   (i.e.,deliberation, intentionality, control, and effort). A more
   circumscribed perspective on consciousness, we argue, facilitates
   attempts to examine the causal impact of low-level, biological, or
   otherwise unconscious influences, bringing these into the frame of
   inquiry. Accordingly, we outline how a reduced reliance on consciousness
   as an explanatory construct deepens inquiry into the processes guiding
   choice, self-control, and persuasion. Lastly, in a set of
   recommendations centering on theory, methods, and training, we suggest
   ways for consumer researchers to evaluate more critically whether the
   contents of consciousness play a meaningful role in driving behavior.

   contributions and limitations of both, and how they work together. We
   agree that unconscious processes precede all conscious ones, but we
   argue that conscious thinking plays a prominent and likely indispensible
   role in much of consumer behavior. Conscious thought is particularly
   useful for logical reasoning, quantification (including about money),
   and communication, all of which are relevant to consumer behavior. We
   argue that most human behavior is produced by an interactive combination
   of conscious and unconscious causes and that favoring one over the other
   will yield an overly simplistic understanding of consumer behavior.
   Pragmatic and ethical concerns also argue for retaining a strong
   interest in conscious processes among consumers.

   cognitive and consumer neuroscience. We extend their suggestions in two
   important ways. First, we offer an extended framework based on a
   taxonomy of consciousness from visual neuroscience that suggests a
   continuum rather than a dichotomy between unconscious and conscious
   processes. This continuum is determined by the role of perception and
   attention and the communication between different functional systems in
   the brain. We then clarify and make suggestions about how different
   methods from the neurobiology toolbox can be used (or not) as measures
   of mediating and moderating variables underlying consciousness in

AB Consumer research can benefit greatly from more insight into unconscious
   processes underlying behavior. Williams and Poehlman's effort at more
   clearly conceptualizing consciousness and call for more research
   provides a welcome stimulus in this regard. At the same time, providing
   evidence for unconscious causation is fraught with methodological
   difficulties. We outline why it is vital to uphold standards of evidence
   for claims regarding unconscious processes, as it is precisely a lack of
   rigor on this front that has generated a countermovement by researchers
   skeptical of dual-process models in general and unconscious processes in
   particular. We contend that the skeptics have offered valid causes for
   concern, which we leverage to formulate six concrete recommendations for
   future research on consciousness. Researchers should (1) specify the
   process level at which they claim evidence for unconscious processes,
   (2) not confuse unconscious influences with unconscious processes, (3)
   carefully choose between different operational definitions of awareness,
   (4) maximally satisfy four criteria for awareness measures, and (5)
   complement measurement with experimental manipulations of awareness.
   Finally, we recommend to (6) refrain from hard claims about unconscious
   causation that transcend the limitations of the evidence, recognizing
   that consciousness is a continuous construct.

   hurts the field's ability to connect top-down construct-level
   understanding to principles derived from more bottom-up, mechanistic
   (physiological) aspects of consumer functioning. We offer that the path

AB Past research finds that general negativity inherent to a choice set
   increases deferral. In contrast, we adopt a functional
   perspective-linking fear to narrowed attention, negative expectations of
   the future, and an increased readiness for action-and propose that
   incidental fear increases the likelihood of consumer choice and reduces
   deferral. Six studies find consistent support for this view, using both
   hypothetical and consequential choices. We demonstrate that relative to
   other emotions (disgust, sadness, hope, pride, anger) and general
   feelings of uncertainty, those experiencing incidental fear choose
   significantly more and defer less. This increased choice, however, is
   realized only for decisions made in the present (vs. future), when
   information about the deferred options is not available. Importantly,
   increased choice from incidental fear is mediated by increased attention
   and liking. Moreover, we also demonstrate that individuals with high
   levels of trait fear (vs. trait anger) are more likely to choose and
   less likely to defer.

AB This research examines how future event markers influence intertemporal

   salient events between a smaller-sooner and larger-later option impacts

   relies on emotion versus reason to make decisions. For those who rely on
   emotion, additional events increase patience. Conversely, for
   individuals who rely on reason, additional events decrease patience.
   These effects are driven by perceptions of time, as events contract
   perceptions of time for emotional decision makers but expand perceptions
   of time for rational decision makers. Implications arise for
   intertemporal choice, time perception, and emotional versus rational

AB This study examines middle-class consumption and lifestyle during the
   transition to adulthood in the United States. Based on analysis of
   qualitative data from interviews with emerging adults between
   adolescence and settled adulthood, we argue that middle-class emerging
   adulthood is marked by a focus on exploratory experience consumption:
   the consumption of novel experiences with cultural capital potential.
   This tacit, embodied orientation is rooted in a habitus developed during
   entitled childhoods but is also shaped by an anticipated shortage of
   opportunities for exploration after they marry and have children.
   Accordingly, middle-class emerging adults voraciously consume
   exploratory experiences in the present with their imagined future selves
   in mind. The class basis for this orientation is examined through our
   analysis of interviews with working-class emerging adults whose
   lifestyles are characterized not by exploratory experience consumption
   but by a desire for the familiar, a fear of the unknown, and a longing
   for stability. The discussion focuses on how the middle-class consumer
   orientation toward exploratory experiences reinforces class (dis)
   advantage, life trajectories, and inequality.

AB Routines are the taken-for-granted practices that form the rhythm of
   everyday life, making people feel secure. How do consumers manage when
   their routines are disrupted? Practice theorists assert that practices
   are important to understanding consumption and stress their shared,
   repetitive, and conventional nature. When practices are stable, they are
   performed effortlessly, producing feelings of ease and trust in a
   predictable world. People are often unaware of the embodied
   competencies, or practical understandings, involved in the performance
   of these practices. However, practical understandings become apparent
   when elements of practices are misaligned. Our findings advance
   Giddens's (1984) theorization of ontological security by showing how the
   interplay between practical and discursive understandings and material
   configurations works to produce different ontological states that we
   call embedded security, embedded insecurity, discursive insecurity,
   acclimating security, and new embedded security. We also show how
   households subtly rework the underlying constitutive rules that anchor
   important practices in place within practice alignment.

AB This research shows that making a precise (vs. round) offer in a
   negotiation may lead to diverging outcomes. On the one hand, past
   literature has demonstrated a precision advantage wherein offer
   precision reduces the amount by which offer recipients counter. On the
   other hand, building on the notion that round numbers symbolize
   completion and previous findings that individuals tend to set goals at
   round numbers, we hypothesize a roundness advantage wherein offer
   roundness increases the bargainer's willingness to accept an offer. Five
   studies provide convergent evidence for our proposition and reconcile
   the present results with previous findings. We found that participants
   receiving a round offer are more (less) likely to accept (counter) than
   those who receive comparable precise offers. However, if they counter,
   participants in the precise condition counter by a smaller amount than
   those in the round condition. Furthermore, in agreement with our
   explanation, we find that the roundness advantage is more likely to
   manifest when participants subscribe to the association between round
   numbers and the feeling of completion.

AB This research demonstrates a visual phenomenon with broad implications
   for consumers: the perceived size of products depends on the saturation
   of their color. Results from six experiments, employing objects and
   products with various shapes and hues, show that increasing color
   saturation increases size perceptions. This influence is explained by
   the tendency for saturated color to capture attention, which, in turn,
   is explained by the arousal that saturated color stimulates. This
   research also demonstrates several downstream outcomes of the effect of
   saturation on size perceptions: evaluations are more favorable- and
   willingness to pay is higher-for products with high (low) saturation
   when usage goals call for large (small) size. Additionally, participants
   choose more of a product to fill a container with higher saturation.
   Further, the saturation of an object's color affects the perceived size
   of its surroundings, such that when a product with high (vs. low)
   saturation is used as a benchmark, the environment is perceived to be
   comparatively smaller (vs. larger). Implications for aesthetics, design,
   sensory marketing, and related topics are discussed. Lastly, to aid
   future color research, appendix A outlines general challenges and
   recommendations in connection with the conceptualization, manipulation,

AB Feeling left out has been shown to trigger primal, automatic responses
   in an attempt to compensate for threats to social belongingness. Such
   responses typically involve reconnection with other human beings.
   However, four experiments provide evidence that exposure to or
   interaction with anthropomorphic consumer products (i. e., products
   featuring characteristics of being alive through design, interaction,
   intelligence, responsiveness, and/ or personality) can also satisfy (at
   least partially) social needs, ultimately mitigating previously
   documented effects of social exclusion. Specifically, interacting with
   anthropomorphic (vs. nonanthropomorphic) products following social
   exclusion reduces (1) the need to exaggerate the number of one's current
   social connections, (2) the anticipated need to engage with close others
   in the future, and (3) the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior.
   These effects are driven by a need for social assurance, rather than
   positive affect. Moreover, an important boundary condition exists:
   drawing attention to the fact that an anthropomorphic product is not
   actually alive (i.e., the product does not provide genuine human
   interaction) limits its ability to fulfill social needs. Thus, in a time
   when consumer products are becoming increasingly anthropomorphic in
   design and function, the results reveal potentially important
   consequences for human-to-human relationships.

AB How does something's temporal location-that is, whether it occurred in
   the past or will occur in the future-affect whether people talk about
   it? Seven studies demonstrate that two factors, affective arousal and
   self-presentation, interact to shape time's impact on word of mouth.
   Future experiences are more affectively arousing than equivalent past
   ones. Whether this heightened arousal increases or decreases sharing,
   however, depends on how the topic potentially being discussed reflects
   on the sharer. For topics that reflect well on the sharer, arousal
   increases sharing such that people are more likely to talk if the event
   is happening in the future (vs. the past). When topics make the sharer
   look bad, however, this is no longer the case. These findings shed light
   on when people talk about and deepen understanding of the psychological
   drivers of word of mouth.

AB The empty space that surrounds a text message can affect the message's
   persuasiveness. Seven studies provide converging evidence in both field
   and laboratory settings that people find a message less persuasive, and
   are less likely to act on its implications, when it is surrounded by
   empty space than when it is not. These effects are mediated by
   perceptions of message strength. That is, message recipients infer that
   a message conveys a less strong opinion when empty space surrounds it
   and are consequently less likely to accept its implications. This effect
   does not occur when the space surrounding the message is generated
   randomly by a computer or when the message is attributed to a
   low-credibility source. When a message is counterattitudinal,
   surrounding it by empty space decreases the disposition to counterargue
   its implications and increases acceptance of the position advocated.
   When recipients are under cognitive load, however, they use the space
   surrounding the message as a heuristic basis for judgment and are less
   persuaded when the message is surrounded by empty space. This research
   adds not only to persuasion literature and current advertising
   practices, but also to an understanding of different interpretations of
   empty space.

   designs and measuring actual behavior is important and beneficial for
   consumer research. More specifically, we discuss when, where, and how
   researchers might go about doing this in order to increase the veracity
   and believability of their work. We analyze the choice of independent
   variables (IVs) along the experimental-realism dimension, ranging from
   artificial to realistic, and the choice of dependent variables (DVs)
   along the behavioral-measures dimension ranging from hypothetical
   intention to actual behavior. Importantly, we also map various goals of
   consumer research along these two dimensions to highlight when it is
   most appropriate to enhance the realism and behavioral measures of an
   experiment. Using a number of illustrative examples from research in the
   extant literature, we specifically highlight how consumer researchers
   can increase experimental realism and utilize actual-behavior measures
   in their experiments in order to improve both the fidelity of the
   research and the likelihood that the research provides insight into real
   consumer behavior.

AB Political ideology plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals'
   attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. However, apart from a handful of
   studies, little is known about how consumers' political ideology affects
   their marketplace behavior. The authors used three large consumer
   complaint databases from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Federal
   Communications Commission in conjunction with a county-level indicator
   of political ideology (the 2012US presidential election results) to
   demonstrate that conservative consumers are not only less likely than
   liberal consumers to report complaints but also less likely to dispute
   complaint resolutions. A survey also sheds light on the relationship
   between political ideology and complaint/dispute behavior. Due to
   stronger motivations to engage in "system justification," conservative
   (as opposed to liberal) consumers are less likely to complain or
   dispute. The present research offers a useful means of identifying those
   consumers most and least likely to complain and dispute, given that
   political ideology is more observable than most psychological factors
   and more stable than most situational factors. Furthermore, this
   research and its theoretical framework open opportunities for future
   research examining the influence of political ideology on other
   marketplace behaviors.

AB Research in political psychology indicates that liberals are less
   motivated than conservatives by epistemic, existential, and relational
   needs to reduce uncertainty, threat, and social discord, and are
   therefore more prone to challenge the status quo. In a compelling
   extension of this work into the field of consumer behavior, Jung,
   Garbarino, Briley, and Wynhausen (this issue) demonstrate that people
   residing in more liberal (vs. conservative) areas register more
   complaints with the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal
   Communications Commission, and National Highway Traffic Safety
   Administration, and dispute more resolutions offered in response to
   their complaints. Furthermore, liberals were found to object more
   strongly to the hypothetical imposition of an unanticipated banking fee,
   and this effect was mediated by system justification. Inspired by Jung
   and colleagues, we investigated the hypothesis that liberals would also
   be more likely to buy and boycott consumer products for political
   reasons. We analyzed data from the American National Election Studies
   and European Social Surveys and discovered that, even after we adjusted
   for demographic factors, liberals in the United States and leftists in
   all 15 European countries were more likely than conservatives and
   rightists to report having bought a product-or refrained from buying a
   product-for political reasons.

AB The organic food market has reached a significant value in developed
   countries, but market shares vary substantively between product
   categories. This article investigates general patterns in the sequence
   of adoption of organic products based on a major Danish retailer's panel
   scanner data. All registered transactions over 20 months from 8,704
   randomly selected customers with a loyalty card are analyzed using a
   hidden Markov model, capturing the dynamics in consumers' purchases. The
   model identifies latent states representing identifiable, accessible,
   and actionable dynamic customer segments, and captures the movements
   between states or segments. A pattern emerges that is consistent with
   the theory of behavioral spillover and inconsistent with the theory of
   moral licensing, including a tendency to buy organic products in an
   increasing number of product categories over time. The order in which
   organic products are adopted is inversely related to the behavioral
   costs of adopting them. The employed approach provides a firm basis for
   personalized communication aiming to increase cross-selling of organic
   products, increase the sale of less popular organic products, and
   accelerate movements from segments buying few organic products to
   segments buying organic more consistently.

AB The present work examines the role of creativity-contingent monetary
   versus social-recognition rewards on creative performance and provides
   new insights into the underlying motivational processes through which
   these rewards affect consumer creativity. A series of five studies
   demonstrate that within the context of creativity contingency, monetary
   rewards induce a performance focus, while social-recognition rewards
   induce a normative focus. Such performance (normative) focus in turn
   enhances (attenuates) approach motivation to be original and hence leads
   to higher (lower) originality in a creative task. Thus, this work not
   only advances the current understanding of how and why two types of
   widely used creativity-contingent external rewards may have contrasting
   effects on creative performance, but it also offers important practical
   insights to managers who utilize reward systems in cultivating consumer
   creativity in their innovation platforms.

AB When confronted with racial stigma, how do people manage it? What
   specific arrangements of objects and tactics do they mobilize to make
   everyday life more tolerable (if not more equal)? The politics of
   respectability (respectability) is one such arrangement. Respectability
   makes life more tolerable by offering a counternarrative that disavows
   stigma through status-oriented displays. This strategy of action emerged
   alongside mass consumer culture in the late 19th century, but what
   relevance does it have to those who are stigmatized in contemporary
   consumer culture? Based on ethnographic interviews and observations with
   middle-class African Americans, respectability remains an important
   strategy that has undergone profound changes since its origins while
   still operating in similar ways. In the late 20th century it fractured
   into two related but distinct counternarratives: (1) "discern and
   avoid," which seeks distance from whatever is stigmatized, and (2)
   "destigmatize," using black culture as a source of high status.
   Perceptions of how well either counternarrative manages stigma depend on
   how ideology, strategy, and consumption are connected via specific
   sociohistorical features of place and individual power resources. I
   illustrate those connections through four cases that show perceived
   success and perceived failure for each counternarrative.

AB This article introduces a new dimension of consumption as liquid or
   solid. Liquid consumption is defined as ephemeral, access based, and
   dematerialized, while solid consumption is defined as enduring,
   ownership based, and material. Liquid and solid consumption are
   conceptualized as existing on a spectrum, with four conditions leading
   to consumption being liquid, solid, or a combination of the two:
   relevance to the self, the nature of social relationships, accessibility
   to mobility networks, and type of precarity experienced. Liquid
   consumption is needed to explain behavior within digital contexts, in
   access-based consumption, and in conditions of global mobility. It
   highlights a consumption orientation around values of flexibility,
   adaptability, fluidity, lightness, detachment, and speed. Implications
   of liquid consumption are discussed for the domains of attachment and
   appropriation; the importance of use value; materialism; brand
   relationships and communities; identity; prosumption and the prosumer;
   and big data, quantification of the self, and surveillance. Lastly,
   managing the challenges of liquid consumption and its effect on consumer
   welfare are explored.

   more conducive to interpersonal conversations than are material
   purchases-that is, experiences have higher conversational value, which
   helps explain why they afford consumers greater happiness than do
   objects (Van Boven and Gilovich 2003). Further, two experiments
   demonstrate that factors known to differ between experiential and
   material purchases-closeness to the self, social approval, and purchase
   uniqueness-help explain why experiences are preferred as a topic of
   conversation over objects, and suggest a social motivation for talking
   more about experiences. Indeed, when the motivation to build a
   relationship with the conversation partner is removed, the preference to
   share about experiences (vs. objects) disappears. Together, these
   findings add to and help integrate the growing literature on the
   relation between purchase type (material vs. experiential) and

AB Consumers are increasingly sharing product experiences with strangers
   and friends online. Despite the prevalence of word of mouth (WOM),
   little is known about how and why WOM differs based on whether people
   are talking to strangers or friends. The current article theorizes that
   one important motivation for WOM is social acceptance. To fulfill this
   motivation, people form and maintain existing relationships with others.
   Building on research in interpersonal relationships, we theorize that
   when communicating with strangers, people attempt to self-enhance to
   attract strangers into forming relationships with the self; when sharing
   with friends, on the other hand, people attempt to connect emotionally
   in order to maintain existing ties. A series of seven studies provide
   backing for this simple yet encompassing framework. Results of the
   current article provide insights into the motivations behind WOM,
   synthesize prior findings, and show that people systematically share
   different content with strangers versus friends. The current work makes
   theoretical contributions to research in interpersonal communication,
   social influence, and WOM, and holds practical implications for
   marketers interested in understanding consumer word of mouth.

AB Consumers typically enjoy an experience less with repeated consumption,
   yet this rate of satiation can dramatically vary across contexts and
   individuals. Building on the notion that satiation is constructed during
   consumption, we demonstrate that people satiate faster when they employ
   a greater working memory capacity. We establish this result in four
   studies across multiple experienced stimuli while using a range of
   measures of working memory capacity. We also develop insight into the
   underlying cognitive mechanism using mediation and moderation to show
   that people utilizing a larger working memory capacity satiate faster
   because they more deeply encode and process each stimulus. This
   subsequently leads to a sense that they have consumed that stimulus more
   times, and hence greater satiation. This provides direct evidence that
   working memory capacity is a critical cognitive mechanism underlying
   satiation, and it helps us potentially understand a range of satiation
   phenomena.

AB Marketers invest a lot of resources in product aesthetics and design,
   but does this strategy always lead to favorable consumer outcomes? While
   prior research suggests enhanced aesthetics should have a uniformly
   positive influence on pre-usage evaluations and choice, the present
   research examines the downstream effects of nondurable product
   aesthetics on consumption behavior and post-consumption affect. First,
   we document an inhibiting effect of aesthetics on actual consumption. We
   find that highly aesthetic products elicit greater perceptions of effort
   in their creation, and that consumers have an intrinsic appreciation for
   such effort. Because the consumption process indirectly destroys the
   effort invested to make the product beautiful, people reduce consumption
   of such products because usage would entail destroying something they
   naturally appreciate. Second, we show that in cases where individuals do
   consume a beautiful product, they exhibit lower consumption enjoyment
   and increased negative affect. These negative post-consumption outcomes
   are mediated in parallel by concerns over having actually destroyed the
   effort that made the product beautiful as well as the decrements in
   beauty that become visible when aesthetic products are made less
   attractive through consumption. Across a series of studies, we challenge
   the common assumption that enhanced aesthetics always lead to positive
   consumer outcomes.

AB Can close brand relationships insulate against physical pain? The idea
   that close interpersonal relationships help people cope with pain has
   received increasing support in social psychology. It is unknown,
   however, whether close brand relationships can do the same and, if so,
   why. Seven studies are reported here to fill this knowledge gap.
   Experiments 1a and 1b are the first to demonstrate that when confronted
   with a loved brand (vs. control), consumers are able to insulate
   themselves against physical pain. Experiment 2 provides evidence that
   the pain-insulating effectiveness of close brand relationships is not
   just due to brands representing mere distractions. Using a multistudy,
   multimethod approach to test for mediation, experiments 3 through 5
   provide convergent empirical support for the hypothesis that feelings of
   social connectedness mediate the effect of close brand relationships on
   pain. Study 6 categorizes the 1,105 brand love essays written by
   participants in our experiments to show that loved brands provide
   feelings of social connectedness, mostly metaphorically and indirectly
   and, to a lesser extent, directly. In summary, close brand relationships
   can help insulate consumers against physical pain due to brands' ability
   to provide a semblance of social connectedness.

AB Statistical mediation analysis has become the technique of choice in
   consumer research to make causal inferences about the influence of a
   treatment on an outcome via one or more mediators. This tutorial aims to
   strengthen two weak links that impede statistical mediation analysis
   from reaching its full potential. The first weak link is the path from
   mediator to outcome, which is a correlation. Six conditions are
   described that this correlation needs to meet in order to make plausible
   causal inferences: directionality, reliability, unconfoundedness,
   distinctiveness, power, and mediation. Recommendations are made to
   increase the plausibility of causal inferences based on statistical
   mediation analysis. Sweetspot analysis is proposed to establish whether
   an observed mediator-outcome correlation falls within the region of
   statistically meaningful correlations. The second weak link is the
   communication of mediation results. Four components of informative
   communication of mediation analysis are described: effect decomposition,
   effect size, difference testing, and data sharing. Recommendations are
   made to improve the communication of mediation analysis. A review of 166
   recently published mediation analyses in the Journal of Consumer
   Research, a reanalysis of two published datasets, and Monte Carlo
   simulations support the conclusions and recommendations.

AB Self-control is an important driver of choice, but might it also change
   choice's meaning, making it seem less indicative of preference? Decades
   of research suggest that preference and choice are often intertwined.
   Choice often originates from one's preferences. As a result, choice is
   often seen as a reflection of preference, leading people to infer their
   preferences by observing their own choices. We suggest that self-control
   attenuates this process. Because self-control often overrides personal
   desires in favor of external constraints, norms, and long-term
   considerations, we propose that self-control is associated with a sense
   of attenuated correspondence between choice and individual preference.
   Five experiments suggest that when the notion of self-control is
   salient, people are less likely to see their choices as reflecting their
   preferences or to infer preference from previous choices. As a result,
   evoking the notion of self-control attenuates the tendency to view
   choice as indicative of preference, even in contexts unrelated to where
   self-control was originally evoked. Thus, self-control shapes not only
   choice itself, but also the perceived meaning of choice.

AB While companies contribute in different ways to the corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) issues they support, little is known about the
   effects of varying CSR contribution types on consumers' evaluations of
   the contributing company. This article examines consumer reactions to
   two basic contribution types-money versus in-kind-in the CSR domain of
   disaster relief to demonstrate through five studies that while consumers
   evaluate a company more favorably when it makes in-kind rather than
   monetary contributions of equivalent value to CSR issues that are
   perceived to be less controllable, the pattern reverses when the
   company's contributions are made to CSR issues that are perceived to be
   more controllable. This interaction between contribution type and
   perceived issue controllability is more likely to manifest when
   controllability is accessible in the minds of consumers. The underlying
   process is driven by the extent to which the disparate emotionality of
   each contribution type matches the intensity of felt emotion evoked by
   CSR issues of varying perceived controllability, producing processing
   fluency.

AB Previous research has shown that material goods can help people
   self-express, either because the products are themselves self-expressive
   (e.g., a band T-shirt) or because the products are associated with a
   desired group. This article examines a new signal of
   self-expressiveness: whether the product is polarizing-that is, whether
   some people strongly like the product and other people strongly dislike
   the product. Eight studies examine how polarization and its associated
   indicator in the online domain (a bimodal distribution of user star
   ratings) affects consumer preferences. The results indicate that
   polarizing products are perceived to be more self-expressive and to
   serve as stronger indicators of one's tastes and personality. As a
   result, people find products with bimodal rating distributions to be
   more desirable when they experience temporary or chronic low
   self-concept clarity. Further, people evaluate products with bimodal
   distributions more favorably in consumption contexts in which
   self-expression is important. These effects emerge when the bimodal
   distribution pertains to a self-expressive attribute (e.g., style) but
   not when it pertains to a non-self-expressive attribute (e.g., quality).
   Last, the effect is especially strong when people have the motivation to
   express an individual-rather than group-level identity. Hence,
   polarizing products are seen as vehicles for individual self-expression.

AB Consumers frequently encounter moral violations (e.g., financial
   scandal, cheating, and corruption) in their daily lives. Yet little is
   known about how exposure to moral violations may affect consumer choice.
   By synthesizing insights from research on social order and conformity,
   we suggest that mere exposure to others' immoral behaviors heightens
   perceived threat to social order, which increases consumers' endorsement
   of conformist attitudes and hence their preferences for
   majority-endorsed choices in subsequently unrelated consumption
   situations. Five studies conducted across different experimental
   contexts and different product categories provided convergent evidence
   showing that exposure to moral violations increases consumers'
   subsequent conformity in consumption. Moreover, the effect disappears
   (a) when the moral violator has already been punished by third parties
   (study 4) and (b) when the majority-endorsed option is viewed as being
   complicit with the moral violation (study 5). This research not only
   demonstrates a novel downstream consequence of witnessing moral
   violations on consumer choice but also advances our understanding of how
   conformity can buffer the negative psychological consequences of moral
   violations and how moral considerations can serve as an important basis
   for consumer choice.

AB Research on the optimization of donation solicitations has focused on
   language and content rather than appearance. The present work considers
   how a solicitation's appearance influences donor response. The results
   indicate that potential donors make inferences about the soliciting
   organization based on the aesthetics of the solicitation materials. In
   general, highly aesthetic elements increase perceptions of
   organizational professionalism, which consequently leads to greater
   donations. However, aesthetic enhancement can backfire; when high levels
   of aesthetics with cost implications (e.g., embossed cardstock, gold
   ink) are combined with high levels of aesthetics without cost
   implications (e.g., attractive background, appealing font), perceptions
   of organizational wastefulness discourage donations. Thus, the most
   effective solicitation is not the most beautiful but rather one offering
   high levels of aesthetics without cost implications and low levels of
   aesthetics with cost implications. The studies demonstrate these effects
   in the field and in the lab and also identify moderators of the negative
   effect of aesthetics with cost implications on donations.

AB Copycat brands imitate the trade dress of other brands, such as their
   brand name, logo, and packaging design. Copycats typically operate in
   the core product category of the imitated brand under the assumption
   that such "in-category imitation" is most effective. In contrast, four
   experiments demonstrate the benefits of "out-of-category imitation" for
   copycats, and the harmful effect on the imitated brand. Copycats are
   evaluated more positively in a related category, because consumers
   appraise the similarity between copycat and imitated brand more
   positively than in the core category, independent of the perceived
   similarity itself. This is due to a reduced salience of norms regarding
   imitation in the related category. Moreover, the results show a damaging
   backlash effect of out-of-category imitation on the general evaluation
   of the imitated brand and on its key perceived product attributes. The
   findings replicate across student, MTurk, and representative consumer
   samples; multiple product categories; and forms of brand imitation. This
   research demonstrates that out-of-category brand imitation helps copycat
   brands and hurts national leading brands much more than has so far been
   considered, which has managerial and public policy implications.

AB Marketing strategies are often tied to how consumers spend time (e.g.,
   waiting in lines, searching across stores) in return for money (e.g.,
   receiving a discount). Viewing such time-money tradeoffs in terms of a
   reservation wage rate for consumers, we identify a wage-rate asymmetry
   between two elicitation procedures: (a) Money-Elicit (MEL): state the
   minimum amount of money, M, that you would accept in return for spending
   a given number of hours, T; and (b) Time-Elicit (TEL): state the maximum
   number of hours, T, that you would spend in return for accepting a given
   amount of money, M. While these procedures are normatively equivalent,
   we propose that TEL (vs. MEL) wage rates are higher because time
   scarcity receives a higher weight in TEL judgments. In eight studies
   including both hypothetical and real settings, we document the wage-rate
   asymmetry, the time scarcity process, and a downstream consequence of
   TEL (vs. MEL) reducing the likelihood of accepting a time-money
   tradeoff. We discuss the implications for practice, and for research on
   wage rates, time versus money, procedural invariance, and scarcity.

AB An increasing number of social ventures are for-profit companies (i.e.,
   for-profit social ventures) that seek to advance a social cause while
   making a profit. In a series of seven studies, this research
   investigates consumer support for organizations as a function of their
   social mission and profit orientation. The impact of profit orientation
   on consumer support depends on the prominence of the organization's
   social mission. For organizations with a prominent social mission,
   profits are interpreted as a signal of greed; absent a prominent social
   mission, a for-profit orientation can instead imply greater competence.
   As a result, consumer support of for-profit social ventures suffers in
   comparison to both nonprofits and traditional for-profits-a downside to
   the organizational benefits of for-profit social ventures identified in
   prior research. In addition, this research investigates organizational
   factors-including excessive organizational spending, profit perceptions,
   and operational efficiency cues-that alter greed perceptions and
   consequently support for for-profit social ventures. Together, this
   research sheds light on consumer reaction to organizations that support
   social causes, with implications for the social venture marketplace,
   including the nonprofit versus for-profit quandary faced by social
   entrepreneurs.

AB Across the five sensory modalities we examine an unexplored difference
   in imagery: psychological distance. In particular, we propose that
   imagined senses can be psychologically more proximal or distal based on
   the maximum physical distance typically required for a stimulus to be
   sensed. Specifically, we propose that imagined senses that require close
   proximity to the body in order to be sensed (i.e., taste, touch) will
   feel more psychologically proximal than senses that do not require such
   close proximity (i.e., hearing, sight). We obtain support for our
   theoretical framework across a pilot study, four lab studies, and one
   field study by examining how images evoked using different sensory
   modalities differentially influence variables shown in past research to
   vary along psychological distance: (1) the imagined distance between the
   consumer and the stimulus, (2) product perceptions on other dimensions
   of psychological distance, and (3) persuasion when matched with other
   dimensions of psychological distance.

AB Research shows that optimism can positively impact health, but when and
   why people feel optimistic when confronting health challenges is less
   clear. Findings from six studies show that the frames people adopt when
   thinking about health challenges influence their optimism about
   overcoming those challenges, and that their culture moderates this
   effect. In cultures where the independent self is highly accessible,
   individuals adopting an initiator frame (how will I act, regardless of
   the situations I encounter?) were more optimistic than those adopting a
   responder frame (how will I react to the situations I encounter?); the
   converse occurred for individuals from cultures where the interdependent
   self is highly accessible. Moreover, mediation and moderation evidence
   revealed that this interactive effect of culture and frame on optimism
   was driven by people's ability to easily imagine the recovery process.
   These effects held for distinct health challenges (cancer, diabetes,
   flood-related illness, traumatic injury) and across single-country and
   cross-country samples, and they impacted positive health outcomes and
   decisions ranging from anticipated energy, physical endurance, and
   willingness to take on more challenging physical therapy to intentions
   to get vaccinated, stick to a doctor-recommended diet, and undertake a

AB It is well known that individuals engage in reactive consumption to
   address self-discrepancy and self-threat and that this consumption may
   either be symbolically related to the nature of the threat or occur in
   an unrelated domain. This research proposes a theory for self-worth
   restoration through the consumption of high-intensity sensory stimuli.
   Four studies demonstrate that not only do individuals facing self-threat
   prefer high-intensity sensory consumption (HISC) but also that this
   consumption restores their self-worth. This propensity for HISC is
   negated after individuals are allowed to engage in additional
   self-affirmation tasks. The findings are documented in both the visual
   domain (as evidenced by a preference for more intense and saturated
   colors) and the auditory domain (as evidenced by a preference for louder
   audio levels). The consumption of high-intensity sensory stimuli
   elevates individuals' arousal levels, which in turn minimizes rumination
   on thoughts related to the threat and thus restores one's self-worth.
   The distractive nature of HISC and its subsequent impact on self-worth
   restoration is shown to operate regardless of the valence of the sensory
   consumption. Finally, the propensity for HISC is negated after
   individuals experience an arousal-elevating threat, providing additional
   support for the underlying process.

AB Mental accounting research suggests that consumers prefer borrowing for
   longer-lasting purchases in order to receive benefits from the purchases
   as they pay for them. In contrast, two sets of archival data and five
   lab studies show that consumers are more willing to borrow for
   experiential versus material purchases, even though experiential
   purchases tend to have a shorter physical duration. Further, framing the
   same purchase as more experiential than material increases willingness
   to borrow. This effect occurs because purchase timing is more important
   for experiential purchases-a function of consumers' aversion to missing
   out on planned consumption. Thus, we moderate the proposed effect by
   varying whether the borrowing decision impacts planned consumption.
   Other differences between material and experiential purchases, such as
   scarcity or expected happiness, cannot similarly explain our results.
   Moreover, our conceptualization allows us to reconcile the apparent
   contradiction between the previous and current research by examining the
   relative impact of purchase-timing importance and payment-benefit
   duration matching in different contexts (i.e., "purchasing" and
   "source-of-funding" decisions).

AB Across six studies, a female mannequin is demonstrated to have negative
   implications for both male and female consumers low in appearance
   self-esteem. In particular, consumers who are lower in appearance
   self-esteem evaluate a product displayed by a mannequin more negatively
   as compared with consumers higher in appearance self-esteem. As
   mannequins signal the normative standard of beauty and consumers with
   low self-esteem in regard to their appearance believe they fail to meet
   this standard, these consumers become threatened by the beauty standard
   when exposed to a mannequin and in response denigrate the product the
   mannequin is displaying. We provide evidence for the underlying process
   in three ways: 1) through the finding that the effect for male and
   female consumers with low appearance self-esteem arises only when the
   mannequin is displaying an appearance-related product, 2) through
   mediation analysis demonstrating that the mannequin conveys society's
   standard of beauty and that this negatively impacts product evaluations,
   and 3) through mitigation of the effect by removing the presence of
   threat via a self-affirmation task or decreasing the mannequin's beauty
   (e.g., marking its face, removing its hair, or removing its head).
   Multiple avenues for future research are forwarded.

AB Individuals often evaluate, purchase, and consume brands in the presence
   of others, including close others. Yet relatively little is known about
   the role brand preferences play in relationships. In the present
   research, the authors explore how the novel concept of brand
   compatibility, defined as the extent to which individuals have similar
   brand preferences (e.g., both partners prefer the same brand of soda),
   influences life satisfaction. The authors propose that when brand
   compatibility is high, life satisfaction will also be high. Conversely,
   because low brand compatibility may be a source of conflict for the
   relationship, the authors propose that it will be associated with
   reduced life satisfaction. Importantly, the authors predict that the
   effects of brand compatibility on conflict and life satisfaction will
   depend upon relationship power. Across multiple studies and
   methodologies, including experimental designs (studies 2, 3, 5) and
   dyadic data from real-life couples (studies 1, 4, 6), the authors test
   and find support for their hypotheses. By exploring how a potentially
   unique form of compatibility influences life satisfaction, including
   identifying a key moderator and an underlying mechanism, the current
   research contributes to the literatures on branding, close
   relationships, consumer well-being, and relationship power.

AB Consumers often pursue goals that lack specific end states, such as
   goals to lose as much weight as possible or to pay off as much debt as
   possible. Yet despite considerable interest in the consequences of
   setting nonspecific (vs. specific) goals, how goal specificity affects
   motivation throughout goal pursuit is less well understood. The current
   research explores the role of reference points in shaping goal
   specificity's effects. We propose that goal specificity alters what
   reference point consumers spontaneously adopt during goal pursuit: for
   specific goals, the end state tends to be more salient, but for
   nonspecific goals, the initial state should be more salient. Five
   studies investigate how this difference in focal reference points shapes
   (1) the relationship between goal progress and motivation, (2) when
   (i.e., at what level of goal progress) goal specificity produces the
   greatest difference in motivation, and (3) the underlying process
   driving these effects. Our findings advance understanding of the
   relationship between goal specificity, goal progress, and motivation,
   and in doing so, underscore the critical role that reference points play
   in goal-directed behavior. In addition, the findings offer practical
   insight into how best to set important financial, health, and other
   consumer goals to enhance motivation.

AB This research examines how incidentally induced consumer curiosity
   influences subsequent indulgent decisions. Prior research has primarily
   focused on the effect of curiosity on information seeking in the present
   domain. The current research goes further to propose that the curiosity
   effect can spill over to prompt consumers to prefer indulgent options in
   other, unrelated domains (e.g., food, money). This situation is likely
   to occur because curiosity motivates individuals to seek the missing
   information as the specific information reward in the current domain.
   Such desire to obtain the information reward primes a reward-seeking
   goal, which in turn leads to increased preferences for indulgent options
   in subsequent, unrelated domains. Furthermore, the impact of curiosity
   on indulgent options possesses goal-priming properties as identified by
   the literature. That is, the effect should (1) persist after a time
   delay, and (2) diminish when the reward-seeking goal is satiated by the
   obtainment of a reward before the indulgent task. We conduct a series of
   studies to provide support for our hypotheses. This research contributes
   to both curiosity and indulgence decision literature and offers
   important practical implications.

AB Consumer behavior is often influenced by subtle environmental cues, such
   as temperature, color, lighting, scent, or sound. We explore the effects
   of a not-so-subtle cue-human crowding-on calorie consumption. Although
   crowding is an omnipresent factor, it has received little attention in
   the marketing literature. We present six studies showing that crowding
   increases calorie consumption. These effects occur because crowding
   increases distraction, which hampers cognitive thinking and evokes more
   affective processing. When consumers process information affectively,
   they consume more calories. We show the specific reason for the increase
   in calories. When given a choice between several different options,
   people select and eat higher-calorie items, but when presented with only
   one option, people eat more of the same food item. We document this
   process, rule out alternative explanations, and discuss theoretical and
   managerial implications.

AB As in other social sciences, published findings in consumer research
   tend to overestimate the size of the effect being investigated, due to
   both file drawer effects and abuse of researcher degrees of freedom,
   including opportunistic analysis decisions. Given that most effect sizes
   are substantially smaller than would be apparent from published
   research, there has been a widespread call to increase power by
   increasing sample size. We propose that, aside from increasing sample
   size, researchers can also increase power by boosting the effect size.
   If done correctly, removing participants, using covariates, and
   optimizing experimental designs, stimuli, and measures can boost effect
   size without inflating researcher degrees of freedom. In fact, careful
   planning of studies and analyses to maximize effect size is essential to
   be able to study many psychologically interesting phenomena when massive
   sample sizes are not feasible.

AB Consumers typically prefer freedom of choice, but when faced with a
   choice they might regret, they may prefer freedom from choice. Eight
   experiments show that people delegate difficult decisions, regardless of
   the decision's importance, and regardless of their potential surrogate's
   expertise. Delegation stems from a desire to avoid responsibility for
   potentially making the wrong choice rather than simply the desire to
   avoid the possibility of a poor outcome: although anticipated
   disappointment with the outcome and anticipated regret about one's
   decision both contribute to the decision to delegate, only anticipated
   regret directly leads people to delegate choices to others.
   Consequently, delegation is an appealing method for coping with
   difficult choices while allowing consumers to retain the benefits of
   choosing that they would forgo by opting out of the choice. Moreover,
   giving people the option to delegate makes them less prone to walk away
   from difficult choices empty-handed.

AB Feeling crowded in a shopping environment can decrease consumers'

   However, the present research suggests that a crowded environment can
   sometimes have a positive impact on consumer behavior. Although feeling
   crowded motivates consumers to avoid interacting with others, it leads
   them to become more attached to brands as an alternative way of
   maintaining their basic need for belongingness. The effect does not
   occur (a) when the crowding environment is composed of familiar people
   (and, therefore, is not considered aversive); (b) when individuals have
   an interdependent self-construal (and consequently, high tolerance for
   crowdedness); (c) when people are accompanied by friends in the crowded
   environment; (d) when the social function of the brands is made salient;
   (e) when people have never used the brand before; or (f) when the brand
   is referred to as a general product rather than a specific brand.

AB Mistakes are often undesirable and frequently result in negative

   Consequently, research suggests that information about mistakes is
   rarely shared with consumers. However, we find that consumers actually
   prefer products that were made by mistake to otherwise identical
   products that were made intentionally. This preference arises because
   consumers perceive that a product made by mistake is more improbable
   relative to a product made intentionally, and thus, view the product as
   more unique. We find converging evidence for this preference in a field
   study, six experiments, and eBay auction sales. Importantly, this
   preference holds regardless of whether the mistake enhances or detracts
   from the product. However, in domains where consumers do not value
   uniqueness (e.g., utilitarian goods), the preference is eliminated.

AB A product's front face (e.g., a watch face or car front) is typically
   the first point of contact and a key determinant of a consumer's initial
   impression about the product. Drawing on evolutionary accounts of human
   face perception suggesting that the face width-to-height ratio (f WHR:
   bizygomatic width divided by upper-face height) can signal dominance and
   affect its overall evaluation, this research is based on the premise
   that product faces are perceived in much the same way as human faces.
   Five experiments tested this premise. Results suggest that like human
   faces, product faces with high (vs. low) f WHR are perceived as more
   dominant. However, while human faces with high f WHR are liked less,
   product faces with high f WHR are liked more as revealed by consumer
   preference and willingness-to-pay scores. The greater preference for the
   high f WHR product faces is motivated by the consumers' desire to
   enhance and signal their own dominant status as evidenced by the
   moderating effects of type of goal and of usage context. Brand managers
   and product designers may be particularly interested in these findings
   since a simple design feature can have potentially significant
   marketplace impact, as was also confirmed by the field data obtained
   from secondary sources.

AB Five studies provide converging evidence for the joint effect of
   perceived economic mobility and socioeconomic status (SES) on
   compensatory behavior, such that low SES consumers who perceive low
   economic mobility (i.e., economically stuck consumers) seek more variety
   than other consumers. We trace this effect to these consumers' desire to
   compensate for their low sense of personal control. Furthermore, we show
   that these consumers' variety-seeking tendency disappears when their
   sense of control is boosted by other means or when the more varied
   option is not associated with a sense of control. Alternative
   explanations based on instrumental benefits, reactance, and affect were
   tested and did not account for the effect. Thus, the current research
   provides fresh insights to consumer research by contributing to the

AB People often share their experiences with others who were not originally
   present, which provides them with both personal and interpersonal
   benefits. However, most prior work on this form of sharing has examined
   the decision to share one's experience only after the experience is
   over. We investigate a distinct, unexplored aspect of the sharing
   process: when the decision to share is already salient during an
   experience and hence can impact the experience itself. We examine this
   research question within the context of photo-taking, an increasingly
   ubiquitous and integral part of people's experiences. Across two field
   and three laboratory studies, we find that relative to taking pictures
   for oneself (e.g., to preserve one's memories), taking pictures with the
   intention to share them with others (e.g., to post on social media)
   reduces enjoyment of experiences. This effect occurs because taking
   photos with the intention to share increases self-presentational concern
   during the experience, which can reduce enjoyment directly, as well as
   indirectly by lowering engagement with the experience. We identify
   several factors that moderate the effect of photo-taking goals on
   enjoyment, such as individual differences in the extent to which
   individuals care about how others perceive them and the closeness of the
   intended audience.

AB With the ever-increasing number of options from which consumers can
   choose, many decisions are made in stages. Whether using decision tools
   to sort, screen, and eliminate options, or intuitively trying to reduce
   the complexity of a choice, consumers often reach a decision by making
   sequential, attribute-level choices. The current article explores how
   the order in which attribute-level choices are made in such multistage
   decisions affects how consumers mentally represent and categorize their
   chosen option. The authors find that attribute choices made in the
   initial stage play a dominant role in how the ultimately chosen option
   is mentally represented, while later attribute choices serve only to
   update and refine the representation of that option. Across 13 studies
   (six of which are reported in the supplemental online materials), the
   authors find that merely changing the order of attribute choices in
   multistage decision processes alters how consumers (1) describe the
   chosen option, (2) perceive its similarity to other available options,
   (3) categorize it, (4) intend to use it, and (5) replace it. Thus, while
   the extant decision-making literature has mainly explored how mental
   representations and categorization impact choice, the current article
   demonstrates the reverse: that the choice process itself can impact
   mental representations.

AB Consumer researchers tend to equate successful marketization-the
   transition from a socialist to a capitalist economy-with the consensual
   acquiescence to an idealized definition of the socialist past. For this
   reason, little research has examined how memories about socialism
   influence marketization over time. To redress this gap, we bring prior
   consumer research on commercial mythmaking and popular memory to bear on
   an in-depth analysis of the marketization of the former German
   Democratic Republic. We find that, owing to a progressive sequence of
   conflicts between commercialized memories of socialism promoted by
   marketing agents and countermemories advocating socialism as a political
   alternative, definitions of the past, and by extension, capitalism's
   hegemony are subject to ongoing contestation and change. Our theoretical
   framework of hegemonic memory making explains relationships among
   consumption, memory making, and market systems that have not been
   recognized by prior research on consumption and nostalgia.

AB Sensorimotor experiences of going against the flow can affect the

   experience the sensation of going against the flow pick alternatives
   that are normatively not preferred (experiments 1a and 1b). These
   effects are evident only when the sensations are dynamic and

   information is supplied (experiment 5). Experiences of going against the
   flow typically involve both movement and direction and are represented
   in memory schematically. Re-experiencing these sensations leads to the
   activation of this schematic representation and elicits a feeling-based
   behavioral disposition to do something different, or to go against one's
   initial inclination (experiment 3), leading participants to pick an
   option that is normatively not preferred.

AB The success of new incongruent products hinges largely on whether
   consumers can efficiently make sense of the product. One of the most
   efficient ways that people make sense of new objects is through
   feature-based association. Such associations often incorporate an
   enabler (e.g., the color green) to help make sense of a semantically
   related feature (e.g., vitamin enriched). Evidence from three studies
   suggests that marketers can strategically incorporate enablers in
   product design to help consumers make sense of an extremely incongruent
   feature. As a result, consumers tend to reflect more favorably on the
   product. Furthermore, the authors find that even if the enabler itself
   is incongruent and leads to lower evaluations on its own, when combined
   with an atypical feature the effect can still be positive. Thus, a small
   but semantically meaningful adjustment in design can help marketers
   successfully introduce extremely incongruent innovations.

AB The consumer Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to revolutionize
   consumer experience. Because consumers can actively interact with smart
   objects, the traditional, human-centric conceptualization of consumer
   experience as consumers' internal subjective responses to branded
   objects may not be sufficient to conceptualize consumer experience in
   the IoT. Smart objects possess their own unique capacities and their own
   kinds of experiences in interaction with the consumer and each other. A
   conceptual framework based on assemblage theory and object-oriented
   ontology details how consumer experience and object experience emerge in
   the IoT. This conceptualization is anchored in the context of
   consumer-object assemblages, and defines consumer experience by its
   emergent properties, capacities, and agentic and communal roles
   expressed in interaction. Four specific consumer experience assemblages
   emerge: enabling experiences, comprising agentic self-extension and
   communal self-expansion, and constraining experiences, comprising
   agentic self-restriction and communal self-reduction. A parallel
   conceptualization of the construct of object experience argues that it
   can be accessed by consumers through object-oriented anthropomorphism, a
   nonhuman-centric approach to evaluating the expressive roles objects
   play in interaction. Directions for future research are derived, and
   consumer researchers are invited to join a dialogue about the important
   themes underlying our framework.

AB Interruptions during consumer decision making are ubiquitous. In seven
   studies, we examine the consequences of a brief interruption during a
   financial risk decision. We identify a fundamental feature inherent in
   an interruption's temporal structure-a repeat exposure to the decision
   stimuli- and find that this reexposure reduces decision stimuli's
   subjective novelty. This reduced novelty in turn reduces decision
   makers' apprehension and increases the amount of risk they take in a
   wide range of risky financial decision contexts. Consistent with our
   theoretical framework, this interruption effect disappears when a
   stimulus's subjective novelty is restored after an interruption. We
   further find that these consequences are often unique to interruptions
   are often do not result from other interventions (e.g., time pressure
   and elongated thinking); this is because an interruption's unique
   temporal structure (which results in a repeat exposure to the decision
   stimuli) underlies its consequences. Our findings shed light on how and
   when interruptions during decision making can influence risk taking.

AB This research examines the effectiveness of public recognition in
   encouraging charitable giving, demonstrating that public recognition can
   sometimes decrease donations. While previous work has largely shown that
   making donations visible to others can motivate donors, the present
   research shows that the effectiveness of public recognition depends on
   whether potential donors are under an independent (i.e., separate from
   others) or interdependent (i.e., connected with others) self-construal.
   Across seven experimental studies, an independent self-construal
   decreases donation intentions and amounts when the donor will receive
   public recognition compared to when the donation will remain private.
   This effect is driven by the activation of an agentic motive, wherein
   independents are motivated to make decisions that are guided by their
   own goals and self-interests, rather than being influenced by the
   opinions and expectations of others. This research contributes to the
   understanding of the nuanced roles of both public recognition and
   self-construal in predicting donation behavior.

AB Digital goods are, in many cases, substantive innovations relative to
   their physical counterparts. Yet, in five experiments, people ascribed
   less value to digital than to physical versions of the same good.
   Research participants paid more for, were willing to pay more for, and
   were more likely to purchase physical goods than equivalent digital
   goods, including souvenir photographs, books (fiction and nonfiction),
   and films. Participants valued physical goods more than digital goods
   whether their value was elicited in an incentive compatible
   pay-what-you-want paradigm, with willingness to pay, or with purchase
   intention. Greater capacity for physical than digital goods to garner an
   association with the self (i.e., psychological ownership) underlies the
   greater value ascribed to physical goods. Differences in psychological
   ownership for physical and digital goods mediated the difference in
   their value. Experimentally manipulating antecedents and consequents of
   psychological ownership (i.e., expected ownership, identity relevance,
   perceived control) bounded this effect, and moderated the mediating role
   of psychological ownership. The findings show how features of objects
   influence their capacity to garner psychological ownership before they
   are acquired, and provide theoretical and practical insights for the
   marketing, psychology, and economics of digital and physical goods.

AB This article introduces the fresh start mindset, defined as a belief
   that people can make a new start, get a new beginning, and chart a new
   course in life, regardless of their past or present circumstances. With
   historical roots in American culture and neoliberalism, and with
   contemporary links to liquid modernity and global consumer culture, this
   mindset structures reasoning, experience, and everyday language, and
   guides behavior across self- and other-transformative consumption
   domains. We develop a six-item scale (FSM) to measure the fresh start
   mindset and situate it within a broader nomological network, including
   growth mindset, personal capacity for change, optimism, future temporal
   focus, internal locus of control, self-efficacy, perseverance,
   resilience, and consumer variety seeking. Individuals with a stronger
   (vs. weaker) fresh start mindset invest in transformative change through
   changing their circumstances, including their own consumption choices
   (e.g., buying a new pair of sunglasses and getting a new self); they
   also are more supportive of transformative programs that assist those
   who are challenged to get a fresh start (i.e., disadvantaged youth,
   at-risk teens, veterans, and tax-burdened adults). Our work
   significantly contributes to transformative consumer research with
   attention to self-activities and programs for vulnerable populations
   that enable new beginnings.

AB Women engage in a variety of beauty practices, or "beauty work," to
   enhance their physical appearance, such as applying cosmetics, tanning,
   or exercising. Although the rewards of physical attractiveness are well
   documented, perceptions of both the women who engage in efforts to
   enhance their appearance and the high-effort beauty products marketed to
   them are not well understood. Across seven studies, we demonstrate that
   consumers judge women who engage in certain types of extensive beauty
   work as possessing poorer moral character. These judgments occur only
   for effortful beauty work perceived as transformative (significantly
   altering appearance) and transient (lasting a relatively short time),
   such that they emerge within cosmetics and tanning, yet not skincare or
   exercise. This effect is mediated by the perception that putting high
   effort into one's appearance signals a willingness to misrepresent one's
   true self, and translates into lower purchase intentions for
   higher-effort cosmetics. We identify several boundary conditions,
   including the attractiveness of the woman performing the beauty work and
   whether the effort is attributed to external norms or causes. In
   examining how beauty work elicits moral judgments, we also shed light on
   why effortful cosmetic use is viewed negatively, yet effortful products
   continue to be commercially successful.

AB Psychological ownership, or the feeling that something is mine, has
   garnered growing attention in marketing. While previous work focuses on
   the positive aspects of psychological ownership, this research draws
   attention to the darker side of psychological ownership-territorial
   behavior. Results of five experimental studies demonstrate that when
   consumers feel psychological ownership of a target, they are prone to
   perceptions of infringement and subsequent territorial responses when
   they infer that another individual feels ownership of the same target.
   Potential infringers are held less accountable when they acknowledge
   ownership prior to engaging in otherwise threatening behaviors, and when
   they could not be expected to know that a target is owned, as it was not
   clearly marked. In addition, high narcissists are subject to a
   psychological ownership metaperception bias, and are thus more apt than
   low narcissists to perceive infringement. A multitude of territorial
   responses are documented for both tangible (coffee, sweater, chair,
   pizza) and intangible (a design) targets of ownership. Further,
   consumers infer the psychological ownership of others from signals of
   the antecedents of psychological ownership: control, investment of self,
   and intimate knowledge. Theoretical implications for territoriality and
   psychological ownership are discussed, along with managerial
   implications and areas for future research.

AB Consumers' choices are often accompanied by unrelated incidental moods.
   The positive mood caused by receiving a compliment, for example, may
   persist when one is choosing what service to book or which product to
   buy. How might being in a positive mood affect consumers' subsequent,
   unrelated choices? The present research demonstrates that being in a
   positive mood can make consumers more likely to defer choice. Four
   studies show that when choosing requires trade-offs between important
   choice attributes, being in a positive (vs. neutral) mood makes choosing
   more difficult and therefore increases the likelihood of deferring
   choice altogether. The findings further understanding of how incidental
   factors shape choice processes and outcomes and the role of emotions in

AB According to the dual entitlement principle, consumers find it fair for
   firms to price asymmetrically to cost changes-that is, for firms to
   increase prices when costs increase but maintain prices when costs
   decrease. However, a meta-analysis reveals asymmetric pricing is less
   prevalent in collectivistic (vs. individualistic) countries (study 1).
   We propose a fairness-based explanation, demonstrating that
   interdependent consumers in collectivistic cultures perceive asymmetric
   pricing to be less fair than do independent consumers in individualistic
   cultures (studies 2, 4, and 5). We attribute this cultural variation to
   culture-specific relationship norms. Specifically, we argue that while
   the practice of asymmetric pricing is consistent with the exchange norms
   among independent consumers that emphasize self-interest pursuit, it is
   inconsistent with the communal norms among interdependent consumers
   mandating firm benevolence. Supporting this argument, we find that (a)
   directly manipulating communal (vs. exchange) norms yields similar
   differences in fairness perceptions that mimic those due to culture
   (study 3), (b) the cultural differences are mediated by the communal
   mandate for firm benevolence (study 4), and (c) the cultural differences
   are mitigated when a firm frames asymmetric pricing as benevolent (study
   5). We conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial
   implications of these findings.

AB The authors conduct four controlled lab experiments and one field study
   in a brick-and-mortar grocery store to demonstrate that relative
   spending-the price of the purchased item relative to the mean price of
   the product category-evolves nonlinearly and distinctly for budget and
   nonbudget shoppers. While the relative spending of budget shoppers
   evolves in a concave manner, the relative spending of nonbudget shoppers
   evolves inversely in a convex manner. Thus, budget (nonbudget) shoppers
   spend relatively more (less) in the middle than at the beginning and
   toward the end of their shopping trip. Mediation analyses confirm that
   the pain of paying experienced while shopping drives price salience,
   which then drives relative spending. Moreover, manipulating shoppers'
   pain of paying, by altering the opportunity costs associated with their
   spending or drawing shoppers' attention to their spending via real-time
   spending feedback, is shown to influence these spending patterns. The
   research offers theoretical contributions to the in-store
   decision-making, budgeting, and pain-of-paying literature and has
   important implications for marketing and promotion strategies in retail
   and mobile technology environments, as it suggests when a shopper may be

AB Though perceived financial well-being is viewed as an important topic of
   consumer research, the literature contains no accepted definition of
   this construct. Further, there has been little systematic examination of
   how perceived financial well-being may affect overall well-being. Using
   consumer financial narratives, several large-scale surveys, and two
   experiments, we conceptualize perceived financial wellbeing as two
   related but separate constructs: 1) stress related to the management of
   money today (current money management stress), and 2) a sense of
   security in one's financial future (expected future financial security).
   We develop and validate measures of these constructs (web appendix A)
   and then demonstrate their relationship to overall well-being,
   controlling for other life domains and objective measures of the
   financial domain. Our findings demonstrate that perceived financial
   well-being is a key predictor of overall well-being and comparable in
   magnitude to the combined effect of other life domains (job
   satisfaction, physical health assessment, and relationship support
   satisfaction). Further, the relative importance of current money
   management stress to overall well-being varies by income groups and due
   to the differing antecedents of current money management stress and
   expected future financial security. Implications for financial
   well-being and education efforts are offered.

AB While joint ethical violations are fairly common in the marketplace and
   in workplace, sports-team, and academic settings, little research has
   studied such collaborative wrongdoings. This work compares the joint
   ethical decisions of pairs of people (i.e., dyads) to those of
   individual decision makers. Four experiments demonstrate that dyads in
   which the partners do not share a social bond with each other behave
   less ethically than individuals do. The authors propose that this effect
   occurs because joint ethical violations offer a means to socially bond
   with others. Consistent with this theory, they demonstrate that the
   dyads' subethicality relative to individuals is attenuated (1) if the
   dyad partners establish rapport prior to the joint decision making, and
   (2) in decision-making contexts in which social bonding goals are less
   active-namely, making a decision with an outgroup versus in-group
   member. Taken together, this research provides novel theoretical
   insights into the social aspects of unethical behavior, offers
   suggestions to improve ethicality in joint decisions, and raises
   important questions for future research.

   thought the same amount of money could buy more when it belonged to

   products. Participants also believed their money-in the form of
   donations, taxes, fines, and fees-would help charities and governments
   more than others' money. We tested six mechanisms based on psychological
   distance, the endowment effect, wishful thinking, better-than-average
   biases, pain of payment, and beliefs about product preferences. Only a
   psychological distance mechanism received support. Specifically, we
   found that the perceived purchasing power of other people's money
   decreased logarithmically as others' psychological distance from the
   self increased, consistent with psychological distance's subadditive
   property. Further supporting a psychological distance mechanism, we
   found that framing one's own money as distant (vs. near) reduced the

AB We examine how construal levels affect wait duration judgments through
   two different routes: one based on consumers' subjective feelings (an
   affective route) and the other based on mental markers (a cognitive
   route). We further identify the conditions under which the affective
   versus the cognitive route operates. We theorize that low-level
   construal people generate more wait-unrelated thoughts during the wait
   than high-level construal people. This difference in turn affects
   duration judgments in opposite directions depending on the judgment
   strategy that people use. People spontaneously rely on their subjective
   feelings-how long they feel they have waited. In this case, low-(vs.
   high-) level construal consumers, who are more distracted by their
   wait-unrelated thoughts, find the wait to be less boring and hence judge
   it to be shorter. However, when subjective feelings become less
   accessible (after a delay) or diagnostic (perceived as less
   trustworthy), or when mental markers become more accessible, people
   resort to the number of thoughts they had during the wait to infer the
   duration-the more thoughts they had, the longer it must have been. In
   this case, low-(vs. high-) level construal people perceive the wait to
   be longer. Results from five studies support the proposed framework.

AB This research documents a systematic bias in memory for ethical
   attribute information: consumers have better memory for an ethical
   attribute when a product performs well on the attribute versus when a
   product performs poorly on the attribute. Because consumers want to
   avoid emotionally difficult ethical information (e.g., child labor) but
   believe they should remember it in order to do the right thing, the
   presence of negative ethical information in a choice or evaluation
   produces conflict between the want and should selves. Consumers resolve
   this conflict by letting the want self prevail and forgetting or
   misremembering the negative ethical information. A series of studies
   establishes the willfully ignorant memory effect, shows that it holds
   only for ethical attributes and not for other attributes, and provides
   process evidence that it is driven by consumers allowing the want self
   to prevail in order to avoid negative feelings associated with the
   conflict. We also ameliorate the effect by reducing the amount of
   pressure exerted by the should self. Lastly, we demonstrate that
   consumers judge forgetting negative ethical information as more morally
   acceptable than remembering but ignoring it, suggesting that willfully
   ignorant memory is a more morally acceptable form of coping with
   want/should conflict.

AB How well can consumers predict future liking of different product
   designs? The present research identifies a systematic error in
   consumers' preferences and predicted liking for product aesthetics.
   Consumers predict a faster decrease in liking for high-(vs. low-)
   arousal-potential product designs (i.e., intense colors or intense
   patterns) over repeat exposure because high-arousal-potential designs
   are expected to become increasingly irritating. These predictions are
   misguided, however, falsely leading consumers to avoid products with
   high-arousal-potential designs when making a decision for extended
   product use. Seven studies test this conceptualization in the laboratory
   and in the field. The first five studies examine predicted liking for
   product designs of varying arousal potential levels over repeat exposure
   and how these intuitions influence product design preferences for
   long(versus short-) term use. The last two studies then investigate the
   accuracy of these intuitions by directly comparing predicted versus
   experienced liking for product designs of varying arousal potential
   levels over repeat exposure. The studies reveal a systematic error in
   prediction whereby consumers overestimate satiation from
   high-arousal-potential product designs. Managerial and theoretical
   applications are also discussed.

AB Why are people often uncomfortable dealing with financial decisions? We
   propose that people perceive financial decisions-more so than decisions
   in many other equally complex and important domains-as compatible with a
   cold, analytical mode of thinking and as highly incompatible with
   feelings and emotions. Consequently, the more people perceive themselves
   as inclined to rely on affect in their decisions, the more they
   experience self-concept incongruity with financial decisions (i.e.,
   feeling that financial decisions are "not them"), and consequently show
   an increased tendency to avoid such decisions. Five studies demonstrate
   this phenomenon, using both consequential and hypothetical decisions;
   provide evidence for the proposed mechanism; and rule out alternative
   accounts, including perceived financial knowledge, expertise and
   self-efficacy perceptions, decision confidence, and preference for
   numerical information. The findings contribute to research on thinking
   styles and decision avoidance, and they underscore a unique
   characteristic of financial decisions that makes them stand out among
   many other decision types. In addition to their theoretical
   significance, the findings have practical implications for the
   communication of financial products and services.

AB Framing a contract's cost as a series of payments over time structures
   how people mentally account for the contract's benefits. For example,
   when people are asked to donate to a charity once a year (aggregate
   pricing), they imagine the benefits they will feel from a single, large
   donation. In contrast, if the charity frames its request in terms of the
   equivalent daily donation (periodic pricing), people consider the
   benefits from making many smaller donations, which is often a more
   enticing prospect than a single gift. Eight lab experiments and a field
   test examine how periodic pricing influences purchase intentions.
   Periodic prices can increase perceived benefits, particularly when
   people value the first few units of a product each more than additional
   units of consumption. More frequent payments can help people appreciate
   recurring pleasures and increase the likelihood of purchasing.

AB Although much research has investigated why and how impulsive
   individuals indulge, little research has explored the conditions under
   which non-impulsive consumers do. This research examines the effects of
   the salience of the notion "rare," or low frequency, on the tendency to
   indulge. The authors find that when the notion of rarity is salient,
   non-impulsive consumers' tendency to indulge increases, but it does not
   affect indulgence tendencies of impulsive consumers. This effect occurs
   because, for non-impulsives, the actual act of indulging is a relatively
   rare occurrence-it is something that happens with low frequency. This
   means that they have formed a strong association between the concepts of
   rarity and indulgence. Thus, for these individuals, making the concept
   of rarity salient activates the concept of indulgence. Nine studies
   provide evidence for this association and its downstream consequences.
   Contributions emerge for the literatures on impulsivity and
   self-control.

AB People can be surprisingly insensitive to quantities in valuation
   judgments-a phenomenon called scope insensitivity, which is generally
   attributed to the operation of affective processes in judgment. Building
   on research showing that affect is inherently a decision-making system
   of the present, we propose that scope insensitivity is more likely to be
   observed in decisions that are psychologically proximate to the
   immediate self. Consistent with this proposition, results from seven
   experiments (and two replications) show that scope insensitivity is more
   prevalent in decisions that are temporally proximate, both prospectively
   (near future vs. distant future) and retrospectively (recent past vs.
   distant past), and in decisions that are psychologically proximate in
   terms of social or physical distance. In addition to clarifying the
   boundaries of the scope-insensitivity phenomenon, these findings help
   refine our understanding of the affective system of judgment.
   Specifically, the findings suggest that the affective system of judgment
   and decision making is not just a system of the present, it is more
   generally a system of the immediate self. Any form of distance from the
   immediate self (in time, social relation, or physical space) tends to
   attenuate the engagement of the overall affective system.

AB Low-warmth actors are often assumed to lack communal (or other-oriented)
   intentions, even when acting generously. Low-warmth donors must
   therefore send stronger signals of their communal intent when donating
   to receive the same amount of charitable credit as high-warmth donors.
   Because goods are linked with communal norms, we find that donating
   goods allows low-warmth donors to signal communal intent and increase
   charitable credit received. Study 1 establishes that low-warmth donors
   receive less credit for unspecified donations than their high-warmth
   counterparts. Studies 2A and 2B show that goods donations, compared to
   equally valued monetary or unspecified donations, increase charitable
   credit for low-warmth donors. Studies 3A and 3B show that donating goods
   boosts charitable credit for low-warmth donors in particular;
   high-warmth donors are assumed to have communal intentions, and receive
   large amounts of credit, regardless of donation type. Finally, study 4
   shows that low-warmth donors can increase charitable credit for monetary
   donations by describing the donation in communal terms-specifically, as
   a gift. This research has clear practical implications. For example,
   many corporations are viewed as low warmth, and most corporate donations
   are monetary, yet companies always have the option to donate goods
   instead.

AB As consumers' political opinions become more divided and more central to
   their identities, it is important to understand how political ideology
   shapes consumers' attempts to differentiate from others in the
   marketplace. Seven studies demonstrate that political ideology
   systematically influences consumers' preferences for differentiation.
   Conservative ideology leads consumers to differentiate from others
   vertically in the social hierarchy through products that signal that
   they are better than others, and liberal ideology leads consumers to
   differentiate from others horizontally in the social hierarchy through
   products that signal that they are unique from others. This happens
   because conservatism endorses, and liberalism opposes, the belief that
   the dominance-based hierarchical social structure is a legitimate
   mechanism to distinguish individual qualities. The effect is robust
   across measured and manipulated ideology, hypothetical and real product
   choices, and online searches in conservative and liberal US states.
   Manipulating consumers' differentiation goals and perceptions of
   hierarchy legitimacy mitigates the effect. The findings advance existing
   research on political ideology, social hierarchy, and consumer
   divergence, and they contribute to marketing practice.

AB Consumer movements are resolute and persistent efforts by organized
   consumer collectives to reimagine elements of consumer culture. Such
   movements often use creative public performances to promote their causes
   and to make movement participation more ludic and fun. However,
   collective creativity within consumer movements has rarely been an
   explicit focus of research. Using ethnographic methods and assemblage
   theory, this study elaborates how collective creativity organizes a
   consumer movement and facilitates its quest for market change. Findings
   show how the Restaurant Day movement initially emerged as a resistant
   response to market tensions relating to constraining food culture
   regulation in a Nordic market context. Findings then illuminate the
   movement's appropriation of collective creativity as its chief mode of
   organization and participation. Collective creativity builds on
   iterative and co-constituting deterritorializing and territorializing
   processes of consumer production that fuel transformative and
   explorative creativity, respectively, within the market context. The
   study provides new insights to consumer movement mobilization,
   organization, member recruitment, and market legitimacy. The study also
   provides novel theoretical insights to the study of consumer creativity.

AB This research studies a fundamental and seemingly straightforward
   question: Can basic advertising elements, such as the presence of
   attractive imagery, have uncontrollable effects on consumers' attitudes
   and consumption decisions? Answering this question is methodologically
   challenging, because the presence of an uncontrollable process can be
   masked by a simultaneously operating controllable process. We argue
   first that existing methods conflate the contribution of both processes
   and are therefore unable to measure the presence of an uncontrollable
   process reliably. To solve the conundrum, we present a novel application
   of processing tree modeling. Evaluative conditioning is employed as a
   paradigm to study the influence of affective visual stimuli on attitudes
   and behavior. Across six experiments, we demonstrate the validity of the
   model parameters estimating controllable and uncontrollable processes.
   As predicted, the parameter estimate of the controllable process is
   susceptible to cognitive resources and levels of motivation to exert
   control. The parameter estimate of the uncontrollable process appears
   unaffected by these factors. We also demonstrate the external validity
   of our findings and their relevance to stimuli and instructions typical
   for consumer research. Finally, we find that controllable and
   uncontrollable processes are both predictive of product choice and
   consumption. We discuss implications for consumer protection.

AB Although previous research suggests that there are hedonic and
   interpersonal benefits to gifting experiences, consumers often give
   material gifts rather than experiential gifts. Exploring this mismatch,
   the current research examines when and why consumers prefer to give
   material versus experiential gifts. The authors propose that gift givers
   are more likely to give experiential gifts to socially close recipients
   than socially distant recipients. Since experiences are perceived as
   more unique than material goods, givers perceive that choosing an
   experiential gift requires more specific knowledge of a recipient's
   preferences to avoid the greater social risk of giving a poorly matched
   gift. Eight studies provide converging evidence for the proposed effect
   of social distance on gift preference and demonstrate that this effect
   is driven by a giver's knowledge of a recipient's preferences. Further
   supporting the mechanism of preference knowledge, the effect of social
   distance is moderated by the social risk associated with experiential
   gifts. When experiences contain little social risk-and thus require less
   knowledge of a recipient-the effect of social distance is significantly
   mitigated. Together, these results provide answers for why consumers
   often prefer to give material gifts over experiences, despite the
   advantage of giving experiences.

AB The present research explores how financial status, which influences
   consumers' expectations about how companies will treat them, affects
   consumers' perceptions and assessments of products that have been given
   anthropomorphic features by companies. Studies 1 and 2 showed that
   participants with higher financial status expect more favorable
   treatment from a humanized entity (e.g., "a self-driving car would
   prioritize the well-being of the rich over others"). The results of
   study 3 indicate that participants with higher perceived financial
   status both afforded greater agency to humanized products and liked
   these products better than did participants with lower perceived
   financial status. These effects were mediated by commercial treatment
   expectations, when we controlled for perceived control and
   self-efficacy. Further confirming the role of treatment expectations,
   when participants believed people with low financial status would be
   treated better than those with high financial status, we observed the
   reverse pattern (study 4). Lastly, study 5 replicated the effect using a
   measured, not manipulated, variable of financial status. Findings
   support the view that effective anthropomorphism requires marketers to
   take into account consumers' motivation to interpret a target with
   humanlike features as having positive agency, which results from
   treatment expectations.

AB Prior consumer research has investigated the consumer behavior, identity
   work, and sources of ethnic group conflict among various immigrants and
   indigenes. However, by continuing to focus on consumers' lived
   experiences, researchers lack theoretical clarity on the institutional
   shaping of these individuals as ethnic consumers, which has important
   implications for sustaining neocolonial power imbalances between
   colonized (immigrant-sending) and colonizing (immigrant-receiving)
   cultures. We bring sociological theories of neoliberal governmentality
   and multiculturalism to bear on an in-depth analysis of the contemporary
   Canadian marketplace to reveal our concept of market-mediated
   multiculturation, which we define as an institutional mechanism for
   attenuating ethnic group conflicts through which immigrant-receiving
   cultures fetishize strangers and their strangeness in their
   commodification of differences, and the existence of inequalities
   between ethnicities is occluded. Specifically, our findings unpack four
   interrelated consumer socialization strategies (envisioning,
   exemplifying, equipping, and embodying) through which institutional
   actors across different fields (politics, market research, retail, and
   consumption) shape an ethnic consumer subject. We conclude with a
   critical discussion of extant scholarship on consumer acculturation as
   being complicit in sustaining entrenched colonialist biases.

AB Culturally oriented consumer research has predominantly been framed by
   two ideal types of reflexivity, which we characterize as existential and
   critical reflexivity. Drawing from our research on divorced women who
   have been displaced from their domestically oriented, middle-class
   lifestyles, we develop an alternative conceptualization-reactive
   reflexivity-that highlights a different relationship among consumer
   agency, social structures, and identity goals and practices. Rather than
   embracing their post-divorce lifestyles as a revitalizing challenge (per
   existential reflexivity) or liberation from a constraining gender role
   (per critical reflexivity), our participants felt estranged from their
   current lifestyle and reflexively viewed their pre-divorce lifestyle as
   a structure of relative empowerment that had afforded emotional,
   aesthetic, and status-oriented benefits. In reflexive response to these
   perceived lifestyle discontinuities, they engaged in discordant
   practices of taste that sought to insulate their aesthetic
   predispositions from structurally imposed socioeconomic constraints and,
   ultimately, to accomplish a reactive identity goal of regaining their
   displaced status as middle-class homemakers. We discuss the implications
   of our analysis for theorizations of consumer taste and the
   relationships between gender ideologies and reflexive consumption
   practices.

AB In everyday life, people are often faced with choices between tasks of
   varying levels of urgency and importance. How do people choose?
   Normatively speaking, people may choose to perform urgent tasks with
   short completion windows, instead of important tasks with larger
   outcomes, because important tasks are more difficult and further away
   from goal completion, urgent tasks involve more immediate and certain
   payoffs, or people want to finish the urgent tasks first and then work
   on important tasks later. The current research identifies a mere urgency
   effect, a tendency to pursue urgency over importance even when these
   normative reasons are controlled for. Specifically, results from five
   experiments demonstrate that people are more likely to perform
   unimportant tasks (i.e., tasks with objectively lower payoffs) over
   important tasks (i.e., tasks with objectively better payoffs), when the
   unimportant tasks are characterized merely by spurious urgency (e.g., an
   illusion of expiration). The mere urgency effect documented in this
   research violates the basic normative principle of dominance-choosing
   objectively worse options over objectively better options. People behave
   as if pursuing an urgent task has its own appeal, independent of its
   objective consequence.

AB Across many different contexts, individuals consult customer ratings to
   inform their purchase decisions. The present studies document a novel
   phenomenon, dubbed "the binary bias," which plays an important role in
   how individuals evaluate customer reviews. Our main proposal is that
   people tend to make a categorical distinction between positive ratings
   (e.g., 4s and 5s) and negative ratings (e.g., 1s and 2s). However,
   within those bins, people do not sufficiently distinguish between more
   extreme values (5s and 1s) and less extreme values (4s and 2s). As a
   result, people's subjective representations of distributions are heavily
   impacted by the extent to which those distributions are imbalanced
   (having more 4s and 5s vs. more 1s and 2s). Ten studies demonstrate that
   this effect has important consequences for people's product evaluations
   and purchase decisions. Additionally, we show this effect is not driven
   by the salience of particular bars, unrealistic distributions, certain
   statistical properties of a distribution, or diminishing subjective
   utility. Furthermore, we demonstrate this phenomenon's relevance to
   other domains besides product reviews, and discuss the implications for
   existing research on how people integrate conflicting evidence.

AB When people seek to persuade others to purchase a particular product or
   service, they often give an extremely favorable review of it as a means
   of doing so. Despite the intuitive appeal of this strategy, the current
   research demonstrates that a moderately positive review is sometimes
   more persuasive. In particular, when the perceived default evaluation in
   a given context is extremely positive, moderately positive reviews that
   deviate from that default can become more persuasive. In contrast, when
   the perceived default is moderately positive, extremely positive reviews
   tend to be more persuasive. This deviation effect occurs because reviews
   that deviate from the perceived default are believed to be more
   thoughtful, and thus accurate, which enhances their persuasive impact.
   This effect is demonstrated in eight experiments set in a diverse range
   of consumer contexts.

AB This research investigates whether a contextual factor-social density,
   defined as the number of people in a given area-influences consumers'
   propensity to share information. We propose that high- (vs. low-)
   density settings make consumers experience a loss of perceived control,
   which in turn makes them more likely to engage in word of mouth to
   restore it. Six studies, conducted online as well as in laboratory and
   naturalistic settings, provide support for this hypothesis. We
   demonstrate that social density increases the likelihood of sharing
   information with others and that a person's chronic need for control
   moderates this effect. Consistent with the proposed process, the effect
   of social density on information sharing is attenuated when participants
   have the opportunity to restore control before they engage in word of
   mouth. We also provide evidence that sharing information restores
   perceived control in high- density environments, and we disentangle the
   effect of social density from that of physical proximity.

AB This research examines how people's mental accounting is influenced by
   their thinking style (analytic vs. holistic). Mental accounting
   literature shows that people mentally allocate their resources into
   certain accounts and track expenses against them. The current research,
   however, finds that while analytic thinkers show such "mental labeling
   effect," the holistic thinkers' mental accounting system is flexible.
   Specifically, analytic thinkers limit their expenses of rebate money to
   similar category purchases, whereas holistic thinkers show preference
   for both similar and dissimilar category items (studies 1 and 2). Study
   3 shows the mental accounting divergence across analytic- and
   holistic-thinking groups by examining how they use mental accounting
   rules in spending gift cards (vs. cash). Study 4 exhibits the underlying
   psychological process in showing that this effect is attributed to
   differences in categorization flexibility between the analytic-and
   holistic-thinking groups. In addition, the above effects are moderated
   by product type. The divergence in mental accounting between analytic
   and holistic thinkers is mostly evident in utilitarian (vs. hedonic)
   consumption instances. Study 5 provides further insights into the
   moderation effect. The implications of these findings include divergence
   in cross-category effects of price promotions, and the effect of
   cross-market discounts between analytic and holistic thinkers.

AB The loss of a sense of humanness that stems from increasing
   mechanization, automation, and digitization gives firms an impetus to
   develop effective ways to humanize products. On the basis of knowledge
   activation theory, this article systematically investigates a novel
   humanization approach: the use of typefaces that appear to be
   handwritten. Across several laboratory and field studies, the authors
   provide evidence of the positive effect of handwritten typefaces, reveal
   the mechanisms that lead to these outcomes, and outline some boundary
   conditions. Specifically, the results show that handwritten typefaces
   create perceptions of human presence, which lead to more favorable
   product evaluations (and behavior) by enhancing the emotional attachment
   between the consumer and the product. However, these effects are
   mitigated for brands to which consumers already feel a sense of
   attachment. Finally, the effects reverse when the products are
   functionally positioned or functional in nature. The present article
   thus extends understanding of humanization processes and provides
   guidelines for how and when brands should use handwritten typefaces.

AB Many apps require consumers to evaluate products by swiping them to the
   right or left. This work explores whether product orientation affects
   the product evaluations communicated by swiping movements, compared with
   those made by pressing onscreen buttons. Building on stimulus-response
   compatibility (SRC) theory, which suggests that irrelevant product
   display features can activate certain behavioral responses when the
   product display and the behavioral response share a common dimension,
   this study predicts that the horizontal direction (left to right or
   right to left) cued by a product's orientation should facilitate a swipe
   movement in the congruent direction. Five studies indicate that when
   people use swiping movements to evaluate objects, their evaluations are
   influenced by the object's orientation, whereas evaluations conveyed
   through button presses reveal no orientation effect. The orientation
   effect for swiping responses also disappears when the objects contain a
   direction cue that is incongruent with their orientation, and when only
   one directional swipe movement is defined as a valid response option.
   Moreover, the effect holds for subjective evaluations but is eliminated
   for objective judgments, when these involve no time pressure.

AB The present research examines how hedonic and utilitarian purchase
   motivations influence consumers' perceptions of their product
   preferences and the resulting number of options they wish to consider
   when making a purchase. Across six studies, consumers choose to review
   larger assortments when their purchase motivation is hedonic rather than
   when their purchase motivation is utilitarian. This effect occurs
   because consumers with hedonic purchase motivations perceive their
   product preferences as highly unique compared to consumers with
   utilitarian purchase motivations. Higher perceived preference uniqueness
   increases the difficulty consumers anticipate in finding a
   preference-matching product, resulting in an expansion of the number of
   product alternatives to review. Further supporting the perceived
   preference uniqueness account, the documented effect is attenuated when
   product assortments are customized based on consumers' personal
   preferences and when a social similarity priming task is employed. These
   findings provide additional evidence on the distinction between hedonic
   and utilitarian purchase motivations, their impact on perceived
   preference uniqueness, and their implications for consumer decision
   making via assortment size choice.

AB When deciding whether to buy an item, consumers sometimes think about
   other ways they could spend their money. Past research has explored how
   increasing the salience of outside options (i.e., alternatives not
   immediately available in the choice set) influences purchase decisions,
   but whether the type of alternative considered systematically affects
   buying behavior remains an open question. Ten studies find that relative
   to considering alternatives that are similar to the target, considering
   dissimilar alternatives leads to a greater decrease in purchase intent
   for the target. When consumers consider a dissimilar alternative, a
   competing nonfocal goal is activated, which decreases the perceived
   importance of the focal goal served by the target option. Consistent
   with this proposed mechanism, the relative importance of the focal goal
   versus the nonfocal goal mediates the effect of alternative type on
   purchase intent, and the effect attenuates when the focal goal is
   shielded from activation of competing goals. We conclude with a
   discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of our
   findings.

AB Consumers often encounter product-related numerical information, such as
   attribute ratings and version numbers. This research demonstrates that a
   smaller (compared to a larger) numerical difference can increase
   perceived improvement and enhance product appeal. We find that when a
   product's version number or rating changes from a decimal number to an
   integer (e.g., 2.4 to 3), product appeal is enhanced compared to when
   the change is between two integers (e.g., 2 to 3), even though the
   latter difference is mathematically larger. This effect occurs when the
   meaning of the numerical information is unclear, leading consumers to
   try to infer what it represents. We suggest that a decimal number is
   inferred to be part of a fine-grained scale, in which decimals are the
   intermediate values and integers are endpoints or category boundaries.
   The switch from a decimal to an integer is therefore perceived as
   skipping over intermediate values and crossing a category boundary. This
   suggests that the product has made a substantive improvement, making it
   more appealing. A consecutive integer-to-integer change does not provide
   a cue to support such inferences. In five studies, we demonstrate the
   decimal-to-integer effect, its underlying process, and its boundary
   conditions.

AB The present research introduces the minimal deviation effect. We propose
   that numbers that are slightly above a numerical category boundary
   (e.g., 1,001 in comparison to 1,000), representing a salient violation
   of coherent numerical categories, are arousal-inducing, and that the
   heightened arousal can be misattributed to the incentive value of the
   focal product, thus increasing consumers' wanting but not liking.
   Results from nine experiments provide converging evidence to support our
   proposition. Specifically, we show that consumers are more likely to
   choose and willing to pay more for products associated with a number
   with minimal deviation from a categorical border, regardless of whether
   the number represents product quantity, brand name, or model series.
   Moreover, we find that the minimal deviation effect diminishes when
   people are already aroused or when they attribute the arousal to other
   sources. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect can be reversed when
   minimal deviation is embedded in certain attribute dimensions (e.g.,
   price), shedding more light on the circumstances under which the minimal
   deviation effect will occur.

AB Consumers gain choice closure when they perceive a sense of finality
   over a past decision and limit comparisons between the selected and the
   forgone options. We investigate consumers' ability to make strategic use
   of choice closure to enhance outcome satisfaction. Seven studies show
   that consumers experience greater satisfaction when they achieve choice
   closure with an inferior outcome and when they do not achieve choice
   closure with a superior outcome; however, they expect to be more
   satisfied by avoiding choice closure with an inferior outcome and by
   seeking it with a superior outcome. We provide a rationale for this
   experience-expectation contrast based on rule overgeneralization.
   Consumers form their expectation on an implicit rule learned and
   internalized in a context in which it is appropriate and advantageous:
   when they aim to increase satisfaction with a future choice. However,
   consumers erroneously apply the same implicit rule to a different
   context, one in which they aim to increase satisfaction with a past
   choice. We conclude that consumers are unlikely to be able to make
   strategic use of choice closure to enhance satisfaction with the outcome

AB This research focuses on the persuasive impact of a common yet
   understudied form of word of mouth (WOM): one-on-one conversations in
   which consumers share and compare past experiences with a product or
   service. In contrast to prior work on WOM influence, we discover a
   "positivity effect" in these conversations, such that consumers who
   share a negative experience form more favorable overall judgments after
   speaking with someone who had a positive experience, but consumers who
   share a positive experience are unaffected by learning about another's
   negative experience. This effect is mediated by consumers' dismissal of
   their own negative experience as a temporary or one-off event in light
   of the other person's contrasting positive experience, and is
   facilitated by positive consumer expectations of product and service
   performance. We also identify a key boundary condition whereby the
   positivity effect of one-on-one conversations is moderated by whether
   consumers have positive or negative expectations of product or service
   performance. When expectations are negative, the positivity effect is
   dampened and a negativity effect emerges.

   multidimensional scale to measure it. Prior socioeconomics and
   psychology research has uncovered correlates of local food preferences
   and offered some possible theoretical explanations. By synthesizing and
   expanding these past findings and perspectives, this research presents a
   tripartite framework for understanding locavorism in terms of three core
   belief dimensions: lionization of local foods, opposition to
   long-distance food systems, and communalization of food economies. Six
   studies provide support for this L-O-C framework and its validity.
   Survey, experimental, and field evidence demonstrate the scale's
   structure, as well as its discriminant, predictive, nomological, and
   known-group validity. In addition to choice and preference for local
   foods, the scale predicts evangelism and meaningfulness related to food
   advertisements. Altogether, this work provides a grounded view of
   locavorism, together with a measurement tool that food marketers may

AB Although past research has shown that anthropomorphism enhances
   consumers' attraction to a brand when social-connectedness or effectance
   motives are active, the current research demonstrates that
   anthropomorphizing a brand becomes a detrimental marketing strategy when
   consumers' distinctiveness motives are salient. Four studies show that
   anthropomorphizing a brand positioned to be distinctive diminishes
   consumers' sense of agency in identity expression. As a result, when
   distinctiveness goals are salient, consumers are less likely to evaluate
   anthropomorphized (vs. nonanthropomorphized) brands favorably and are
   less likely to choose them to express distinctiveness. This negative
   effect of brand anthropomorphism, however, is contingent on the brand's
   positioning strategy-brand-as-supporter (supporting consumers' desires
   to be different) versus brand-as-agent (communicating unique brand
   features instead of focusing on consumers' needs) versus
   brand-as-controller (limiting consumers' freedom in expressing
   distinctiveness). Our results demonstrate that an anthropomorphized
   brand-as-supporter enhances consumers' sense of agency in identity
   expression, compared to both an anthropomorphized brand-as-agent and an
   anthropomorphized brand-as-controller. In turn, enhancing or thwarting
   consumers' sense of agency in expressing their differences from others
   drives the differential impact of anthropomorphizing a brand positioned

   consumption? This research investigates the malleability of older
   consumers' feel-age and the underlying mechanisms by focusing on the
   influence of contextual social cues and the downstream effects on
   consumption behavior. Five studies provide evidence that the mere
   presence of young social cues triggers an identity threat for older
   consumers; and feeling younger is a way to protect the self from
   negative stereotypes associated with aging. By contrast, young consumers
   are relatively immune to age-related social cues. Whereas the presence
   of young social cues magnifies older consumers' tendency to feel
   younger, this effect is attenuated when the young social cues are less
   desirable or when the older consumers possess higher self-esteem. The
   greater tendency to feel younger in the presence of young social cues
   increases older consumers' choice of contemporary over traditional

AB Existing research demonstrates that financial constraints are widespread
   and influence consumer attention, preference, choice, and consumption in
   a variety of ways. Despite the growing knowledge of how financial
   constraints affect the consumer decision-making process, less is known
   about its impact on post-purchase behavior. This work examines whether
   financial constraints impact an important post-purchase behavior-word of
   mouth-and in what direction. Seven studies show that financial
   constraints reduce purchase-related word of mouth. This effect emerges
   across consumers' reported frequencies of discussing their purchases, as
   well as their intentions, desires, and real decisions to engage in word
   of mouth. This effect is explained by reduced anticipated pleasure of
   engaging in purchase-related word of mouth, which results from
   financially constrained consumers' belief that rehearsing their monetary
   expenditures will reinforce negative feelings about their limited
   financial situation. This effect cannot be similarly explained by other
   accounts such as impression management or the desire to hoard
   informational resources. Further, the authors show that the reduction in
   anticipated pleasure from word of mouth is specific to sharing about
   one's monetary expenditures. Thus, financial constraints reduce
   purchase-related word of mouth, but they do not universally decrease
   one's propensity to share.

AB Given the increasingly specific ways marketers can target ads, consumers
   and regulators are demanding ad transparency: disclosure of how
   consumers' personal information was used to generate ads. We investigate
   how and why ad transparency impacts ad effectiveness. Drawing on
   literature about offline norms of information sharing, we posit that ad
   transparency backfires when it exposes marketing practices that violate
   norms about "information flows"-consumers' beliefs about how their
   information should move between parties. Study 1 inductively shows that
   consumers deem information flows acceptable (or not) based on whether
   their personal information was: 1) obtained within versus outside of the
   website on which the ad appears, and 2) stated by the consumer versus
   inferred by the firm (the latter of each pair being less acceptable).
   Studies 2 and 3 show that revealing unacceptable information flows
   reduces ad effectiveness, which is driven by increasing consumers'
   relative concern for their privacy over desire for the personalization
   that such targeting affords. Study 4 shows the moderating role of
   platform trust: when consumers trust a platform, revealing acceptable
   information flows increases ad effectiveness. Studies 5a and 5b,
   conducted in the field with a loyalty program website (i.e., a trusted
   platform), demonstrate this benefit of transparency.

AB An increasing number of consumers, in recent times, have reported
   feeling busier than ever. The current research examines how the
   subjective perception of busyness-which is referred to as a busy mindset
   in the current research -impacts consumers' decision-making. Building on
   different streams of research in sociology and self-view, the current
   research proposes that a busy mindset bolsters people's sense of
   self-importance, which, in turn, can increase self-control. Thus, a busy
   mindset is predicted to facilitate people's ability to exert
   self-control. Seven studies, including a field study, provide support
   for this busy mindset hypothesis across various self-control domains.
   Findings from these studies provide support for the underlying process
   related to self-importance in multiple ways, while also addressing
   alternative accounts related to stress and the desire for productivity.
   Finally, findings from the current research delineate important
   managerially relevant boundary conditions for the proposed busy mindset
   effect.

AB Across five studies, the current research demonstrates that imbuing
   money with humanlike characteristics can enhance charitable giving.
   Based on mind perception theory, we propose that anthropomorphizing
   money can induce people to attribute to money the capacity to feel and
   sense (i.e., warmth) and the capacity to do things (i.e., competence).
   Further, we argue that enhanced warmth perception increases charitable
   giving. Studies 1a and 1b provided initial evidence that money
   anthropomorphism increased charitable giving by measuring real monetary
   donation behavior (study 1a) and by adopting a practical method to
   anthropomorphize money in charitable appeals (study 1b). Study 2 showed
   that money anthropomorphism enhanced both warmth and competence
   perceptions of money, but that only enhanced warmth perception increased
   donation intention. Study 3 showed that money anthropomorphism did not
   enhance other types of charitable giving, such as signature provision.
   Study 4 showed that the money anthropomorphism effect was unique to
   money and that anthropomorphizing other financial instruments, such as a
   credit card, did not induce the same effect.

AB Virtually no research has examined the role of emoticons in commercial
   relationships, and research outside the marketing domain reports mixed
   findings. This article aims to resolve these mixed findings by
   considering that emoticon senders are often simultaneously evaluated on
   two fundamental dimensions, warmth and competence, and the accessibility
   of one dimension over the other is critically contingent on salient
   relationship norms (communal vs. exchange norms) in customers' minds due
   to individual and situational factors. Through laboratory and field
   experiments, the current research shows that customers perceive service
   employees who use emoticons as higher in warmth but lower in competence
   compared to those who do not (study 1). We further demonstrate that when
   a service employee uses emoticons, communal-oriented (exchange-oriented)
   customers are more likely to infer higher warmth (lower competence) and
   thus to be more (less) satisfied with the service (study 2). We also
   examine two practically important service situations that can make a
   certain type of relationship norm more salient: unsatisfactory services
   (study 3) and employees' extra-role services (study 4). We speculate on
   possible mechanisms underlying these effects and discuss theoretical and
   practical implications along with opportunities for future research.

AB Consumer-to-consumer brand message sharing is pivotal for effective
   social media marketing. Even as companies join social media
   conversations and generate millions of brand messages, it remains
   unclear what, how, and when brand messages stand out and prompt sharing
   by consumers. With a conceptual extension of speech act theory, this
   study offers a granular assessment of brands' message intentions (i.e.,
   assertive, expressive, or directive) and the effects on consumer
   sharing. A text mining study of more than two years of Facebook posts
   and Twitter tweets by well-known consumer brands empirically
   demonstrates the impacts of distinct message intentions on consumers'
   message sharing. Specifically, the use of rhetorical styles
   (alliteration and repetitions) and cross-message compositions enhance
   consumer message sharing. As a further extension, an image-based study
   demonstrates that the presence of visuals, or so-called image acts,
   increases the ability to account for message sharing. The findings
   explicate brand message sharing by consumers and thus offer guidance to
   content managers for developing more effective conversational strategies
   in social media marketing.

AB Many consumers suffer from low levels of financial literacy, and
   attempts to increase this dimension of consumer expertise via
   educational interventions are typically unsuccessful. We argue that many
   of these apparent deficits are caused by the distribution of
   responsibility for knowledge and decision-making between relationship
   partners. Early in relationships, responsibility for financial matters
   is often determined not by differences in financial expertise, but by
   differences in relative contributions to other domains (study 3).
   Although responsibility may be initially unrelated to ability,
   responsibility predicts learning of new financial information (study 4).
   Cross-sectional data from consumers in long-term relationships show that
   as relationships lengthen, high levels of financial responsibility are
   associated with increases in financial literacy, whereas low levels of
   financial responsibility are not (study 1). These diverging trajectories
   of expertise cannot be explained by role switching or changes in the
   sample over time (study 2). The resulting gap in financial literacy is
   linked to corresponding differences in both financial decision-making
   and financial information search (studies 5, 5a). Consumers develop
   expertise on a "need to know" basis. Offloading responsibility to a
   relationship partner may eliminate this need in the present, while
   simultaneously creating barriers to developing expertise when needed in
   the future.

AB Although coupons are very effective in increasing sales, a major
   challenge marketers face with coupons is the low redemption rates.
   Consequently, marketers are continuously trying to identify consumers
   who are more or less likely to respond to couponing efforts, in order to
   better direct coupons to segments high in coupon proneness and hence
   increase redemption rates. The current research identifies consumers'
   cultural backgrounds and values as important determinants of their
   likelihood of redeeming coupons. Across five studies, we find that
   Asians (vs. Caucasians), Indians (vs. Americans), and, more generally,
   consumers with an interdependent (vs. independent) self-construal are
   more likely to use coupons because they are more motivated to engage in
   self-regulation, which is proposed to enhance coupon proneness. We
   conclude with the implications of these findings for marketers, such as
   for their segmentation and targeting endeavors. We also provide specific
   tools that marketers could use, both inside and outside the store, to
   influence consumers' use of coupons.

AB Consumers typically infer greater quantity from larger numbers. For
   instance, a 500 gram box of chocolates appears heavier than a .5
   kilogram box. By expressing quantities in alternative units or attribute
   dimensions, one can represent an otherwise identical quantity in a more
   versus less discretized manner (e.g., a box containing 25 chocolates vs.
   a box weighing 500 grams). Seven experimental studies show that a
   difference between more discretized quantities (e.g., 25 vs. 50
   chocolates) appears larger relative to a difference between less
   discretized quantities (e.g., 500 grams vs. 1,000 grams), above and
   beyond effects of number magnitude. More discretized quantity
   expressions enhance the consumers' ability to discriminate between
   choice options and can also nudge consumers to more favorable choices.
   Because more discretized quantities are more evaluable, expressing a
   quantity in terms of a collection of elements particularly helps
   individuals who are less numerically proficient. By identifying how
   discretization functions as a novel antecedent of evaluability and by
   distinguishing two different conceptualizations of numerosity (i.e.,
   symbolic and perceptual numerosity), this article draws important
   connections between the numerical cognition literature and General
   Evaluability Theory.

AB Contrary to the common belief that having more time facilitates goal
   pursuit by allowing for more flexibility and fewer restrictions, the
   current work argues that long deadlines may produce unintended
   detrimental consequences on goal pursuit. In particular, this research
   identifies a mere deadline effect, showing that longer versus shorter
   deadlines, once imposed, lead consumers to infer that the focal goal is
   more difficult, even when the deadline length results from incidental
   factors that cannot be meaningfully used to make any other diagnostic
   inferences about the task itself besides completion frame. Further,
   these difficulty inferences consequently lead consumers to commit more
   resources (e.g., time and money). Thus, while long incidental deadlines
   might be beneficial for essential yet often underestimated aspects of
   long-term well-being (e.g., when consumers exert more effort to save for
   college and plan for retirement), the unintended difficulty perception
   arising from deadline length will sometimes sabotage goal pursuit (e.g.,
   when consumers commit more resources that are beyond their capability,
   and when elevated resource estimates lead to increased procrastination
   and higher likelihood of quitting).

   in both the lab and field show that bounded intervals of time (e.g., an
   hour before a scheduled meeting) feel prospectively shorter than
   unbounded intervals of time (e.g., an hour with nothing scheduled
   subsequently). Furthermore, consumers perform fewer tasks and are less
   likely to engage in relatively extended (though feasible) tasks during a

AB Specifications of many product attributes (prices, review scores, fuel
   efficiency, calories, computer processor speed, etc.) are numerical.
   When comparing alternatives, consumers often need to judge how much
   larger or smaller one value is than another (say x and y). How do they
   make such a judgment? The literature suggests that people can rely on
   either the absolute difference (x - y) or relative difference (x / y).
   Importantly, relying on the absolute versus relative difference might
   lead to divergent outcomes. Therefore, this research aims to identify
   one factor that moderates consumers' reliance on absolute versus
   relative differences. Specifically, we propose that when the attribute
   is easy to evaluate (i.e., when consumers have clear reference
   information), people tend to compute and rely on absolute differences to
   make comparative judgments. By contrast, when the attribute evaluability
   is low (i.e., reference information is lacking), they tend to compute
   the relative difference. Results from six studies provide convergent
   evidence for this proposition and demonstrate its downstream effects on
   preference and judgments.

AB Parenting has been a central activity throughout human history, yet
   little research has examined the parental care motivation system on
   preferences and decision-making. Because successful parenting involves
   caring for both a child's immediate and long-term needs, we consider
   whether parenting motivation leads people to focus more on the present
   or on the future. A series of five experiments reveals that parenting
   motivation activates gender-specific stereotypes of parental roles,
   leading men to be more future-focused and women to be more
   present-focused. These shifts in temporal focus produce gender
   differences in temporal preferences, as manifested in intertemporal
   decisions (preferences for smaller, immediate rewards vs. larger, future
   ones) and attitudes toward a marketplace entity with inherent temporal
   tradeoffs (i.e., rent-to-own businesses). Reversing gender role
   stereotypes also reverses these gender differences, suggesting
   downstream effects of parenting motivation may be due, at least in part,
   to stereotypes about familial division of labor.

AB People increasingly seek out opportunities to escape from a sped-up pace
   of life by engaging in slow forms of consumption. Drawing from the
   theory of social acceleration, we explore how consumers can experience
   and achieve a sloweddown experience of time through consumption. To do
   so, we ethnographically study the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage in Spain
   and introduce the concept of consumer deceleration. Consumer
   deceleration is a perception of a slowed-down temporal experience
   achieved via a decrease in certain quantities (traveled distance, use of
   technology, experienced episodes) per unit of time through altering,
   adopting, or eschewing forms of consumption. Consumers decelerate in
   three ways: embodied, technological, and episodic. Each is enabled by
   consumer practices and market characteristics, rules, and norms, and
   results in time being experienced as passing more slowly and as being an
   abundant resource. Achieving deceleration is challenging, as it requires
   resynchronization to a different temporal logic and the ability to
   manage intrusions from acceleration. Conceptualizing consumer
   deceleration allows us to enhance our understanding of temporality and
   consumption, embodied consumption, extraordinary experiences, and the
   theory of social acceleration. Overall, this study contributes to
   consumer research by illuminating the role of speed and rhythm in
   consumer culture.

AB Given curiosity's characterization as a motivational drive for
   knowledge, prior research has primarily focused on curiosity's positive
   effects on knowledge exploration, information acquisition, and learning.
   Once the desired knowledge has been acquired, curiosity is said to be
   satisfied. But what happens if curiosity is left unsatisfied? Across
   five experiments, spanning four domains of indulgence-related decisions
   and relying on different methods of curiosity elicitation, the present
   research sheds light on an unexpected yet crucial consequence of
   curiosity-that unsatisfied curiosity tempts indulgent consumption in
   domains unrelated to the source of the curiosity. This effect is
   explained by a generalized desire for rewards. Experiments 1-3 establish
   and replicate the proposed mediation model of curiosity -> desire for
   rewards -> indulgence, employing manipulation-of-process,
   moderation-of-process, and measurement-of-process experimental designs.
   Experiment 4 utilizes neurophysiological data to indicate brain
   activation in the insular cortex for unsatisfied (vs. satisfied)
   curiosity. Experiment 5 addresses the role of cognitive depletion as a
   possible alternative mechanism. In summary, this article demonstrates
   that the hunger for information that accompanies unsatisfied curiosity
   is converted into a generalized desire for rewards, which in turn tempts
   indulgence.

AB Drawing from research on food consumption, conceptual metaphors, and
   assimilation and contrast, we examine how exposure to romantic stimuli
   (e.g., watching a romantic ad, reading a romantic note) affects
   consumers' subsequent consumption of sweets. Across five studies, we
   find that romantic stimuli exposure increases sweet food consumption
   among abstract thinkers but reduces sweet food intake among concrete
   thinkers. We also identify the moderating role of metaphor content on
   this finding such that the effects of romantic exposure on the
   consumption of sweets occur only when the metaphoric association between
   love and sweetness is highlighted but dissipate when a competing
   metaphor is accentuated.

AB We introduce the concept of therapeutic servicescapes, defined as
   consumption settings where emplaced, market-mediated performances
   compensate for socio-cultural dilemmas. Our focus is on the localization
   of emotions that are emplaced in specific sociospatial features and
   collectively reproduced through ritualized consumer performances. This
   ethnographic study of religious pilgrimage consumption reveals that the
   therapeutic servicescape comprises three features: evocative spaces,
   ideological homogeneity, and restorative emotion scripts. These
   service-scape features catalyze the consumer rituals of therapeutic
   relations, therapeutic release, and therapeutic renewal. Our
   theorization of therapeutic servicescapes offers three contributions.
   First, we reveal how emotions are socially and geographically
   orchestrated and transformed in marketplace settings. Second, we
   demonstrate how therapeutic ritual performances reproduce emplaced,
   market-mediated emotion and compensate for embodied emotional
   restrictions. Third, we demonstrate how the negotiation of emotional
   ordering guides the therapeutic dialogue between religion and the
   marketplace.

AB The current research demonstrates that temporally separating a
   consumer's initial decision to perform a guilt-inducing action from its
   actual enactment reduces the guilt felt while acting. This hypothesis
   follows from the development of a dynamic model that unpacks guilt into
   two distinct components. Initially, one experiences decision guilt
   accompanying the decision to act or the realization that one will act;
   subsequently, one experiences action guilt while engaging in the
   guilt-inducing behavior. Four experiments and two pilot studies reveal
   that introducing a temporal "decision-enactment gap" enables decision
   guilt to decay in this interim period, which lowers the overall guilt
   experienced upon acting. In line with the self-regulative function of
   guilt, decision-enactment gaps also increase indulgent consumption and
   decrease post-behavior atonement. This decoupling process can thus
   alleviate guilt that might otherwise detract from experiences, but may
   come at a cost to self-control efforts. The authors discuss the
   theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

AB Consumer payments elicited on slider scales can be systematically
   different from those elicited through text boxes because of the end
   point assimilation effect. When people use text boxes to make payments,
   they evaluate monetary values relative to the starting point of the
   response range. In contrast, when people use slider scales, they
   evaluate monetary values relative to the starting point as well as the
   end point of the response range. Consequently, payments elicited on
   slider scales tend to be assimilated toward the end point of the
   response range. This slider scale end point assimilation effect varies
   for ascending and descending payment formats. For ascending payment
   formats (e.g., eBay bids), slider scales elicit higher payments than
   text boxes. But for descending payment formats (e.g., Priceline bids),
   slider scales elicit lower payments than text boxes. This research not
   only documents how slider scales alter consumer payments, but also
   explains how the mental number line affects financial decisions.

AB This research examines how the intensity of the dynamic competitive
   interaction with other bidders in ascending auctions influences
   consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for auctioned products. It focuses
   on one important aspect of this interaction: the speed of competitor
   reaction. The key hypothesis is that having one's own bids reciprocated
   by competing bidders more quickly increases one's WTP in an auction.
   Evidence from five experiments demonstrates this effect and pinpoints
   the essential aspects of the psychological mechanism that underlies it.
   In particular, the effect of speed of competitor reaction on bidding
   behavior (1) is serially mediated by the perception that the auction is
   more intensely competitive and by a greater desire to win, (2) is
   distinct from the effects of time pressure and of the auction's duration
   or overall rate of progression, (3) is not driven by inferences about
   the auctioned product's market value, (4) is not qualified by the number
   of competing bidders nor due to any inferences about the latter, and (5)
   hinges on direct competitive interaction with other human bidders.

AB A fundamental contribution of consumer behavior research is to help
   marketing scholars develop an understanding of how people think about
   and express their preferences. In this article we find that two commonly
   used preference elicitation procedures, willingness to pay (WTP) and
   choice, are consistently associated with different expressed
   preferences. Specifically, choices are associated with a relatively
   greater preference for hedonic goods, while WTP is associated with a
   relatively greater preference for utilitarian goods. We find that this
   is caused, in part, by the greater reliance on deliberation in
   determining WTP values, while preferences in choices are determined by
   an affect heuristic. Unlike other choice and WTP preference reversals,
   we find that this effect is not caused by mechanical determinants such
   as scale compatibility, as the effect persists with continuous scale
   measures that rely on affect and with choice-based scale measures that
   rely on determining valuation.

AB This research demonstrates a new effect of consumer similarity in a
   chance context. Six studies show how similarity with previous winners
   can positively or negatively affect potential participants' perceived
   likelihood of winning the subsequent independent sweepstakes draw.
   Attributions of winning outcomes to a personal cause or randomness
   change potential participants' expectations regarding the sequence of
   more or less similar winners. When personal attribution is prevalent,
   exposure to more (vs. less) similar winners causes potential
   participants to feel they are more likely to win and, as a consequence,
   judge the sweepstakes as more attractive. This positive effect of
   similarity is mediated by the expectation of more repetitions of similar
   winners consistent with the belief that luck can be transferred among
   similar people. When randomness is presented as the salient cause for
   winning, though, people's subjective conception of randomness leads them
   to expect more alternations in the sequence of more and less similar
   winners, thus prompting a reversal of the similarity effect. That is,
   they feel less likely to win when the sweepstakes features a more
   compared to a less similar winner.

AB Observers' reactions to a service failure and their attributions of
   responsibility for its occurrence can depend on fortuitous
   characteristics of the protagonists that happen to draw their attention.
   Four field and laboratory experiments show that when observers have an
   incidental similarity to one of the persons involved in a service
   failure (the customer or the service provider), their attention is drawn
   to this protagonist, often leading them to construe the situation from
   this person's perspective and consequently to blame the protagonist less
   for the negative event they observe. However, when an incidentally
   similar protagonist is rude or has an undesirable personal
   characteristic (i.e., obesity), observers' greater attention to that
   person increases their attributions of responsibility to him or her
   rather than decreasing it. These opposing effects of incidental
   similarity on attributions influence not only observers' evaluations of
   the persons involved in the situation they observe, but also their
   willingness to patronize the establishment. These effects occur both
   when observers actually witness a conflict offline and when they
   consider it online on the basis of reviews.

AB The emphasis on business size has become more overt in recent years.
   However, it is not clear how company size influences consumers'
   evaluations. Five experiments investigate the effect of size on
   consumers' expectations and evaluations of company behaviors. Consumers
   expect higher communion from small compared to large companies, and
   consequently, small relative to large companies garner lower evaluations
   when they exhibit low communion behaviors. These high communion
   expectations are driven by the relatively lower marketplace power of
   small companies. While study 1 provides real-world evidence for the
   effect of company size on evaluations of company behaviors, studies 2A
   and 2B demonstrate that perceptions of power underlie the effect of
   company size on expectations for communion. Studies 3A and 3B indicate
   that when a company engages in low communion behavior, small relative to
   large companies garner lower evaluations and this effect is driven by
   consumers' perceived violation of expectations. Incorporating additional
   studies, two meta-analyses conducted with four studies for consumer
   expectations and six studies for consumer evaluations provide
   confirmatory evidence in support of our hypotheses. This research
   demonstrates that how companies are perceived in terms of size and power
   creates meaning for consumers that drives their expectations and
   subsequent evaluations.

AB Evidence suggests that consumers seek to become more expert about

   occasions. Current approaches to becoming expert center on cultivating
   an analytic mind-set. In the present research the authors explore the
   benefit to enthusiasts of moving beyond analytics to cultivate a
   holistic style of processing. In the taste context the authors define
   holistic processing as nonverbal, imagery-based, and involving narrative
   processing. The authors conduct qualitative interviews with taste
   experts (Master Sommeliers) to operationalize the holistic approach to
   hedonic learning, and then test it against traditional analytic methods
   in a series of experiments across a range of hedonic products. The
   results suggest that hedonic learning follows a sequence of stages whose
   order matters, and that the holistic stage is facilitated by attending
   to experience as a narrative event and by employing visual imagery. The
   results of this multimethod investigation have implications for both
   managers and academics interested in how consumers learn to become

AB Variety-seeking is a fundamental aspect of choice. But given circadian

   Four studies, including an empirical analysis of millions of purchases,
   demonstrate diurnal variation in variety-seeking. Variety-seeking is
   lower in the morning than other times of day. People pick less varied
   flavors of yogurt, for example, when choosing in the morning. Further,
   the results demonstrate the underlying role of circadian changes in
   physiological stimulation and arousal. The effect is mediated by a
   physiological measure of arousal (i.e., body temperature) and moderated
   by factors that shape physiological arousal (i.e., sunlight and
   individual differences in circadian preferences). These findings shed
   light on drivers of variety-seeking and the biological basis of consumer

AB Imagination visual mental imagery, a mental simulation process that
   involves imagining an end user interacting with an end product, has been
   proposed as an efficient strategy to incorporate end-user experiences
   during new product ideation. Consumer research finds that this strategy
   enhances overall product usefulness, but does not resolve whether and
   how this process may impact outcome originality. The present work
   delineates the imagination visual mental imagery construct and argues
   that such mental imagery can take two different routes-one that is more
   feelings-based (i.e., feelings-imagination), and one that is more
   objective (i.e., objective-imagination). Further, we propose that
   although these two approaches will equally benefit outcome usefulness,
   they will have differential impact on outcome originality. Across five
   studies, we demonstrate that adopting a feelings-imagination versus an
   objective-imagination approach induces higher empathic concern,
   enhancing cognitive flexibility, which leads to higher outcome
   originality. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

AB What influences consumers' preferences for strong versus weak sensory
   stimuli? In this article, we find converging evidence that when the
   experience of a romantic crush is salient, consumers have an enhanced
   preference for options that elicit strong sensory stimulation (e.g.,
   loud music, strongly flavored food). We demonstrate this effect across
   seven studies using a broad array of products and services as stimuli.
   We further show that these consumers have a heightened motivation to
   achieve greater sensations from the desired person, but cannot act in a
   way that directly satisfies this motivation, leading them to be more
   likely to turn to products and services for the desired sensations.
   Moreover, we find that the effect is specific to the experience of a
   romantic crush and cannot be generalized to other interpersonal
   experiences (e.g., passionate love, stable romantic relationship, unmet

AB This research studies repetition decisions-namely, whether to repeat a
   behavior (e.g., a purchase) after receiving an incentive (e.g., a
   discount). Can uncertainty drive repetition? Four experiments, all
   involving real consequences for each individual participant, document a
   counterintuitive reinforcing-uncertainty effect: individuals repeat a
   behavior more if its incentive is uncertain than if it is certain, even
   when the certain incentive is financially better. This effect is robust;
   it holds in both lab and field settings and at both small and large
   magnitudes. Furthermore, the experiments identify two theory-driven
   boundary conditions for the reinforcing-uncertainty effect: the effect
   arises (a) only if the uncertainty is resolved immediately and not if
   the resolution of uncertainty is delayed, and (b) only after, not
   before, one has engaged in repetitions. These results support a
   resolution-as-reward account and cast doubt on other explanations such

AB Although marketing offers with flexible price options within a range of
   two end-points (i.e., range offers) have been frequently used in various
   contexts, such as discount ranges, flexible pricing, and deal
   quotations, our understanding of how consumers react to this pricing
   strategy is rather limited. The current research suggests that
   consumers' reaction to range marketing offers may depend on their
   general sense of scarcity. Eight studies show that reminders of resource
   scarcity induce a promotion orientation among consumers, which
   consequently increases consumers' favorability toward range marketing
   offers. This effect is found to strengthen when the range of the offer
   becomes wider, and to weaken when the range offer cannot provide a
   better-than-reference outcome. These findings result in novel
   theoretical insights about the ways consumers react to range marketing
   offers. From a managerial perspective, this research offers tactics that

AB Despite abundant work documenting consumers' reliance on symbolic

   little research has investigated the underlying psychological processes
   that drive this type of compensatory consumption. This article addresses
   this critical gap, demonstrating that self-discrepancies triggered by
   identity threats reduce working memory capacity (WMC), and these
   reductions in WMC mediate compensatory consumption. Consumers process
   identity-relevant products more positively than neutral products,
   establishing a causal chain between self-threats, WMC, and compensatory
   consumption. In addition, identity-consistent experiences facilitate
   increases in WMC. Importantly, by utilizing negative emotions as the
   source of self-threat, this article also demonstrates that
   identity-inconsistent emotions can serve as a source of threat that is
   not only impactful, but also easily manipulated by managers through

AB When people experience threats to important aspects of their
   self-concept (e.g., power, intelligence, sociability), they often
   compensate by consuming products that symbolize success, mastery, or
   competence on the threatened self-domain (within-domain compensatory
   consumption). Our research examines whether such compensatory
   consumption is effective in repairing the self-concept. Across seven
   experiments, we show that whether compensatory consumption is effective
   depends on the extent to which the connection between the compensatory
   products and the threatened domains is made explicit. When the
   connections are made explicit (e.g., through product names and marketing
   slogans), self-repair is impeded, but when the connections are only
   implicit (product is inherently symbolic of self-threat domain),
   self-repair can be successful. We further show that these differential
   effects of product connection explicitness are mediated by rumination:
   explicit connections induce rumination about the self-threat, which
   undermines self-repair, whereas implicit connections cause no
   rumination, facilitating self-repair. Our research provides a
   reconciliation of conflicting findings on self-repair in previous
   research, and also shows that despite the differences in efficacy,
   consumers compensate regardless of whether product connections are
   implicit or explicit, which has implications for consumer well-being.

AB Consumers can obtain skill-based products through a variety of
   acquisition modes, such as purchase or rental. Despite the rise of
   nonpurchase acquisition modes, surprisingly little research has explored
   the effects of differential acquisition modes on consumer behavior. This
   research begins to fill this gap in the literature by examining the
   effect of acquisition mode on the expected time necessary to master
   newly adopted skill-based products and the downstream consequences for
   consumers and marketers. Results of four experiments and a field study
   show that purchasing, versus renting, products requiring skill-based
   learning increases the amount of time consumers expect to be required to
   master them. Further, the differences in speed of product mastery, in
   turn, impact subsequent consumer behavior via differential levels of
   product use commitment.

AB Hearing is our highly sensitive warning system. As a sense, hearing has
   uniquely evolved to perform this alerting function and is perceptive to
   subtle ambient cues that are associated with threat. We propose that one
   aspect of sound that may cue such associations is pitch, such that
   low-pitch (vs. moderate pitch) background sound nonconsciously primes a
   threat response resulting in heightened anxiety among consumers.
   Furthermore, this emotional response manifests itself in the form of
   increased risk avoidance. Seven studies in varied domains demonstrate
   that low- (vs. moderate-) pitch background sound results in higher
   anxiety, which leads to risk-avoidant consumer choices-for instance,
   being willing to pay more for car insurance or choosing a food option
   with lower taste uncertainty.

AB Consumers tell many lies. While engaging in deception can provide a
   variety of benefits, a potential danger when lying is that the consumer
   may subsequently forget aspects of the lie told. To ensure the deception
   is not inadvertently revealed later, the consumer must remember the
   content of the lie. In this research, we introduce the notion of
   deception memory-which we define as memory for the content of a
   previously communicated lie-and examine what differentiates a memorable
   lie from a forgettable lie. Three behavioral studies where consumers lie
   to marketers (study 1) or fellow consumers (studies 2 and 3) and a
   critical incident study (study 4) show that increases in the
   consequentiality of the lie heightens lie-induced arousal (LIA), which
   narrows attention to the content of the lie and subsequently improves
   deception memory. Therefore, while more arousing lies may be more
   consequential, and therefore, riskier to tell, our results suggest that
   they are less likely to be forgotten. This is the first examination of
   retrieval accuracy for deception memory. Finally, many avenues for
   future research related to memorable and forgettable lies are proposed
   in this article.

AB With sharing economy and access-based consumption, consumers
   increasingly access goods through social access modes other than private
   ownership-such as co-ownership, leasing, or borrowing. Prior research
   focuses on consumers' attitudinal motivations and consumption-cultural
   use experiences pertaining to such social exchange-based access modes.
   In so doing, prior research has overlooked the influence that consumers'
   fundamental, even biologically shaped, cognitive traits may have on
   their choice of access modes. To fill this research gap, this study
   analyzes a data set of more than 30,000 new car registrations by male
   consumers in Finland, including cognitive test data from the Finnish
   Defense Forces and covariates from other governmental sources. The field
   data suggests that consumers' intelligence scores and their choice to
   co-own and lease their cars are positively associated. Econometric
   evidence further suggests that the association between intelligence and
   choice of social exchange-based access modes can be explained by
   intelligent consumers' higher social trust in people and institutions,
   as well as two circumstantial mechanisms: their financial standing and
   tendency to seek savings. The findings from the field data are supported
   by an additional survey study (n = 460). Implications for the evolution
   of markets and consumption, as well as human intelligence and
   cooperation, are discussed.

AB Product tests are a common feature before any product launch. During
   product tests, marketers might discover that the product can deliver
   additional unintended benefits to the users. Should marketers
   communicate such unexpectedly found benefits to their potential
   customers as an unexpectedly discovered benefit or as an intended
   benefit? Across six experiments, including a field experiment, the
   current research shows that framing a product benefit as unexpected
   increases desire for the product, when consumers have a heightened
   motivation to seek rewards. However, framing an undesirable product
   feature (e.g., a side effect) as unexpected can negatively impact
   product desirability for consumers, who have a heightened motivation to
   avoid losses. Finally, highlighting another managerially important
   boundary condition, our findings show that the unexpected-framing effect
   is attenuated when the benefit framed as unexpected is incongruent with
   the product category. Theoretical and managerial implications of
   unexpected framing are discussed.

AB Ironic consumption refers to using a product (brand, style, behavior,
   etc.) with the intent of signaling a meaning (identity, message, belief,
   etc.) that reverses the conventional meaning of the product. We report
   five studies showing that people are more likely to think that a
   consumer is using a product ironically when the product is incongruent
   with the consumer's known identity or beliefs. The impression that
   ironic consumers make on an observer depends on the observer's
   relationship with the consumed product. When a consumer uses a product
   associated with the observer's in-group (e.g., wearing a "Powered by
   Kale" shirt in front of a vegan), observers have a less favorable
   impression if they believe the consumer is using the product ironically.
   Conversely, when a consumer uses a product that is not associated with
   the observer's in-group (e.g., wearing a "Powered by Kale" shirt in
   front of a meat-eater), observers have a more favorable impression if
   they believe the consumer is using the product ironically. Collectively,
   our studies suggest that consumers can use products ironically to
   selectively signal one meaning to an in-group (who is likely to detect
   irony), and another to out-groups (who are unlikely to detect irony).

AB Many consumers base their purchase decisions on online consumer reviews.
   An overlooked feature of these texts is their narrativity: the extent to
   which they tell a story. The authors construct a new theory of
   narrativity to link the narrative content and discourse of consumer
   reviews to consumer behavior. They also develop from scratch a
   computerized technique that reliably determines the degree of
   narrativity of 190,461 verbatim, online consumer reviews and validate
   the automated text analysis with two controlled experiments. More
   transporting (i.e., engaging) and persuasive reviews have
   better-developed characters and events as well as more emotionally
   changing genres and dramatic event orders. This interdisciplinary,
   multimethod research should help future researchers (1) predict how
   narrativity affects consumers' narrative transportation and persuasion,
   (2) measure the narrativity of large digital corpora of textual data,
   and (3) understand how this important linguistic feature varies along a

AB A hedonic contrast effect occurs when comparing a stimulus to its
   alternatives makes it better or worse. We find that counterfactual
   comparisons induce larger hedonic contrast effects when they are also
   social comparisons. Hedonic contrast effects influence happiness with a
   food or wage more when another person receives its counterfactual
   alternative than when no person receives its counterfactual alternative.
   Social attention, the propensity to attend to the experiences of other
   people, underlies the larger hedonic contrast effects induced by social
   comparisons. People pay more attention to counterfactual alternatives
   when they are also social comparison standards, and this difference in
   the allocation of attention mediates the larger hedonic contrast effects
   that social counterfactual comparisons induce. Reducing attentional
   resources with cognitive load or time pressure reduces the impact of
   social counterfactual comparisons, and drawing attention to nonsocial
   counterfactual comparisons increases their impact. Social attention
   makes comparisons stronger when they are social.

AB A person can use a variety of strategies to sustain the pursuit of a
   conscious goal (e.g., deliberate on the goal, monitor goal progress,
   increase goal commitment). However, less is known about how to sustain
   the pursuit of a nonconscious goal, a reality that is reflected in the
   common finding that nonconscious goal pursuit typically persists for
   only one choice episode. This research investigates two factors that
   help sustain the pursuit of a nonconscious goal: increasing the level of
   goal activation prior to goal pursuit and limiting the extent of goal
   deactivation after a goal-consistent behavior. When one of these two
   factors is present, nonconscious goal pursuit is sustained, as evidenced
   by a longer sequence of goal-consistent choices. Five studies compare
   and contrast strategies for sustaining conscious and nonconscious goal
   pursuit and provide insight into how the goal system manages the pursuit
   of a nonconscious goal. In addition, the findings inform when a consumer
   is more or less likely to pursue opposing goals across sequential
   choices (e.g., being virtuous after being indulgent).

AB This study delineates the process of brand longevity: the achievement of

   Our study contributes to branding theory by proposing a multilevel
   approach to understanding brand longevity through application of an
   assemblage perspective to answer the question: how do serial brands
   attain longevity within evolving sociocultural contexts? By applying
   assemblage theory, we scrutinize the enduring success of a serial media
   brand over the past 55 years. To address this question, a wide range of
   archival brand-related data were collected and analyzed, including:
   analysis of films, books, marketing materials, press commentaries, and
   reviews, as well as broader contextual data regarding the sociocultural
   contexts within which the brand assemblage has developed. Our findings
   empirically support the study of brand longevity in and of itself, and
   conceptualize brand longevity as relying on an evolutionary approach to
   assembling the brand, which looks outward from the brand in order to
   consider the potential of brand elements to prevail in contemporary
   contexts and to ensure both continuity and change.

AB Nowadays consumers can easily connect with others who are pursuing
   similar goals via smart devices and mobile apps. This technology also
   enables them to compare how well they are doing relative to others in a
   variety of contexts, ranging from online gaming to losing weight to
   loyalty programs. This research investigates consumers' motivation to
   achieve a goal when they compare themselves with a superior other who
   has already attained the goal. Building on the literature on social
   comparison, and on competition in particular, we find that consumers are
   less motivated when the superior other has attained the goal compared to
   when the superior other is just ahead, keeping the relative distance
   equal. This negative effect on motivation is evident even in situations
   in which consumers can still attain the same goal as the superior other.
   We argue and demonstrate that this effect occurs because the other's
   goal attainment limits consumers' prospect to compete and overtake the
   superior other. Six experimental studies show evidence for this effect
   in hypothetical loyalty programs and behavioral task completion. These
   findings provide a deeper understanding of the motivational effect of
   social comparison, which have implications for marketing managers and
   public policy makers.

AB A significant amount of research on numerosity demonstrates that product
   perceptions are often influenced by the scale on which numerical
   attribute information is presented. However, fewer studies have examined
   how self-control is influenced by the numerosity of cost information
   (e.g., price, nutritional content) in situations that may violate a
   personal goal. The present research demonstrates that, in such
   situations, the numerosity of cost information has a stronger influence
   on self-control when consumers are highly focused on restraint. Because
   restrained consumers regulate their behavior by anticipating the
   negative emotions from violating their goals, they experience a
   narrowing of attention during self-control decisions that makes them
   more reliant on numerosity as a cue for judgment. The results of eight
   experiments demonstrate that consumers who are primed or predisposed to
   be high in restraint display less self-control when cost information is
   presented on a contracted scale with small numbers compared to an
   expanded scale with large numbers. When consumers are less focused on
   restraint, numerosity has less of an effect on self-control because
   unrestrained consumers do not experience an analogous narrowing of
   attention.

AB Benign and malicious envy are a consequence of an unfavorable upward
   comparison to another individual (i.e., a negative self-other
   discrepancy). Benign (malicious) envy occurs when people believe the
   envied individual deserves (does not deserve) his/her advantage. Prior
   research has shown that benign envy motivates a person to address the
   self-other discrepancy via self-improvement, whereas malicious envy does
   not. This research shows that both types of envy, not just benign envy,
   can motivate self-improvement, provided that the opportunities to do so
   occur outside the envy-eliciting domain. Benign envy increases the
   accessibility of the belief that effort determines whether people are
   rewarded; hence, it motivates process-focused goal pursuit and the use
   of products that emphasize effort-dependent self-improvement. Malicious
   envy increases the accessibility of the belief that the effort does not
   determine whether people are rewarded; hence, it motivates
   outcome-focused goal pursuit and the use of products that emphasize
   effort-independent self-improvement. Implications and potential
   extensions in the areas of envy, self-conscious emotions, and goals are

AB Although most research on consumers' choices, and resulting insights,
   have focused on choices that consumers make solely for themselves,
   consumers often make choices for others, and there is a growing
   literature examining such choices. Theoretically, how can this growing
   literature be integrated, and what gaps remain? Practically, why should
   marketers, consumers, and policy makers care when choices are made for
   others, and what should they do differently? A 2 x 2 framework of
   consumers' choices for others addresses these questions. This framework
   has two fundamental dimensions: the chooser's social focus (relationship
   vs. recipient oriented) and the chooser's consideration of consumption
   preferences (highlight the recipient's preferences vs. balance the
   recipient's preferences with the chooser's preferences). These
   dimensions generate four cells that represent prototypical
   choosing-for-others contexts: gift-giving (relationship focus,
   highlighting recipient's preferences), joint consumption (relationship
   focus, balancing recipient's and chooser's preferences), everyday
   favors/pick-ups (recipient focus, highlighting recipient's preferences),
   and caregiving (recipient focus, balancing recipient's and chooser's
   preferences). This framework captures most choosing-for-others
   situations, and each cell involves a distinct profile of motives,
   ultimately affecting choices. This framework integrates the
   choosing-for-others literature, which we hope will guide future
   research, and it also offers practical implications for marketers,
   consumers, and policy makers.

AB To advance understanding of how well different types of brand
   relationships drive customer brand loyalty and to help companies improve
   the effectiveness of their relationship-building investments, this
   article conducts a meta-analysis of the link between five consumer-brand
   relationship constructs and customer brand loyalty. The analysis of 588
   elasticities from 290 studies reported in 255 publications over 24 years
   (n = 348,541 across 46 countries) reveals that the aggregate brand
   relationship elasticity is .439. More importantly, results demonstrate
   under what conditions various types of brand relationships increase
   loyalty. For example, while elasticities are generally highest for
   love-based and attachment-based brand relationships, the positive
   influence of brand relationships on customer brand loyalty is stronger
   in more recent (vs. earlier) years, for nonstatus (vs. status) and
   publicly (vs. privately) consumed brands, and for estimates using
   attitudinal (vs. behavioral) customer brand loyalty. Overall, the
   results suggest that brand relationship elasticities vary considerably
   across brand, loyalty, time, and consumer characteristics. Drawing on
   these findings, the current research advances implications for managers
   and scholars and provide avenues for future research.

AB Consumer movements strive to change markets when those markets produce

   studies argue that consumer movements primarily seek to challenge these
   value outcomes by championing alternative higher-order values or by
   pressuring institutions to change market governance mechanisms. Building
   on and refining theorization on value regimes, this study illuminates a
   new type of consumer movement strategy where consumers collaborate to
   construct alternative object pathways. The study draws from ethnographic
   fieldwork in the German retail food sector and shows how building
   alternative object pathways allowed a consumer movement to mitigate the
   value regime's excessive production of food waste. The revised value
   regime theorization offers a new and more holistic way of understanding
   and contextualizing how and where consumer movements mobilize for
   change. It also provides a new tool for understanding systemic value

AB While previous research has mobilized sociological and psychological
   readings of the body, this study considers it ontologically as the
   ultimate place we must live in, with no escape possible. A
   phenomenological framework and a four-year, multi-method, qualitative
   study of tattoo recipients and tattooists substantiates the
   conceptualization of the body as a threefold articulation: an
   inescapable place (topia), the source of utopias arising from fleeting
   trajectories between here and elsewhere, and the "embodied heterotopia"
   that it becomes when people rework their bodies as a better place to
   inhabit. We show how tattooed bodies are spatially conceived as a topia
   through their topographies, territories, landscapes, and limits. We then
   highlight how this creates a dynamic interplay between past, present,
   and future, resulting in utopian dreams of beautification, escape,
   conjuration, and immutability. Finally, we show how tattooees produce
   embodied heterotopias, namely other places that both mirror and
   compensate for their ontological entrapment. In considering the body as
   a place, our framework enriches phenomenological and existential
   approaches to self-transformation in contemporary consumption.

AB This research examines how consumers make unilateral decisions on behalf
   of the self and multiple others, in situations where the chosen option
   will be shared and consumed jointly by the group-for instance, choosing
   wine for the table. Results across six studies using three different
   choice contexts (wine, books, and movies) demonstrate that such choices
   are shaped by the decision-maker's self-construal (independent vs.
   interdependent) and by the size of the group being chosen for (large vs.
   small). Specifically, we find that interdependent consumers consistently
   make choices that balance self and others' preferences, regardless of
   group size. In contrast, the choices of independent consumers differ
   depending on group size: for smaller groups, independents make choices
   that balance self and others' preferences, while for larger groups, they
   make choices that more strongly reflect their own preferences. Via
   mediation and moderation, the data show that differential attention to
   others underlies the combined effect of self-construal and group size on
   the joint consumption choices that consumers make for the self and
   others.

AB Successful weight control is a challenge for many consumers, but in
   principle, it is a simple arithmetic combination of increasing caloric
   expenditure and/or decreasing caloric intake. We call the former
   "exercise" and the latter "diet." A field survey, three behavioral lab
   experiments, and a national weight loss field study show that (1) people
   tend to construe exercise at higher levels and diet at lower levels, (2)
   activating people's focus on the high-level purposes versus low-level
   processes of their behavior may improve the odds of weight control
   success by exercise and diet, respectively, and (3) people who
   effectuated exercise plans that were high in desirability in terms of
   bringing about greater net caloric cuts, and diet plans that were high
   in feasibility in terms of ease of compliance, had the greatest weight
   reduction over a three-month period. Understanding the theory of how
   contrasting mental models underlie exercise versus diet may help
   consumers control their weight with more success, and marketers position
   their weight control products and services more effectively.

AB Although consumer behavior theory has traditionally regarded evaluations
   as instrumental to consumer choice, in reality consumers often assess
   and express what they like and dislike even when there is no decision at
   stake. Why are consumers so eager to express their evaluations when
   there is no ostensible purpose for doing so? In this research, we
   advance the thesis that this is because consumers derive an inherent
   pleasure from assessing and expressing their likes and dislikes. In
   support of this thesis, the results of seven studies show that compared
   to a variety of simple and commonplace control judgments, assessing and
   expressing one's likes and dislikes results in greater task enjoyment.
   This occurs because externalizing one's evaluations enables a form of
   self-expression that appears to be deep and global. These findings have

AB Consumers regularly fail to habituate newly adopted practices. In
   contrast to established practices, this often occurs because
   understanding a practice is different from actually doing it. Our work
   explores this "messiness of doing" and explains why consumers
   successfully habituate some newly adopted practices after experiencing
   obstacles (i.e., misaligned practice elements) but not others. Utilizing
   a longitudinal approach that follows first-time parents from pregnancy
   through the first eight months postpartum, we track how parents plan for
   practices and how those plans unfold. We document a process whereby
   parents first engage in extensive planning and preparation prior to the
   birth of their child, during which parents build two realignment
   capabilities (anticipation and integration). After the baby's arrival,
   some practices invariably do not work. Parents respond to these
   misalignments by following one of five paths-differentiated by the
   capabilities parents build while planning-that result in practice
   abandonment, vulnerable habituation, or habituation. Our work highlights
   the challenges associated with translating a social practice into an
   enacted practice and the corresponding importance of accumulating
   realignment capabilities during planning. To facilitate habituation of
   newly adopted practices, how consumers make plans for these practices
   may ultimately matter more than what they actually plan to do.

AB We investigate a psychological factor regulating consumers' switching in
   response to poor service quality: chronic global self-esteem. Whereas
   high-self-esteem consumers tend to switch to other providers in response
   to poor service quality, low-self-esteem consumers often do not. This
   happens because low-self-esteem consumers who experience poor service
   become risk-averse, and therefore reluctant to engage in new committed
   service relationships. Indeed, low-self-esteem consumers' likelihood to
   switch to an alternative provider in response to poor service quality
   increases when this provider offers a less risky, low commitment (vs.
   more risky, high commitment) contract. Moreover, experimentally reducing
   low-self-esteem consumers' risk aversion increases their likelihood to
   switch to alternative providers in response to poor service quality.
   Finally, low-self-esteem consumers' risk aversion mediates their
   reluctance to switch in response to poor service. We rule out failure
   severity perceptions, power, autonomy, affect, and action orientation as
   alternative explanations. The implication of this research for public
   policy makers is that promoting competition (by offering consumers
   options and by reducing switching costs) may not be enough to protect
   the welfare of low-self-esteem consumers. We also suggest ways in which
   firms can untie vulnerable consumers from negative service
   relationships.

AB Food and beverage manufacturers now regularly display "just below"
   calorie amounts (e.g., 99, 199, 299) in advertisements, presumably to
   appeal to health-motivated consumers. "Just below" values are those that
   fall one or more digits below a round number, most commonly seen as
   nine-ending numbers. However, although nine-ending prices are known to
   stimulate purchase intent, it is unclear whether or when nine-ending
   calorie labeling shapes food preferences. The present research shows
   that when consumers view indulgent foods with just-below (vs.
   round-ending) calorie amounts, they exhibit higher consumption
   intentions, purchase intent, and consumption behavior, yet only if they
   are high in health motivation. This is due to a tendency for
   health-motivated consumers to overweigh the leftmost digit in multidigit
   numbers-a cognitive bias known as the "level effect." This bias results
   in the perception that just-below (vs. round) -ending indulgent foods
   have relatively fewer calories, decreasing anticipated guilt and
   increasing consumption intentions and behavior. The superiority of
   just-below calorie presentation under health motivation is attenuated
   with the addition of reference intake labeling (i.e., % daily calorie
   intake values), which equalizes the magnitude of nine- and round-ending
   calorie indulgent foods.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare, but little
   is known about consumer receptivity to AI in medicine. Consumers are
   reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical
   choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to
   utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for
   healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider
   performance (studies 3A-3C), and derive negative utility if a provider
   is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect, a concern
   that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for
   consumers' unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer
   resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger
   for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5).
   Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is
   eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized
   (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that
   only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human
   healthcare provider (study 9). These findings make contributions to the
   psychology of automation and medical decision making, and suggest
   interventions to increase consumer acceptance of AI in medicine.

AB The essence of a brand is that it delivers on its promises. However,
   consumers' trust in brands (CTB) has declined around the world in recent
   decades. As a result, CTB has become a major concern for managers. The
   authors examine whether CTB is influenced by marketing-mix activities
   (i.e., advertising, new product introduction, distribution, price, and
   price promotion) implemented by brands. The authors propose and show
   that the sensitivity of CTB to marketing-mix activities is moderated by
   consumer, category, and country characteristics, using a multisource
   data set consisting of a survey of 15,073 respondents and scanner panel
   data on 589 brands in 46 CPG categories across 13 countries (including
   the four largest emerging markets), which collectively account for half
   of the world's population. The authors find strong positive effects for
   advertising and new product introduction intensity, weak positive
   effects for price and distribution intensity, and a minor negative
   effect for price promotion intensity on CTB. Furthermore, the authors
   find that the effect of marketing-mix activities on CTB is moderated by
   consumers' personality traits, consumers' reliance on brands in a
   category, and countries' secular-rational and self-expression cultural
   values.

AB Consumers routinely make decisions about the timing of their
   consumption, making tradeoffs between consuming now or later. Most of
   the literature examining impatience considers monetary outcomes (i.e.,
   delaying dollars), implicitly assuming that how the money is spent does
   not systematically alter impatience levels and patterns. The authors
   propose an impatience asymmetry for material and experiential purchases
   based on utility duration. Five studies provide evidence that consumers
   are more impatient toward experiential purchases compared to material
   purchases and that this increased impatience is driven by whether the
   value is extracted over a shorter utility duration (often associated
   with experiential purchases) or a longer utility duration (often
   associated with material purchases). Thus, when an experience is
   consumed over a longer period of time, the results show that impatience
   can be diminished. Additional results show that the effect holds in both
   delay and expedite frames and suggest that the results cannot be
   explained by differences in scheduling, time sensitivity, affect,
   ownership, future time perspective, or future connectedness.

AB Consumers' response to mass media can be difficult to assess because
   individuals choose for themselves the amount of media they consume, and
   that choice may be correlated with their other consumption decisions. To
   avoid this selection problem, this article examines the introduction of
   television to the US, during which some cities gained access to
   television years before others. This natural experiment makes it
   possible to estimate the causal impact of television on the decision to
   start smoking, a consumer behavior with important public health
   implications. Difference-in-differences analyses of television's
   introduction indicate that (1) television did cause people to start
   smoking, (2) 16- to 21-year-olds were particularly affected by
   television, and (3) much of the response to television occurred within a
   couple of years of its introduction. Our preferred estimates suggest
   that television increased the share of smokers in the population by 5-15
   percentage points, generating roughly 11 million additional smokers
   between 1946 and 1970. More broadly, these results offer causal evidence
   that (1) mass media can have a large influence on consumers, potentially
   affecting their health, (2) media exerts an especially strong influence
   on teens, and (3) mass media can influence consumers more than typical
   changes in prices.

AB Prior research has examined the role of the traditional five sensory
   systems (visual, olfactory, haptic, auditory, and gustatory) and how
   they influence food evaluations. This research extends the boundaries of
   sensory marketing by examining the effects of the vestibular system,
   often referred to as the "sixth sensory system," which is responsible
   for balance and posture. The results of six experiments show that
   vestibular sensations related to posture (i.e., sitting vs. standing)
   influence food taste perceptions. Specifically, standing (vs. sitting)
   postures induce greater physical stress on the body, which in turn
   decreases sensory sensitivity. As a result, when eating in a standing
   (vs. sitting) posture, consumers rate the taste of pleasant-tasting
   foods and beverages as less favorable, the temperature as less intense,
   and they consume smaller amounts. The effects of posture on taste
   perception are reversed for unpleasant-tasting foods. These findings
   have conceptual implications for broadening the frontiers of sensory
   marketing and for the effects of sensory systems on food taste
   perceptions. Given the increasing trend toward eating while standing,
   the findings also have practical implications for restaurant, retail,
   and other food-service environment designs.

AB From dating profiles and social media accounts to online streaming
   services, consumers are often asked to express who they are by
   constructing an assortment. Apple Music, for example, asks new users to
   indicate "two or more" of their favorite types of music when they create
   an account. But while consumers might create such self-expressive
   assortments to communicate who they are, could the composition of these
   assortments also affect how people see themselves? Seven studies
   demonstrate that perceiving greater variety in a self-expressive
   assortment undermines self-continuity. This occurs because variety leads
   consumers to infer that their preferences are less stable, thereby
   decreasing the belief that their identity stays the same over time.
   Variety's effect generalizes across multiple domains of self-expression
   (e.g., books, music, television) and has downstream consequences for
   service evaluation and even unrelated decision-making (e.g.,
   intertemporal tradeoffs). The findings advance understanding of how
   choice shapes identity, the role of variety in consumers' lives, and

AB Prior to customizing for themselves, consumers often encounter products
   customized by other people within their social network. Our research
   suggests that when encountering a custom-made example of an
   identity-related product created by an identified social other,
   consumers infer this social other was motivated to express uniqueness.
   After making this inference, consumers are also motivated to express
   uniqueness, particularly when the example was created by a close versus
   distant social other. Consumers express uniqueness through their own
   customization choices, choosing fewer options shown in the example or
   choosing fewer best-selling options. Consumers sometimes even pay a
   monetary cost or sacrifice preferred choices in order to make their own
   product unique. Further, this effect dissipates when motivations other
   than expressing uniqueness are inferred about a social other (e.g., for
   functionally related products). Across eight studies that span different
   product contexts, involve real choices, and isolate the underlying
   theoretical mechanism (i.e., motivation to express uniqueness), our
   research documents the unique role of custom-made examples, demonstrates
   the importance of social distance for customization choices, and
   identifies a novel path explaining when and why individuals express

AB Prosocial organizations have different moral objectives. Some seek to
   promote welfare (e.g., Red Cross), but others seek to promote justice
   and equality (e.g., ACLU). Additionally, these organizations can induce
   different positive emotions to motivate donations. If organizations are
   seeking to promote different moral objectives using positive emotions,
   which positive emotion will be the most effective for their respective
   campaigns? We demonstrate how the congruency between the moral domain of
   an emotion and the moral objective of an organization plays a role in
   influencing prosocial behaviors. Charities that seek to increase care in
   society (e.g., disaster-relief charities) should utilize compassion in
   their promotion campaigns, but charities that seek to promote fairness
   and equality in society (e.g., human rights charities) should utilize
   gratitude in their promotion campaigns. One field study (N = 2,112) and
   four experiments (N = 2,100) demonstrate that utilizing a positive
   emotion congruent with the charity's moral objective increases monetary
   donations and preferences. The preferences are driven by the moral
   concerns made salient by the respective emotions. Further, the
   preferences attenuate when exchange norms are made salient. Altogether,
   these results underscore the importance of considering moral congruence
   in consumption contexts.

   leads customers to feel ignored and to form abstract high-level
   construals. Explicit rejection (implicit ignoring) causes consumers to
   form more (less) vivid mental imagery of the exclusionary experience and
   to activate a concrete (abstract) mindset, resulting in preferences for
   tangible (intangible) and visual (textual) compensation options.
   Retailers are advised to align their compensation with construal levels
   to increase post-recovery customer satisfaction, customer reviews,
   intended loyalty, and brand referral behavior.

AB This research examines the effect of social exclusion on consumers'
   preferences for visual density. Based on seven experimental studies, we
   reveal that consumers who perceive themselves as socially excluded
   evaluate products with dense visual patterns more positively than their
   nonexcluded peers. This effect occurs because social exclusion triggers
   a feeling of psychological emptiness and dense patterns can provide a
   sense of being "filled," which helps to alleviate this feeling of
   emptiness. This effect is attenuated when consumers physically fill
   something or experience a feeling of "temporal density" (i.e., imagining
   a busy schedule with many tasks packed into a short time). These results
   shed light on consumers' socially grounded product aesthetic preferences
   and offer practical implications for marketers, designers, and policy
   makers.

AB Whether it is clothing, meals or an exercise regimen, consumers purchase
   a wide range of goods on a recurring basis using a subscription model.
   While past research indicates that people continue to subscribe to these
   services even when they rarely use them, no work to date has examined
   how identity considerations affect preferences in this domain. Building
   on research on signaling and self-concept structure, we propose that
   quitting an ongoing subscription can threaten the stability of the
   self-concept by signaling a change in identity. Consumers who are
   uncertain about their self-concept (i.e., low self-concept clarity) and
   motivated to maintain a stable self-concept are thus more likely to keep
   unused subscriptions than those who are more certain. In support of the
   underlying mechanism, we demonstrate that self-concept clarity affects
   choices only for identity-relevant subscription choices, and that it
   affects choices for subscriptions, but not one-shot product choices that
   are a weaker signal of identity. Finally, because signing up for a new
   subscription also signals an identity change that can threaten the
   stability of the self, consumers with low self-concept clarity are also
   less likely to subscribe to a new service compared to those with more
   certain self-concepts.

AB The nature of a person's motivation (whether it is intrinsic or
   extrinsic) is a key predictor of how committed they are to a task, and
   hence how well they are likely to perform at it. However, it is
   difficult to reliably communicate and make inferences about such fine
   nuances regarding another person's motivation. Building on the social
   functional view of emotion and the evolutionary and psychophysical
   characteristics of facial expression of emotions, this research suggests
   that displayed enjoyment, as evidenced by the size and type of someone's
   smile, can serve as a strong nonverbal signal of intrinsic motivation.
   Taking the perspective of both actors and observers, five studies show
   that people infer greater intrinsic motivation when they see others
   display large Duchenne (vs. small) smiles, and that actors intuit this
   relationship, strategically displaying larger and more Duchenne-like
   smiles if they have an accessible goal to signal intrinsic (vs.
   extrinsic or no specific) motivation.

AB The present research proposes a new perspective to investigate the
   effect of product anthropomorphism on consumers' comparative judgment
   strategy in comparing two anthropomorphized (vs. two
   nonanthropomorphized) product options in a consideration set. Six
   experiments show that anthropomorphism increases consumers' use of an
   absolute judgment strategy (vs. a dimension-by-dimension strategy) in
   comparative judgment, leading to increased preference for the option
   with a more favorable overall evaluation over the option with a greater
   number of superior dimensions. The effect is mediated by consumers'
   perception of each anthropomorphized product alternative as an
   integrated entity rather than a bundle of separate attributes. The
   authors find the effect to be robust by directly tracing the process of
   participants' information processing using MouseLab software and
   eye-tracking techniques, and by self-reported preferences and real
   consumption choices. Moreover, the effect is moderated by the motivation
   to seek maximized accuracy or ease. These studies have important
   implications for theories about anthropomorphism and comparative
   judgment as well as marketing practice.

AB The idea that consumers use products to feel good about themselves is a
   basic tenet of marketing. Yet, in addition to the motive to
   self-enhance, consumers also strive to confirm their self-views (i.e.,
   self-verification). Although self-verification provides self-related
   benefits, its role in consumer behavior is poorly understood. To redress
   that gap, we examine a dispositional variable-trait self-esteem-that
   predicts whether consumers self-verify in the marketplace. We propose
   that low (vs. high) self-esteem consumers gravitate toward inferior
   products because those products confirm their pessimistic self-views.
   Five studies supported our theorizing: low (vs. high) self-esteem
   participants gravitated toward inferior products (study 1) because of
   the motivation to self-verify (study 2). Low self-esteem consumers
   preferred inferior products only when those products signaled
   pessimistic (vs. positive) self-views and could therefore be
   self-verifying (study 3). Even more telling, low self-esteem consumers'
   propensity to choose inferior products disappeared after they were
   induced to view themselves as consumers of superior products (study 4),
   but remained in the wake of negative feedback (study 5). Our
   investigation thus highlights self-esteem as a boundary condition for
   compensatory consumption. By pinpointing factors that predict when
   self-verification guides consumer behavior, this work enriches the
   field's understanding of how products serve self-motives.

AB Consumers often encounter advertisements in the background while
   primarily focused on other stimuli (e.g., while multitasking).
   Consumers' perceived level of distraction by these background ads serves
   as a metacognitive cue from which inferences are drawn. When consumers
   perceive themselves to be relatively distracted by a background
   advertisement, they draw on an underlying lay theory that distraction
   implies interest in the contents of the distracting stimulus to make the
   metacognitive inference that they have positive evaluations of the
   advertised brand. Across five studies, we provide evidence for this
   proposed metacognitive inferential process by demonstrating that
   perceived distraction does not enhance brand evaluations when the
   distraction = interest lay theory is not perceived to be (1) diagnostic
   or (2) applicable to the current context (e.g., when consumers have
   little interest in the product category being advertised). Thus, this
   research introduces distraction as a new metacognitive experience from
   which consumers draw inferences and offers important insights into when
   and how background ads shape brand evaluations.

AB Consumers' judgments of the magnitude of benefit that a product provides
   increase their likelihood of purchasing it, and their judgments of the
   magnitude of harm that accrues from purchasing a product decrease their
   likelihood of purchasing it. When assessing the magnitude of a product's
   potential outcome, consumers often encounter information about its
   probability of occurring. Ten studies demonstrate that this information
   biases consumers' product decisions. Consumers both expect and perceive
   larger-probability outcomes to be larger in magnitude-even when they
   receive identical and objective information about the outcome's actual
   magnitude. This bias emerges because people believe that larger
   probabilities emanate from more powerful causal antecedents, and in turn
   expect more powerful antecedents to produce larger outcomes. Moreover,
   this bias shapes consumers' product decisions. Of course, it is rational
   for people to prefer products that promise high-probability benefits and
   to avoid products that produce high-probability harms. But consumers
   irrationally overweight this probability information because it distorts
   their judgments of the magnitude of products' benefits and harms, and
   this distortion biases their purchase decisions.

AB Consumers set a lower consumption budget when they set individual
   calorie budgets for constituent categories (e.g., breakfast, lunch,
   dinner, and snacks; categorical approach) versus when they set a total
   budget (overall approach). This contraction effect of unpacking a
   judgment is driven by motivated reasoning. Consumers are motivated to
   reduce calorie consumption, and this motive directs their cognitive
   elaboration for the budget decision to be on what to cut and how much to
   cut. Furthermore, the categorical (vs. overall) approach brings to mind
   more thoughts that are consistent with the motive to reduce consumption,
   which then leads to a lower calorie budget. Consistent with this
   explanation, the level of elaboration on reducing calorie
   intake-especially on occasions where over-consumption is less
   salient-mediates the contraction effect. In addition, the contraction
   effect is attenuated when the motive to reduce consumption is
   deactivated. Finally, while the contraction effect occurs when consumers
   have a motive to reduce consumption, the classic expansion effect of
   unpacking occurs when consumers are prompted to think about what to
   consume or are motivated to increase consumption. The results for
   calorie budgeting are shown to have downstream consequences on actual
   food consumption.

AB Brand leaders possess tremendous agency, with the ability to shape a
   sweeping variety of outcomes. Does this fact confer psychological value
   to consumers? We posit that external conditions that undermine feelings
   of personal control cause consumers to affiliate more with brand
   leaders. This occurs because affiliating with such high-agency brands
   gives consumers a sense of personal agency and thereby restores feelings
   of control. An initial study using archival data from nearly 18,000
   consumers reporting on over 1,200 brands documents real-world effects
   that are consistent with these propositions. Four follow-up experiments
   demonstrate the effect of low control on brand leader (vs. nonleader)
   purchase intentions using direct manipulations in controlled settings,
   capture the underlying process, and rule out alternative explanations.
   This research thus reveals that the psychology of personal control
   underlies a process that benefits brand leaders.

AB Millions of Americans are targeted by investment scams, resulting in
   billions of dollars lost each year. Previous research indicates that
   investment fraud victims are more likely to be male, white, and married,
   and to have higher socioeconomic status compared to the general US
   population, but little research examines what behaviors and mindsets
   differentiate them from other investors. A telephone survey was
   administered to 214 investment fraud victims and 813 general investors
   recruited using random digit dialing. Based on the opportunity model of
   predatory victimization, the aim was to identify differences in
   investment behaviors and psychological mindsets that may affect exposure
   to investment scams and make individuals more attractive and susceptible
   targets. In addition to being older and male, victims were more
   materialistic than general investors and were more frequent stock
   traders, and purchased more investments sold through unsolicited calls,
   emails, television advertisements, or "free lunch" seminars, but were
   less likely to invest based on a social network member's recommendation.
   As more retirees begin to take on managing their retirement assets, many
   may be tempted by unreasonable investment returns promised by
   unscrupulous brokers. Findings point to specific areas where investor
   education is needed to counteract poor investment decision-making and

AB Cues in the environment can prime consumer identities, increasing
   adoption of behaviors consistent with the primed identity and avoidance
   of behaviors consistent with alternate (nonprimed) identities. Although
   alternate-identity avoidance is common, three studies show that priming
   an identity (e.g., student) can also encourage consumers to approach
   alternate identities (e.g., friend). When two identities are relatively
   easy to balance (e.g., sufficient time for both student- and
   friend-related activities), participants approach alternate identities
   that are associated with the primed identity following a cognitive
   process of spreading activation. However, when identities are difficult
   to balance, participants approach alternate identities that are
   dissociated from the primed identity. We argue that this reversal occurs
   owing to a switch from a cognitive process to a motivational process
   akin to that seen in multiple-goal management. Under the motivational
   process, priming a focal identity inhibits (activates) associated
   (dissociated) identities because the two are seen as (non-)substitutable
   with each other. The motivational process under high balance difficulty
   relaxes when participants can self-affirm, causing response to instead
   mimic the cognitive process. The resulting integrative framework
   introduces identity-balance difficulty and its interaction with
   association into identity research, uniquely highlighting the importance
   of multiple-identity management with implications for research and
   practice.

AB The present research proposes that luxury consumption can be a
   double-edged sword: while luxury consumption yields status benefits, it
   can also make consumers feel inauthentic, producing what we call the
   impostor syndrome from luxury consumption. As a result, paradoxically,
   luxury consumption may backfire and lead consumers to behave less
   confidently due to their undermined feelings of self-authenticity.
   Feelings of inauthenticity from luxury consumption may arise because
   consumers perceive luxury as an undue privilege. These feelings are less
   pronounced among consumers with high levels of chronic psychological

AB An increasingly prevalent form of social influence occurs online where
   consumers read reviews written by other consumers. Do people rely on
   consumer reviews differently when making experiential purchases (events
   to live through) versus when making material purchases (objects to
   keep)? Though people often use consumer reviews both when making
   experiential and material purchases, an analysis of more than six
   million reviews on Amazon.com and four laboratory experiments reveal
   that people are less likely to rely on consumer reviews for experiential
   purchases than for material purchases. This effect is driven by beliefs
   that reviews are less reflective of the purchase's objective quality for
   experiences than for material goods. These findings not only indicate
   how different types of purchases are influenced by word of mouth, but
   also illuminate the psychological processes underlying shoppers'
   reliance on consumer reviews. Furthermore, as one of the first
   investigations into how people choose among various experiential and
   material purchase options, these findings suggest that people are less
   receptive to being told what to do than what to have.

AB Although research has consistently demonstrated that people prefer to
   purchase products and brands that represent their identity, relatively
   little research has examined how this identity relevance influences
   product usage. Drawing from work on intertemporal choice, the present
   work proposes a conceptual framework for the influence of identity on
   product usage. The authors theorize and demonstrate an identity
   conservation effect, in that consumers are less likely to use nondurable
   identity products compared to nonidentity products because the tradeoff
   between possession value and in-use value is larger for identity
   products. Six studies demonstrate the identity conservation effect and
   provide support for the value tradeoff framework through both mediation
   and theoretically supported moderation.

AB Advertisers often depict their products being consumed in a social
   setting, but they also depict people secretly consuming their products.
   Will consumers like a product more if they are prompted to consume it in
   secret? We report eight studies, where women consumed and evaluated
   products such as cookies, chocolate, and apple chips. Women in secret
   consumption conditions were instructed to imagine eating the food in
   secret, instructed to hide the food from others while consuming it, or
   shown an advertisement encouraging eating the food in secret. These
   secret consumption prompts resulted in more positive product evaluations
   and increased product choice, compared to evaluations in non-secret
   conditions. We identify preoccupation and attitude polarization as the
   primary drivers for these outcomes. When women consume a product in
   secret, they become preoccupied with the product, as thoughts about the
   product continually pop into mind. Increased thinking leads to attitude
   polarization, where evaluations for products they like become even more
   positive. Finally, we also identify moderators of these secrecy effects.

AB Consumers routinely encounter situations in which they perceive that
   resources are scarce. However, little is known about how this perception
   influences consumers' use of price in their purchase decisions. The
   present research seeks to fill this gap by examining the link between
   scarcity and the tendency to use price to judge product quality, and the
   mechanisms underlying that link. Six studies (and five more reported in
   the web appendix) using multiple product categories and a variety of
   operationalizations of both scarcity and price-quality judgments show
   that scarcity decreases consumers' tendency to use price to judge
   product quality. This occurs because scarcity induces a desire to
   compensate for the shortage and seek abundance, and thereby reduces an
   individual's general categorization tendency (because categorizing
   brings about a feeling of reduction); this, in turn, hinders consumers
   from viewing products as belonging to different price-tier groups, and
   thus lowers their tendency to use price as a basis for judging product
   quality. Boundary conditions for the proposed effect are also
   identified. The current research makes fundamental contributions to the
   literatures on scarcity, price-quality judgments, and categorization.

AB Company apologies require apologizers, which can take the form of one
   person or multiple people. Does the number of apologizers influence how
   consumers interpret and respond to that apology? The current research
   suggests that a single apologizer proves more effective than multiple
   apologizers because consumers tend to have a stronger empathic response
   towards one person than towards multiple people. Across one archival
   study and four experiments, a single apologizer (relative to multiple
   apologizers) garners higher stock returns (study 1), elicits a higher
   rate of behavior indicative of acceptance of the apology (study 2), and
   more readily facilitates consumer forgiveness of the company, perceived
   company integrity, and satisfaction with the apology (studies 3-5). This
   effect is mediated by empathy for the apologizer (studies 4 and 5), and
   the benefit for a single apologizer dissipates when consumers perceive
   multiple apologizers as entitative, united members (study 5).
   Contributions and implications are discussed.

AB Romantic relationships are built on trust, but partners are not always
   honest about their financial behavior-they may hide spending, debt, and
   savings from one another. This article introduces the construct of
   financial infidelity, defined as "engaging in any financial behavior
   expected to be disapproved of by one's romantic partner and
   intentionally failing to disclose this behavior to them." We develop and
   validate the Financial Infidelity Scale (FI-Scale) to measure individual
   variation in consumers' financial infidelity proneness. In 10 lab
   studies, one field study, and analyses of real bank account data
   collected in partnership with a couples' money-management mobile
   application, we demonstrate that the FI-Scale has strong psychometric
   properties, is distinct from conceptually related scales, and predicts
   actual financial infidelity among married consumers. Importantly, the
   FI-Scale predicts a broad range of consumption-related behaviors (e.g.,
   spending despite anticipated spousal disapproval, preferences for
   discreet payment methods and unmarked packaging, concealing bank account
   information). Our work is the first to introduce, define, and measure
   financial infidelity reliably and succinctly and examine its antecedents
   and consequences.

AB In many situations, consumers use green products without a deliberate
   choice to use or purchase the product. This research explores how using
   a green product (e.g., a pair of headphones made from recycled
   materials) influences the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption
   experience (e.g., listening to music), even if consumers have not
   deliberately chosen or purchased the product. Five experiments in actual
   consumption settings revealed that using a green (vs. conventional)
   product enhances the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption
   experience, referred to as the greenconsumption effect. Merely using a
   green product makes consumers perceive an increase in the extent to
   which they are valued as individuals by society, which leads to warm
   glow feelings, and consequently enhances the enjoyment of the
   accompanying consumption experience. When consumers experience low
   social worth, the positive effect of using green products on the
   accompanying consumption experience is amplified. The greenconsumption
   effect disappears when the negative environmental impact of the green
   product attribute is low. From a managerial standpoint, the current
   research identifies instances where brands can benefit from going green
   and encourages marketers, especially service providers, to promote green
   products that are instrumental in consumption experiences.

AB Consumers often try to visually identify a previously encountered
   product among a sequence of similar items, guided only by their memory
   and a few general search terms. What determines their success at
   correctly identifying the target product in such "product lineups"? The
   current research finds that the longer consumers search sequentially,
   the more conservative and-ironically-inaccurate judges they become.
   Consequently, the more consumers search, the more likely they are to
   erroneously reject the correct target when it finally appears in the
   lineup. This happens because each time consumers evaluate a similar item
   in the lineup, and determine that it is not the option for which they
   have been looking, they draw an implicit inference that the correct
   target should feel more familiar than the similar items rejected up to
   that point. This causes the subjective feeling of familiarity consumers
   expect to experience with the true target to progressively escalate,
   making them more conservative but also less accurate judges. The
   findings have practical implications for consumers and marketers, and
   make theoretical contributions to research on inference-making, online
   search, and product recognition.

AB When a consumer realizes that information relevant to a consumption
   decision is missing, such uncertainty can be attributed to ignorance
   (i.e., the information has never been observed and is unknown) or to
   memory failure (i.e., the information has been observed and is
   forgotten). Although research has examined inferences about unknown
   attributes, no prior work has examined inferences about forgotten
   attributes. Across six experiments in the lab and in the field, we find
   that when uncertainty is attributed to ignorance, consumers often make
   inferences about unknown attributes based on existing correlational
   evidence (e.g., a brand comparison sheet that could indicate a positive
   or negative correlation between the unknown attribute and observable
   attributes). However, when uncertainty is attributed to memory failure,
   consumers tend to ignore such existing correlational evidence and
   instead make inferences about forgotten attributes that tend to be
   positively correlated with known attributes. This process occurs partly
   because when consumers believe that an attribute was forgotten, they
   falsely retrieve an impression about the attribute that tends to be
   consistent with their overall product evaluation. Overall, believing
   that an attribute is forgotten and believing that it is unknown can lead
   to opposite inferences and choices.

AB Promotional games are used frequently in retail stores and online. While
   prior literature has focused on antecedents of promotional games, such
   as how individual differences induce game participation, little is known
   about post-winning decision making or its underlying processes. This
   study offers findings from seven studies to provide a detailed
   perspective on how promotional games increase consumer conversion rates
   and spending. The effect of winning a discount on conversion rates and
   spending is multiply determined and occurs via perceptions of luck and
   store affective attitude, and via perceptions of luck alone and store
   affective attitude alone. In order to get a more nuanced understanding
   of the underlying processes and to delineate theoretically driven
   boundary conditions for this novel effect, the authors subsequently
   analyze the two individual pathways through perceptions of luck and
   store affective attitude in isolation. Thereby, they contribute to the
   literature on pricing and promotions by providing a detailed
   understanding on how winning a promotional discount leads to a different
   set of consumer inferences relative to an equivalent straight discount,
   and to the literature on the role of luck in consumer behavior by
   providing a nuanced understanding of how luck operates in this common

AB Trickle-down theories suggest that status symbols and fashion trends
   originate from the elites and move downward, but some high-end
   restaurants serve lowbrow food (e.g., potato chips, macaroni and
   cheese), and some high-status individuals wear downscale clothing (e.g.,
   ripped jeans, duct-taped shoes). Why would high-status actors adopt
   items traditionally associated with low-status groups? Using a signaling
   perspective to explain this phenomenon, the authors suggest that elites
   sometimes adopt items associated with low-status groups as a costly
   signal to distinguish themselves from middle-status individuals. As a
   result, signals sometimes trickle round, moving directly from the lower
   to the upper class, before diffusing to the middle class. Furthermore,
   consistent with a signaling perspective, the presence of multiple
   signaling dimensions facilitates this effect, enabling the highs to mix
   and match high and low signals and differentiate themselves. These
   findings deepen the understanding of signaling dynamics, support a
   trickle-round theory of fashion, and shed light on alternative status
   symbols.

   evokes volatility when faced with a risky prospect, but prefer a name
   that evokes calmness when faced with a safe prospect. The authors posit
   that a volatile (vs. calm) prospect name results in more perceived
   fluctuations, and thus greater movement from, the given risk level.
   Therefore, a volatile prospect name results in a wider range of
   probabilities compared to a calm prospect name. The authors test the
   proposed effect and the role of the phonetic elements of a name using
   real-world data and controlled studies within diverse consumer domains

AB At work, at school, at the gym club, or even at home, consumers often
   face challenging situations in which they are motivated to perform their
   best. This research demonstrates that activating performance goals,
   whether in cognitive or physical domains, leads to an increase in the
   consumption of high-calorie foods at the expense of good nutrition. This
   effect derives from beliefs that the function of food is to provide
   energy for the body (food as fuel) coupled with poor nutrition literacy,
   leading consumers to overgeneralize the instrumental role of calories
   for performance. Indeed, nutrition experts choose very different foods
   (lower in calorie, higher in nutritional value) than lay consumers in
   response to performance goals. Also, performance goals no longer
   increase calorie intake when emphasizing the hedonic function of food
   (food for pleasure). Hence, while consumer research often interprets the
   overconsumption of pleasurable and unhealthy high-calorie foods as a
   consequence of hedonic goals and self-control failures, our research
   suggests that this overconsumption may also be explained by a
   maladaptive motivation to manage energy intake.

AB Some life transitions are difficult and prolonged, such as becoming an
   independent adult, forming a family, or adopting healthy consumption
   habits. Permanent liminality describes transitions that can span years
   and even a lifetime with no anticipated end. To understand how consumers
   are caught in permanent liminality, we examine how Pentecostal converts
   consume religious services in their difficult transition from the
   secular "world" to Pentecostalism. We draw on the concept of in/dividual
   personhood to explain how the Pentecostal dividual is coconstituted in
   an endless movement between the undesired "worldly" in/dividual and the
   contiguous incorporation into the desired Pentecostal in/dividual and
   structure. Pentecostals' permanent liminality thus involves ongoing
   cycles of separation and incorporation within zones of indeterminacy, in
   which neither separation nor incorporation is ever completed. This
   theoretical framework explains the unfinished transition of Pentecostal
   converts as contested dividuals. We extend this theoretical explanation
   for future research on liquid modernity and consumers caught in
   permanent liminality.

AB Many studies document the benefits of presenting smaller quantities of
   products, particularly when differences in quantity relate to
   availability or popularity. However, we know less about the effects of
   quantity differences in contexts unrelated to scarcity, such as when
   products are depicted in ads, special displays, or online retailing
   settings. The present research builds on extant literature by
   investigating a previously unexplored question: How do product
   perceptions differ depending on whether consumers view a single unit in
   isolation, versus as one unit among identical product replicates? Five
   experiments demonstrate that presenting multiple product replicates as a
   group (vs. presenting a single item) increases product efficacy
   perceptions because it leads consumers to perceive products as more
   homogeneous and unified around a shared goal. That is, consumers
   perceive greater product entitativity when viewing a group of product
   replicates. As a result, the perceived and actual ability of products to
   deliver that function (i.e., product efficacy) increases.

AB The authors introduce emotional ability similarity to explain consumer
   satisfaction in interactions with frontline sales and service employees
   and other consumers beyond the effects of traditional relational
   variables in the similarity-attraction paradigm. Four studies examine
   how and why similar abilities for using emotional information between
   two people promote relational success in marketplace exchanges. We find
   that, when interacting with others, consumers who exchange nonverbal
   information with their partners experience (dis)similarity in their
   emotional ability (EA). Similar dyads who rely on expressive (high-high
   EA pairs) or inexpressive (low-low EA pairs) emotion norms experience
   significantly greater satisfaction in their interactions than consumers
   with dissimilar norms (high-low EA pairs). Together, these findings
   advance the understanding of consumer relationships and satisfaction by
   establishing EA similarity as a new avenue for consumer research.

AB In light of consumers' growing dependence on their smartphones, this
   article investigates the nature of the relationship that consumers form
   with their smartphone and its underlying mechanisms. We propose that in
   addition to obvious functional benefits, consumers in fact derive
   emotional benefits from their smartphone-in particular, feelings of
   psychological comfort and, if needed, actual stress relief. In other
   words, in a sense, smartphones are not unlike adult pacifiers. This
   psychological comfort arises from a unique combination of properties
   that turn smartphones into a reassuring presence for their owners: the
   portability of the device, its personal nature, the subjective sense of
   privacy experienced while on the device, and the haptic gratification it
   affords. Results from one large-scale field study and three laboratory
   experiments support the proposed underlying mechanisms and document
   downstream consequences of the psychological comfort that smartphones
   provide. The findings show, for example, that (a) in moments of stress,
   consumers exhibit a greater tendency to seek out their smartphone (study
   2); and (b) engaging with one's smartphone provides greater stress
   relief than engaging in the same activity with a comparable device such
   as one's laptop (study 3) or a similar smartphone belonging to someone
   else (study 4).

AB Individuals often experience incidental device-delivered haptic feedback
   (e.g., vibrational alerts accompanying messages on mobile phones and
   wearables), yet almost no research has examined the psychological and
   behavioral implications of technology-mediated touch on consumers.
   Drawing from theories in social psychology and computer science, we
   explore how device-delivered haptic feedback may have the capability to
   augment consumer responses to certain consumer-directed communications.
   Across four studies, we find that haptic alerts accompanying messages
   can improve consumer performance on related tasks and demonstrate that
   this effect is driven by an increased sense of social presence in what
   can otherwise feel like an impersonal technological exchange. These
   findings provide applied value for mobile marketers and gadget
   designers, and carry important implications for consumer compliance in
   health and fitness domains.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to soon replace human drivers and
   promise substantial benefits to society. Yet, consumers remain skeptical
   about handing over control to an AV. Partly because there is uncertainty
   about the appropriate moral norms for such vehicles (e.g., should AVs
   protect the passenger or the pedestrian if harm is unavoidable?).
   Building on recent work on AV morality, the current research examined
   how people resolve the dilemma between protecting self versus a
   pedestrian, and what they expect an AV to do in a similar situation.
   Five studies revealed that participants considered harm to a pedestrian
   more permissible with an AV as compared to self as the decision agent in
   a regular car. This shift in moral judgments was driven by the
   attribution of responsibility to the AV and was observed for both severe
   and moderate harm, and when harm was real or imagined. However, the
   effect was attenuated when five pedestrians or a child could be harmed.
   These findings suggest that AVs can change prevailing moral norms and
   promote an increased self-interest among consumers. This has relevance
   for the design and policy issues related to AVs. It also highlights the
   moral implications of autonomous agents replacing human decision-makers.

AB By using scenarios based on moral dilemmas, Gill (2020) found that when
   consumers are riding in an autonomous vehicle (AV), they are more
   willing to harm a pedestrian than when they, themselves, are driving a
   regular car. By taking a first-person perspective, in contrast to most
   prior research that has taken a third-person perspective, the problem is
   framed in a personal way that allows identification of a mechanism of
   responsibility attribution. In this commentary, a generalized framework
   is developed in which we can locate the work of Gill (2020), as well as
   prior research that uses moral dilemmas, to understand how consumers
   believe that AVs should respond when faced with competing life-and-death
   alternatives. The framework shows the distinct positions that research
   to date has adopted, points out gaps in research, and suggests a family
   of four research agendas that can be pursued going forward, driven in
   large part by the perspective taken to the moral dilemma. Research
   employing these different perspectives, including the unresearched
   problem of taking the perspective of the object, holds promise for using
   moral dilemmas for enabling our understanding of consumer experience and
   consumer-object relationships with AVs.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying economic downturn have
   dramatically impacted the lives of consumers around the world. From a
   conceptual perspective, such health and economic threats can severely
   disrupt consumers' sense of ontological security and elicit adaptive
   responses by both consumers and marketers. Given the opportune timing,
   this issue of the Journal of Consumer Research is focused on articles
   that address questions of consumers' responses to external threats. The
   purpose of this introduction is to provide an organizing "conceptual
   tapestry" to connect the articles appearing in the issue. This framework
   is provided as a tool to help researchers structure their particular
   projects within the broader landscape of consumer threat response and to
   present some potential directions for future research. In conjunction
   with these articles, we hope that this conceptual framework will provide
   a point of departure for researchers seeking to enhance the
   understanding of how consumers and markets collectively respond over the
   short term and long term to threats that disrupt consumers' routines,
   lives, or even the fabric of society.

AB This article brings the sociological theory of governmentality to bear
   on a longitudinal analysis of American presidential speeches to theorize
   the formation of the citizen-consumer subject. This 40-year historical
   analysis-which extends through four economic recessions and the
   presidential terms of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and
   Barack Obama-illustrates the ways in which the national mythology of the
   American Dream has been linked to the political ideology of the state to
   create the citizen-consumer subject in the United States. The
   quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data demonstrates 1) the
   consistent emphasis on responsibility as a key moral value, albeit
   meshed with ideals of liberalism and libertarianism at different
   presidential periods; 2) that the presidents iteratively link the
   neoliberal political ideology and the national mythology of the American
   Dream through a sophisticated morality play myth, wherein they cast the
   citizen-consumer as a responsible moral hero on a journey to achieve the
   American Dream; and 3) that the presidents use three main
   dispositives-disciplinary, legal, and security-to craft the
   citizen-consumer subject in their response to economic recessions. These
   findings extend prior consumer research on consumer subjectivity,
   consumer moralism, marketplace mythology, and politics of consumption.

AB The age to which people expect to live likely drives many important
   consumer decisions. Yet we know surprisingly little about the
   antecedents and consequences of consumers' subjective life expectancies.
   In the present work, we propose that subjective life expectancy is
   influenced by the combination of people's childhood environment and
   their current environment. We find that people who grew up in poorer
   environments expected to have a shorter lifespan compared to people who
   grew up in richer environments when faced with a current stressor. We
   document that experiencing a stressor leads people from resource-poor
   childhoods to believe they will die sooner because they respond to
   stressors in a more pessimistic way. We further show that subjective
   life expectancy is an important psychological mechanism that directly
   contributes to multiple consumer decisions, including desire for
   long-term care insurance, decisions about retirement savings, and
   preference for long-term bonds. Overall, the present work opens future
   research avenues by showing how, why, and when subjective life
   expectancy influences consumer behavior.

AB Consumers regularly encounter cues of contagious disease in daily life-a
   commuter sneezes on the train, a colleague blows their nose in a
   meeting, or they read recent headlines about the dangerous spread of a
   disease. Research has overwhelmingly argued that the dominant response
   to these cues is disgust-an emotion that leads to a desire to reject and
   avoid potential contamination. We argue, however, that contagious
   disease cues can also elicit fear. Across four experiments and two large
   empirical data analyses of the presence of contagious disease on actual
   consumption behavior, we find that cues of contagious disease increase
   both fear and disgust, and these emotions together form a unique
   behavioral tendency with respect to consumer behavior. Relative to
   either emotion alone, disgust and fear increase preference for
   more-familiar products asymmetrically over less-familiar ones. These
   results contribute theoretically to research on complex emotional states
   and the behavioral tendencies of emotions, document a systematic and
   consequential impact of contagious disease cues on real consumption
   behavior, and have significant practical implications for marketers.

AB This article examines how exposure to disease-related cues influences
   consumers' preference for typical (vs. atypical) product options.
   Merging insights from evolutionary psychology with research on
   preference for typicality in consumer products, we predict that disease
   salience decreases relative preference for typical versus atypical
   options, because typical products are implicitly associated with many
   people, misaligning them with the people-avoidance motive triggered by
   disease cues. We further build on this conceptualization to identify
   situations in which this preference shift might be eliminated.
   Specifically, we argue that the focal effect will not manifest when the
   disease in question is explicitly described to be noncontagious, or when
   an anti-infection intervention is introduced, or when the decision
   context involves minimum infection. Results from six studies provide
   support for our predictions, advancing basic knowledge on the
   evolutionary strategies guiding disease avoidance, while also
   documenting how such strategies can affect consumer preferences.

AB How does coping with a resource loss of time, space, or money change a
   consumer? In the current work, we argue that resource losses that give
   rise to budget contractions require a coping strategy that not only
   influences choice in the moment but also changes underlying consumer
   preferences. We show that the preference restructuring that occurs when
   coping with a budget loss also leads to stabilization of preferences.
   Specifically, a consumer who allocates a budget to a set of items prior
   to a budget contraction and allocates that same budget post-contraction
   when the budget is fully restored will allocate the restored budget to
   fewer options in the set. Coping with the contraction helps consumers
   prioritize what matters to them, leading to refinement of preference.
   This within-consumer preference refinement effect exists for budgets of
   time, space, and money. We identify boundary conditions (i.e.,
   significant budget contractions and self-determined contraction
   allocations are necessary for prioritization to occur) and rule out
   non-prioritization explanations (e.g., anchoring and under-adjusting).
   These findings suggest that marketers should focus on capturing
   consumers who are dealing with budget contractions as this is one of the
   moments where individuals revisit and rediscover what matters most to
   them.

AB Past research demonstrates that reminders of one's own mortality can
   lead to materialistic and self-serving consumer behaviors. In contrast,
   across five studies, we explore a condition under which mortality
   salience (MS) leads to increased tendency to give away one's
   possessions-when the donation act is high in transcendence potential. We
   propose and find that consumers are more likely to donate their
   possessions to charity under MS (vs. comparison conditions) when the
   product is considered highly (vs. not highly) connected to the self.
   Moreover, we demonstrate that this tendency manifests only when
   transcendence is attainable through donation. In support of the
   proposition of transcendence as the underlying mechanism, the observed
   effects are attenuated under conditions where: (1) transcendence has
   already been satiated via alternative means or (2) the donated
   possession will not transcend the self (i.e., its physical integrity is
   lost by being broken down and recycled). The theoretical and practical
   implications of the work are discussed.

AB We demonstrate that natural products are more strongly preferred when
   used to prevent a problem than when used to cure a problem (the
   prevent/cure effect). This organizing principle explains variation in
   the preference for natural across distinct product categories (e.g.,
   food vs. medicine), within product categories (e.g., between different
   types of medicines), and for the same product depending on how it is
   used (to prevent or to cure ailments). The prevent/cure effect is driven
   by two factors: lay beliefs about product attributes and importance of
   product attributes. Specifically, (a) consumers hold lay beliefs that
   natural products are safer and less potent and (b) consumers care more
   about safety and less about potency when preventing as compared to when
   curing, which leads to a stronger preference for natural when
   preventing. Consistent with this explanation, when natural products are
   described as more risky and more potent, reversing the standard
   inferences about naturalness, then natural products become more
   preferred for curing than for preventing. This research sheds light on
   when the marketing of "natural" is most appealing to consumers.

AB Previous research in consumer behavior and decision-making has explored
   many important aspects of social observation. However, the effect of
   social observation during the specific time wherein consumers construct
   their preferences remains relatively understudied. The present work
   seeks to fill this knowledge gap and adds to this literature by studying
   how consumers react to being observed during the preference-construction
   stage (i.e., prior to reaching their decision). While existing research
   on social observation focuses on accountability and self-presentation
   concerns, the present study uncovers an additional unique concern.
   Specifically, eight studies (three additional studies reported in the
   web appendix) find that being observed prior to reaching the decision
   threatens consumers' sense of autonomy in making the decision, resulting
   in an aversion to being observed. Furthermore, we find that such threats
   lead consumers to terminate their decision by avoiding purchase or by
   choosing default options. Given the extent to which consumers are
   observed in the marketplace by other individuals and by online
   platforms, and given the rise in consumers' privacy concerns associated
   with such practices, understanding consumer reactions to being observed
   in the predecisional stage is an important topic with practical
   implications.

AB Using a sample of individuals who hold target retirement funds (TRFs),
   we examine how people use arithmetic to estimate their retirement age.
   We find a robust "zero" bias where investors have a strong preference
   for TRFs that end with zero compared to TRFs that end with five. The
   evidence is consistent that the bias is an outcome of people using
   imprecise arithmetic, specifically rounding up and down in the
   computational estimation required to estimate their retirement year. The
   zero bias manifests itself in people born in years ending between eight
   and two. Those born in zero-through two-ending years select TRFs that
   imply they intend to retire at 70, whereas those born in eight-and
   nine-ending years choose TRFs that imply retiring at 60. The choices can
   significantly lower or increase wealth by altering the contribution
   amounts and exposing investors to risk incompatible with their age
   profile. The bias is particularly costly for those who are risk averse
   and select later TRFs but is also most beneficial to risk-averse
   consumers who choose early TRFs. We experimentally confirm that the
   contribution rates are related to the TRF choices and that the use of
   imprecise mathematical rounding is implicated in the bias.

   rooted in perceptions that warm foods are more filling and tastier than
   cold ones, which enhance warm foods' desirability and affect consumer
   choices. The preference for warm products is mitigated when food energy
   does not provide utility to consumers though, such as when consumers
   have a health goal active, and it reverses when consumers purposefully
   aim to reduce their calorie intake. The "warm is calorie-rich" intuition
   is important for marketers and managers because warm food temperatures
   can increase willingness to pay (by 25%) and amount served (+27%), as
   well as influence consumer preferences. This intuition also has
   important public policy implications: consumers tend to underestimate
   the nutritional value of cold foods, resulting in increased consumption
   of calories (+31%) and fat (+37%).

AB Entrepreneurs are increasingly relying on online crowdfunding-the use of
   online platforms to raise money from a large number of people-to finance
   their ventures. This research explores the proposition that the amounts
   contributed by the majority of funders in the early stages of a
   crowdfunding campaign may have a counterintuitive influence on follow-up
   contributions and on the campaign's fund-raising success. Findings from
   an analysis of real-world large-scale crowdfunding data and five
   experiments show that potential funders are more (vs. less) likely to
   contribute to a newly launched project when early contributions consist
   mainly of relatively small (vs. large) amounts. The results further show
   that this Small Predicts Large effect is driven by people's relationship
   inferences: when contributions made at the early stages of a
   crowdfunding campaign mainly comprise relatively large amounts,
   consumers tend to infer that those large contributions were made by the
   entrepreneur's friends or relatives. Because of this relationship
   inference, prospective funders perceive larger contributions as being
   less diagnostic of others' true opinions of the project and this
   perception negatively affects their willingness to contribute. However,
   if a crowdfunding campaign provides sufficient justification for the
   early-stage large contributions, this Small Predicts Large effect will
   be eliminated.

AB Companies can create value by differentiating their products and
   services along quantitative attributes. Existing research suggests that
   consumers' tendency to rely on relatively effortless and affect-based
   processes reduces their sensitivity to the scope of quantitative
   attributes and that this explains why increments along quantitative
   attributes often have diminishing marginal value. The current article
   sheds new light on how "system 1" processes moderate the effect of
   quantitative product attributes on subjective value. Seven studies
   provide evidence that system 1 processes can produce diminishing
   marginal value, but also increasing marginal value, or any combination
   of the two, depending on the composition of the choice set. This is
   because system 1 processes facilitate ordinal comparisons (e.g., 256 GB
   is more than 128 GB, which is more than 64 GB) while system 2 processes,
   which are relatively more effortful and calculation based, facilitate
   cardinal comparisons (e.g., the difference between 256 and 128 GB is
   twice as large as between 128 and 64 GB).

AB Previous research has highlighted the effects of receiving interpersonal
   touch on persuasion. In contrast, we examine initiating touch.
   Individuals instructed to touch engage in egocentric projection in which
   they project their own affective reaction onto their expectations for
   how the recipient will feel (i.e., empathic forecast), how they appear
   to the recipient (i.e., metaperception), and the evaluation of the
   interaction itself (i.e., interaction awkwardness). Touch initiators
   expect that recipients will feel worse with touch, express concern for
   how they, themselves, will be perceived, and think that interactions are
   more awkward. Interestingly, touch recipients do not evaluate these
   interactions more negatively and leave higher tips after having been
   touched; touch initiators do not expect this to be the case. As a
   result, instructed touch initiators (vs. volitional touch initiators)
   are less (more) likely to engage in subsequent interactions with
   customers, potentially undermining future service provided to customers.
   Across five studies, four of which involve actual dyadic interactions,
   we test the consequences of initiating touch with an inquiry into the
   effects of interpersonal touch on the initiator. We discuss theoretical
   and managerial implications.

AB Consumers monitor their goal progress to know how much effort they need
   to invest to achieve their goals. However, the factors influencing
   consumers' goal progress monitoring are largely unexamined. Seven
   studies (N = 8,409) identified categorization as a novel factor that
   influences goal progress perceptions, with consequences for motivation.
   When pursuing a goal, categorization cues lead consumers to perceive
   that their goal-relevant actions are in separate categories; as a
   result, consumers anchor their estimates of goal progress on the
   proportion of categories completed and are less affected by the absolute
   amount of progress made than when categorization cues are not present.
   As a result, depending on the proportion of categories completed,
   categorization can lead consumers to infer greater progress when they
   are actually farther from their goal, and to infer less progress when
   they are closer to their goal. We demonstrate consequences of this
   effect for consumers' motivation and goal attainment in incentive
   compatible contexts.
