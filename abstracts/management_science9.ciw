AB The mobility of individual managers has long presented a problem for
   firms in knowledge-intensive industries. Shifting to more complex work
   often reduces the importance of a single individual's knowledge for the
   firm's exchange relationships because complex work requires inputs from
   a broader set of the firm's members. Although complex work decreases the
   likelihood that a single individual can shift the exchange relationship
   to another firm, we propose that it increases the vulnerability of the
   firm's performance to departures of those individual managers who act as
   coordinators of knowledge. This leads us to focus on how the internal
   knowledge network formed to maintain each relationship can compound or
   mitigate the loss of a coordinating manager. Using original data on
   client relationships from a law firm, we examine the effect of internal
   knowledge networks and lead partner departures on the performance of the
   relationships. Supporting our argument, we find that the negative
   performance effect of a lead partner departure is greater when the
   network has high knowledge heterogeneity and involves more experts and
   lower when the network has high cohesion.

AB This paper studies the role of family background in explaining
   differences in the willingness to compete in a cognitive task. By
   combining data from a lab experiment conducted with a fairly
   representative sample of adolescents in Norway and high-quality register
   data on family background, we show that family background is fundamental
   in two important ways. First, boys from low socioeconomic status
   families are less willing to compete than boys from better-off families,
   even when controlling for confidence, performance, risk preferences,
   time preferences, social preferences, and psychological traits. Second,
   family background is crucial for understanding the large gender
   difference in the willingness to compete. Girls are much less willing to
   compete than boys among children from better-off families, whereas we do
   not find any gender difference in willingness to compete among children
   from low socioeconomic status families. Our data suggest that the main
   explanation of the role of family background is that the father's
   socioeconomic status is strongly associated with boys' willingness to
   compete. We do not find any association between the willingness to
   compete for boys or girls and the mother's socioeconomic status or other
   family characteristic that may potentially shape competition
   preferences, including parental equality and sibling rivalry.

AB Most daily decisions involve uncertainty about outcome probabilities
   arising from incomplete knowledge, i.e., ambiguity. We explore how the
   addition of partial information affects these types of choices using
   theoretical and empirical methods. Our experiments in both gain and loss
   domains demonstrate that when such information supports a favorable
   outcome, it strongly increases valuation of an ambiguous financial
   prospect. However, when information supports an unfavorable outcome, it
   has significantly less impact. We find that two mechanisms drive this
   asymmetry. First, unfavorable information decreases estimates of a good
   outcome occurring but also reduces aversive uncertainty. These factors
   act in opposition, minimizing the effects of unfavorable information.
   Second, when information can be subjectively interpreted, unfavorable
   information is less likely to be integrated into evaluations. Our
   findings reveal mechanisms not captured by traditional models of
   decision making under uncertainty and highlight the importance of
   increasing the salience of unfavorable information in uncertain contexts
   to promote unbiased decision making.

   problem in which the probability of winning a prize is unknown
   (uncertain). In this paper, we study how individuals make choices
   between gambles in which the uncertainty is in different dimensions: the
   winning probability, the amount of the prize, the payment date, and the
   combinations thereof. Although the decision-theoretic models accommodate
   a rich variety of behaviors, we present experimental evidence that
   points at systematic behavioral patterns: (i) no uncertainty is
   preferred to uncertainty on any single dimension and to uncertainty on
   multiple dimensions, and (ii) "correlated" uncertainty on multiple
   dimensions is preferred to uncertainty on any single dimension.

AB Applying tests for jumps to financial data sets can lead to an important
   number of spurious detections. Bursts of volatility are often
   incorrectly identified as jumps when the sampling is too sparse. At a
   higher frequency, methods robust to microstructure noise are required.
   We argue that whatever the jump detection test and the sampling
   frequency, a large number of spurious detections remain because of
   multiple testing issues. We propose a formal treatment based on an
   explicit thresholding on available test statistics. We prove that our
   method eliminates asymptotically all remaining spurious detections. In
   Dow Jones stocks between 2006 and 2008, spurious detections can
   represent up to 90% of the jumps detected initially. For the stocks
   considered, jumps are rare events, they do not cluster in time, and no
   cojump affects all stocks simultaneously, suggesting jump risk is
   diversifiable. We relate the remaining jumps to macroeconomic news,
   prescheduled company-specific announcements, and stories from news
   agencies that include a variety of unscheduled and uncategorized events.
   The vast majority of news does not cause jumps but may generate a market
   reaction in the form of bursts of volatility.

AB We investigate the incentives for social communication in the new social
   media technologies. Three features of online social communication are
   represented in the model. First, new social media platforms allow for
   increased connectivity; i.e., they enable sending messages to many more
   receivers, for the same fixed cost, compared to traditional word of
   mouth. Second, users contribute content because they derive status-or
   image-based utility from being listened to by their peers. Third, we
   capture the role of social differentiation, or how social distance
   between people affects their preferences for messages. In the model,
   agents endogenously decide whether to be a sender of information and
   then compete for the attention of receivers. An important point of this
   paper is that social communication incentives diminish even as the reach
   or the span of communication increases. As the span of communication
   increases, competition between senders for receiver attention becomes
   more intense, resulting in senders competing with greater equilibrium
   messaging effort. This in turn leads to lower equilibrium payoffs and
   the entry of fewer senders. This result provides a strategic rationale
   for the so-called participation inequality phenomenon, which is a
   characteristic of many social media platforms. We also show that social
   differentiation may enhance or deter sender entry depending on whether
   it can be endogenously influenced by senders. Finally, we examine how
   the underlying network structure (in terms of its density and its degree
   distribution) affects communication and uncover a nonmonotonic pattern
   in that increased connectivity first increases and then reduces the
   entry of senders.

AB The practice of detailing in the marketing of prescription drugs is
   undergoing significant changes. For instance, in September 2013, the
   Physician Payment Sunshine Act went into full effect. The accompanying
   transparency requirements have prompted physician practices and
   hospitals to severely restrict pharmaceutical sales representatives'
   direct access to their physicians. Despite all the attention in the
   popular press, scant scholarly research has investigated how these
   restrictions on physician access impact physician prescription behavior
   and competitive detailing to physicians. To analyze the impact of these
   restrictions, we develop a structural model of how pharmaceutical firms
   compete dynamically to schedule detailing to physicians. Detailing
   activities are known to have significant carryover effects that are
   captured in a first-stage model of physicians' demand for prescription
   drugs. We also specify detailing policy functions that describe each
   firm's observed detailing actions. In a second stage, we estimate a
   model that describes costs of detailing, assuming that the observed
   detailing levels are consistent with a Markov perfect Nash equilibrium.
   The estimated structural model is used to examine the implications of
   restrictions on the amount of detailing via counterfactual simulations.
   We find that restriction policies would increase the market share of a
   nondrug-treatment-only option but impact firms asymmetrically; firms
   that are strong in detailing and/or rely more on detailing would be hurt
   more. Unexpectedly, a policy that imposes a ceiling on detailing
   frequency could significantly reduce detailing of all firms in the
   market, including those firms with average detailing levels below the
   ceiling, and effectively would soften competition between firms and
   enhance their profits.

AB We study a joint inventory and pricing problem in a single-stage system
   with a positive lead time. We consider both additive and multiplicative
   demand forms. This problem is, in general, intractable due to its
   computational complexity. We develop a simple heuristic that resolves
   this issue. The heuristic involves a myopic pricing policy that
   generates each period's price as a function of the initial inventory
   level and a base-stock policy for inventory replenishment. In each
   period, the firm monitors its so-called price-deflated inventory
   position and places an order to reach a target base-stock level. The
   price-deflated inventory position weights the on-hand and pipeline
   inventory according to a factor that reflects the sensitivity of price
   to the net inventory level. To assess the effectiveness of our
   heuristic, we construct an upper bound to the exact system. The upper
   bound is based on an information-relaxation approach and involves a
   penalty function derived from the proposed heuristic. A numerical study
   suggests that the heuristic is near-optimal. The heuristic approach can
   be applied to a wide variety of inventory systems, such as systems with
   fixed ordering costs or fixed batch sizes. The heuristic enables us to
   explore the use of price as a lever to balance supply and demand. Our
   findings indicate that a responsive strategy (that effectively reduces
   the replenishment lead time) leads to a more stable pricing policy and
   that the value of dynamic pricing increases with lead time.

   e/(e - 1). We propose a polynomial- time nonadaptive policy that

   system with multiple customer types that differ in their valuations for
   instant delivery and their delay costs. The distinctive feature of our
   model is that the ranking of customer preferences depends on lead times:
   patient customers are willing to pay more than impatient customers for
   long lead times, and vice versa for speedier service. We provide
   necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of the capacity, the
   market size, and the properties of the valuation-delay cost
   distribution, for three features of the optimal menu and segmentation:
   pricing out the middle of the delay cost spectrum while serving both
   ends, pooling types with different delay costs into a single class, and
   strategic delay to deliberately inflate lead times.

AB We study a standard dynamic pricing problem where the seller (a
   monopolist) possesses a finite amount of inventories and attempts to
   sell the products during a finite selling season. Despite the potential
   benefits of dynamic pricing, many sellers still adopt a static pricing
   policy because of (1) the complexity of frequent reoptimizations, (2)
   the negative perception of excessive price adjustments, and (3) the lack
   of flexibility caused by existing business constraints. In this paper,
   we develop a family of pricing heuristics that can be used to address
   all these challenges. Our heuristic is computationally easy to
   implement; it requires only a single optimization at the beginning of
   the selling season and automatically adjusts the prices over time.
   Moreover, to guarantee a strong revenue performance, the heuristic only
   needs to adjust the prices of a small number of products and do so
   infrequently. This property helps the seller focus his effort on the
   prices of the most important products instead of all products. In
   addition, in the case where not all products are equally admissible to
   price adjustment (due to existing business constraints such as
   contractual agreement, strategic product positioning, etc.), our
   heuristic can immediately substitute the price adjustment of the
   original products with the price adjustment of similar products and
   maintain an equivalent revenue performance. This property provides the
   seller with extra flexibility in managing his prices.

   its key suppliers. We do so by using an extensive, hand-collected data
   set that captures the supply chain relationships of bankrupt firms over
   the time period 1990-2009. Looking at a sample of more than 2,000 loan
   contracts, we compare the average borrowing cost of suppliers in the two
   years prior to the bankruptcy of a key customer to the average cost in
   the two years following the announced bankruptcy. We find the average
   loan spreads increase by roughly 20% following the customer's announced
   bankruptcy. These effects are even stronger if the bankrupt firm is
   operating within a distressed industry or when there is a strong
   supplier-customer relationship. We also find that the structure of
   lending agreements significantly changes in the aftermath of a client
   bankruptcy. More specifically, we find that the number of covenants
   increases and the lead banker(s) take an increasingly important role in
   the period following the client's bankruptcy. Taken together, the

   In a field experiment with 266 employees, we find that paying higher
   wages, per se, does not have a discernible effect on productivity in a
   context with no future employment opportunities. However, structuring a
   portion of the wage as a clear and unexpected gift-by offering an
   unconditional raise after the employee has accepted the contract-leads
   to higher productivity for the duration of the job. Gifts are roughly as
   efficient as hiring more workers.

AB We examine whether a firm's intellectual property (IP) strategy in
   support of the open source software (OSS) community stimulates new OSS
   product entry by start-up software firms. In particular, we analyze the
   impact of strategic decisions taken by IBM around the mid-2000s, such as
   its announcement that it will not assert its patents against the OSS
   community and its creation of a patent commons. These decisions formed a
   coherent IP strategy in support of OSS. We find that IBM's actions
   stimulated new OSS product introductions by entrepreneurial firms and
   that their impact is increasing in the cumulativeness of innovation in
   the market and the extent to which patent ownership in the market is
   concentrated.

AB Firms tracking consumer purchase information often use behavior-based
   pricing (BBP), i.e., price discriminate between consumers based on
   preferences revealed from purchase histories. However, behavioral
   research has shown that such pricing practices can lead to perceptions
   of unfairness when consumers are charged a higher price than other
   consumers for the same product. This paper studies the impact of
   consumers' fairness concerns on firms' behavior-based pricing strategy,
   profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare. Prior research shows that
   BBP often yields lower profits than profits without customer recognition
   or behavior-based price discrimination. By contrast, we find that firms'
   profits from conducting BBP increase with consumers' fairness concerns.
   When fairness concerns are sufficiently strong, practicing BBP is more
   profitable than without customer recognition. However, consumers'
   fairness concerns decrease consumer surplus. In addition, when
   consumers' fairness concerns are sufficiently strong, they reduce
   inefficient switching and improve social welfare.

AB Firms require demand forecasts at different levels of aggregation to
   support a variety of resource allocation decisions. For example, a
   retailer needs store-level forecasts to manage inventory at the store,
   but also requires a regionally aggregated forecast for managing
   inventory at a distribution center. In generating an aggregate forecast,
   a firm can choose to make the forecast directly based on the aggregated
   data or indirectly by summing lower-level forecasts (i.e., bottom up).
   Our study investigates the relative performance of such hierarchical
   forecasting processes through a behavioral lens. We identify two
   judgment biases that affect the relative performance of direct and
   indirect forecasting approaches: a propensity for random judgment errors
   and a failure to benefit from the informational value that is embedded
   in the correlation structure between lower-level demands. Based on these
   biases, we characterize demand environments where one hierarchical
   process results in more accurate forecasts than the other.

   informed trading by calculating its association with measures of the
   adverse-selection component of the cost of trading. We then provide new
   evidence that PIN_G and PIN_B capture informed trading around earnings
   announcements by showing that they predict positive and negative
   earnings surprises, respectively. Conjecturing that investors who take
   long positions will be more concerned about informed selling than about
   informed buying since the former depresses the sale price whereas the
   latter raises it, we then investigate asymmetry in the pricing of
   private information. We find strong evidence of such asymmetry in that
   the effect of PIN_B on the cost of equity capital is large and highly
   significant, whereas the effect of PIN_G is small and statistically
   insignificant.

AB News aggregators have emerged as an important component of digital
   content ecosystems, attracting traffic by hosting curated collections of
   links to third-party content, but also inciting conflict with content
   producers. Aggregators provide titles and short summaries (snippets) of
   articles they link to. Content producers claim that their presence
   deprives them of traffic that would otherwise flow to their sites. In
   light of this controversy, we conduct a series of field experiments
   whose objective is to provide insight with respect to how readers
   allocate their attention between a news aggregator and the original
   articles it links to. Our experiments are based on manipulating elements
   of the user interface of a Swiss mobile news aggregator. We examine how
   key design parameters, such as the length of the text snippet that an
   aggregator displays about articles, the presence of associated images,
   and the number of related articles on the same story, affect a reader's
   propensity to visit the content producer's site and read the full
   article. Our findings suggest the presence of a substitution
   relationship between the amount of information that aggregators offer
   about articles and the probability that readers will opt to read the
   full articles at the content producer sites. Interestingly, however,
   when several related article outlines compete for user attention, a
   longer snippet and the inclusion of an image increase the probability
   that an article will be chosen over its competitors.

AB Peer ratings have become increasingly important sources of product
   information, particularly in markets for information goods. However, in
   spite of the increasing prevalence of this information, there are
   relatively few academic studies that analyze the impact of peer ratings
   on consumers transacting in "real-world" marketplaces. In this paper, we
   partner with a major telecommunications company to analyze the impact of
   peer ratings in a real-world video-on-demand market where consumer
   participation is organic and where movies are costly and well known to
   consumers. After experimentally changing the initial conditions of
   product information displayed to consumers, we find that, consistent
   with the prior literature, peer ratings influence consumer behavior
   independently from underlying product quality. However, we also find
   that, in contrast to the prior literature, there is little evidence of
   long-term bias as a result of herding effects, at least in our setting.
   Specifically, when movies are artificially promoted or demoted in peer
   rating lists, subsequent reviews cause them to return to their true
   quality position relatively quickly. One explanation for this difference
   is that consumers in our empirical setting likely had more outside
   information about the true quality of the products they were evaluating
   than did consumers in the studies reported in prior literature. Although
   tentative, this explanation suggests that in real-world marketplaces
   where consumers have sufficient access to outside information about true
   product quality, peer ratings may be more robust to herding effects and
   thus provide more reliable signals of true product quality than
   previously thought.

AB We examine the governance role of debt in the context of U.S.-based dual
   class ownership structures. We hypothesize that the use of debt
   alleviates the conflict between shareholder classes by balancing the
   power of controlling insiders. We document that dual class firms have
   higher leverage and a greater propensity to issue private debt; they
   also more frequently use cash sweeps and performance-based covenants.
   Dual class firms with greater agency conflicts and a greater need to
   access the capital market appear to rely more extensively on debt. These
   findings are consistent with controlling insiders bonding against the
   agency costs associated with dual class ownership. The governance role
   of debt is further corroborated by the valuation effect of debt for dual
   class companies. Private debt issuances trigger greater positive market
   reactions to the inferior dual class stock in relation to both the
   superior dual class stock and a matched sample of single class firms.
   Further, leverage attenuates the previously documented adverse effect of
   dual class status on Tobin's q. Taken together, our analyses suggest
   that dual class firms use debt as a complementary governance mechanism.

   are pervasive in the workplace. We test experimentally whether they have
   a negative impact on people's willingness to cooperate. Participants
   first perform in a simple task and then participate in a public goods
   game. The payment scheme for the task varies across treatment groups.
   Compared with a piece-rate scheme, individuals in a winner-takes-all
   competition are significantly less cooperative in the public goods game.
   A lottery treatment, where the winner is decided by luck, has the same
   effect. In a competition treatment with feedback, winners cooperate as
   little as participants in the other treatments, whereas losers cooperate
   even less. All three treatments lead to substantial losses in the
   realised social surplus from the public good while having no significant
   impact on performance. In a complementary experiment, we aim to shed
   light on the psychological mechanisms behind our results.

AB We investigate how adoption of a retailer's factory outlet channel
   impacts customers' spending in the retailer's traditional retail store
   channel. In recent years, many retailers have added exclusively sourced
   factory outlet stores into their channel mix to achieve market expansion
   and customer segmentation. However, the impact of adoption of this
   lower-quality, lower-price alternative channel on spending at the
   retailer's higher-quality, higher-price retail store channel is not
   clear. Customers adopting the outlet channel might increase their
   spending in the retail store channel because of the opportunity to
   become familiar with the brand at a lower price point or transfer of
   positive associations formed through patronage of the outlet channel to
   the store channel. Customers adopting the lower-quality channel might
   also decrease their spending in the retail store channel because of
   brand dilution or cannibalization. To investigate this issue, we use a
   unique individual-level panel data set from a specialty apparel retailer
   from a period during which the retailer opened many factory outlet
   stores. This allows us to study how purchase behavior changes after
   customers adopt the outlet channel while carefully controlling for
   alternative explanations including customer heterogeneity and selection
   effects. We find that although customers who adopt the outlet channel
   spend less with the retailer compared to store-only customers, the
   difference cannot be attributed to the impact of adoption of the outlet
   channel. After controlling for heterogeneity and selection effects, we
   uncover a positive spillover to the retail store channel from adoption
   of the outlet channel. Customers who adopt the outlet channel not only
   make incremental purchases at the outlet channel, but also increase
   their spending in the retail store channel after adoption. The increase
   in spending is due to more frequent retail store purchases and not to
   larger per-purchase expenditure.

AB We analyze the sourcing decision of a buyer choosing between two
   supplier types: responsible suppliers are costly but adhere to strict
   social and environmental responsibility standards, whereas risky
   suppliers are less expensive but may experience responsibility
   violations. A segment of the consumer population, called socially
   conscious, is willing to pay a higher price for a product sourced from a
   responsible supplier and may not purchase in the event of a
   responsibility violation from a risky supplier. We identify four
   possible sourcing strategies that a buyer might employ: low cost
   sourcing (sourcing from the risky supplier), dual sourcing, responsible
   niche sourcing (sourcing from a responsible supplier and selling only to
   socially conscious consumers), and responsible mass market sourcing
   (sourcing responsibly and selling to all consumers). We determine when
   each strategy is optimal and show that efforts to improve supply chain
   responsibility that focus on consumers (by increasing their willingness
   to pay for responsibility or increasing the number of consumers that are
   socially conscious) or increasing supply chain transparency may lead to
   unintended consequences, such as an increase in risky sourcing. Efforts
   that focus on enforcement and penalizing the buyer, however, never
   backfire and always lead to more responsible sourcing and less risky
   sourcing.

   given. To estimate relationships, we designed and executed a grant
   proposal process at a leading research university in which we randomized

   evaluator-proposal pairs. We find that evaluators systematically give
   lower scores to research proposals that are closer to their own areas of
   expertise and to those that are highly novel. The patterns are
   consistent with biases associated with boundedly rational evaluation of
   new ideas. The patterns are inconsistent with intellectual distance
   simply contributing "noise" or being associated with private interests

AB We present a new mechanism by which prior employment can influence
   transitions to other firms. We propose that some employees divert effort
   toward unproductive activities to learn about their own fitness for
   alternative employment. Based on the results of this costly learning
   experience, or "experiment," some employees will transition into other
   firms or launch their own ventures, whereas others will remain at the
   incumbent firm. We develop a theoretical model to explicate these
   propositions and test them using four data sets from the mutual fund and
   hedge fund industries. We find evidence that managers who engage in
   excessive risk taking at mutual funds are subsequently more likely to
   join or start hedge funds, although there is little evidence that this
   risk taking is intended to signal quality to outside observers. Taken
   together, our findings suggest that learning about one's own fitness for
   alternative employment, through experimentation on the job, is an
   important mechanism for enabling employee mobility.

   increases their ability to attract new customers and strengthens their
   relationships with existing customers, resulting in improvement in
   operating performance. The positive effect on operating performance is

AB We investigate why extreme positive earnings surprises occur and the
   consequences of these events. We posit that managers know before
   analysts when extremely good earnings news is developing, but can have
   incentives to allow the earnings news to surprise the market at the
   earnings announcement. In particular, managers can use an extreme
   positive earnings surprise to attract investor attention when they
   believe their stock is neglected and future performance is expected to
   be strong. Analysts, who must allocate scarce resources across many
   firms, can also be inattentive and miss signals that suggest good
   performance is going to be announced. Using various proxies for extreme
   positive earnings surprises, management expectations for future
   performance and desire for attention, and analyst neglect, we find
   evidence that an extreme positive earnings surprise is a predictable
   event. These findings are incremental to controlling for a firm's
   information environment, earnings volatility, and operating leverage.
   Finally, we show that extreme positive earnings surprises are a
   successful method for attracting attention, with significant increases
   in the number of institutional owners, the number of analysts, and
   trading volume during the subsequent three years.

AB We present experiments studying how high-ability individuals use help to
   foster efficient coordination. After an initial phase that traps groups
   in a low-productivity equilibrium, incentives to coordinate are
   increased, making it possible to escape this performance trap. The
   design varies whether high-ability individuals can offer help and, if
   so, whether they must commit to help for an extended period. If help is
   chosen on a round-by-round basis, the probability of escaping the
   performance trap is slightly reduced by allowing for help. The
   likelihood of success significantly improves if high-ability individuals
   must commit to help for an extended time. We develop and estimate a
   structural model of sophisticated learning that provides an explanation
   for why commitment is necessary. The key insight is that potential
   leaders who are overly optimistic about their ability to teach their
   followers are too fast to eliminate help in the absence of commitment.

AB Sellers are often more interested in inducing buyers to make a
   choice-any choice-than in influencing which option they choose. For
   example, many retailers are more concerned about maximizing customer
   purchases within categories than influencing which brand is purchased in
   any particular category. Although this issue is important to researchers
   and practitioners, research on how contextual factors, such as decoys
   and prior decisions, affect whether consumers will "choose to choose" is
   scarce. We propose a reference-dependent model to fill this gap. This
   model unites several streams of research and leads to novel predictions
   that are tested and supported in four experiments. The paper concludes
   with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the
   findings.

AB Studying the operational motivation of a retailer to publicly announce
   his forecast information, this paper shows that by making forecast
   information publicly available to both his manufacturer and to the
   competitor, a retailer is able to credibly share his forecast
   information-an outcome that cannot be achieved by merely exchanging
   information within the supply chain. We model a market comprised of an
   incumbent supply chain facing the possible entry of a competing supply
   chain. In each supply chain, a retailer sources the product from a
   manufacturer, and the manufacturers must secure capacity prior to the
   beginning of the selling season. Due to the superior knowledge of the
   incumbent retailer about the consumer market, he privately observes a
   signal about the consumer's demand, which may be high or low. We first
   confirm that the retailer cannot credibly share this forecast
   information only with his manufacturer within the supply chain, since,
   regardless of the observed signal, the retailer has an incentive to
   inflate to induce the manufacturer to secure a high capacity level.
   However, when the information is also shared with the competitor, the
   incumbent retailer faces the trade-off between the desire to secure an
   ample capacity level and the fear of intense competition. By making
   information publicly available, it is possible to achieve truthful
   information sharing; an incumbent retailer observing a high forecast
   benefits from the increased capacity level to such an extent that he is
   willing to engage in intense competition to prove his accountability for
   the shared information. On the other hand, an incumbent retailer with a
   low forecast is not willing to engage in intense competition in exchange
   for the high level of capacity; thus, he truthfully reveals his low
   forecast to weaken competition. Moreover, we demonstrate that this
   public information sharing can benefit all the firms in the market as
   well as consumers. In addition, we show that compared to the advance
   purchase contract, all the firms except the incumbent manufacturer can
   be better off using public information sharing under a simple wholesale
   price contract.

AB We assemble a unique data set of commercial mortgages with information
   on loan characteristics at origination and subsequent performance. The
   most significant difference between securitized and balance sheet loans
   is the size of the loan. The loans in the highest loan size decile have
   a 43% chance of securitization, whereas the ones in the lowest decile
   have only a 1% chance. This result is consistent with diversification
   being a key motivation for securitization. We also find that loans that
   require substantial monitoring are less likely to be securitized.
   Finally, securitized loans get resolved less quickly after defaulting.

AB This paper studies the propensity of firms to commit to disclose
   information that is subsequently biased, in the presence of other firms
   also issuing potentially biased information. An important aspect of such
   an analysis is the fact that firms can choose whether to disclose or
   withhold information. We show that allowing the number of disclosed
   reports to be endogenous introduces a countervailing force to some of
   the empirical predictions from the prior literature. For example, we
   find that as more firms issue reports or as the correlation across
   firms' cash flows increases, the firm biases its report less. However,
   when we treat firms' disclosure choices as endogenous, we show that the
   number of firms that commit to disclose decreases as the correlation
   across these cash flows increases, and this, in turn, offsets the direct
   effect of the correlation on bias.

AB Theory predicts that entrepreneurs have distinct attitudes toward risk
   and uncertainty, but empirical evidence is mixed. To better understand
   the unique behavioral characteristics of entrepreneurs and the causes of
   these mixed results, we perform a large "lab-in-the-field" experiment
   comparing entrepreneurs to managers (a suitable comparison group) and
   employees (n = 2,288). The results indicate that entrepreneurs perceive
   themselves as less risk averse than managers and employees, in line with
   common wisdom. However, when using experimental incentivized measures,
   the differences are subtler. Entrepreneurs are only found to be unique
   in their lower degree of loss aversion, and not in their risk or
   ambiguity aversion. This combination of results might be explained by
   our finding that perceived risk attitude is not only correlated to risk
   aversion but also to loss aversion. Overall, we therefore suggest using
   a broader definition of risk that captures this unique feature of
   entrepreneurs: their willingness to risk losses.

   This is because the decision to research a question implies a belief
   that research will be fruitful. If priors about the impact of one's work
   are correct on average, then those who choose to research a question are
   optimistic about the quality of their work. The bias varies predictably

AB Choices can be context dependent. This empirical finding is usually
   invoked to suggest that preferences are constructive and susceptible to
   decision environment. Yet preference construction can be systematic and
   endogenous. This paper develops the theory of contextual deliberation as
   a potential explanation for behavioral phenomena of preference
   construction. When preference ordering in a choice set is ex ante
   unknown and state dependent, decision makers can engage in information
   acquisition activities (i.e., deliberation) before choice to improve
   knowledge about the state-dependent preference ordering. Choice context
   can thus influence ex post preference ordering through affecting the
   incentive to deliberate. Consequently, contextual deliberation may lead
   to preference construction and give rise to seemingly irrational
   behavioral phenomena such as the compromise effect and the choice
   overload effect. The theory of contextual deliberation also yields
   predictions that can be empirically tested to identify from other
   alternative explanations.

AB We study the impact of wait time on consumers' purchasing behavior when
   product quality is unknown to some consumers (the "uninformed
   consumers") but known to others (the "informed consumers"). In a
   capacitated environment, wait times act as a signal of quality for
   uninformed consumers because, due to informed consumers in the
   population, low (high) quality products tend to generate shorter
   (longer) wait times. Hence, longer wait times may increase uninformed
   consumers' perceived quality, and they may still purchase the product,
   even when the wait time is long. Similarly, short wait times decrease
   the consumers' perceived quality, and they may walk away despite the
   short wait-the "empty restaurant syndrome." This paper develops and
   tests a theory of observational learning that predicts these effects. We
   find that uninformed consumers' purchasing probability at short waits
   decreases in the presence of informed consumers. Furthermore, we find
   that relatively few informed consumers suffice to create this effect.
   Finally, we show that the purchasing frequency might even increase in
   the wait time.

AB We study experimentally bargaining in a multiple-tier supply chain with
   horizontal competition and sequential bargaining between tiers. Our
   treatments vary the cost differences between firms in tiers 1 and 2. We
   measure how these underlying costs influence the efficiency, negotiated
   prices, and profit distribution across the supply chain, as well as the
   consistency of these outcomes with existing theory. We find that the
   structural issue of cost differentials dominates personal
   characteristics in explaining outcomes, with profits in a tier generally
   increasing with decreased competition in the tier and increasing with
   decreased competition in alternate tiers. The balanced principal model
   of supply chain bargaining does a good job explaining our data, and it
   outperforms the common assumption of leader-follower negotiations. We
   find a significant anchoring effect from a firm's first bid but no
   effect of the sequence of those bids, no evidence of failure to close
   via escalation of commitment, and mixed results for a deadline effect.
   We also find an interesting asymmetry between the buy and sell sides in
   employed bidding strategy. All firms make predominantly concessionary
   offers after the initial anchor; however, sell-side firms that engage in
   aggressive anticoncessionary bidding successfully increase prices while
   not compromising closure rates. Buy-side firms achieve much smaller
   price changes from anticoncessionary tactics and risk reduced closure,
   yielding no net benefit.

AB We consider the multiple-time-period, short-term production scheduling
   problem for a network of multiple open-pit mines and ports. Ore produced
   at each mine, in each period, is transported by rail to a set of ports
   and blended into products for shipping. Each port forms these blends to
   a specification, as stipulated in contracts with downstream customers.
   This problem belongs to a class of multiple producer/consumer scheduling
   problems in which producers are able to generate a range of products, a
   combination of which are required by consumers to meet specified
   demands. In practice, short-term schedules are formed independently at
   each mine, tasked with achieving a grade and quality target outlined in
   a medium-term plan. Because of uncertainty in the data available to a
   medium-term planner and the dynamics of the mining environment, such
   targets may not be feasible in the short term. In this paper, we present
   an algorithm in which the grade and quality targets assigned to each
   mine are iteratively adapted, ensuring the satisfaction of blending
   constraints at each port while generating schedules for each mine that
   maximise resource utilisation.

AB The growing popularity of online dating websites is altering one of the
   most fundamental human activities: finding a date or a marriage partner.
   Online dating platforms offer new capabilities, such as extensive
   search, big data-based mate recommendations, and varying levels of
   anonymity, whose parallels do not exist in the physical world. Yet
   little is known about the causal effects of these new features. In this
   study we examine the impact of a particular anonymity feature, which is
   unique to online environments, on matching outcomes. This feature allows
   users to browse profiles of other users anonymously, by being able to
   check out a potential mate's profile while not leaving any visible
   online record of the visit. Although this feature may decrease search
   costs and allow users to search without inhibition, it also eliminates
   "weak signals" of interest for their potential mates that may play an
   important role in establishing successful communication. We run a
   randomized field experiment on a major North American online dating
   website, where 50,000 of 100,000 randomly selected new users are gifted
   the ability to anonymously view profiles of other users. Compared with
   the control group, the users treated with anonymity become disinhibited,
   in that they view more profiles and are more likely to view same-sex and
   interracial mates. However, based on our analysis, we demonstrate
   causally that weak signaling is a key mechanism in achieving higher
   levels of matching outcomes. Anonymous users, who lose the ability to
   leave a weak signal, end up having fewer matches compared with their
   nonanonymous counterparts. This effect of anonymity is particularly
   strong for women, who tend not to make the first move and instead rely
   on the counterparty to initiate the communication. Further, the
   reduction in quantity of matches by anonymous users is not compensated
   by a corresponding increase in quality of matches.

AB In this paper, we study how restricting the availability of patches to
   legal users impacts the vendor's profits, market share, software
   maintenance decisions, and welfare outcomes. Prior work on this topic
   assumes that the hacker's effort is independent of the vendor's decision
   to release the patch freely or not. Clearly, if the patch is not
   available to everyone, the hacker finds it easier to exploit the
   vulnerability in the product and, as a result, is likely to alter his
   effort. To understand the role of a strategic hacker, we build a
   game-theoretic model, where the hacker's decision is endogenous. With
   this model, we find that the hacker's effort may, on the one hand,
   decrease the utility that the vendor can extract from the consumers but,
   on the other hand, may help differentiate the legal version of the
   product from the pirated version. A vendor can strategically exploit the
   hacker's behavior in its pricing and software maintenance decisions. The
   endogeneity of the hacker's actions drives several of our findings that
   have interesting policy implications. For example, the vendor may
   increase the price and reduce market share to exploit the
   differentiation. In such a case, there may be more pirates in the
   restricted-patch case than when the patch is freely available, a result
   that runs counter to typical arguments provided for restricting patches.

   investigates the role of market information in DRAM manufacturing and
   the consequences of allowing information sharing in the industry. An
   oligopoly model of competition with correlated private information is
   developed in which firms make decisions about production and capacity.
   In this setting, firms consider the information their competitors are
   likely to hold, conditional on their own. We find that both firms and
   customers benefit when firms share information with their competitors.
   In particular, sharing information is profitable because market price
   decreases slowly with overproduction. When combined with the results
   from the information sharing literature, this paper highlights the need
   to assess information sharing policies on a case-by-case basis.

AB We investigate the emergence of socially responsible (SR) production
   through consumer decisions. Our experimental treatments vary market
   competitiveness and consumers' information on social responsibility in
   production. We show that-irrespective of consumers' information-SR
   production reduces monopolistic supplier's profit and is therefore
   unlikely to emerge. With supplier competition, SR production positively
   influences consumers' buying decisions and suppliers offering SR
   products achieve significantly higher profits, as long as their price is
   not too high. Our results yield valuable insights into the possibilities
   and limitations of promoting SR production through consumer behavior,
   and they provide evidence for positive effects of competition on moral
   behavior.

AB This study finds that large marketwide declines in stock prices are
   associated with higher litigation incidence and settlements even though
   marketwide events are legally irrelevant. The probability of litigation
   nearly doubles (from 0.29% to 0.55%) and the amount of settlements also
   doubles (from $5.0 million to $10.1 million) when earnings disclosures
   occur during a large market decline, even after controlling for the
   firm's market-adjusted return. Furthermore, judges with (without)
   specialized experience in securities litigation are more (less) likely
   to dismiss cases triggered by disclosures during large market declines.
   This pattern is consistent with experienced judges recognizing and
   dismissing weaker cases. Finally, managers are less likely to disclose
   adverse news at the end of trading days with large market declines.
   Although we cannot definitively identify the motive behind this pattern,
   it is consistent with managers recognizing increased litigation risk
   during large market declines.

AB Consider a firm that would like to commit to a focused business strategy
   because focus improves efficiency and thus increases profit. We identify
   two general conditions under which tougher competition strengthens the
   firm's ability to commit to a focused strategy. Under these conditions,
   competition fosters commitment for two reasons: (i) competition reduces
   the value of the option to diversify (the contestability effect), and
   (ii) competition increases the importance of being efficient (the
   efficiency effect). We use a number of different models of imperfect
   competition to illustrate the applicability of our results. Our examples
   suggest that the contestability effect is very general. In contrast, the
   efficiency effect often requires further conditions, which are specific
   to the nature of competition in each model. In both cases, our analysis
   helps us predict when these effects are more likely to be observed.

AB We use contract negotiation data to study how leverage affects the
   interaction between firms and an important nonfinancial stakeholder,
   labor unions. Consistent with the idea that leverage diminishes the
   bargaining position of labor, we find that unions are less likely to
   strike when a firm has high leverage or increases leverage prior to a
   contract negotiation. We also find large leverage increases after a
   strike, consistent with the idea that firms intentionally use leverage
   to improve their bargaining position. This poststrike increase in
   leverage is particularly pronounced when the union wins the strike.
   Moreover, we do not find any clear indication that such increases in
   leverage are linked to changes in investments. In addition, firms that
   experience a strike subsequently invest more internationally and in
   right-to-work states where union are afforded fewer legal protections,
   and they increase their disposal of production units that are located in
   states where strikes have occurred.

   market; it effectively raised the transaction cost in a segment favored
   by short-term speculators. Relative to the unaffected control sample, we
   find that the rise in transaction cost, equivalent to a two- to
   three-percentage-point increase in transaction tax, reduced speculative
   trading in the treatment segment by 75% and raised its price volatility
   by 18%. It also significantly reduced price informativeness. We further
   show that the results are likely due to a relatively greater withdrawal
   by informed speculators than by destabilizing speculators following the

   decline after the event for the affected options, that the make-take
   structure encourages market makers to improve quoted prices, and that
   brokers change their routing behavior to include fees in the routing

AB Deadlines are common in product development and are often felt to be too
   harsh-many development efforts are still worth continuing at the time of
   mandated termination. We examine the value of deadlines from the
   agency-theoretic perspective. We consider a firm that pays an agent to
   lead product development activities. The chance of success depends on
   the viability of the project and the effort of the agent. As the project
   proceeds without success, doubts grow as to whether the project is
   viable. To motivate continued effort, the firm must promise the agent a
   generous reward if success is achieved during the late stage of
   development. However, rewarding late success undermines effort
   incentives in the early stage. The firm may find it more profitable to
   impose a hard, early deadline to eliminate the agent's dynamic incentive
   to procrastinate. We derive conditions under which the firm should
   impose such deadlines.

AB We investigate the optimal market entry and original equipment
   manufacturer (OEM) decisions of a firm facing a market in which firms'
   brands can be horizontally differentiated and products can be vertically
   differentiated. The entrant might sell under its own brand and compete
   with an incumbent, become a supplier to the incumbent, or both. Findings
   reveal that when consumers perceive the firms are horizontally and
   vertically differentiated, the entrant profits by simultaneously
   entering the market and establishing an OEM arrangement with the
   incumbent. In such competitive scenarios, both buyer and seller increase
   profits by agreeing on wholesale prices that are not too low, which
   softens both horizontal and vertical conflict between the firms.
   Findings also show that the incumbent may prefer to pay high wholesale
   prices to the entrant even if the incumbent had the option to source the
   product independently at a lower marginal cost. When firms have the
   capability of producing each other's product lines, supply relationships
   between them can still happen in equilibrium. In this case, an
   interesting result is that firms may optimally select to differentiate
   production and, because of the OEM relationship, sell the same product
   qualities to consumers. The reason for this outcome is that the OEM
   arrangement with differentiated production causes a strategic effect
   that reduces the firms' aggressiveness when competing for consumers.
   Under certain conditions, the OEM arrangement can completely nullify the
   horizontal and vertical conflict between the firms.

AB The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), a part of the U.S.
   Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires the Centers for
   Medicare and Medicaid Services to penalize hospitals with excess
   readmissions. We take an economic and operational (patient flow)
   perspective to analyze the effectiveness of this policy in encouraging
   hospitals to reduce readmissions. We develop a game-theoretic model that
   captures the competition among hospitals inherent in HRRP's benchmarking
   mechanism. We show that this competition can be counterproductive: it
   increases the number of nonincentivized hospitals, which prefer paying
   penalties over reducing readmissions in any equilibrium. We calibrate
   our model with a data set of more than 3,000 hospitals in the United
   States and show that under the current policy, and for a large set of
   parameters, 4%-13% of the hospitals remain nonincentivized to reduce
   readmissions. We also validate our model against the actual performance
   of hospitals in the three years since the introduction of the policy. We
   draw several policy recommendations to improve this policy's outcome.
   For example, localizing the benchmarking process-comparing hospitals
   against similar peers-improves the performance of the policy.

AB Airlines use robust scheduling to mitigate the impact of unforeseeable
   disruptions on profits. We examine how effectively three common
   practices-flexibility to swap aircraft, flexibility to reassign gates,
   and scheduled aircraft downtime-accomplish this goal. We first estimate
   a multiple-input, multiple-outcome production frontier, which defines
   the attainable set of outcomes from given inputs. We then recover
   unobserved input costs and calculate how expenditure on inputs affects
   outcomes and revenues. We find that the per-dollar return from
   expenditure on gates, or more effective management of existing gate
   capacity, is three times larger than the per-dollar returns from other
   inputs. Next, we use the estimated trade-offs faced by carriers along
   the frontier to measure the value to carriers of reducing delays.
   Finally, we calculate the improvement in carriers' outcomes and profits
   if their operational inefficiencies are eliminated. On average, we
   estimate that operational inefficiencies cost carriers about $1.7
   billion in revenue annually.

AB Consumer reviews are now part of everyday decision making. Yet the
   credibility of these reviews is fundamentally undermined when businesses
   commit review fraud, creating fake reviews for themselves or their
   competitors. We investigate the economic incentives to commit review
   fraud on the popular review platform Yelp, using two complementary
   approaches and data sets. We begin by analyzing restaurant reviews that
   are identified by Yelp's filtering algorithm as suspicious, or fake-and
   treat these as a proxy for review fraud (an assumption we provide
   evidence for). We present four main findings. First, roughly 16% of
   restaurant reviews on Yelp are filtered. These reviews tend to be more
   extreme (favorable or unfavorable) than other reviews, and the
   prevalence of suspicious reviews has grown significantly over time.
   Second, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when its
   reputation is weak, i.e., when it has few reviews or it has recently
   received bad reviews. Third, chain restaurants-which benefit less from
   Yelp-are also less likely to commit review fraud. Fourth, when
   restaurants face increased competition, they become more likely to
   receive unfavorable fake reviews. Using a separate data set, we analyze
   businesses that were caught soliciting fake reviews through a sting
   conducted by Yelp. These data support our main results and shed further
   light on the economic incentives behind a business's decision to leave
   fake reviews.

   spread/maturity relation of credit default swap (CDS) instruments in
   very specific ways. Consistent with their model, we find that CDS
   spreads are lower across maturities following the adoption of IFRS, and
   the slope and concavity of the CDS spread/maturity relation are higher.
   These changes did not occur to the spread/maturity relation of a control
   sample of CDS instruments. Predicted changes apply more intensely to
   firms with low pre-IFRS transparency. Overall, this study provides
   strong evidence that IFRS adoption increased accounting transparency.

   changes once the firm obtains a loan from another bank ("outside loan")

   that an outside loan triggers a decrease in the initial bank's
   willingness to lend to the firm, i.e., outside loans are strategic
   substitutes. Consistent with concerns about coordination problems and
   higher indebtedness, we find that this reaction is more pronounced the
   larger the outside loan and it is muted if the initial bank's existing
   and future loans retain seniority and are protected with valuable
   collateral. Our results give a benevolent role to transparency enabling
   banks to mitigate adverse effects from outside loans. The resulting

AB Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a significant public health issue, and
   treatment, namely, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, is
   very time sensitive. Public access defibrillation programs, which deploy
   automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for bystander use in an
   emergency, reduce the time to defibrillation and improve survival rates.
   In this paper, we develop models to guide the deployment of public AEDs.
   Our models generalize existing location models and incorporate
   differences in bystander behavior. We formulate three mixed integer
   nonlinear models and derive equivalent integer linear reformulations or
   easily computable bounds. We use kernel density estimation to derive a
   spatial probability distribution of cardiac arrests that is used for
   optimization and model evaluation. Using data from Toronto, Canada, we
   show that optimizing AED deployment outperforms the existing approach by
   40% in coverage, and substantial gains can be achieved through
   relocating existing AEDs. Our results suggest that improvements in
   survival and cost-effectiveness are possible with optimization.

   considered by a search firm, we examine the sources of the low
   proportion of women placed in senior roles. Contrary to received wisdom,
   we find limited evidence that demand-side screeners strongly contribute
   to gender disadvantage in this setting. What gender differences exist
   tend to play out at the start of the hiring process and are driven both
   by supply-side and demand-side actors. Once considered for a position,
   women are no less likely than men to be hired-though they are slightly

AB How do people react to setbacks and successes? I use a laboratory
   experiment to determine the effect of winning and losing in a
   competition on the willingness to seek further challenges. Participants
   compete in two-person tournaments in an arithmetic task and are then
   informed of their score and the outcome of the competition. Participants
   then have to decide on a performance target for a second round: the
   higher the target, the higher the potential reward, but participants who
   do not reach the target earn nothing. Conditional on the score, winning
   or losing is exogenous. I find that, conditional on first-round scores,
   losers go for a more challenging target. Losers also perform worse,
   leading to lower earnings and a higher probability of failure. These
   results are driven by gender-specific reactions to winning and losing:
   men react to losing by picking a more challenging target while women
   lower their performance. These findings could have important
   implications for our understanding of individual career paths. Early
   outcomes could alter the probability of success and failure in the long
   term.

AB Providing broadband to schools can be an effective way to foster
   household Internet adoption in neighboring areas. On the one hand, the
   infrastructure put into place to meet schools' needs can also serve
   households. On the other hand, students get acquainted with the Internet
   at school and signal its usefulness to adults at home who, consequently,
   can be more likely to adopt it. In this paper, we model the roles that
   broadband use at school and Internet adoption in neighboring households
   play in the decision to adopt the Internet at home and measure their
   effects empirically. We use data from Portugal between 2006 and 2009 on
   household Internet penetration and on how much schools use broadband. We
   use two different sets of instruments for the schools' broadband use to
   alleviate endogeneity concerns. Both approaches yield similar results.
   We find that broadband use at school leads to higher levels of Internet
   penetration in neighboring households. Broadband use in schools was
   responsible for a year-over-year increase of 3.5 percentage points on
   Internet penetration in households with children. Across our data set
   this effect accounts for about 17% of the increase in home Internet
   adoption. We also find evidence of regional spillovers in Internet
   adoption across households. These were roughly responsible for an
   increase of 2.1 percentage points in Internet penetration or 38% of the
   total increase in household Internet penetration between 2006 and 2009.
   These results show that wiring schools with broadband is an effective
   policy to lower the barriers for Internet adoption at home and as such
   contributes to accelerating the pace of broadband diffusion.

AB Refinancing a mortgage is often one of the most important financial
   decisions people make. Borrowers choose the interest rate differential
   at which to refinance, and when that differential is reached, they need
   to take the steps to refinance before rates change again. Using a simple
   closed-form solution approximation of the optimal refinancing rule and a
   unique panel data set including information from a large secondary
   market participant on refinancing, we find that approximately 57% of
   borrowers refinance suboptimally-50% choose the wrong rate, 17% wait too
   long to refinance, and 10% do both. Financially sophisticated borrowers
   make smaller mistakes, refinancing at rates closer to optimal and
   waiting less after mortgage rates reach their trigger rates. Evidence
   suggests borrowers learn from their refinancing experiences.

AB Consumer credit regulations usually require that lenders disclose
   interest rates. However, in the absence of specific prominence
   requirements, lenders can conceal the interest rate in the fine print
   while still complying with the law. I examine the effect of such a
   strategy using a field experiment in Brazil in which a credit card
   company offered their clients payment plans to pay off their balances.
   Using randomized contract interest rates and the degree of rate
   disclosure, I show that most clients are rate sensitive, whether or not
   rates are prominently disclosed. The elasticity of payment plan
   enrollment with respect to the interest rate ranges from -0.711 to
   -0.880. High-risk clients are an exception; these clients are rate
   sensitive only when disclosure is prominent. I also show that clients
   are influenced by nudges that favor longer-term contracts. Conditional
   on enrollment, the proportion of clients who choose a longer-term
   contract is 40 percentage points higher when a longer-term contract is
   featured in the advertisement layout. This effect, however, is weaker
   when stakes are higher.

AB Daily deal websites help small local merchants to attract new consumers.
   A strategy adopted by some websites is to continually track and display
   the number of deals sold by a merchant. We investigate the strategic
   implications of displaying deal sales and the website's incentive to
   implement this feature. We analyze a market in which a merchant offering
   an experience good is privately informed of its type. Whereas daily
   deals cannibalize a merchant's revenue from experienced consumers, we
   show that, by displaying deal sales, the website can transform this
   cannibalization into an advantage. Displaying deal sales can leverage
   discounted sales to experienced consumers to help a high-quality
   merchant signal its type and acquire new consumers at a higher margin.
   Signaling is supported through observational learning from displayed
   deal sales since it reveals how experienced consumers respond to the
   deal. Nevertheless, the website may not implement this feature if
   signaling entails too much distortion in the merchant's deal price. We
   also find that it can be optimal for the website to offer the merchant
   an up-front subsidy, but only if the website displays deal sales. Our
   analysis leads to managerial insights for daily deal websites.

AB We develop a framework for continuous search for information on a choice
   set of multiple alternatives and apply it to consumer search in a
   product market. When a consumer considers purchasing a product in a
   product category, the consumer can gather information sequentially on
   several products. At each moment, the consumer can choose which product
   to gather more information on and whether to stop gathering information
   and purchase one of the products or to exit the market with no purchase.
   Given costly information gathering, consumers end up not gathering
   complete information on all the products and need to make decisions
   under imperfect information. Under the assumption of constant
   informativeness of search, we solve for the optimal search, switch, and
   purchase or exit behavior in such a setting, which is characterized by
   an optimal consideration set and a purchase threshold structure. This
   paper shows that a product is only considered for search or purchase if
   it has a sufficiently high expected utility. Given multiple products in
   the consumer's consideration set, the consumer only stops searching for
   information and purchases a product if the difference between the
   expected utilities of the top two products is greater than some
   threshold. Comparative statics show that negative information
   correlation among products widens the purchase threshold, and so does an
   increase in the number of the choices. Under our rational consumer
   model, we show that choice overload can occur when consumers search or
   evaluate multiple alternatives before making a purchase decision. We
   also find that it is optimal for a monopolistic seller of multiple
   products to facilitate information search for low-valuation consumers
   and obfuscate information for those with high valuations.

AB In many service settings, customers have to join the queue without being
   fully aware of the parameters of the service provider (e.g., customers
   at checkout counters may not know the true service rate before joining).
   In such "blind queues,"customers make their joining/balking decisions
   based on limited information about the service provider's operational
   parameters (from past service experiences, reviews, etc.) and queue
   lengths. We analyze a firm serving customers making decisions under
   arbitrary beliefs about the service parameters in an observable queue
   for a service with a known price. By proposing an ordering for the
   balking threshold distributions in the customer population, we are able
   to compare the effects of customer beliefs on the queue. We show that,
   although revealing the service information to customers improves
   revenues under certain conditions, it may destroy consumer welfare or
   social welfare. Given a market size, consumer welfare can be
   significantly reduced when a fast server announces its true service
   parameter. When revenue is higher under some beliefs, one would expect
   the congestion to also be higher because more customers join, but we
   show that congestion may not necessarily increase.

   measure becomes a likelihood ratio statistic for testing inequality

   bounded by a chi-squared distribution under general sampling schemes,
   allowing for conservative large-sample testing. We develop a tight

   to traditional sure price promotions of equal expected monetary value.
   We compared these two risky and sure price promotions for planned

   Together, we found that consumers are not only more likely to purchase a
   product promoted with a probabilistic free discount over the same
   product promoted with a sure discount but that they are also likely to
   purchase more of it. This preference seems to be primarily due to a
   diminishing sensitivity to the prices. In addition, we find that the

   likely not implicated.

AB We investigate the equilibrium relationship between product quality and
   word-of-mouth (WOM) communication. Specifically, we ask whether firms
   should optimally produce "better" products when consumers are more
   likely to exchange information. The critical moderating factor in our
   model is the nature of the communication and what its primary impact is.
   We first look at WOM that expands awareness of a product. We show that
   quality may either increase or decrease as WOM expands. The answer
   depends, in part, on the extent to which the expansion of WOM is one of
   scale alone or whether it also fundamentally changes the structure of
   communications. Next, we examine a model in which the primary impact of
   WOM is to help people to evaluate the utility provided by products with
   which they are already familiar. Our model suggests that more WOM in
   this context should always lead to higher-quality products. We
   demonstrate that the underlying driver of this result is that the
   elasticity of demand with respect to quality is increasing in the
   proportion of consumers who are informed about the product's quality.
   Taken together, the two models therefore suggest that the firm's optimal
   product-policy response to the growth in social interactions depends on
   both the content and the structure of the underlying conversations.
   Finally, we compare both WOM models to analogous models of advertising
   and demonstrate that the firm's optimal response to a decrease in
   advertising costs is quite different from that to an increase in WOM.
   The reason for these differences can be traced back to a fundamental
   distinction between advertising and WOM: although the former is
   optimized, the latter is far more random.

AB In this paper, we explore the impact of delay announcements using an
   empirical approach by analyzing the data from a medium-sized call
   center. We first explore the question of whether delay announcements
   impact customers' behavior using a non-parametric approach. The answer
   to this question appears to be ambiguous. We thus turn to investigate
   the fundamental mechanism by which delay announcements impact customer
   behavior, by constructing a dynamic structural model. In contrast to the
   implicit assumption made in the literature that announcements do not
   directly impact customers' waiting costs, our key insights show that
   delay announcements not only impact customers' beliefs about the system
   but also directly impact customers' waiting costs. In particular,
   customers' per-unit waiting cost decreases with the offered waiting
   times associated with the announcements. The results of our
   counterfactual analysis show that it may not be necessary to provide
   announcements with very fine granularity.

AB With a large nationwide retailer, we run a natural field experiment to
   measure the effects of energy use information disclosure, customer
   rebates, and sales agent incentives on demand for energy-efficient
   durable goods. Although a combination of large rebates plus sales
   incentives substantially increases market share, information and sales
   incentives alone each have zero statistical effect and explain at most a
   small fraction of the low baseline market share. Sales agents
   strategically comply only partially with the experiment, targeting
   information to more interested consumers but not discussing energy
   efficiency with the disinterested majority. These results suggest that
   seller-provided information is not a major barrier to energy-efficiency
   investments at current prices in this context.

AB We study the problem faced by a central planner trying to increase the
   consumption of a good, such as new malaria drugs in Africa. The central
   planner allocates subsidies to its producers, subject to a budget
   constraint and endogenous market response. The policy most commonly
   implemented in practical applications of this problem is uniform, in the
   sense that it allocates the same per-unit subsidy to every firm,
   primarily because of its simplicity and perceived fairness.
   Surprisingly, we identify sufficient conditions of the firms' marginal
   costs such that uniform subsidies are optimal, even if the firms'
   efficiency levels are arbitrarily different. Moreover, this insight is
   usually preserved even if the central planner is uncertain about the
   specific market conditions. Further in many cases, uniform subsidies
   simultaneously attain the best social welfare solution. Additionally,
   simulation results in relevant settings where uniform subsidies are not
   optimal suggest that they induce a nearly optimal market consumption. On
   the other hand, if the firms face a fixed cost of entry to the market,
   then the performance of uniform subsidies can be significantly worse,
   suggesting the need for an alternative policy in this setup.

AB We investigate the effects of organizational culture and personal values
   on performance under individual and team contest incentives. We develop
   a model of regard for others and in-group favoritism that predicts
   interaction effects between organizational values and personal values in
   contest games. These predictions are tested in a computerized lab
   experiment with exogenous control of both organizational values and
   incentives. In line with our theoretical model, we find that prosocial
   (proself)-orientated subjects exert more (less) effort in team contests
   in the primed prosocial organizational values condition, relative to the
   neutrally primed baseline condition. Further, when the prosocial
   organizational values are combined with individual contest incentives,
   prosocial subjects no longer outperform their proself counterparts.
   These findings provide, to our knowledge, a first, affirmative, causal
   test of person-organization fit theory. They also suggest the importance

   convert part or all of their annual cash compensation into deferred
   company stock. Using a large sample of S&P 1500 firms that allowed
   directors to defer their cash fees into equity between 1999 and 2009, we
   find significant associations between equity deferral choices and
   specific features of the director compensation plans, proxies for
   directors' outside wealth diversification, and future firm stock market
   performance. Trading performance analyses indicate that outside
   directors earn substantial abnormal returns from their deferrals, with a
   significant proportion of the deferral transactions occurring during
   blackout periods. These results are consistent with companies
   structuring director equity deferral plans to circumvent U.S. Securities

   site, as do the prices charged at those sites. I propose that
   organizational form and prices may be systematically related as a result
   of brand externalities. In particular, I develop logic that the relevant
   form of externality should differ for upper quality tier brands and
   lower tier brands. Using panel data on price and organizational form
   from more than 6,700 branded U.S. hotels affiliated with 40
   "dual-distribution" brands-those brands that simultaneously company
   manage and franchise individual outlets-I find that, consistent with the

   prices within high-quality chains, whereas franchisees price higher in
   the lower tiers.

   of the executive labor market outcome-the assignment of managers to
   firms and the cross-sectional distribution of executive pay-are
   endogenously determined. Results in this paper reveal the importance of
   match specificity in productivity, driven by complementarities between
   firm and manager attributes. Therefore, one reason that larger, more
   diversified, research-intensive firms pay their executives more is
   because they are assortatively matched with managers that are talented,
   have more cross-industry experience, and are prone to innovation. More
   important, they outbid competing firms for these managers because they
   enjoy higher marginal productivity from given managerial skills.
   Announcement abnormal returns and executive tenure duration are both
   higher for matches with higher estimated productivity, suggesting mutual
   benefits for both the firms and the managers from assortative matching.

   ability to manage money effectively. Using a large sample of older
   respondents, we test whether knowledge of basic concepts essential to
   effective financial choice declines after age 60. We find a consistent
   linear decline in financial literacy score after age 60. A nearly
   identical rate of decline among men, stockowners, older, and
   college-educated respondents indicates that cohort effects are not
   driving the results. Confidence in financial decision-making abilities
   does not decline with age. A separate analysis using data that include
   measures of cognitive ability suggests that a natural decline in both

   find that working capital levels decrease in the fourth fiscal quarter
   significantly more than expected, conditional on seasonal changes in
   economic activity. The decrease subsequently reverses in the following
   first fiscal quarter. Evidence indicates that firms manage down year-end
   working capital through transactions that increase year-end operating
   cash flow and that firms spread this activity over allworking capital
   accounts. Finally, the temporary decrease in year-end working capital is
   correlated with compensation benchmarks and analysts' annual cash flow

AB Although offshore outsourcing has become an important strategy to lower

   capabilities by supplying, with aspirations to compete with the buyers
   in the product market. We build an analytical model to study the impact
   of value chain climbing on value distribution in vertical relationships.
   The analysis identifies a set of dominant relationships, characterizes
   how the buyer's optimal choice among these relationships depends on
   firms' relative competitiveness in the product market and the supplier's
   speed of capability development, and shows how the optimal choice
   evolves with the dynamics of the supplier's capability development. The
   results provide new insights into our understanding of value
   distribution in vertical relationships across different contexts and
   over time. By endogenizing the supplier's entry into the product market,
   our study enriches the literatures on vertical relationships, market

   judgments (i. e., closer to 0 or 1) for events they view as entailing
   more epistemic uncertainty and less aleatory uncertainty. We demonstrate
   this pattern in a domain where there is agreement concerning the balance
   of evidence (pairings of teams according to their seed in a basketball
   tournament) but individual differences in the perception of the
   epistemicness/aleatoriness of that domain (Study 1), across a range of
   domains that vary in their perceived epistemicness/aleatoriness (Study
   2), in a single judgment task for which we only vary the degree of
   randomness with which events are selected (Study 3), and when we prime
   participants to see events as more epistemic or aleatory (Study 4).
   Decomposition of accuracy scores suggests that the greater judgment
   extremity of more epistemic events can manifest itself as a trade-off
   between enhanced resolution and diminished calibration. We further
   relate our findings to the hard-easy effect and also show that
   differences between epistemic and aleatory judgment are amplified when

   the participants in the system when their waiting times or delays exceed
   acceptable thresholds and to address fairness in the balancing of
   service levels among participants. To evaluate uncertain delays, we
   propose the Delay Unpleasantness Measure, which takes into account the
   frequency and intensity of delays above a threshold, and introduce the
   concept of lexicographic min-max fairness to design appointment systems
   from the perspective of the worst-off participants. We focus our study
   in the healthcare industry in balancing physicians' overtime and
   patients' waiting times in which patients are distinguished by their
   service time characterizations. The model can be adapted in the robust

   we suggest using the mean absolute deviations as the descriptive
   statistics in the distributional uncertainty set to preserve the

AB This paper studies a merger between price-setting newsvendors in an
   oligopolistic market. It is well known that inventory pooling can
   greatly reduce inventory costs in a centralized distribution system
   because it helps reduce aggregate demand uncertainty. Although such
   statistical economies of scale are important benefits of a retail
   merger, the extant literature models cost savings from a merger only
   through reduction in a postmerger firm's marginal cost. In this paper,
   we develop a model of a retail merger under uncertain demand that
   distinguishes between cost savings from conventional economies of scale
   and those from statistical economies of scale, and we show that these
   two sources of cost savings have substantially different impacts on
   firms' decisions in a postmerger market. Contrary to the existing theory
   of mergers developed under deterministic demand, we find that although
   inventory pooling enables the postmerger firm to achieve cost savings,
   it always induces firms to raise their prices, and we find that marginal
   cost reduction induces firms to lower their prices only when it is
   substantial-consequently, larger cost synergies can benefit even
   nonparticipant firms. Finally, even if a merger induces all firms to
   raise their prices, it can still improve expected consumer welfare by
   increasing firms' service levels under uncertain demand.

   expenditures benefit from credit multiplier effects with regard to
   regular debt, which substitutes for postretirement obligations. As a
   result, firms with defined-benefit plans have 12% more R&D and 5% less
   capital expenditure compared with otherwise similar firms, and they vary
   contributions as a function of cash flow and real investment. The role
   of postretirement plans is attenuated in countries with available
   alternative funding sources. The results are robust to controlling for
   other dimensions of financial policy-cash holdings, debt maturity,
   dividends, preferred stock, convertible debt, and leverage-that also
   affect real investment.

AB The use of business insurance has been traditionally studied in a
   single-firmsetting, but in reality preventing operational accidents
   involves the (unobservable) efforts of multiple firms. We show that, in
   a multifirm setting, insurance can be used strategically as a commitment
   mechanism to prevent excessive free riding by other firms. In the
   presence of wealth imbalances, contracts alone leave wealth-constrained
   firms with inefficiently low incentives to exert effort (because of
   limited liability) and firms with sufficient wealth with excessive
   incentives. Insurance allows the latter to credibly commit to lower
   effort, thereby mitigating the incentives of the wealth-constrained
   firms to free ride. This finding shows that insurance can improve the
   efficiency of risk management efforts by decreasing free-riding
   problems.

AB We develop a model to analyze how board governance affects firms'
   financial reporting choices and managers' incentives to manipulate
   accounting reports. In our setting, ceteris paribus, conservative
   accounting is desirable because it allows the board of directors to
   better oversee the firm's investment decisions. This feature of
   conservatism, however, causes the manager to manipulate the accounting
   system to mislead the board and distort its decisions. Effective
   reporting oversight curtails managers' ability to manipulate, which
   increases the benefits of conservative accounting and simultaneously
   reduces its costs. Our model predicts that stronger reporting oversight
   leads to greater accounting conservatism, manipulation, and investment
   efficiency.

   immediate gains and losses if the future was uncertain, and preferred
   future gains and losses if the present was uncertain. This pattern of

AB We demonstrate that a sampling-based mechanism can offer an alternative
   explanation for belief synchronization in social groups and the
   persistence of collective illusions. Our model assumes that people are
   more likely to sample popular alternatives than unpopular alternatives.
   We show that this mechanism is sufficient to explain belief
   synchronization: a strong majority of opinions will likely emerge in
   favor of one alternative. The reason is that the group is unlikely to
   move away from a state in which one alternative is very unpopular. If by
   chance most people come to dislike alternative A, they are all unlikely
   to sample it again and their opinions of A remain the same. When A is in
   fact the best alternative, a collective illusion has emerged because
   people mistakenly believe that a suboptimal alternative is the best. Our
   model implies that such a collective illusion is persistent. The model
   thus offers an existence proof that a collective illusion can occur even
   in settings where people do not infer that popular alternatives are
   better. The model also casts new light on the effect of online
   recommendation systems on attitude homogenization and the effect of
   majority voting on beliefs and attitudes.

AB Intercollegiate athletics in the United States have become a
   multibillion-dollar industry over the past several decades. In this
   study, we investigate the short-and longterm direct monetary effects of
   operating a winning athletics program for an academic institution of
   higher education. We construct a unique panel data set from multiple
   sources and utilize the latest dynamic panel data estimation methods to
   account for heterogeneity while also addressing endogeneity concerns. We
   find that success in men's football and basketball has a significant
   impact on a school's respective football and basketball revenues;
   however, the effect is different based on the type of school. We find
   that regular season wins in football account for most of the increase in
   revenue for established schools, whereas invitations to prestigious
   postseason bowl games play a big part for less-established schools.
   Furthermore, we find that student population and education quality
   dissipate the effect of athletic success on monetary payoffs. We find
   that success in basketball carries over more from the past than in
   football with additional contemporaneous marginal effects for
   established schools. We do find, however, that past athletic success
   carries over significantly to the present in both football and
   basketball, suggesting the significance of the long-term monetary effect
   of athletic success to many academic institutions in the United States.

   principals are informed about the past actions of other agents and thus
   have more information about norms of behavior. Compared with a setting
   in which principals are uninformed, agents exert substantially higher
   effort under a fixed wage contract when they are aware that an informed

   apparently signals a norm not to exploit trust, which leads to more

AB This paper analyzes the substantially growing markets for crowdfunding,
   in which retail investors lend to borrowers without financial
   intermediaries. Critics suggest that these markets allow sophisticated
   investors to take advantage of unsophisticated investors. The growth and
   viability of these markets critically depend on the underlying
   incentives. We provide evidence of perverse incentives in crowdfunding
   that are not fully recognized by the market. In particular, we look at
   group leader bids in the presence of origination fees and find that
   these bids are (wrongly) perceived as a signal of good loan quality,
   resulting in lower interest rates. Yet these loans actually have higher
   default rates. These adverse incentives are overcome only with
   sufficient skin in the game and when there are no origination fees. The
   results from the analysis in this paper provide more general
   implications for crowdfunding, its structure, and its regulation.

   widespread and exists even among the largest U.S. firms. Tests reveal
   that both labor supply and demand influence local matching. Compensation
   and unforced turnover are lower for local than for nonlocal CEOs, and
   the compensation of local CEOs depends on local labor market factors,

AB The financial sector is unique in being largely self-governed: the
   majority of financial firms' shares are held by other financial
   institutions. This raises the possibility that the monitoring of
   financial firms is especially undermined by conflicts of interest as a
   result of personal and professional links between these firms and their
   shareholders. To investigate this possibility, we scrutinize the aspect
   of the financial sector's self-governance that is directly observable:
   mutual fund companies' voting on their peers' stocks. We find that
   considerations specific to investee firms' membership in the same
   industry as their investors do indeed impact voting. This impact is in
   the direction of supporting the investee's management. We show that the
   own-industry effect reduces director efficacy and lowers firm value as a
   result. We extend our analysis to other financial companies and show
   that they also tend to vote more favorably when it comes to their peers.
   Our results suggest that peer support is a corrupting factor in the
   financial sector's governance.

AB Using a manually collected data set of all proxy contests from 1994
   through 2012, I show that proxy contests play an important role in
   hostile corporate governance. Target shareholders benefit from proxy
   contests: the average abnormal returns reach 6.5% around proxy contest
   announcements. Proxy contests that address firms' business strategies
   and undervaluation are most beneficial for shareholders. By contrast,
   proxy contests that aim at changing capital structure and governance do
   not lead to higher firm values. Relative to matching firms, future
   targets are smaller, they have higher stock liquidity, higher
   institutional and activist ownership, lower leverage and market
   valuation, and higher investments. Whereas most of these characteristics
   predict proxy contests in time series, prior to proxy contests, targets
   also experience poor stock performance, decreases in investments,
   increases in cash reserves and payouts to shareholders, and increases in
   management's entrenchment. These changes in corporate policies are
   consistent with targets' attempts to affect the probability of a proxy
   contest.

   judgments, independently or in teams, and were ranked based on Brier
   scores. In both seasons of the tournament, prices from the prediction

   markets when forecasts were statistically aggregated using temporal

   a 15 percentage point reduction in noncompliance with labor standards

   find a null effect on factory health and safety standards. This pattern
   is consistent with a causal mechanism that links lean to improved social

   develop novel indexes of the extent to which a new invention
   consolidates or destabilizes existing technology streams. We apply these
   indexes in analyses of university research commercialization and find
   that, although federal research funding pushes campuses to create
   inventions that are more destabilizing, deeper commercial ties lead them
   to produce technologies that consolidate the status quo. By quantifying
   the effects that new technologies have on their predecessors, the
   indexes we propose allow patent-based studies of innovation to capture

   replicate the "diversity trumps ability" proposition for large groups,
   showing that samples of heterogeneous agents outperform same-sized
   homogeneous teams of high ability. In groups smaller than approximately
   16 members, however, the effects of group composition depend on the
   social decision function employed: diversity is key only in continuous
   estimation tasks (averaging) and much less important in discrete choice
   tasks (voting), in which agents' individual abilities remain crucial.
   Thus, strategies to improve collective decision making must adapt to the
   predictive situation at hand.

AB Discrete choice experiments such as choice-based conjoint and dual
   response are popular preference elicitation methods, yet, they can
   suffer from context effects, extreme response behavior, and problems
   with estimating consumers' willingness to pay accurately when the
   purchase probability is high. This study proposes two new features to
   avoid these limits: (a) strictly separating all forced and all free
   choice questions and (b) an adaptive mechanism to select fewer, but more
   informative, free choice questions. The use of these two features
   invokes two new discrete choice experiment methods: separated dual
   response (SDR), with just the first feature, and separated adaptive dual
   response (SADR), with both features. A conceptual comparison, simulation
   study, tests to address endogeneity concerns, and three empirical
   studies demonstrate the appeal of these two new features, relative to
   the benefits of existing discrete choice experiments, especially when
   estimating willingness to pay.

AB Many products undergo cost reductions over their product life cycles.
   However, strategic customers may have more incentive to wait if they
   expect a cost reduction to lead to a price drop. A firm that does not
   face any uncertainty can use pricing strategies such as price commitment
   and price matching to alleviate the strategic waiting of customers.
   However, these pricing strategies provide less flexibility than dynamic
   pricing for a firm facing uncertainty. In this paper, we examine the
   impact of cost reduction under dynamic pricing, price commitment, and
   price matching when cost reduction can come from production learning or
   from technology advancement. The firm makes pricing decisions when
   facing uncertainty in future cost, and strategic customers decide
   whether to wait when facing uncertainty in future price. We show that in
   general the firm's profit is higher when future cost is more uncertain,
   but not necessarily when cost reduction is more significant. In
   addition, production learning and technology advancement can have
   opposite effects on the optimal pricing decisions and the choice of
   pricing strategy.

AB In some strategic alliances, a firm shares its manufacturing capacity
   with another, and the latter shares its distribution capacity with the
   former. Even though such bidirectional alliances have become more
   common, they remain challenging to manage because of the frequent
   disputes over capacity allocation, especially when demand is uncertain.
   In this paper, we investigate whether there exists a contractual
   mechanism that can mitigate the extent of these disputes while improving
   the profits of all participating firms. We consider two types of
   bidirectional contracts, namely, the ex post transfer payment contract
   and the ex ante capacity reservation contract. By modeling the capacity
   allocation and the bidirectional contract design as a noncooperative
   game between two firms with noncompeting product lines, we show that,
   relative to a situation with no contract, either contract can improve
   the alliance's total profit in equilibrium. In terms of distribution of
   the total surplus, we find that capacity reservation contracts always
   make both firms better off, whereas ex post transfer payment contracts
   may make one firm worse off. Hence, capacity reservation contracts are
   more likely to be implemented in practice in such bidirectional
   alliances.

AB Many service systems use case managers, servers who are assigned
   multiple customers and have frequent, repeated interactions with each
   customer until the customer's service is completed. Examples may be
   found in healthcare (emergency department physicians), contact centers
   (agents handling multiple online chats simultaneously) and social
   welfare agencies (social workers with multiple clients). We propose a
   stochastic model of a baseline case-manager system, formulate models
   that provide performance bounds and stability conditions for the
   baseline system, and develop two approximations, one of which is based
   on a two-time-scale approach. Numerical experiments and analysis of the
   approximations show that increasing case throughput by increasing the
   probability of case completion can lead to much greater waiting-time
   reductions than increasing service speed. Many systems place an upper
   limit on the number of customers simultaneously handled by each case
   manager. We examine the impact of these caseload limits on waiting time
   and describe effective, heuristic methods for setting these limits.

AB When a product of uncertain quality is first introduced, consumers may
   choose to strategically delay their purchasing decisions in anticipation
   of the product reviews of their peers. This paper investigates how the
   presence of social learning affects the strategic interaction between a
   dynamic-pricing monopolist and a forward-looking consumer population,
   within a simple two-period model. Our analysis yields three main
   insights. First, we find that the presence of social learning has
   significant structural implications for optimal pricing policies: In the
   absence of social learning, decreasing price plans are always preferred
   by the firm; by contrast, in the presence of social learning we find
   that (i) if the firm commits to a price path ex ante (preannounced
   pricing), an increasing price plan is typically announced, whereas (ii)
   if the firm adjusts price dynamically (responsive pricing), prices are
   initially low and may either rise or decline over time. Second, we
   establish that under both preannounced and responsive pricing, even
   though the social learning process exacerbates strategic consumer
   behavior (i.e., increases strategic purchasing delays), its presence
   results in an increase in expected firm profit. Third, we illustrate
   that, contrary to results reported in existing literature on strategic
   consumer behavior, in settings where social learning is significantly
   influential, preannounced pricing policies are generally not beneficial
   for the firm.

AB The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BIS) has recently sanctioned
   expected shortfall (ES) as the market risk measure to be used for
   banking regulatory purposes, replacing the well-known value at risk
   (VaR). This change is motivated by the appealing theoretical properties
   of ES as a measure of risk and the poor properties of VaR. In
   particular, VaR fails to control for "tail risk." In this transition,
   the major challenge faced by financial institutions is the
   unavailability of simple tools for evaluation of ES forecasts (i.e.,
   backtesting ES). The main purpose of this paper is to propose such
   tools. Specifically, we propose backtests for ES based on cumulative
   violations, which are the natural analogue of the commonly used
   backtests for VaR. We establish the asymptotic properties of the tests,
   and investigate their finite sample performance through some Monte Carlo
   simulations. An empirical application to three major stock indexes shows
   that VaR is generally unresponsive to extreme events such as those
   experienced during the recent financial crisis, whereas ES provides a
   more accurate description of the risk involved.

AB Employing a unique data set for the period 2000-2010, this paper
   examines the impact of formal enforcement actions targeting the core of
   the banks' financial safety and soundness in terms of bank capital,
   risk, and performance. We find that, on average, these actions reduce
   both the risk-weighted assets and the nonperforming loans ratios of
   punished banks, but there is no increase in the level of regulatory
   capital. These effects are less powerful during the postcrisis period,
   suggesting that banks' scope to improve their safety and soundness
   condition in crisis periods is much more limited. We also find, albeit
   with some limitations, that the timing of formal enforcement actions is
   important: the more the actions are deferred relative to the continuous
   deterioration of the banks' financial condition, the more limited their
   impact on the risk-based capital ratio, while actions taken earlier help
   banks to improve their financial soundness.

AB We consider a project supply chain where a manufacturer carries out a
   sequence of tasks, and each task requires certain key materials from a
   supplier. Since a fixed-price contract cannot attain channel
   coordination, we focus on time-based incentive contracts. Our proposed
   contract requires optimization of the material delivery schedule as well
   as the fraction and the timing of a delayed payment to each supplier.
   Under the contract, the manufacturer's profit is affected by the
   variance but not by the mean of a supplier's lead time. Each supplier
   benefits from a reduction in the mean or variance of his own lead time,
   whereas the supplier's profit is independent of the duration of the
   on-site tasks and the lead times of other suppliers. The contract is
   also robust in various scenarios: in particular, coordination can be
   achieved even if the manufacturer's estimate of the average delivery
   lead time is inaccurate.

AB Strategic supply chain design decisions are critical to the long-term
   success of a business. Traditional facility location models for supply
   chain design focus on the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of
   proximity, i.e., the distance between facilities and customers. These
   strategic-focused models do not consider the supply chain's agility,
   i.e., its ability to quickly respond to unexpected fluctuations in
   customer needs. In this paper, we study the problem of designing a
   supply chain distribution network under demand uncertainty and analyze
   how the optimal design characteristics of proximity and agility depend
   on various input parameters. We are able to draw managerial insights on
   how agility considerations may invalidate well-established and widely
   accepted qualitative results derived from traditional models. In
   particular, we show that it is optimal to increase the density of
   distribution centers (DCs) when the shortage penalty cost increases, and
   to decrease the density of DCs when a certain unit transportation cost
   parameter increases. Through these findings, our work conveys the
   message that traditional, proximity-based facility location models can
   be inadequate for designing modern responsive supply chains, and calls
   for the need to develop a new class of models for the task.

AB Service organizations face a trade-off between high utilization and
   responsiveness. High utilization can improve financial performance, but
   causes congestion, which increases throughput time. Employees may manage
   this trade-off by reducing processing times during periods of high
   workload, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between
   utilization and throughput time. Using two years of inpatient data from
   203 California hospitals, we find evidence that patient length of stay
   (LOS) increases as occupancy increases, until a tipping point, after
   which patients are discharged early to alleviate congestion. More
   interestingly, we find a second tipping point-at 93% occupancy-beyond
   which additional occupancy leads to a longer LOS. These results are
   indicative of a workload-related "saturation effect" where employees can
   no longer overcome high workload by speeding up. Our data suggest that
   the saturation effect is due to an increase in the workload requirements
   of the remaining patients. Collectively, we find that the underlying
   relationship between occupancy and LOS is N-shaped. Consequently,
   managers who seek cost efficiencies via a strategy of high utilization
   in tandem with speeding up may find that their strategy backfires
   because there is a point at which employees are no longer able to
   compensate for a high workload by working harder, and throughput time
   counterproductively increases. We perform a counterfactual analysis and
   find that an alternate strategy of employing flexible labor when faced
   with high occupancy levels might be a more productive approach, and
   could save the hospitals in our sample up to $138 million over 23
   months.

   we compare the degree of conformity in groups with varying gender

   that a subject's lack of ability predicts both a true propensity to

AB Firms today average forecasts collected from multiple experts and
   models. Because of cognitive biases, strategic incentives, or the
   structure of machine-learning algorithms, these forecasts are often
   overfit to sample data and are overconfident. Little is known about the
   challenges associated with aggregating such forecasts. We introduce a
   theoretical model to examine the combined effect of overfitting and
   overconfidence on the average forecast. Their combined effect is that
   the mean and median probability forecasts are poorly calibrated with hit
   rates of their prediction intervals too high and too low, respectively.
   Consequently, we prescribe the use of a trimmed average, or trimmed
   opinion pool, to achieve better calibration. We identify the random
   forest, a leading machine-learning algorithm that pools hundreds of
   overfit and overconfident regression trees, as an ideal environment for
   trimming probabilities. Using several known data sets, we demonstrate
   that trimmed ensembles can significantly improve the random forest's

   sizes, or both? (ii) Can the performance of affine jump-diffusion models

   find that a simple affine jump-diffusion model with both stochastic

   NASDAQ-100 daily returns from 1980 to 2013 well; the model outperforms
   existing ones (e.g., models with variance-gamma jumps or jumps in
   volatility) during the crisis and is at least comparable before the
   crisis. For the first question, on the basis of the model and the data
   sets, we observe that during the crisis, negative jump rate increased
   significantly, although there was little change in the average negative
   jump size.

   because they convey special meaning. In this study, we examine whether
   previous inferences of asymmetric stock price reactions to bright-line
   surprises are observed when empirical tests are designed to be
   consistent with a rational expectations equilibrium. Focusing on a small
   range of earnings surprises around hypothesized bright lines, we find no
   evidence of asymmetric price reactions once investors' ex ante
   expectation of bias in earnings surprises is controlled. Results from
   additional tests yield support for the external validity of the
   theoretical framework underlying our bright-line pricing tests. Our
   findings suggest simple refinements to traditional bins-comparison and
   regression tests for asymmetric price reactions to bright-line earnings
   surprises, which account for necessary conditions implied by a rational

AB We characterize the consistency of a large class of nonexpected utility
   preferences (including mean-variance preferences and prospect theory
   preferences) with stochastic orders (for example, stochastic dominances
   of different degrees). Our characterization rests on a novel decision
   theoretic result that provides a behavioral interpretation of the set of
   all derivatives of the functional representing the decision maker's
   preferences. As an illustration, we consider in some detail prospect
   theory and choice-acclimating preferences, two popular models of
   reference dependence under risk, and we show the incompatibility of loss
   aversion with prudence.

AB Research and development (R&D) collaborations, common in high-tech
   industries, are challenging to manage because of technical and market
   risks as well as incentive problems. We investigate how control rights,
   options, payment terms, and timing allow the innovator to capture
   maximum value from its R&D collaborations with a marketer. Our study
   reveals a counterintuitive result; the innovator may, under certain
   conditions, prefer to grant launch control rights or buyout options to
   the marketer despite the fact that both terms restrict its downstream
   actions. We demonstrate that a menu of contracts is not necessary to
   address the adverse selection problem because the menu can be replicated
   by a single option contract. We show that timing, through renegotiation
   or delayed contracting, as well as the careful allocation of control
   rights and options can have a significant influence on the value of
   collaborative R&D. We provide recommendations on the optimal contract
   structure and timing based on two project characteristics, novelty of
   the R&D process and market-potential variability.

AB Many online content providers aim to compensate for a loss in
   advertising revenues by charging consumers for access to content.
   However, such a choice is not straightforward because subscription fees
   typically deter customers, and a resulting decline in viewership further
   reduces advertising revenues. This research examines whether firms that
   offer both free and paid content can benefit from adjusting the amount
   of content offered for free. We find that firms should offer more
   free-and not paid-content in periods of high demand. We motivate
   theoretically that this policy, which we term "countercyclical
   offering," may be optimal for firms when consumers are heterogeneous in
   their valuation of online content and this heterogeneity varies over
   time. Using unique data from an online content provider, we then provide
   empirical evidence that firms indeed engage in countercyclical offering
   and increase the share of free content in periods of high demand.

AB Oftentimes, close competitors carry partially overlapping assortments in
   seeming contradiction to the principle of maximum differentiation. One
   of the justifications of such practice is that an overlapping assortment
   with competitive prices on the common products may prevent further
   consumer search and therefore could be useful even when profits from the
   overlapping products do not justify the costs of carrying them. In this
   paper, we examine the validity of this intuition and show that such
   strategy may indeed be optimal when consumers are uncertain about prices
   they might find elsewhere and face shopping costs for discovery of all
   prices. Specifically, we showthat the (larger) assortment with product
   overlap may signal a "competitive" price of the relatively unique
   product and prevent further consumer search for a lower price on it. An
   implication of this finding is that a consumer may rationally behave as
   if she likes a larger assortment even if the assortment is enlarged by
   adding products the consumer has no interest in. Furthermore, we show
   that the optimal pricing strategy may include pricing of common products
   or products with known costs at a loss, which provides a novel
   explanation of loss-leader pricing.

AB This paper analyzes a variation of the secretary problem in which two
   selectors with different fields of interest each want to appoint one of
   the n candidates with as much expertise as possible in their field.
   Selectors simultaneously vote to accept or reject: Unanimous decisions
   are respected, and candidates with a split decision are hired with
   probability p. Each candidate arrives with expertise x and y in the two
   fields, uniformly and independently distributed on [0; 1] and observable
   to both selectors. If a candidate with expertise pair (x, y) is hired by
   unanimous decision, the payoffs to the selectors are simply x and y.
   However, to model the level of conformity in the firm, we deduct a
   positive "consensus cost" c from the utility of a selector who has
   rejected a candidate who is nevertheless hired. We show(Theorem 1) that
   each stage game has a unique equilibrium in which there are two
   thresholds, z < nu; and say selector I accepts candidate (x,y) if x > nu
   or x > z and y > nu. We show that for sufficiently large p and c,
   decisions are unanimous, and that as the number n of candidates goes to
   infinity, the equilibrium value of the game goes to the golden mean. We
   show that as the consensus cost c increases from 0, this hurts the
   selectors (Theorem 4) but helps the firm (Theorem 6), whose utility from
   hiring candidate (x,y) is a weighted average of x and y. Thus a little
   conformity is good for the firm.

AB We develop a model in which the parties to a joint production project
   have a choice of specifying contractual performance in terms of actions
   or deliverables. Penalties for noncompliance are not specified; rather,
   they are left to the courts under the legal doctrine of compensatory
   damages. We analyze three scenarios of increasing uncertainty: full
   information, where implications of partner actions are known; risk,
   where implications can be probabilistically quantified; and ambiguity,
   where implications cannot be so quantified. Under full information,
   action requirements dominate: they always induce the maximum economic
   value. This dominance vanishes in the risk scenario. Under ambiguity,
   deliverables specifications can interact with compensatory damages to
   create a form of "ambiguity insurance," where ambiguity aversion is
   assuaged in a way that increases the aggregate, perceived value of the
   project. This effect does not arise under contracts specifying action
   requirements. Thus, deliverables contracts may facilitate highly novel
   joint projects that would otherwise be foregone as a result of excessive
   uncertainty. Suggested empirical implications include the choice of
   contract clause type depending on the level of uncertainty in a joint
   development project, one application being the level of partner
   experience with interfirm collaborations.

   the dichotomy between first-order and second-order ambiguity aversion,
   which I define here. My definition and its characterization are
   independent of specific representations of decisions under uncertainty.
   I showthat with second-order ambiguity aversion, a positive exposure to
   ambiguity is optimal if and only if there is a subjective belief such
   that the act's expected outcome is positive. With first-order ambiguity
   aversion, zero exposure to ambiguity can be optimal. Examples in
   finance, insurance, and contracting demonstrate the economic relevance
   of this dichotomy.

AB There is growing interest in the use of loss contracts that offer
   performance incentives as up-front payments that employees can lose.
   Standard behavioral models predict a trade-off in the use of loss
   contracts: employees will work harder under loss contracts than under
   gain contracts, but, anticipating loss aversion, they will prefer gain
   contracts to loss contracts. In a series of experiments, we test these
   predictions by measuring performance and preferences for
   payoff-equivalent gain and loss contracts. We find that people indeed
   work harder under loss than gain contracts, as the theory predicts.
   Surprisingly, rather than a preference for the gain contract, we find
   that people actually prefer loss contracts. In exploring mechanisms for
   our results, we find suggestive evidence that people do anticipate loss
   aversion but select into loss contracts as a commitment device to
   improve performance, using one bias, loss aversion, to address another,
   dynamic inconsistency.

   opinions. We contribute to this literature by examining the impact of
   managerial ability on the credit rating process. Given debt market
   participants' interest in assessing default risk, we begin by
   documenting that higher managerial ability is associated with lower
   variability in future earnings and stock returns. We then show that
   higher managerial ability is associated with higher credit ratings
   (i.e., lower assessments of credit risk). To provide more direct
   identification of the impact of managerial ability, we examine chief
   executive officer (CEO) replacements and document that ratings increase
   (decrease) when CEOs are replaced with more (less) able CEOs. Finally,
   we show that managerial ability also has capital market implications by
   documenting that managerial ability is associated with bond offering
   credit spreads. Collectively, our evidence suggests that managerial
   ability is an important factor that bond market participants impound
   into their assessments of firm credit risk.

   consumers. In this paper, we seek to understand and measure the causal
   impact of tablets on e-commerce sales. In doing so, we examine the
   complementary and substitution impact of the tablet channel on the
   smartphone and PC channels. We rely on a unique data set from Alibaba,
   the largest e-commerce firm in the world, and exploit a natural
   experiment via the iPad app introduction to empirically identify our
   results. The results show that users' adoption of tablets enhanced the
   overall growth of Alibaba's e-commerce market, with an annual increase
   of approximately US$923.5 million. Our results demonstrate that the
   tablet channel acts as a substitute for the PC channel while it acts as
   a complement for the smartphone channel. Furthermore, the use of tablets
   spurs casual browsing, which leads to the purchase of more impulse
   products and a wider diversity of products. Cross-device browsing
   behavior is found to enhance sales outcomes, and the degree of
   interrelationships between devices varies across the course of the day.
   We provide insights for retailers about how they can increase their
   sales volume and revenue in the emerging tablet economy.

AB Many decision makers seek to optimize choices between uncertain options
   such as strategies, employees, or products. When performance targets
   must be met, attending to observed past performance is not enough to
   optimize choices-option uncertainty must also be considered. For
   example, for stretch targets that exceed observed performance, more
   uncertain options are often better bets. A significant determinant of
   option uncertainty is sample size: for a given option, the smaller the
   sample of information we have about it, the greater the uncertainty. In
   two studies, choices were made between pairs of uncertain options with
   the goal of exceeding a specified performance target. Information about
   the options differed in the size of the sample drawn from them, sample
   size, and the observed performance of those samples, the proportion of
   successes or "hits" in the sample. We found people to be sensitive to
   sample size-based uncertainty only when differences in observed
   performance were negligible. We conclude that in the presence of
   performance targets, people largely fail to capitalize on the value
   advantages of small samples in the presence of stretch targets.

   closed-form ordering quantities for both symmetric and asymmetric
   uncertainty sets, under capacitated inventory constraints, in both
   static and dynamic settings. The behaviors of our robust strategies
   differ qualitatively depending on the symmetry of the uncertainty set.
   For instance, considering our simplest static problem, (1) if the
   uncertainty set is symmetric, then there is positive ordering in all
   periods, whereas (2) if the set is asymmetric, then there is a set of
   periods in the middle of the planning horizon with zero orders. We also
   link the symmetry of the uncertainty set to the symmetry of the demand
   distribution. Finally, we present encouraging computational results
   where our solution compares favorably to previously studied, more

   a large part of the country is below sea level and high water levels in

   optimization model to determine economically efficient flood protection
   standards. We improve the model proposed by David van Dantzig [van

   Econometrica 24(3):276-287] after a devastating flood in the Netherlands
   in 1953. Our model is nonconvex, but we derive an explicit simple
   expression for the global optimal solution, which is periodic. We also
   discuss how to use this optimal investment policy to derive an efficient
   flood protection standard. The rather simple expression for this
   standard gives us much insight into how it depends on several relevant
   economic and climate model parameters. This approach has been applied to
   all dike rings in the Netherlands, and the resulting standards have been
   stated in the new Delta Programme 2015, which has been accepted by the

   participation rate among bondholders is significantly lower if the firm
   has CDSs traded on its debt. To address endogeneity concerns, I use the
   introduction of the Big Bang Protocol as a natural experiment. The
   results suggest that firms with CDSs find it difficult to reduce debt
   out of court. This is important because it can increase the likelihood
   of future bankruptcy, which is inefficient. The findings are consistent
   with the empty creditor hypothesis, which posits that bondholders who
   are hedged with CDSs are less likely to participate in a debt
   restructuring. The paper also contains direct evidence for the existence

   equilibrium each player "selects" an emotional state that determines the
   player's preferences over the outcomes of the game. These preferences
   typically differ from the players' material preferences. The emotional
   states interact to play a Nash equilibrium and, in addition, each
   player's mental state must be a best response to the mental states of
   the others (in the sense of maximizing material payoffs). We discuss the
   concept behind the definition of mental equilibrium and examine it in
   the context of some of the most popular games discussed in the
   experimental economics literature. In particular, our approach allows us
   to identify the mental states (the psychology) that lead players to play
   various prominent experimental outcomes. We provide necessary and
   sufficient conditions for mental equilibria to be sustained by material
   preferences. Finally, we discuss the concept of collective emotions,
   which is based on the idea that players can coordinate their mental

AB We embed systematic default, procyclical recovery rates, and external
   habit persistence into a model with a slight possibility of a
   macroeconomic disaster of reasonable magnitude. We derive analytical
   solutions for defaultable bond prices and show that a single set of
   structural parameters calibrated to the real economy can simultaneously
   explain several key empirical regularities in equity, credit, and
   options markets. Our model captures the empirical level and volatility
   of credit spreads, generates a flexible credit risk term structure, and
   provides a good fit to a century of observed spreads. The model also
   matches high-yield and collaterized debt obligation tranche spreads,
   equity market moments, and index option skewness. Finally, our model
   implies a time-varying relationship between bond and option prices that
   depends on the state of the economy and that explains the conflicting
   empirical evidence found in the literature.

   corporate bond funds, which, although less researched, represent an
   important setting to study investor behavior. Based on a large sample of
   corporate bond funds over 1991-2014, we first show that flows are
   sensitive to both fund performance and macroeconomic conditions, but
   unlike equity funds, the flow-performance relationship is not convex.
   Then, we find that investor flows can predict fund performance. More
   importantly, the predictability cannot be explained by return momentum
   or price pressure but is subsumed by performance persistence. Finally,
   an examination of idiosyncratic flows reveals little evidence that fund
   investors use finer-than-public information.

AB This paper identifies an important source of variation in U.S. firms'
   material information flows: their Form 8-K filing frequency. Exploiting
   cross-sectional variation in this novel proxy for information intensity,
   this paper finds that firms with higher information intensity experience
   lower future returns and lower future volatilities. The marginal return
   impact is higher at low levels of information intensity and high levels
   of prior volatility. On average, an information-intensity-based
   long-short portfolio generates a return spread of 4.3% per year. After
   adjusting for the Fama-French three factors and the momentum factor, the
   abnormal return remains 4.4% per year. These novel findings suggest
   that, because of the dynamic nature of information arrival, the
   frequency/quantity of information is an important source affecting the
   information environment and stock returns of public companies. These
   findings are consistent with the predictions of a broad class of noisy
   rational expectations equilibrium models and estimation risk models, and
   they highlight the importance of learning in financial markets with
   incomplete information.

   experiment to examine the link between product market competition and
   internal governance mechanisms. Consistent with the notion that
   competition plays an important role in aligning incentives within the
   firm, SOX has led to a larger improvement in the operation of firms in
   concentrated industries than in nonconcentrated industries. Furthermore,
   within concentrated industries, the effect is especially pronounced
   among firms with weaker governance mechanisms prior to SOX. We
   corroborate these findings using two additional regulatory changes in

AB Innovation has traditionally been seen as the province of producers.
   However, theoretical and empirical research now shows that individual
   users-consumers-are also a major and increasingly important source of
   new product and service designs. In this paper, we build a microeconomic
   model of a market that incorporates demand-side innovation and
   competition. We explain the conditions under which firms find it
   beneficial to invest in supporting and harvesting users' innovations,
   and we show that social welfare rises when firms utilize this source of
   innovation. Our modeling also indicates reasons for policy interventions
   with respect to a mixed user and producer innovation economy. From the
   social welfare perspective, as the share of innovating users in a market
   increases, profit-maximizing firms tend to switch "too late" from a
   focus on internal research and development to a strategy of also
   supporting and harvesting user innovations. Underlying this inefficiency
   are externalities that the producer cannot capture. Overall, our results
   explain when and how the proliferation of innovating users leads to a
   superior division of innovative labor involving complementary
   investments by users and producers, both benefitting producers and
   increasing social welfare.

AB Online auction environments provide several sources of information that
   can be used by bidders to form their bids. The impact of this
   information on bidding is likely to be higher when ambiguously specified
   products are auctioned. The secondary market represents one such
   environment, where used and returned items from big-box retailers are
   auctioned off to other business buyers. Using a proprietary data set of
   secondary market auctions hosted on an online business-to-business
   platform, we study how market pricing information from other auctions
   for comparable products affects the bidding behavior of the first
   bidder. First bidders are shown to be influenced by two sets of pricing
   information: prices from their own historical bidding behavior and
   concurrent prices, formed from other open and just-finished auctions
   relative to the focal auction. We also study how the impact of this
   market pricing information is moderated by bidder heterogeneity,
   captured by bidder experience and cross-bidding activity on the platform
   across comparable concurrent auctions. Finally, we show that the first
   bid is significantly associated with the auction's final price,
   contingent on the type of first bidder. Auctions are increasingly being
   used for the sale of ill-defined and idiosyncratic products; our work
   thus provides managerial implications for how auctioneers may design and
   manage the flow of relevant information to different classes of bidders
   on their sites in order to enhance their yields.

AB This paper studies optimal sales force compensation plans in a
   multiperiod moral-hazard model when the firm wants to implement high
   effort in every period but only obtains aggregate information on sales.
   The sales agent chooses effort each period after observing previous
   sales, and his incentive responsiveness might change over time. The
   paper derives conditions under which a linear incentive scheme-a pure
   commission-dominates a bonus plan and vice versa. A commission is
   optimal if the agent is most difficult to motivate in the last period.
   Otherwise, combining the commission with a bonus plan can lower the
   firm's cost of providing incentives in earlier periods. The results are
   robust to different types of cost externalities and demand externalities
   across periods. However, if the firm obtains intermediate sales
   information, bonus plans dominate commissions.

AB It has been argued that servicizing business models, under which a firm
   sells the use of a product rather than the product itself, are
   environmentally beneficial. The main arguments are as follow. First,
   under servicizing the firm charges customers based on the product usage.
   Second, the quantity of products required to meet customer needs may be
   smaller because the firm may be able to pool customer needs. Third, the
   firm may have an incentive to offer products with higher efficiency.
   Motivated by these arguments, we investigate the economic and
   environmental potential of servicizing business models. We endogenize
   the firm's choice between a pure sales model, a pure servicizing model,
   and a hybrid model with both sales and servicizing options; the pricing
   decisions; and the resulting customer usage. We consider two extremes of
   pooling efficacy, i.e., no pooling versus strong pooling. We find that
   under no pooling servicizing leads to higher environmental impact due to
   production but lower environmental impact due to use. In contrast, under
   strong pooling, when a hybrid business model is more profitable, it is
   also environmentally superior. However, a pure servicizing model is
   environmentally inferior for high production costs because it leads to a
   larger production quantity even under strong pooling. We also examine
   the product efficiency choice and find that the firm offers higher
   efficiency products only under servicizing models with strong pooling.

AB The design and use of standard processes are foundational
   recommendations in many operations practices. Yet, given the
   demonstrated performance benefits of standardized processes, it is
   surprising that they are often not followed consistently. One way to
   ensure greater compliance is by electronically monitoring the activities
   of individuals, although such aggressive monitoring poses the risk of
   inducing backlash. In the setting of hand hygiene in healthcare, a
   context where compliance with standard processes is frequently less than
   50% and where this lack of compliance can result in negative
   consequences, we investigated the effectiveness of electronic
   monitoring. We did so using a unique, radio frequency identification
   (RFID)-based system deployed in 71 hospital units. We found that
   electronically monitoring individual compliance resulted in a large,
   positive increase in compliance. We also found that there was
   substantial variability in the effect across units and that units with
   higher levels of preactivation compliance experienced increased benefits
   from monitoring relative to units with lower levels of prepreactivation
   compliance. By observing compliance rates over three and a half years,
   we investigated the persistent effects of individual monitoring and
   found that compliance rates initially increased before they gradually
   declined. Additionally, in multiple units, individual monitoring was
   discontinued, allowing for an investigation of the impact of removing
   the intervention on compliance. Surprisingly, we found that, after
   removal, compliance rates declined to below prepreactivation levels. Our
   findings suggest that, although individual electronic monitoring can
   dramatically improve process compliance, it requires sustained
   managerial commitment.

AB Operational decisions under information asymmetry can signal a firm's
   prospects to less informed parties, such as investors, customers,
   competitors, and regulators. Consequently, managers in these settings
   often face a trade-off between making an optimal decision and sending a
   favorable signal. We provide experimental evidence on the choices made
   by decision makers in such settings. Equilibrium assumptions that are
   commonly applied to analyze these situations yield the least cost
   separating outcome as the unique equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the
   more informed party undertakes a costly signal to resolve the
   information asymmetry that exists. We provide evidence, however, that
   participants are much more likely to pursue a pooling outcome when such
   an outcome is available. This result is important for research and
   practice because pooling and separating outcomes can yield dramatically
   different results and have divergent implications. We find evidence that
   the choice to pool is influenced by changes in the underlying newsvendor
   model parameters in our setting. In robustness tests, we show that
   choosing a pooling outcome is especially pronounced among participants
   who report a high level of understanding of the setting and that
   participants who pool are rewarded by the less informed party with
   higher payoffs. Finally, we demonstrate through a reexamination of two
   previous studies how pooling outcomes can substantively extend the
   implications of other extant signaling game models in the operations
   management literature.

AB Healthcare reimbursements in the United States have been traditionally
   based on a fee-for-service (FFS) scheme, providing incentives for high
   volume of care, rather than efficient care. The new healthcare
   legislation tests new payment models that remove such incentives, such
   as the bundled payment (BP) system. We consider a population of patients
   (beneficiaries). The provider may reject patients based on the patient's
   cost profile and selects the treatment intensity based on a risk-averse
   utility function. Treatment may result in success or failure, where
   failure means that unforeseen complications require further care. Our
   interest is in analyzing the effect of different payment schemes on
   outcomes such as the presence and extent of patient selection, the
   treatment intensity, the provider's utility and financial risk, and the
   total system payoff. Our results confirm that FFS provides incentives
   for excessive treatment intensity and results in suboptimal system
   payoff. We show that BP could lead to suboptimal patient selection and
   treatment levels that may be lower or higher than desirable for the
   system, with a high level of financial risk for the provider. We also
   find that the performance of BP is extremely sensitive to the bundled
   payment value and to the provider's risk aversion. The performance of
   both BP and FFS degrades when the provider becomes more risk averse. We
   design two payment systems, hybrid payment and stop-loss mechanisms,
   that alleviate the shortcomings of FFS and BP and may induce system
   optimum decisions in a complementary manner.

AB We investigate whether organizations can create value by introducing

   operational transparency has been shown to improve consumer perceptions
   of service value, existing theory posits that increased contact between
   consumers and producers may diminish work performance. Two field and two
   laboratory experiments in food service settings suggest that
   transparency that (1) allows customers to observe operational processes
   (process transparency) and (2) allows employees to observe customers
   (customer transparency) not only improves customer perceptions but also
   increases service quality and efficiency. The introduction of this
   transparency contributed to a 22.2% increase in customer-reported
   quality and reduced throughput times by 19.2%. Laboratory studies
   revealed that customers who observed process transparency perceived
   greater employee effort and thus were more appreciative of the employees
   and valued the service more. Employees who observed customer
   transparency felt that their work was more appreciated and more
   impactful and thus were more satisfied with their work and more willing
   to exert effort. We find that transparency, by visually revealing
   operating processes to consumers and beneficiaries to producers,
   generates a positive feedback loop through which value is created for

   maintaining a high level of control-affects subsequent performance. We
   observe a strong decline in exerted effort when we inform workers about
   the meaninglessness of a job already done. Our data also suggests that
   providing a supplemental alternative meaning perfectly compensates for
   this negative performance effect. Individual characteristics such as

AB We study the inefficiencies stemming from a firm's operating flexibility
   under debt. We find that flexibility in replenishing or liquidating
   inventory, by providing risk-shifting incentives, could lead to
   borrowing costs that erase more than one-third of the firm's value. In
   this context, we examine the effectiveness of practical and widely used
   covenants in restoring firm value by limiting such risk-shifting
   behavior. We find that simple financial covenants can fully restore
   value for a firm that possesses a midseason inventory liquidation
   option. In the presence of added flexibility in replenishing or
   partially liquidating inventory, financial covenants fail, but simple
   borrowing base covenants successfully restore firm value. Explicitly
   characterizing optimal covenant tightness for all these cases, we find
   that better market conditions, such as lower inventory depreciation
   rate, higher gross margins, or increased product demand, are typically
   associated with tighter covenants. Our results suggest that
   inventory-heavy firms can reap the full benefits of additional operating
   flexibility, irrespective of their leverage, by entering simple debt
   contracts of the type commonly employed in practice. For such contracts
   to be effective, however, firms with enhanced flexibility and/or
   operating in better markets must also be willing to abide by more and/or
   tighter covenants.

AB Motivated by the recent interest in making delay announcements in large
   service systems, such as call centers, we investigate the accuracy of
   announcing the waiting time of the last customer to enter service (LES).
   In practice, customers typically respond to delay announcements by
   either balking or by becoming more or less impatient, and their response
   alters system performance. We study the accuracy of the LES announcement
   in single-class, multiserver Markovian queueing models with
   announcement-dependent customer behavior. We show that, interestingly,
   even in this stylized setting, the LES announcement may not always be
   accurate. This motivates the need to study its accuracy carefully and to
   determine conditions under which it is accurate. Since the direct
   analysis of the system with customer response is prohibitively
   difficult, we focus on manyserver, heavy-traffic analysis instead. We
   consider the quality-and-efficiency-driven and efficiency-driven
   many-server, heavy-traffic regimes and prove, under both regimes, that
   the LES prediction is asymptotically accurate if and only if asymptotic
   fluctuations in the queue length process are small as long as some
   regulatory conditions apply. This result provides an easy check for the
   accuracy of LES announcements in practice. We supplement our theoretical
   results with an extensive simulation study to generate practical
   managerial insights.

AB This paper compares the financial and environmental performance of two
   revenue models for the online retailing of groceries: the per-order
   model, where customers pay for each delivery, and the subscription
   model, where customers pay a set fee and receive free deliveries. We
   build a stylized model that incorporates (i) customers with ongoing
   uncertain grocery needs and who choose between shopping offline or
   online and (ii) an online retailer that makes deliveries through a
   proprietary distribution network. We find that subscription incentivizes
   smaller and more frequent grocery orders, which reduces food waste and
   creates more value for the customer; the result is higher retailer
   revenues, lower grocery costs, and potentially higher adoption rates.
   These advantages are countered by greater delivery-related travel and
   expenses, which are moderated by area geography and routing-related
   scale economies. Subscription also leads to lower food waste-related
   emissions but to higher delivery-related emissions. Ceteris paribus, the
   perorder model is preferable for higher-margin retailers with
   higher-consumption product assortments that are sold in sparsely
   populated markets spread over large, irregular areas with high delivery
   costs. Geographic and demographic data indicate that the subscription
   model is almost always environmentally preferable because lower food
   waste emissions dominate higher delivery emissions.

AB In many settings firms rely on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to
   certify prosocial attributes embodied in their products. We provide a
   model of competition between NGOs in the provision of labeling services.
   Competition between a fixed number ofNGOs features a "race to the top"
   in labeling standards, but entry ofNGOs offering new labels pushes
   standards down. In a wide range of settings NGO entry and competition
   results in too many labels being adopted, with each label being too
   stringent. Compared to a setting in which firms can credibly communicate
   the social attributes of their products, labels demand greater prosocial
   behavior than is desired by firms, although with proliferation of the
   number of labels this discrepancy disappears. In contrast to existing
   models, firms may engage in excessive corporate social responsibility
   when they rely on an NGO as a certifying intermediary.

AB This study documents a positive relationship between the option-implied
   riskneutral skewness (RNS) of individual stock returns' distribution and
   future realized stock returns during the period 1996-2012. A strategy
   that goes long the quintile portfolio with the highest RNS stocks and
   short the quintile portfolio with the lowest RNS stocks yields a
   Fama-French-Carhart alpha of 55 basis points per month (t-statistic of
   2.47). The significant underperformance of the portfolio with the most
   negative RNS stocks is driven by those stocks that are also perceived as
   relatively overpriced according to a series of overvaluation proxies and
   are too costly or too risky to sell short, thereby hindering the price
   correction mechanism. Our findings indicate that a highly negative RNS
   value, when reflecting high hedging demand for options by investors who
   perceive the underlying stock as relatively overpriced but hard to sell
   short, is a robust signal of significant future stock underperformance.

AB Sell-side analysts change their stock recommendations when their
   valuations differ from the market's. These valuation differences can
   arise from either differences in earnings estimates or the nonearnings
   components of valuation methodologies. We find that recommendation
   changes motivated by earnings estimate revisions have a greater initial
   price reaction than the same recommendation changes without earnings
   estimate revisions: about +1.3% (2.8%) greater for upgrades
   (downgrades). Nevertheless, the postrecommendation drift is also
   greater, suggesting that investors underreact to earningsbased
   recommendation changes. Implemented as a trading strategy,
   earnings-based recommendation changes earn risk-adjusted returns of 3%
   per month, considerably more than non-earnings-based recommendation
   changes. Evidence from variation in firms' information environment and
   analysts' regulatory environment suggests that recommendation changes
   with earnings estimate revisions are less affected by analysts'
   cognitive and incentive biases.

AB The effect of corporate governance may depend on a firm's financial
   slack. On one hand, financial slack may be spent by managers for their
   private benefits; a high level is likely associated with severe agency
   conflicts. Thus corporate governance matters more for high financial
   slack firms (i.e., the wasteful spending hypothesis). On the other hand,
   financial slack provides insurance against future uncertainties; a
   lowlevel may signal deviations from the best interests of shareholders.
   Then corporate governance is more effective for low financial slack
   firms (i.e., the precautionary needs hypothesis). We differentiate the
   two hypotheses using the passage of antitakeover laws to identify
   exogenous variation in governance. Consistent with the wasteful spending
   hypothesis, the laws' passage has a larger negative impact on the
   operating and stock market performance of high financial slack firms.
   Further analysis shows that these firms do not invest more but become
   less efficient at cost management after the laws' passage.

AB Theory predicts that individual investor's incentives to uncover new
   information about asset values are low if asset prices are efficient.
   This, in turn, implies that heterogeneity in investment manager skill,
   if present, should be most clearly visible among managers that focus on
   asset classes with less informationally efficient prices. We investigate
   this argument using a large sample of syndicated bank loan portfolios
   managed by collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managers. Using a CLO's
   equity tranche cashon-cash return to measure performance, we find strong
   persistence that is robust to an extensive set of risk controls.
   Although investors seem to derive their expectation about management
   quality from a manager's realized performance and allocate more capital
   to "skilled" managers, top performers cope to stay ahead of net-of-fees.
   This questions the rationality of managers and the efficiency of the
   syndicated loan market.

AB Correlations of equity returns have varied substantially over time and
   remain a source of continuing policy debate. This paper studies stock
   market correlations in an equilibrium model with heterogeneous risk
   aversion. In the model, preference heterogeneity causes variations in
   the volatility of aggregate risk aversion from good to bad states. At
   times of high volatility in aggregate risk aversion, which is a common
   factor in returns, we see high correlations. The model matches average
   industry return correlations and changes in correlations from business
   cycle peaks to troughs and replicates the dynamics of expected excess
   returns and standard deviations. Model-implied aggregate risk aversion
   explains average industry correlations, expected excess returns,
   standard deviations, and turnover volatility in the data. We find
   supportive evidence for the model's prediction that industries with low
   dividend-consumption correlation have low average return correlation but
   experience disproportional increases in return correlations in
   recessions.

AB Link recommendation, which suggests links to connect currently unlinked
   users, is a key functionality offered by major online social networks.
   Salient examples of link recommendation include "People You May Know" on
   Facebook and LinkedIn as well as "You May Know" on Google+. The main
   stakeholders of an online social network include users (e.g., Facebook
   users) who use the network to socialize with other users and an operator
   (e.g., Facebook Inc.) that establishes and operates the network for its
   own benefit (e.g., revenue). Existing link recommendation methods
   recommend links that are likely to be established by users but overlook
   the benefit a recommended link could bring to an operator. To address
   this gap, we define the utility of recommending a link and formulate a
   new research problem-the utility-based link recommendation problem. We
   then propose a novel utility-based link recommendation method that
   recommends links based on the value, cost, and linkage likelihood of a
   link, in contrast to existing link recommendation methods that focus
   solely on linkage likelihood. Specifically, our method models the
   dependency relationship between the value, cost, linkage likelihood, and
   utility-based link recommendation decision using a Bayesian network;
   predicts the probability of recommending a link with the Bayesian
   network; and recommends links with the highest probabilities. Using data
   obtained from a major U.S. online social network, we demonstrate
   significant performance improvement achieved by our method compared with
   prevalent link recommendation methods from representative prior
   research.

   participant who learns from experience arrive at shared decisions via
   mutual concessions. In doing so, they attenuate individual biases, such
   as the overweighting and underweighting of the probability of rare
   events. The social interaction thus leads dyads to make shared decisions
   that follow normative standards more closely than the decisions made by
   individual decision makers. Finally, in processing experiential
   information, dyads appear to be sensitive to the reliability of the
   experience: the more reliable the experiential information, the larger
   its influence on the dyad's decision.

AB Contrary to the tendency of mediators to defuse negative emotions
   between adversaries by treating them kindly, we demonstrate the
   surprising effectiveness of hostile mediators in resolving conflict.
   Hostile mediators generate greater willingness to reach agreements
   between adversaries (Experiment 1). Consequently, negotiators
   interacting with hostile mediators are better able to reach agreements
   in incentive-compatible negotiations than those interacting with nice
   mediators (Experiment 2). By serving as common enemies, hostile
   mediators cause adversaries in conflict to feel more connected and
   become more willing to reach agreement (Experiments 3 and 4). Finally,
   we manipulate the target of mediators' hostility to document the
   moderating role of common enemies: mediators who directed their
   hostility toward both negotiators (bilateral hostility)-becoming a
   common enemy-increased willingness to reach agreement; those who
   directed hostility at just one negotiator (unilateral hostility) did not
   serve as common enemies, eliminating the hostile mediator effect
   (Experiment 5). We discuss theoretical and practical implications, and
   we suggest future directions.

AB Despite growing interest in various facets of the position of chief
   marketing officer (CMO), there is very little research on CMO
   compensation. Accordingly, we set out to investigate the determinants of
   CMO compensation and its effect on firm performance. Employing the lens
   of agency theory, we hypothesize that the CMO's marginal productivity
   will positively impact the amount of total compensation as well as the
   extent of performance-based compensation in the CMO's compensation
   contract. Moreover, we hypothesize that deviations in contracting
   elements from predicted levels will adversely impact firm performance.
   Analyzing a sample of 9,230 firm-year observations over the period
   1992-2013, we find that CMOs employed at firms with high advertising and
   R& D intensity, and operating in competitive product markets, command
   larger amounts of total compensation. Moreover, a greater proportion of
   their compensation is market based, with heightened sensitivity to
   movements in the firm's stock price. We also find that deviations in CMO
   compensation elements have an adverse impact on operating performance
   (return on assets (ROA)), earnings surprises, and stock returns.
   Specifically, a 10% deviation in market-based compensation from
   predicted levels reduces ROAby 0.28%, dampens earnings surprises by
   0.19%, and degrades annualized stock returns by 2.4%.

   return policies, online review platforms, or any other means by which a
   firm allows consumers to learn about their value for a new product. In
   our model, demonstrations help individual consumers to learn whether
   they prefer an innovative product over an established alternative. The
   innovative firm controls demonstration informativeness. When the
   innovative firm commits to demonstration policies and there is
   flexibility in prices, the firm is best off offering fully informative
   demonstrations that divide the market and dampen price competition. In
   contrast, when a firm can adjust its demonstration strategy in response
   to prices, the firm prefers only partially informative demonstrations,
   designed to maximize its market share. Such a strategy can generate the
   monopoly profit for the innovative firm. We contrast the strategic role
   of demonstrations in our framework with the strategic role of capacity
   limits in models of judo economics, which also allow firms to divide a

AB We present a long-term power generation expansion planning model that
   features a long planning horizon, an hourly time resolution, multiperiod
   investment and retirement decisions, transmission constraints, start-up
   restrictions, and short-term demand response. Demand response is the
   capability of power load to react to short-term changes in electricity
   prices. It plays an increasingly important role in today's electricity
   markets but has not been taken into consideration in long-term power
   generation expansion planning problems, which mostly treat demand as
   perfectly inelastic. Given mild assumptions for the underlying demand
   function, the resulting model is a large-scale, concave, linearly
   constrained maximization problem. We exploit the model structure by
   developing a new approach to generalized Benders decomposition (GBD). In
   particular, we present two algorithmic ideas: (1) solving the nonlinear
   Benders subproblem as a linear programming (LP) problem with the aid of
   dynamic linear overestimation, referred to as the LP-based method, and
   (2) directly calculating all necessary optimal primal and dual variable
   values, referred to as the calculation-based method. We consider three
   special cases of our expansion planning model and show that solving
   mathematical programming problems can become entirely obsolete in the
   calculation-based method. We demonstrate the efficiency of all proposed
   algorithms for the Texas power system, comparing our tailored
   decomposition methods to a monolithic approach and a state-of-the-art
   GBD implementation. Our LP-based method is up to 3,822 times faster than
   the monolithic approach and up to 55 times faster than the GBD. The
   calculation-based method dramatically improves the solution time, being
   an average factor of 20 faster than solving LPs and 107,074 times faster
   than the monolithic approach (for the largest solvable instance by a
   commercial solver). The overall largest instance we solve, containing
   more than 79 million variables and constraints, converges in less than
   one minute using the calculation-based method. The modeling language
   GAMS and its latest features were used to efficiently implement all
   algorithms.

AB Mainstream queueing models are frequently employed in modeling
   healthcare delivery in a number of settings, and they further are used
   in making operational decisions for the same. The vast majority of these
   queueing models ignore the effects of delay experienced by a patient
   awaiting care. However, long delays may have adverse effects on patient
   outcomes and can potentially lead to a longer length of stay (LOS) when
   the patient ultimately does receive care. This work sets out to
   understand these delay issues from an operational perspective. Using
   data of more than 57,000 emergency department (ED) visits, we use an
   instrumental variable approach to empirically measure the impact of
   delays in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, i.e., ED boarding, on the
   patient's ICU LOS for multiple patient types. Capturing these
   empirically observed effects in a queueing model is challenging because
   the effect introduces potentially long-range correlations in service and
   interarrival times. We propose a queueing model that incorporates these
   measured delay effects and characterizes approximations to the expected
   work in the system when the service time of a job is adversely impacted
   by the delay experienced by that job. Our approximation demonstrates an
   effect of system load on work that grows much faster than the
   traditional 1/1(1-rho) relationship seen in most queueing systems. As
   such, it is imperative that the relationship of delays and LOS be better
   understood by hospital managers so that they can make capacity decisions
   that prevent even seemingly moderate delays from causing dire
   operational consequences.

AB We study server scheduling in multiclass service systems under
   uncertainty in the customer arrival volumes. Common practice in such
   systems is to first identify staffing levels and then determine
   schedules for the servers that cover these levels. We propose a new
   stochastic integer programming (SIP) model that integrates these two
   decisions, which can yield lower scheduling costs by exploiting the
   presence of alternative server configurations that yield similar quality
   of service. We find that a branch-and-cut algorithm based on Benders
   decomposition may fail due to the weakness of the relaxation bound. We
   propose a novel application of mixed-integer rounding to improve the
   Benders cuts used in this algorithm, a technique that is applicable to
   any SIP with integer first-stage decision variables. Numerical examples
   illustrate the computational efficiency of the proposed approach and the
   potential benefit of solving the integrated model compared to
   considering the staffing and scheduling problems separately.

AB Dynamic product rotation is perceived as a useful lever to increase
   sales. The effect over individual customers is, however, unclear: more
   choice in the future may induce them to postpone a purchase if the
   current offer is not sufficiently appealing, hoping to buy a better
   product in the future; moreover, visiting a store to learn about a new
   product may be costly, thereby diminishing the value of product updates.
   We analyze a model of strategic customer behavior in the face of a
   rotating product offering, with variable assortment depth. We find that
   the customers' visit and purchase decisions follow a relatively simple
   structure: a customer should visit the store only when new products have
   been introduced and purchase a product if the value it provides is
   higher than a threshold. We then use this structure to examine the
   retailer's optimal product-rotation policy. The structure of the optimal
   policy depends on product-rotation costs and capacity constraints. When
   capacity constraints are tight, the retailer spreads out product
   introductions throughout the selling season. Strategic customers tend to
   become more demanding (their purchasing thresholds increase) as the
   frequency of product rotation increases, so the marginal benefit of each
   additional product rotation decreases. In contrast, the purchasing
   thresholds for myopic customers-who buy the first item that fits their
   needs-are independent of the number of products introduced in the
   season. As a result, when the cost of product rotation is low, the
   frequency of product updates is higher when the retailer sells to
   strategic customers, whereas the opposite is true when the cost of
   product rotation is high. When capacity constraints are less stringent
   and product-rotation costs are convex in the assortment depth, we find
   that the level of product variety should increase as the season
   progresses when the firm sells to strategic customers, while the level
   of product variety stays constant over the season when faced with myopic
   customers. Finally, when there are no capacity constraints, it is
   optimal to introduce all products in a single period.

AB We study a microprocessor company selling short-life-cycle products to a
   set of buyers that includes large consumer electronic goods
   manufacturers. The seller has a limited capacity for each product and
   negotiates with each buyer for the price. Our analysis of their sales
   data reveals that larger purchases do not always result in bigger
   discounts. Instead, the discount curve is like an "N." While existing
   theories cannot explain this non-monotonic pattern, we develop an
   analytical model and show that the nonmonotonicity is rooted in how
   sellers value capacity when negotiating with a buyer. Large buyers
   accelerate the selling process and small buyers are helpful in consuming
   the residual capacity. However, satisfying midsized buyers may be costly
   because supplying these buyers can make it difficult to utilize the
   remaining capacity, which is often too much for small buyers but not
   enough for large buyers. We briefly discuss the implications for
   capacity rationing and posted pricing as well as potential applications
   to other industries.

AB Many carriers, such as airlines and ocean carriers, collaborate through
   the formation of alliances. The rules of alliances are important for
   both the stability of the alliance and the profitability of the alliance
   members. In this paper, we address the design of resource exchange
   alliances, a type of alliance agreement widely used in practice,
   especially in the ocean cargo industry. Resource exchange alliances
   often increase competition among alliance members since the members can
   sell substitutable products after the exchange. We propose a resource
   exchange model that takes into account the resulting competition and
   alliance profit allocation among alliance members. The problem of
   determining the optimal amounts of resources to exchange is formulated
   as a stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints
   (MPECs). Although MPEC problems are, in general, very difficult to
   solve, we successfully demonstrate an efficient solution approach and
   provide valuable insights for the resource exchange design problem. In
   particular, we show that the resource exchange alliance we propose can
   induce greater profit for the alliance members (both total and
   individual profits) even though it leads to greater competition.

AB The uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem is one of the most
   famous and most studied problems in the operations research literature.
   Given a set of potential facility locations and a set of customers, the
   goal is to find a subset of facility locations to open and to allocate
   each customer to open facilities so that the facility opening plus
   customer allocation costs are minimized. In our setting, for each
   customer the allocation cost is assumed to be a linear or separable
   convex quadratic function. Motivated by recent UFL applications in
   business analytics, we revise approaches that work on a projected
   decision space and hence are intrinsically more scalable for large-scale
   input data. Our working hypothesis is that many of the exact
   (decomposition) approaches that were proposed decades ago and discarded
   soon after need to be redesigned to take advantage of the new hardware
   and software technologies. To this end, we "thin out" the classical
   models from the literature and use (generalized) Benders cuts to replace
   a huge number of allocation variables by a small number of continuous
   variables that model the customer allocation cost directly. Our results
   showthat Benders decomposition allows for a significant boost in the
   performance of a mixed-integer programming solver. We report the optimal
   solution of a large set of previously unsolved benchmark instances
   widely used in the available literature. In particular, dramatic
   speedups are achieved for UFL problems with separable quadratic
   allocation costs, which turn out to be much easier than their linear
   counterparts when our approach is used.

AB Transaction cost economics predicts that investments in management
   control will enable risky interfirm transactions. Risk is rarely
   eliminated, because firms trade off costs of management control and
   expected costs of control loss (together, the "cost of control"). The
   resultant solution typically comprises a mix of control investments with
   residual performance and residual relational risks. Transaction cost
   economics also predicts that the control-residual risk trade-off will
   vary with the cost of control. We use survey data on 287 risky
   information technology transactions to test whether the control-residual
   risk trade-off varies predictably with two partnership-specific factors
   that proxy for variation in the cost of control: prior ties between
   exchange partners and the criticality of strategic resources to the
   transaction. The results support the hypotheses, providing novel
   evidence on trade-offs that managers make when investing in management
   controls while also prudently accepting some risks.

AB This paper studies the efficiency and distributive effects of three
   prominent accounting methods in auction settings when bidders'
   incentives are linked to accounting income. The purchase price method
   (PP) requires the acquirer to book the acquisition at historical cost,
   thereby underestimating the asset value by the amount of the acquirer's
   surplus in the transaction. The exit value method (EV) is downward
   biased and forces the acquirer to book an accounting loss on the date of
   acquisition. EV connects otherwise independent valuations inducing a
   reporting-based winner's curse and can even lead to fire-sale-like
   values. Relative to PP, EV implies lower asset prices, a decrease
   (increase) in the surplus of the seller (acquirer), and an increase in
   the probability that the asset attains its best use when the market is
   sufficiently competitive. Finally, I examine an alternative method in
   which the asset is valued at its perceived value-in-use (VU). Under this
   method, the acquirer bids more aggressively to increase perceived
   value-in-use, leading to a shift of surplus from the acquirer to the
   seller. Yet VU is unbiased and always maximizes the probability that the
   asset attains its best use.

AB We examine the impact of the international diversification of banks on
   the value of their advice in 1,705 cross-border merger and acquisition
   (M&A) transactions. We find that bidders engaging internationally
   diversified advisors face lower announcement returns. An increase of one
   standard deviation in advisor diversification is associated with an
   announcement return lower by 92 basis points for a bidder acquiring a
   listed target. The lower bidder returns are attributable to the lower
   synergies of the deals being completed. Our evidence suggests that
   internationally diversified advisors offer lower-quality advice to their
   clients, since their reputational concerns are weakened by having access
   to multiple geographies from which they can derive fee-based income. We
   present further evidence that financial incentives in the form of the
   advisor's involvement in deal financing and market incentives in the
   form of the potential to gain market share in the bidder country may
   mitigate some of the negative effects of the international
   diversification of the advisors.

AB Acritical component of both economic and perceptual decision making
   under uncertainty is the belief-formation process. However, most
   research has studied belief formation in economic and perceptual
   decision making in isolation. One reason for this separate treatment may
   be the assumption that there are distinct psychological mechanisms that
   underlie belief formation in economic and perceptual decisions. An
   alternative theory is that there exists a common mechanism that governs
   belief formation in both domains. Here, we test this alternative theory
   by combining a novel computational modeling technique with two
   well-known experimental paradigms. We estimate a drift-diffusion model
   (DDM) and provide an analytical method to decode prior beliefs from DDM
   parameters. Subjects in our experiment exhibit strong extrapolative
   beliefs in both paradigms. In line with the common mechanism hypothesis,
   we find that a single computational model explains belief formation in
   both tasks and that individual differences in belief formation are

   increase sales. Targeted email offers featuring products in the same
   category as a customer's previous purchases generate higher purchase
   rates. However, a targeted offer emphasizing familiar products could
   result in curtailed search for unadvertised products, as a closely
   matched offer weakens a customer's incentives to search beyond the
   targeted items. In a field experiment using email offers sent by an
   online wine retailer, targeted offers resulted in decreased search
   activity on the retailer'swebsite. This effect is driven by a lower rate
   of search by customers who visit the site, rather than a lower incidence
   of search. There are several ways this could potentially hurt retailers
   and consumers, such as reduced cross-selling and fewer opportunities for
   customers to explore new products.

AB In a two-period vertical duopoly, we examine how behavior-based price
   discrimination (BPD) affects the firms' endogenous quality
   differentiation and profits. The firms' relative production efficiency,
   defined as the ratio between their unit cost difference and quality
   difference, plays a crucial role. With exogenous product qualities, BPD
   always decreases the profits of the more efficient firm, but increases
   those of the sufficiently less efficient firm. Anticipating its period 2
   disadvantage in price discrimination, the less efficient firm competes
   more vigorously and also gains more in period 1 than its competitor. For
   the sufficiently less efficient firm, its period 1 gain dominates its
   period 2 loss, and its total profits increase. With endogenous quality
   choices, BPD does not alter the low-end quality (at the lower bound of
   the quality space), but increases the high-end quality, enlarging

AB The first in, first out (FIFO) queue discipline respects the order of
   arrivals, but is not efficient when customers have heterogeneous waiting
   costs. Priority queues, in which customers with higher waiting costs are
   served first, are more efficient but usually involve undesirable
   queue-jumping behaviors that violate bumped customers' property rights
   over their waiting spots. To have the best of both worlds, we propose
   time-trading mechanisms, in which customers who are privately informed
   about their waiting costs mutually agree on the ordering in the queue by
   trading positions. If a customer ever moves back in the queue, she will
   receive an appropriate monetary compensation. Customers can always
   decide not to participate in trading and retain their positions as if
   they are being served FIFO. We design the optimal mechanisms for the
   social planner, the service provider, and an intermediary who might
   mediate the trading platform. Both the social planner's and the service
   provider's optimal mechanisms involve a flat admission fee and an
   auction that implements strict priority. If a revenue-maximizing
   intermediary operates the trading platform, it should charge a trade
   participation fee and implement an auction with some trade restrictions.
   Therefore, customers are not strictly prioritized. However, relative to
   a FIFO system, the intermediary delivers value to the social planner by
   improving efficiency, and to the service provider by increasing its
   revenue.

AB We study sourcing in a supply chain with three levels: a manufacturer,
   tier 1 suppliers, and tier 2 suppliers prone to disruption from, e.g.,
   natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods. The manufacturer may
   not directly dictate which tier 2 suppliers are used but may influence
   the sourcing decisions of tier 1 suppliers via contract parameters. The
   manufacturer's optimal strategy depends critically on the degree of
   overlap in the supply chain: if tier 1 suppliers share tier 2 suppliers,
   resulting in a "diamond-shaped" supply chain, the manufacturer relies
   less on direct mitigation (procuring excess inventory and multisourcing
   in tier 1) and more on indirect mitigation (inducing tier 1 suppliers to
   mitigate disruption risk). We also show that while the manufacturer
   always prefers less overlap, tier 1 suppliers may prefer a more
   overlapped supply chain and hence may strategically choose to form a
   diamond-shaped supply chain. This preference conflict worsens as the
   manufacturer's profit margin increases, as disruptions become more
   severe, and as unreliable tier 2 suppliers become more heterogeneous in
   their probability of disruption; however, penalty contracts-in which the
   manufacturer penalizes tier 1 suppliers for a failure to deliver ordered
   units-alleviate this coordination problem.

   almost nonexistent. In this study, we identify product variety (measured
   as the number of factory installed options), plant variety (measured as
   the number of models per assembly line in a plant), and capacity
   utilization as drivers of subsequent manufacturing-related recalls. We
   examine their individual and joint effects using a unique data set
   compiled for a seven-year period by linking assembly line production
   data for North American automotive manufacturers with recall data from
   the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration. We show that
   manufacturing-related recalls are positively associated with product
   variety and plant utilization, but not with plant variety. We also find
   that the joint effect of plant variety and utilization is positively
   associated with increased recalls. In quantitative terms, a
   one-standard-deviation increase in the number of options (four
   additional options) is associated with two additional recalls and costs
   $46.2 million to automakers over the sample duration. We observe similar
   results with plant utilization, and find that a car built in a plant
   that is being utilized above 100% capacity is associated with more than
   eight additional recalls corresponding to an incremental cost of $167
   million.

AB Buyers have two levers to enhance their supply base performance:
   fostering supplier competition and inducing suppliers to improve. The
   competition-improvement relation between the two levers has important
   implications for supply base design. We study a buyer facing two
   potential suppliers that can exert cost-reduction efforts, examining the
   interplay of supplier competition and supplier cost improvement under
   various information structures (i.e., the supplier effort is observable
   or unobservable) and commitment capabilities (i.e., the buyer may not
   commit, or may commit to a full or partial procurement mechanism, before
   suppliers exert efforts). We find that the two identical suppliers may
   choose unequal efforts, resulting in an asymmetric equilibrium outcome
   that enhances the performance of dual sourcing. Moreover, the
   competition-improvement relation depends on the effort observability.
   Whereas supplier competition always leads to lower improvement effort
   when the effort is unobservable, it may induce higher effort when the
   effort is observable. Thus, a trade-off between supplier competition and
   supplier effort is not always necessary in supply base design. Comparing
   the observable-and unobservable-effort cases, we demonstrate a
   detrimental effect of supplier effort observability on the buyer
   profits. Finally, we show that more commitment expands the presence of
   asymmetric equilibria, enhancing dual sourcing, and the partial
   commitment strengthens the positive effect of competition on observable
   efforts while maintaining the detrimental effect of effort
   observability.

AB Many retailers have recently started to offer customers the option to
   buy online and pick up in store (BOPS). We study the impact of the BOPS
   initiative on store operations. We build a stylized model where a
   retailer operates both online and offline channels. Customers
   strategically make channel choices. The BOPS option affects customer
   choice in two ways: by providing real-time information about inventory
   availability and by reducing the hassle cost of shopping. We obtain
   three findings. First, not all products are well suited for in-store
   pickup; specifically, it may not be profitable to implement BOPS on
   products that sell well in stores. Second, BOPS enables retailers to
   reach new customers, but for existing customers, the shift from online
   fulfillment to store fulfillment may decrease profit margins when the
   latter is less cost effective. Finally, in a decentralized retail system
   where store and online channels are managed separately, BOPS revenue can
   be shared across channels to alleviate incentive conflicts; it is rarely
   efficient to allocate all the revenue to a single channel.

   Our analysis is motivated by theoretical models of decision making by

   investors face information signals of uncertain quality, they place a
   greater weight on the worst signal. We find strong empirical support for

AB We develop a parsimonious liquidity-adjusted downside capital asset
   pricing model to investigate whether phenomena such as downward
   liquidity spirals and flights to liquidity impact expected asset
   returns. We find strong empirical support for the model. Downside
   liquidity risk (sensitivity of stock liquidity to negative market
   returns) has an economically meaningful return premium that is 10 times
   larger than its symmetric analogue. The expected liquidity level and
   downside market risk are also associated with meaningful return
   premiums. Downside liquidity risk and its associated premium are higher
   during periods of low marketwide liquidity and for stocks that are
   relatively small, illiquid, volatile, and have high book-to-market
   ratios. These results are consistent with investors requiring
   compensation for holding assets susceptible to adverse liquidity
   phenomena. Our findings suggest that mitigation of downside liquidity
   risk can lower firms' cost of capital.

   provided by principles-based standards to manage earnings when firms are
   near bankruptcy, issuing equity, or experiencing high growth, and if
   earnings are near prominent earnings benchmarks. Overall, our evidence
   is consistent with managers using the discretion provided by
   principles-based standards to communicate better the economic substance
   of transactions, on average, but also with some managers using the added
   discretion strategically when managerial incentives exist to increase
   reported earnings.

   cognitive biases affecting decision making in situations characterized
   by random outcomes. In this paper, we study the effects and implications
   of overconfidence in a competitive newsvendor setting. In this context,
   overconfidence is defined as a cognitive bias in which decision makers
   behave as though the outcome of an uncertain event is less risky than it
   really is. This bias unequivocally leads to a lower expected profit for
   a newsvendor that does not compete on inventory availability.
   Nevertheless, it can be a positive force for competing newsvendors.
   Indeed, we find that when the product's profit margin is high,
   overconfidence can lead to a first-best outcome. In a similar vein, we
   also show that the more biased of two competing newsvendors is not
   necessarily destined to a smaller expected profit than its less biased

AB There is an increasing attention in information systems to be able to
   predict outcomes using search frequency on popular portals. This growing
   literature focuses on revealing demand patterns of individual assets
   (e.g., products, stocks, services). However, users typically search many
   different assets together (e.g., correlated searches) and leave a
   digital footprint, which can help provide insights on the behaviors of a
   group of assets. Furthermore, such group behavior can be used to predict
   outcomes (e.g., demand, stock returns) in the future. We analyze the
   underlying behavior of distinct subnetworks formed by correlated user
   searches for multiple items in the stock market and use such information
   for return prediction. Using cosearch data for stocks from Yahoo!
   Finance, we find 50-79 search clusters representing 230-349 stocks among
   Russell 3000 stocks at different time periods. These clusters reveal
   interesting habitats where the returns of stocks within a cluster tend
   to comove after controlling for known determinants of comovement. When a
   stock enters (departs) a cluster, the focal stock return comoves
   (detaches) with the cluster returns. Thus, search cluster-based habitats
   reveal aggregate investment preferences and are more granular than
   fundamental-based habitats. We find that search-based habitats can also
   improve return predictability of related stocks.

AB The prevalence and widespread usage of email has given businesses a
   direct and cost-effective way of providing consumers with targeted
   discount offers. While these discounts are expected to increase the
   demand for the promoted products, are they effective in increasing
   revenues? Do they have effects beyond acting as price reductions? We
   study these questions using individual-level data from 70 randomized
   experiments run by a large online ticket resale platform. We estimate
   the redemption rates of the offers and also measure the broader impact
   of emailed promotions by comparing purchases by individuals who received
   the experimental promotions with purchases by those who did not receive
   the offers because of the experimental randomization. We find that the
   offers cause the average expenditure to increase significantly, by $3.03
   ( a 37.2% increase) during the promotion window. However, the redemption
   rate of these offers is low. Importantly, 90% of these gains are not
   through redemption of the offers. The individuals who spent more on the
   platform in the past are more responsive to the offers, and the effect
   of the offers is significantly higher among individuals who did not
   transact on the platform in the year before the offer was given.
   Interestingly, the offer causes carryover to the week after the
   promotion expires; we find that spending increases by $ 1.55 in the week
   after the offer expires. Additionally, we find evidence for cross
   category spillovers to nonpromoted products: offers not applicable to a
   ticket genre cause an increase in spending in that genre. We conclude
   that emailed offers can serve as a form of "advertising" for the firm's
   products, in addition to being tools for price discrimination.

   creating a sequence of randomized field experiments that mitigates
   (many) potential endogeneity problems. Exploratory analysis of
   individual holdout experiments shows positive effects for both email and
   catalog; however, the estimated effect for any individual campaign is
   imprecise, because of the small size of the holdout. To pool data across
   campaigns, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for advertising
   response that allows us to account for individual differences in
   purchase propensity and marketing response. Building on the traditional
   ad- stock framework, we are able to estimate separate decay rates for
   each advertising medium, allowing us to predict channel-specific
   short-and long-term effects of advertising and use these predictions to
   inform marketing strategy. We find that catalogs have substantially
   longer-lasting impact on customer purchase than emails. We show how the
   model can be used to score and target individual customers based on
   their advertising responsiveness, and we find that targeting the most
   responsive customers increases the predicted returns on advertising by
   approximately 70% versus traditional recency, frequency, and monetary
   value-based targeting.

AB We study behavior-based pricing (BBP) in a vertically differentiated
   model. Vertical differentiation is innately asymmetric because all
   customers prefer the higher-quality product when prices are equal. This
   asymmetry causes BBP to have different properties than symmetric
   horizontally differentiated models. We highlight two dimensions that
   affect the analysis: the role of quality-adjusted cost differences
   between the firms and the role of consumer discounting relative to firm
   discounting. In the second period, consistent with the prior literature,
   we find that there are conditions based on market shares and
   quality-adjusted costs under which either the low-quality firm or the
   high-quality firm-but not both-will reward its current customers with
   lower prices than it charges to new customers. We then consider whether
   these conditions can arise in a two-period equilibrium. We find that if
   consumers sufficiently discount the future periods, then firms at enough
   of a competitive disadvantage will reward their customers: i.e., the
   low-quality firm will reward its current customers if the
   quality-adjusted cost differential between the two firms is small, while
   the high-quality firm will reward its current customers if this cost
   differential is large. Conversely, we find that if consumers do not
   discount the future very much, then the firm at a competitive
   disadvantage (i.e., a low-quality firm competing against a low-cost
   high-quality firm, or a high-quality firm that has very high costs) can
   earn greater profits with BBP than without BBP, although there are cases
   where both firms may benefit from BBP.

AB An important economic problem is that of finding optimal pricing
   mechanisms to sell a single item when there are a random number of
   buyers who arrive over time. In this paper, we combine ideas from
   auction theory and recent work on pricing with strategic consumers to
   derive the optimal continuous time pricing scheme in this situation.
   Under the assumption that buyers are split among those who have a high
   valuation and those who have a low valuation for the item, we obtain the
   price path that maximizes the seller's revenue. We conclude that,
   depending on the specific instance, it is optimal to either use a fixed
   price strategy or to use steep markdowns by the end of the selling
   season. As a complement to this optimality result, we prove that under a
   large family of price functions there is an equilibrium for the buyers.
   Finally, we derive an approach to tackle the case in which buyers'
   valuations follow a general distribution. The approach is based on
   optimal control theory and is well suited for numerical computations.

   exploit its representation structure and analyze the mechanisms driving

   is the key mechanism through which systemic influences affect the

AB There are over 90,000 patients in the United States waiting for a kidney
   transplant. Under the current allocation policy, the vast majority of
   deceased organs are allocated locally. This causes significant
   disparities in waiting times and access to transplant across different
   geographical areas. To ameliorate this inequity, we propose an
   operational solution that offers affordable jet services (OrganJet) to
   patients on the transplant waiting list, allowing them to list in
   multiple different, and possibly very distant, donation service areas
   (DSAs) of their choosing. First, using a fluid approximation, we
   formulate the patients' problem of choosing a location to multiple list
   as a selfish routing game in which each patient tries to minimize his
   "congestion cost," i.e., maximize his life expectancy. Through a
   combination of numerical, simulation, and analytical results, we show
   that multiple listing can lead to a significant improvement in
   geographic equity. In the special case when sufficiently many patients
   can multiple list, the geographic inequity disappears. Moreover, the
   supply of deceased donor organs increases under multiple listing,
   leading to more transplants and saved lives. We also consider a
   diffusion approximation and study the resulting multiple-listing game.
   The equilibrium outcome under the diffusion approximation is a
   second-order perturbation of that under the selfish routing formulation.
   In particular, the geographic equity metric, waiting times, and
   probabilities of receiving a transplant at various DSAs in equilibrium
   are second-order perturbations of those predicted by the selfish routing
   equilibrium. Hence, the analysis under the diffusion approximation also
   supports the finding that multiple listing leads to an improvement in
   geographic equity. In addition, restricting attention to the special
   case of sufficiently many patients multiple listing leads to an explicit
   characterization of the equilibria, which in turn yields additional
   structural insights. Last, we undertake a simulation study that supports
   aforementioned findings.

AB Companies that source from emerging economies often face supplier
   responsibility risks, namely, financial and reputational burdens that
   the companies have to bear when their suppliers' engagement in
   noncomplying labor and environmental practices becomes public. To
   mitigate such risks, companies can invest in screening mechanisms and
   design incentive schemes in sourcing contracts. Common mitigation
   instruments include supplier certification, process audits, and
   contingency payments. The interactions of these instruments are often
   not well understood. We first note that the effectiveness of any
   mitigation instrument depends on how it changes the economic trade-offs
   faced by a supplier in compliance to social and environmental standard,
   and hence we develop a model that explicitly captures such trade-offs.
   As a result, our model endogenizes the supplier's noncompliance
   probability and connects it with various factors, including the
   supplier's intrinsic ethical level that is unobservable to the buyer. We
   then study the buyer's optimal contracting problem under different
   mitigation instruments. We find that although the process audit and
   contingency payment instruments can directly lower supplier
   responsibility risk, they, acting alone, are not as effective as the
   supplier certification instrument in screening suppliers with different
   ethical levels. Nevertheless, these instruments are all complementary to
   each other; when used jointly, they make supplier screening more
   effective and result in lower sourcing cost. These findings provide
   explanations for some of the observed practices used in industry to
   mitigate supplier responsibility risks.

AB We study the effects of the introduction of cross-channel
   functionalities on the overall sales dispersion of retailers and the
   implications of these effects for inventory management. To do that, we
   analyze data from a leading U.S. retailer who introduced a
   "ship-to-store" (STS) functionality that allows customers to ship
   products to their local store free of charge when those products are not
   available in their local store. Based on the fact that stores prioritize
   carrying products for which local demand is high, we test the hypothesis
   that introducing the STS functionality increased the retailer's overall
   sales dispersion. We find that, on average, the contribution of the 90%
   lowest-selling products to total sales increased by 0.75 percentage
   points, increasing sales dispersion. Calibrating conventional
   inventory-ordering models, we show that to respond optimally to the
   observed increase in dispersion, the retailer would need to increase its
   cycle and safety inventories by approximately 2.7%. Our paper points out
   the effect of an increasingly important retail phenomenon (channel
   integration) on a key factor for inventory management (sales
   dispersion).

AB Face-to-face communication drastically increases cooperation rates in

   this communication gap. We distinguish three main categories. First,
   communication may decrease social distance. Second, communication may
   enable subjects to assess their opponent's cooperativeness ("type
   detection") and condition their own action on that information. Third,
   communication allows subjects to make promises, which create commitment
   for subjects who do not want to break a promise. We find that
   communication increases cooperation very substantially. In our
   experiment, we find that commitment value is an important factor, but
   the largest part of the increase can be attributed to type detection. We

AB Prior literature has documented that investor attention and constraints
   on that attention are associated with the pricing of stocks. We
   introduce the concept of attention comovement, which is the extent to
   which investor attention to a firm is explained by attention paid to the
   firm's industry and the market in general. We find that attention
   comovement is nontrivial for the average firm and is related to firm
   characteristics, such as size and visibility. We also find that the
   comovement of investor attention has market consequences, in that it is
   positively associated with excess stock return comovement. Finally, we
   show that a firm's earnings announcement contributes to the transfer of
   attention from one firm to its peer firms. Our results provide insights
   about the information flows underlying return comovement and aid in
   understanding the micro and macronature of investor attention.

AB Although people generally try to avoid lying, the lure of potential
   monetary payoffs often leads to unethical behavior. The current research
   investigates whether small monetary rewards for honesty help people
   resist the temptations of larger incentives or whether they backfire and
   lead to even more dishonesty. Four experiments address these issues.
   Experiment 1 shows that a $1 bonus led people to act more honestly when
   they could have lied to obtain $4; an identical bonus, however, did not
   increase dishonesty. Experiment 2 uses a different context and again
   shows that a $1 bonus led people to act more honestly; it also finds no
   evidence that this small payoff crowded out subsequent altruistic
   behavior. Experiment 3 shows that a $1 bonus increased people's honesty
   even when the payoffs for lying increased to $8, $12, and $16, but not
   when the payoff for lying increased to $20. Experiment 4 finds that
   smaller bonuses for honesty still had an impact, although it tended to
   be somewhat weaker. In addition, compared with no bonus, the combined
   effect of several small monetary bonuses (1 dollar, 75 cents, 50 cents,
   and 25 cents) marginally reduced lying.

AB We develop a continuum of stochastic dominance rules, covering

   motivation for such a continuum is that while decision makers have a
   preference for "more is better," they are mostly risk averse but cannot
   assert that they would dislike any risk. For example, situations with
   targets, aspiration levels, and local convexities in induced utility
   functions in sequential decision problems may lead to preferences for
   some risks. We relate our continuum of stochastic dominance rules to
   utility classes, the corresponding integral conditions, and probability
   transfers and discuss the usefulness of these interpretations. Several
   examples involving, e.g., finite-crossing cumulative distribution
   functions, location-scale families, and induced utility, illustrate the
   implementation of the framework developed here. Finally, we extend our

AB Although the adoption of new technology has received significant
   attention in management research, investigations of abandonment have
   lagged. In this study, we examine differences in the rates of
   abandonment of medical technologies based on whether abandonment occurs
   in response to the emergence of a superior technology or in light of new
   information questioning its efficacy. We link differences in responses
   to underlying differences in the missions and incentives of
   organizations. Examining coronary stents across three technological
   regime changes using a census of approximately two million patients
   admitted to Florida hospitals from 1995 to 2007, we show meaningful
   differences across three hospital types: for-profit, not-for-profit, and
   academic medical centers. Results show that for-profit hospitals abandon
   the earlier generation in favor of a superior technology faster than
   not-for-profit hospitals, but this is not the case if the efficacy of
   the technology is questioned. Academic medical centers, however, have
   the highest rates of abandonment under both triggers. Importantly, we
   find that organizational factors dominate physician differences as
   explanatory factors for abandonment. Implications of these findings are
   twofold. First, we identify the factors likely at play, i.e., the
   salience of norms of science and the corresponding trade-offs with
   economic benefits, when organizations make abandonment decisions.
   Second, our work underscores the importance of organizational mission,
   which dominates individual preferences in determining rates of
   abandonment.

AB We show that U.S. state-level employment nondiscrimination acts
   (ENDAs)-laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation
   and gender identity-spur innovation. We find a significant increase in
   patents and patent citations for firms head-quartered in states that
   have passed ENDAs relative to firms head-quartered in states that have
   not. This result is more pronounced for firms that previously have not
   implemented pro-gay nondiscrimination policies, for firms in states with
   a large homosexual population, and for firms in human capital-intensive
   industries. Lastly, we provide evidence suggesting that ENDAs affect
   innovation by matching employees, who are generally more creative than
   anti-gay employees, with innovative firms.

AB As public firms exploit their growth opportunities following their
   initial public offering, their assets in place increase, and they
   organize themselves optimally to operate these assets efficiently, which
   requires a more formal and less flexible organization than to generate
   new growth opportunities. Our theory predicts that, as a result of these
   inflexibilities, firms fail to fully replace their growth opportunities,
   so that their Tobin's q falls with age and they invest less as they grow
   older. With our theory, competition in the market for corporate control
   and capital markets monitoring increase the rate of decrease in Tobin's
   q, while product and labor market competition slow it down. We find
   empirical support for these predictions. We also find evidence that the
   decline in q is related to firm rigidities.

AB This paper studies whether and how the contractual horizon of venture
   capital funds affects their investments in innovative firms. I find that
   funds with a longer remaining horizon select younger companies at an
   earlier stage of their development, which grow their patent stock
   significantly more than companies financed by funds with a shorter
   horizon. The sensitivity of investment decisions to horizon is stronger
   among experienced venture capital firms, who allocate investments across
   a larger number of fund vintages. Finally, I find that the interaction
   of funds' fixed horizon with their option-like compensation structure
   affects their investment decisions: when early performance has been
   high, fund managers target less innovative companies. These findings
   shed light on the drivers of venture capital investment decisions and on
   their implications for the type of companies that receive venture
   capital financing.

AB We provide new evidence that the subjective "look of competence" rather
   than beauty is important for CEO selection and compensation. Our
   experiments, studying the facial traits of CEOs using nearly 2,000
   subjects, link facial characteristics to both CEO compensation and
   performance. In one experiment, we use pairs of photographs and find
   that subjects rate CEO faces as appearing more "competent" than non-CEO
   faces. Another experiment matches CEOs from large firms against CEOs
   from smaller firms and finds large-firm CEOs look more competent. In a
   third experiment, subjects numerically score the facial traits of CEOs.
   We find competent looks are priced into CEO compensation, more so than
   attractiveness. Our evidence suggests this premium has a behavioral
   origin. First, we find no evidence that the premium is associated with
   superior performance. Second, we separately analyze inside and outside
   CEO hires and find that the competence compensation premium is driven by
   outside hires-the situation where first impressions are likely to be
   more important.

   that executives believe they can better predict or influence the

   intentionally go bankrupt to avoid contributing their taxes. We link
   companies to each other through their shared resources, because some
   resources are the instigators of fraud. We introduce GOTCHA!, a new
   approach to define and extract features from a time-weighted network and
   to exploit and integrate network-based and intrinsic features in fraud
   detection. The GOTCHA! propagation algorithm diffuses fraud through the
   network, labeling the unknown and anticipating future fraud while
   simultaneously decaying the importance of past fraud. We find that
   domaindriven network variables have a significant impact on detecting
   past and future frauds and improve the baseline by detecting up to 55%
   additional fraudsters over time.

AB The selection of products and prices offered by a firm significantly
   impacts its profits. Existing approaches do not provide flexible models
   that capture the joint effect of assortment and price. We propose a
   nonparametric framework in which each customer is represented by a
   particular price threshold and a particular preference list over the
   alternatives. The customers follow a two-stage choice process; they
   consider the set of products with prices less than the threshold and
   choose the most preferred product from the set considered. We develop a
   tractable nonparametric expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to fit
   the model to the aggregate transaction data and design an efficient
   algorithm to determine the profit-maximizing combination of offer set
   and price. We also identify classes of pricing structures of increasing
   complexity, which determine the computational complexity of the
   estimation and decision problems. Our pricing structures are naturally
   expressed as business constraints, allowing a manager to trade off
   pricing flexibility with computational burden.

AB We use a detailed operational and clinical data set from a maternity
   hospital to investigate how workload affects decisions in
   gatekeeper-provider systems, where the servers act as gatekeepers to
   specialists but may also attempt to serve customers themselves, albeit
   with a probability of success that is decreasing in the complexity of
   the customers' needs. We study the effect of workload during a service
   episode on gatekeepers' service configuration decisions and the rate at
   which gatekeepers refer customers to a specialist. We find that
   gatekeeper-providers (midwives in our context) make substantial use of
   two levers to manage their workload (measured as patients per midwife):
   they ration resource-intensive discretionary services (epidural
   analgesia) for customers with noncomplex service needs (mothers with
   spontaneous onset of labor) and, at the same time, increase the rate of
   specialist referral (physician-led delivery) for customers with complex
   needs (mothers with pharmacologically induced labor). The workload
   effect in the study unit is surprisingly large and comparable in size to
   those for leading clinical risk factors: when workload increases from
   two standard deviations below to two standard deviations above the mean,
   noncomplex cases are 28.8% less likely to receive an epidural, leading
   to a cost reduction of 8.7%, while complex cases are 14.2% more likely
   to be referred for a physician-led delivery, leading to a cost increase
   of 2.6%. These observations are consistent with overtreatment at both
   high and low workload levels, albeit for different types of patients,
   and suggest that smoothing gatekeeper workload would reduce variability
   in customer service experience.

AB We demonstrate that widely used measures of antigay sentiment and the
   size of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population
   are misestimated, likely substantially. In a series of online
   experiments using a large and diverse but nonrepresentative sample, we
   compare estimates from the standard methodology of asking sensitive
   questions to measures from a "veiled" methodology that precludes
   inference about an individual but provides population estimates. The
   veiled method increased self-reports of antigay sentiment, particularly
   in the workplace: respondents were 67% more likely to disapprove of an
   openly gay manager when asked with a veil, and 71% more likely to say it
   should be legal to discriminate in hiring on the basis of sexual
   orientation. The veiled methodology also produces larger estimates of
   the fraction of the population that identifies as LGBT or has had a
   sexual experience with a member of the same sex. Self-reports of
   nonheterosexual identity rose by 65%, and same-sex sexual experiences by
   59%. We conduct a "placebo test" and show that for nonsensitive placebo
   items, the veiled methodology produces effects that are small in
   magnitude and not significantly different from zero in seven out of
   eight items. Taken together, the results suggest antigay discrimination
   might be a more significant issue than formerly considered, as the
   nonheterosexual population and antigay workplace-related sentiment are
   both larger than previously measured.

AB In 2008, the majority of U.S. airlines began charging for the second
   checked bag, and then for the first checked bag. One of the often cited
   reasons for this action by the airlines' executives was that this would
   influence customers to travel with less baggage and thus improve cost
   and operational performance. A popular customer belief, however, is that
   airline departure delays got worse due to an increase and size of
   customer carry-on baggage. A notable exception to the charging for
   checked bags trend was Southwest Airlines, which turned their resistance
   to this practice into a "Bags Fly Free" marketing campaign. Using a
   publicly available database of the airlines' departure performance, we
   investigate whether the implementation of checked bag fees was really
   associated with better operational performance metrics. At the aggregate
   level, using all publicly recorded U.S. flights from May 1, 2007, to May
   1, 2009, we find that the airlines that began charging for checked bags
   saw a significant relative improvement in their on-time departure
   performance in the time periods after the baggage fees were implemented.
   Surprisingly, we also find that airlines that did not charge for checked
   bags also saw an improvement, although not as big, when competing
   airlines flying the same origin-destination city markets implemented the
   fees. The improvement in on-time departure performance was the largest
   for flights during peak evening departure time blocks.

AB This paper has two objectives. First, we show how debt financing
   distorts a retailer's inventory decision when the retailer orders
   multiple items that differ in cost, revenue, or demand parameters.
   Taking advantage of limited liability, a debt-financed retailer favors
   items with a low salvage value, those with a high profit margin, and
   those that represent a large proportion of the total inventory
   investment. Second, we argue that this distortion is mitigated when the
   financing is provided by the supplier who can observe the actual order
   quantities before determining the credit terms. Borrowing goods rather
   than borrowing cash limits the retailer's ability to deviate from the
   first-best inventory decision. On the flip side, few suppliers can
   access capital at the same low cost as banks. We study a combination of
   bank and supplier financing that allows the retailer to get the best of
   both worlds.

AB We conduct three behavioral laboratory experiments to compare newsvendor
   order decisions placed directly to order decisions submitted in a
   decomposed way by soliciting point forecasts, uncertainty estimates, and
   service-level decisions. Decomposing order decisions in such a way often
   follows from organizational structure and can lead to performance
   improvements compared with ordering directly. However, we also
   demonstrate that if the critical ratio is below 50%, or if the
   underlying demand uncertainty is too high, task decomposition may not be
   preferred to direct ordering. Under such conditions, decision makers are
   prone to set service levels too high or to suffer from excessive random
   judgment error, which reduces the efficacy of task decomposition. We
   further demonstrate that if accompanied by decision support in the form
   of suggested quantities, task decomposition becomes the
   better-performing approach to newsvendor decision making more generally.
   Decision support and task decomposition therefore appear as
   complementary methods to improve decision performance in the newsvendor

   effects of random assignment to classroom leadership positions in a

   scores, increases students' political popularity in the classroom, makes
   students more likely to take initiative, and shapes students' beliefs
   about the determinants of success. The results suggest that leadership
   service may impact human capital and is not solely a signal of

   from the lower to upper quartile of managerial ability is associated
   with a 3.15% (2.50%) reduction in a firm's one-year (five-year) cash
   effective tax rate. We examine how higher-ability managers reduce income
   tax payments and find that they engage in greater state tax planning
   activities, shift more income to foreign tax havens, make more research
   and development credit claims, and make greater investments in assets
   that generate accelerated depreciation deductions. Identifying a manager
   characteristic related to firms' tax policy decisions adds to our
   understanding of the factors that explain the substantial variation in

AB Firms' innovative activities can be sensitive to public policies that
   affect the availability of capital. In this paper, we investigate the
   effects of regional and temporal variation in U.S. personal bankruptcy
   laws on firms' innovative activities. We find that bankruptcy laws that
   provide stronger debtor protection decrease the number of patents
   produced by small firms. Stronger debtor protection also decreases the
   average quality, and variance in quality, of firms' patents. We find
   evidence that the negative effect of stronger debtor protection on
   experimentation and innovation may be due to the decreased availability
   of external financing in response to stronger debtor rights, an effect
   amplified in industries with a high dependence on external financing.
   Hence, while it is typically assumed that stronger debtor protection
   encourages innovation by reducing the cost of failure for innovators, we
   show that it can instead dampen innovative activities by tightening the
   availability of external financing to innovative firms.

AB We consider a contracting problem in which a principal hires an agent to
   manage a risky project. When the agent chooses volatility components of
   the output process and the principal observes the output continuously,
   the principal can compute the quadratic variation of the output, but not
   the individual components. This leads to moral hazard with respect to
   the risk choices of the agent. To find the optimal contract, we develop
   a novel approach to solving principal-agent problems: first, we identify
   a family of admissible contracts for which the optimal agent's action is
   explicitly characterized; then, we show that we do not lose on
   generality when finding the optimal contract inside this family, up to
   integrability conditions. To do this, we use the recent theory of
   singular changes of measures for Ito processes. We solve the problem in
   the case of CARA preferences and show that the optimal contract is
   linear in these factors: the contractible sources of risk, including the
   output, the quadratic variation of the output and the cross-variations
   between the output and the contractible risk sources. Thus, like sample
   Sharpe ratios used in practice, path-dependent contracts naturally arise
   when there is moral hazard with respect to risk management. In a
   numerical example, we show that the loss of efficiency can be
   significant if the principal does not use the quadratic variation
   component of the optimal contract.

   Rev. Financial Stud. 22(5): 1915-1953] showed that in the stock market,
   it is difficult for an optimized portfolio constructed using
   mean-variance analysis to outperform a simple, equally weighted
   portfolio because of estimation error. In this paper, we demonstrate
   that portfolio optimization can be made to work in currency markets. The
   key difference between the two settings is that in currency markets
   interest rates provide a predictor of future returns that is free of
   estimation error, which permits the application of mean-variance
   analysis. We show that over the last 26 years, a mean-variance efficient
   portfolio constructed in this fashion has a Sharpe ratio of 0.91, versus
   only 0.15 for the equally weighted portfolio. We also consider the

AB This paper investigates the information in corporate credit ratings. If
   ratings are to be informative indicators of credit risk, they must
   reflect what a risk-averse investor cares about: both raw default
   probability and systematic risk. We find that ratings are relatively
   inaccurate measures of raw default probability-they are dominated as
   predictors of failure by a simple model based on publicly available
   financial information. However, ratings do contain relevant information
   since they are related to a measure of exposure to common (and
   undiversifiable) variation in default probability ("failure beta").
   Systematic risk is shown to be related to joint default probabilities in
   the context of the Merton [ Merton RC (1974) On the pricing of corporate
   debt: The risk structure of interest rates. J. Finance 29(2):449-470]
   model. Empirically, it is related to credit default swap spreads and
   risk premia. Given the multidimensional nature of credit risk, it is not
   possible for one measure to capture all the relevant information.

AB Social media platform owners often choose to provide tighter integration
   with their own complementary applications (i.e., first-party
   applications) as compared to that with other complementary third-party
   applications. We study the impact of such integration on consumer demand
   for first-party applications and competing third-party applications by
   exploring Facebook's integration of Instagram, an application in its
   photo-sharing application ecosystem. We find that consumers obtain
   additional value from Instagram after its integration with Facebook,
   leading to a large increase in the use of Instagram for Facebook photo
   sharing. Further, we find that the growth of Instagram's user base has a
   positive spillover effect on big third-party applications and a negative
   spillover effect on small third-party applications in Facebook's
   photo-sharing ecosystem. As a result, while small third-party
   applications face reduced demand after integration, big third-party
   applications experience a small increase in demand. Thus, the overall
   demand for the entire photo-sharing application ecosystem actually
   increases, which suggests that Facebook's integration strategy benefits
   the complementary market overall. Our results highlight the role of
   platform integration for first-party applications and the application
   ecosystem overall, and they have implications for strategic management
   of first-party applications in the presence of third-party applications.

AB A robust finding in the escalation literature, termed as the preference
   effect, is that involvement in the period 1 initial project assessment
   decision increases the tendency for decision makers to stick with a
   losing course of action during the period 2 project reassessment
   decision. The proposed solution is to bring in a new decision maker in
   period 2. Across multiple studies, we show that providing period 1
   information in real options format increases the tendency for decision
   makers to view period 2 focal event information as both more negative
   and more important. Consequently, such decision makers exhibit less
   escalation in period 2, i.e., exhibit behavior opposite to the
   preference effect. This suggests that, in real option contexts, not only
   do we not need to bring in a new decision maker, but also
   (counterintuitively) it is beneficial to retain the same decision maker
   in situations where escalation is likely to occur.

AB In this study, we focus on measuring the efficiency of category-level
   sales response to promotions across various categories and stores. Our
   heterogeneous stochastic frontier model allows us to attribute portions
   of this efficiency to specific characteristics of the stores and
   categories. Using our full PEM (promotional efficiency frontier) model,
   we analyze the efficiency of 20 frequently bought categories of a
   supermarket retailer and apply it to store-category-level data. We find
   that the average efficiency of category and store sales response across
   all categories and stores is 84.34%, with low values in categories such
   as spreads and fresh seafood and high values in categories such as
   frozen entrees and meat. We find that the variation in efficiency of
   this sales response can be attributed to specific store and category
   characteristics such as selling area of store, distance to competition,
   number of stock-keeping units in the category, and average interpurchase
   time. Unobserved heterogeneity is captured by the latent class approach
   that provides support for the existence of three segments. An
   understanding of the roles played by these characteristics in the
   efficiency of sales response can aid managers in devising a strategy
   that maximizes sales.

AB Price-matching guarantees (PMGs) are offered in a wide array of product
   categories in retail markets. PMGs offer consumers the assurance that,
   should they find a lower price elsewhere within a specified period after
   purchase the retailer will match that price and refund the price
   difference. The goal of this study is to explain the following stylized
   facts: (1) many retailers that operate both online and offline implement
   PMG offline but not online; (2) the practices of PMG vary considerably
   across retail categories; and (3) some retailers launch specialized
   websites that automatically check competitors' prices for consumers
   after purchase. To this end, we build a sequential search model that
   endogenizes consumers' pre- and postpurchase search decisions. We find
   that PMG expands retail demand but intensifies price competition on two
   dimensions. PMG drives retailers to offer deeper promotions because it
   increases the overall extent of consumer search, which we call the
   primary competition-intensifying effect. We also find a new secondary
   competition-intensifying effect, which results from endogenous consumer
   search. As deeper promotions incentivize consumers to continue price
   search, retailers are forced to lower the "regular" price to deter
   consumers from searching. The strength of the secondary
   competition-intensifying effect increases with the ratio of product
   valuation to search cost, which explains the variation in PMG practices
   online versus offline and across retail categories. We show that an
   asymmetric equilibrium exists such that one retailer offers PMG while
   the other does not. In this equilibrium, the PMG retailer may benefit
   from launching a price check website to facilitate consumers'
   postpurchase search.

AB We study how to optimally attract new customers using a referral

   to share with friends, and every purchase coming through that link
   generates a referral payment. The firm chooses the referral payment
   function and consumers play an equilibrium in response. The optimal
   payment function is nonlinear and not necessarily monotonic in the
   number of successful referrals. If we approximate the optimal policy
   using a linear payment function, the approximation loss scales with the
   square root of the average consumer degree. Using a threshold payment,
   the approximation loss scales proportionally to the average consumer
   degree. Combining the two, using a linear payment function with a

   initiation as a between-stage adaptive response mechanism that occurs
   when an upstream stage initiates tasks that are normally handled by a
   downstream stage. We show that having some diagnostic tests ordered
   during the triage process reduces treatment time by 20 minutes, on
   average. However, ordering too many tests at triage can lead to an
   increase in the total number of tests performed on the patient. We also

   delays for tasks such as medication delivery, and rushing as nurses
   spend less time with their patients when the queue length is high.

   spanning three years in which thousands of forecasters predicted the
   outcomes of hundreds of events. We sought to apply insights from
   research to structure the questions, interactions, and elicitations to
   improve forecasts. Indeed, forecasters' confidence roughly matched their
   accuracy. As information came in, accuracy increased. Confidence
   increased at approximately the same rate as accuracy, and good
   calibration persisted. Nevertheless, there was evidence of a small
   amount of overconfidence (3%), especially on the most confident
   forecasts. Training helped reduce overconfidence, and team collaboration
   improved forecast accuracy. Together, teams and training reduced
   overconfidence to 1%. Our results provide reason for tempered optimism
   regarding confidence calibration and its development over time in

AB During the 2000s, over a dozen U.S. states passed laws that prohibit
   healthcare employers from mandating overtime for nurses. Using a
   nationwide panel data set from 2004 to 2012, we find that these
   mandatory overtime laws reduced the service quality of nursing homes, as
   measured by an increase in deficiency citations. This outcome can be
   explained by two undesirable changes in the staffing hours of registered
   nurses: decreased hours of permanent nurses and increased hours of
   contract nurses per resident day. We observe that the increase in
   deficiency citations concentrates in the domains of administration and
   quality of care rather than quality of life, and the severity levels of
   the increased citations tend to be minor rather than major. We also find
   that the laws' negative effect on quality is more severe in nursing
   homes with higher percentages of Medicare-covered residents. These
   observations are consistent with the predictions of a stochastic
   staffing model that incorporates demand uncertainty and operational
   flexibility. Furthermore, we rule out an alternative hypothesis that the
   quality decline is induced by an increase in nurse wages.

AB Amonopolist offers a product to a market of consumers with heterogeneous

   quality, they learn by observing past purchase decisions and reviews of
   other consumers. Our goal is to analyze the social learning mechanism
   and its effect on the seller's pricing decision. Consumers follow an
   intuitive, non-Bayesian decision rule. Under conditions that we
   identify, we show that consumers eventually learn the product's quality.
   We show how the learning trajectory can be approximated in settings with
   high demand intensity via a mean-field approximation that highlights the
   dynamics of this learning process, its dependence on the price, and the
   market heterogeneity with respect to quality preferences. Two pricing
   policies are studied: a static price and one with a single price change.
   Finally, numerical experiments suggest that pricing policies that
   account for social learning may increase revenues considerably relative
   to policies that do not.

AB Most operations models assume individuals make decisions based on a
   perfect understanding of random variables or stochastic processes. In
   reality, however, individuals are subject to cognitive limitations and
   make systematic errors. We leverage established psychology on sample
   naivete to model individuals' forecasting errors and biases in a way
   that is portable to operations models. The model has one behavioral
   parameter and embeds perfect rationality as a special case. We use the
   model to mathematically characterize point and error forecast behavior,
   reflecting an individual's beliefs about the mean and variance of a
   random variable. We then derive 10 behavioral phenomena that are
   inconsistent with perfect rationality assumptions but supported by
   existing empirical evidence. Finally, we apply the model to two
   operations settings, inventory management and queuing, to illustrate the
   model's portability and discuss its numerous predictions. For inventory
   management, we characterize order decisions assuming behavioral demand
   forecasting. The model predicts that even under automated cost
   optimization, one should expect a pull-to-center effect. It also
   predicts that this effect can be mitigated by separating point
   forecasting from error forecasting. For base stock models, it predicts
   that safety stocks are too small (large) for short (long) lead times. We
   also express the steady-state behavior of a queue with balking, assuming

AB A large auditing literature concludes that Big N auditors provide higher
   audit quality than non-Big N auditors. Recently, however, a high-profile
   study suggests that propensity score matching (PSM) on client
   characteristics eliminates the Big N effect [Lawrence A, Minutti-Meza M,
   Zhang P (2011) Can Big 4 versus non-Big 4 differences in audit-quality
   proxies be attributed to client characteristics? Accounting Rev.
   86(1):259-286]. We conjecture that this finding may be affected by PSM's
   sensitivity to its design choices and/or by the validity of the audit
   quality measures used in the analysis. To investigate, we examine random
   combinations of PSM design choices that achieve covariate balance, and
   four commonly used audit quality measures. We find that the majority of
   these design choices support a Big N effect for most of the audit
   quality measures. Overall, our findings show that it is premature to
   suggest that PSM eliminates the Big N effect.

AB In this study, we examine the role of restructuring charges in the
   existence and subsequent weakening of the widely documented accrual
   anomaly. We find that prior to 2003, the significant positive abnormal
   hedge returns experienced by accrual based strategies were influenced by
   a subset of firms with high restructuring charges. After 2003, with the
   introduction of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146
   changing the accounting for restructuring charges, restructuring firms
   no longer experience significant abnormal returns, thereby weakening the
   accrual anomaly. Our results suggest that the regulatory changes have
   had an effect on impairing the role of restructuring charges in the
   accrual anomaly by improving the market's ability to correctly assess
   the valuation implications of restructuring charges in the low accruals
   portfolios.

AB We estimate and compare the effect of increased time costs on consumer
   satisfaction and behavior. We are able to move beyond the existing
   literature, which focuses on satisfaction and intention, and estimate
   the effect of waiting time on return behavior. Further, we do so in a
   prosocial context and our measure of cost is the length of time a blood
   donor spends waiting. We find that relying on satisfaction data masks
   important time cost sensitivities; namely, it is not how the donor feels
   about the wait time that matters for return behavior, but rather the
   actual duration of the wait. Consistent with theory we develop, our
   results indicate that waiting has a significant longer-term social cost:
   we estimate that a 38% increase (equivalent to one standard deviation)
   in the average wait would result in a 10% decrease in donations per
   year.

   field and compared workers' productivity under no unemployment benefits
   to productivity under two different unemployment schemes. In one scheme,
   the unemployed received an unconditional monetary transfer. In the
   other, the monetary transfer was obtained conditional on the unemployed
   spending some time on an ancillary activity. Our results challenge the
   standard economic theory prediction that unemployment benefits,
   especially unconditional compensations, hinder workers' effort. We find
   that workers employed under the unconditional scheme are more productive
   than workers under the conditional one, and both schemes make workers
   more productive than having no unemployment benefit. We discuss two
   possible explanations for our results based on reciprocity and
   differential psychological costs of unemployment across unemployment
   benefit schemes.

   hairdresser pointed out the opportunity to donate. Our data indicate
   that the voluntary activity of collecting donations in the salon led to
   greater tips for the hairdresser and significant donations. In the
   second treatment, the hairdresser unconditionally donated to the charity
   before the customers could. This donation did not increase tips further
   compared with the collection-only treatment. Our data indicate that
   indirect reciprocity works in the field. We find evidence that indirect

AB The consequences of many economic decisions materialize only in the
   future. To make informed choices in such decision problems, consumers
   need to anticipate the likelihood of future states of the world, the
   state dependence of their preferences, and the choice alternatives that
   may become relevant. This complex task may expose consumers to
   psychological biases like extrapolative expectations, projection bias,
   or salience. We test whether customers are affected by such biases when
   they buy advance tickets for an outdoor movie theater, a real-world
   situation that, because of the availability of reliable weather
   forecasts, closely resembles a stylized decision problem under risk. We
   find that customers' decisions are heavily influenced by the weather at
   the time of purchase, even though the latter is irrelevant for the
   experience of visiting the theater in the future. The empirical evidence
   cannot be fully explained by a range of candidate rational explanations,
   but is consistent with the presence of the aforementioned psychological
   mechanisms.

   returns. An investment strategy that takes a long position in stocks in
   the highest conditional beta decile and a short position in stocks in
   the lowest conditional beta decile produces average returns and alphas
   in the range of 0.60%-0.80% per month. We provide an investor
   attention-based explanation of this finding. We show that stocks with
   high conditional beta have strong attention-grabbing characteristics,
   leading to a higher fraction of buyer-initiated trades for these stocks.
   We also find that stocks recently bought perform significantly better
   than stocks recently sold. Hence, the high beta stocks that investors
   are more likely to buy have higher expected returns than the low beta
   stocks that investors are more likely to sell.

AB This paper develops a new theory of the capital structure of
   parent-subsidiary organizations based on legal-system arbitrage: the
   capital structure of parent-subsidiary organizations is chosen to
   minimize the agency costs generated by selective renegotiation of claims
   written on the component legal entities. We show that optimal mixes of
   parent-subsidiary-level financing minimize the default premia associated
   with the organization's overall financing package by equating the
   marginal enforceability of debt contracts written at the parent and
   subsidiary levels. The enforceability of creditor claims depends not
   only on the legal regime but also on the size of the debt claims and the
   liquidation value of the firm's assets. Small claims written under a
   weak creditor rights regime may be more enforceable than large claims
   written under a regime with strong creditor protection. Thus, all
   optimal mixes involve some borrowing at the subsidiary level even if the
   subsidiary legal regime features weaker creditor protection than the
   parent regime. However, the mix between parent and subsidiary financing
   tilts toward the regime that features stronger creditor protection.

   return spreads based on book-to-market, momentum, asset growth, net
   share issues, accrual, and price-to-earnings ratio. Only one of the two
   macro-based measures can explain a sizable portion of the value premium
   over the longer 1930-2012 period. We also find that the IST risk premium
   estimates are sensitive to the sample period, the data frequency, the
   test assets, and the econometric model specification. Impulse responses
   of aggregate investment and consumption indicate potential measurement
   problems in IST proxies, which may contribute to the sensitivity of IST

   may obtain a higher revenue by hiding the item's common-value

AB This paper investigates why audiences devalue organizations that behave
   inauthentically. One explanation is that inauthenticity leads to lower
   perceptions of product quality. This stems from the audience's doubt of
   an inauthentic actor's capability and commitment to produce high-quality
   goods. Another explanation is that audiences discount the symbolic
   value-or what the object represents-of products from inauthentic
   organizations. I empirically test each of these mechanisms in the craft
   beer industry. First, I exploit exogenous variation in consumers'
   knowledge of craft brewers' inauthentic identity (whether they are owned
   by a corporate brewer) to empirically demonstrate an inauthenticity
   discount. Next, I decompose audience evaluations to show that knowledge
   of a producer's inauthenticity does not have a statistically significant
   impact on evaluators' sensory experience of the product-its taste,
   smell, appearance, or mouthfeel-but that it does affect audience
   evaluations of the product's symbolic value.

AB Network externality arises when the utility of a product depends not
   only on its attributes but also on the number of consumers who purchase
   the same product. In this paper, we study consumer choice models that
   endogenize such network externality. We first characterize the choice
   probabilities under such models and conduct studies on comparative
   statics. Then we investigate the assortment optimization problem under
   such choice models. Although the problem is generally NP-hard, we show
   that a new class of assortments, called quasi-revenue-ordered
   assortments, which consist of a revenue-ordered assortment plus at most
   one additional item, are optimal under mild conditions. We also propose
   an iterative estimation method to calibrate such choice models, for both
   uncensored and censored data cases. An empirical study on a mobile game
   data set shows that our proposed model can provide better fits for the
   data, increase the prediction accuracy for consumer choices, and
   potentially increase revenue.

AB We obtain a closed-form solution for pricing European options under a
   general jump-diffusion model that can incorporate arbitrary discrete
   jump-size distributions, including nonparametric distributions such as
   an empirical distribution. The flexibility in the jump-size distribution
   allows the model to better capture leptokurtic features found in
   real-world data. The model uses a discrete-time framework and leads to a
   pricing formula that is provably convergent to the continuous-time price
   as the discretization is increased. The solution is easy to implement
   with fast convergence properties. Numerical results illustrate the
   efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model and highlight its
   robustness and flexibility.

AB Patients nationwide experience difficulties in accessing medical care in
   a timely manner due to long backlogs of appointments. Medical practices
   aim to utilize their valuable resources efficiently, deliver timely
   access to care, and at the same time they strive to provide short
   waiting times for patients present at the medical facility. We address
   the joint problem of determining the panel size of a medical practice
   and the number of offered appointment slots per day, so that patients do
   not face long backlogs and the clinic is not overcrowded. We explicitly
   model the two time scales involved in accessing medical care:
   appointment delay (order of days, weeks) and clinic delay (order of
   minutes, hours). Closed-form expressions are derived for the performance
   measures of interest based on diffusion approximations. Our model
   captures many features of the complex reality of outpatient care,
   including patient no-shows, balking behavior, and random service times.
   Our analysis provides theoretical and numerical support for the
   optimality of an "open access" policy in outpatient scheduling when we
   account for both types of delay, and it demonstrates the importance of
   considering panel sizing and scheduling decisions in a joint framework.

AB This natural field experiment tests the effects of purely symbolic
   awards on volunteer retention in a public goods context. The experiment
   is conducted at Wikipedia, which faces declining editor retention rates,
   particularly among newcomers. Randomization assures that award receipt
   is orthogonal to previous performance. The analysis reveals that awards
   have a sizeable effect on newcomer retention, which persists over the
   four quarters following the initial intervention. This is noteworthy for
   indicating that awards for volunteers can be effective even if they have
   no impact on the volunteers' future career opportunities. The awards are
   purely symbolic, and the status increment they produce is limited to the
   recipients' pseudonymous online identities in a community they have just
   recently joined. The results can be explained by enhanced
   self-identification with the community, but they are also in line with
   recent findings on the role of status and reputation, recognition, and
   evaluation potential in online communities.

AB We develop a rational expectations model in which an issuer purchases
   credit ratings sequentially, deciding which to disclose to investors.
   Opacity about contacts between the issuer and rating agencies induces
   potential asymmetric information about which ratings the issuer
   obtained. While the equilibrium forces disclosure of ratings when the
   market knows these have been generated, endogenous uncertainty about
   whether there are undisclosed ratings can arise and lead to selective
   disclosure and rating bias. Although investors account for this bias in
   pricing, selective disclosure makes ratings noisier signals of project
   value, leading to inefficient investment decisions. Our paper suggests
   that regulatory disclosure requirements are welfare enhancing.

AB We present evidence that intrinsic demand for information about the
   future is increasing in expected future consumption utility. In the
   first experiment, subjects may resolve a lottery now or later. The
   information is useless for decision making, but the larger the reward,
   the more likely subjects are to pay to resolve the lottery early. In the
   second experiment, subjects may pay to avoid being tested for herpes
   simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and the more highly feared type 2 (HSV-2).
   Subjects are three times more likely to avoid testing for HSV-2,
   suggesting that more aversive outcomes lead to more information
   avoidance. In a third experiment, subjects make choices about when to
   get tested for a fictional disease. Some subjects behave in a way
   consistent with expected utility theory, and others exhibit greater
   delay of information for more severe diseases. We also find that
   information choice is correlated with positive affect, ambiguity
   aversion, and time preference, as some theories predict.

   natural field experiment, we study a minimally invasive change in the
   communication of a well-established incentive scheme-a reminder
   regarding the piece rate at the beginning of the shift. The experiment
   was conducted in a large firm where experienced managers work in a team
   production setting and where incentives for both quantity and quality of
   output are provided. While the treatment conveyed no additional material
   information and left the incentive system unchanged, it had significant
   positive effects on quantity and on managers' compensation. These
   effects are economically sizable and robust to alternative empirical
   specifications. We consider various potential mechanisms, but our
   preferred explanation is that the treatment raised the salience of
   incentives.

AB Implicit contracts can mitigate moral hazard in labor, credit, and
   product markets. The enforcement mechanism underlying an implicit
   contract is the threat of exclusion: the agent fears that he will lose
   future income if the principal breaks off the relationship. This threat
   may be very weak in environments where an agent can appropriate
   income-generating resources provided by the principal. For example, in
   credit markets with weak creditor protection, borrowers may be able to
   appropriate borrowed funds and generate investment income without
   requiring further loans. We examine implicit contracting in a lending
   experiment where the threat of exclusion is exogenously varied. We find
   that weak exclusion undermines implicit contracting: it leads to a more
   frequent breakdown of credit relationships as well as to smaller loans.

AB This paper proposes a new regulatory approach that implements capital

   excessive risk taking in the financial sector originates from the
   shareholder moral hazard created by government guarantees rather than
   from corporate governance failures within banks. The idea behind the
   proposed regulatory approach is thus that the more the compensation
   structure decouples the interests of bank managers from those of
   shareholders by curbing risk-taking incentives, the higher the leverage
   the bank is permitted to take on. Consequently, the risk-shifting
   incentives caused by government guarantees and the risk-mitigating
   incentives created by the compensation structure offset each other such
   that the manager chooses the socially efficient investment policy.

AB It is widely documented that managers strive to maintain smooth
   dividends. Yet, it is not clear if this behavior reflects investors'
   preferences. In this paper, we study whether investors indeed value
   dividend-smoothing stocks differently by exploring the implications of
   dividend smoothing for firms' investor clientele, stock prices, and cost
   of capital. We find that retail investors are less likely to hold
   dividend-smoothing stocks, while institutional investors, and especially
   mutual funds, are more likely. However, this preference does not result
   in any detectable relation between the smoothness of a firm's dividends
   and the expected return, or market value, of its stock. Together, the
   evidence suggests that firms adjust the supply of smoothed dividends to
   match investors' demand. Dividend smoothing affects the composition of a
   firm's shareholders but has little impact on its stock price.

AB Online peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending) has emerged as an appealing
   new channel of financing in recent years. A fundamental but largely
   unanswered question in this nascent industry is the choice of market
   mechanisms, i.e., how the supply and demand of funds are matched, and
   the terms (price) at which transactions will occur. Two of the most
   popular mechanisms are auctions (where the "crowd" determines the price
   of the transaction through an auction process) and posted prices (where
   the platform determines the price). While P2P lending platforms
   typically use one or the other, there is little systematic research on
   the implications of such choices for market participants, transaction
   outcomes, and social welfare. We address this question both
   theoretically and empirically. We first develop a game-theoretic model
   that yields empirically testable hypotheses, taking into account the
   incentive of the platform. We then test these hypotheses by exploiting a
   regime change from auctions to posted prices on one of the largest P2P
   lending platforms. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that under
   platform-mandated posted prices, loans are funded with higher
   probability, but the preset interest rates are higher than borrowers'
   starting interest rates and contract interest rates in auctions. More
   important, all else equal, loans funded under posted prices are more
   likely to default, thereby undermining lenders' returns on investment
   and their surplus. Although platform-mandated posted prices may be
   faster in originating loans, auctions that rely on the crowd to discover
   prices are not necessarily inferior in terms of overall social welfare.

   seven sets of studies demonstrating strong framing effects on the

   voluntary behavior are preferred when they are framed as advantaging
   those who act desirably (rather than disadvantaging those who do not).
   Conversely, policies targeting obligations are preferred when they are
   framed as disadvantaging those who fail to act desirably (rather than
   advantaging those who do). These differences in policy acceptance do not
   result from common causes of framing effects, such as a misunderstanding
   of outcomes or insufficient deliberation about the implications. Rather,
   the framing effects we document follow from beliefs about when
   punishment is and is not appropriate. We conclude with a field

AB This paper proposes a novel account of impatience: People pay more
   attention to the opportunity costs of choosing larger, later rewards
   than to the opportunity costs of choosing smaller, sooner ones. Eight
   studies show that when the opportunity costs of choosing smaller, sooner
   rewards are subtly highlighted, people become more patient, whereas when
   the opportunity costs of choosing larger, later rewards are highlighted
   this has no effect. This pattern is robust to variations in the choice
   task, to the participant population, and to whether the choices are
   incentivized or hypothetical. We argue that people are naturally aware
   of the opportunity costs of delayed rewards but pay less attention to
   those associated with smaller, sooner ones. We conclude by discussing
   implications for theory and policy.

AB We propose that an important determinant of judged confidence is the
   evaluation of evidence that is unknown or missing, and overconfidence is
   often driven by the neglect of unknowns. We contrast this account with
   prior research suggesting that overconfidence is due to biased
   processing of known evidence in favor of a focal hypothesis. In Study 1,
   we asked participants to list their thoughts as they answered
   two-alternative forced-choice trivia questions and judged the
   probability that their answers were correct. Participants who thought
   more about unknowns were less overconfident. In Studies 2 and 3, we
   asked participants to list unknowns before assessing their confidence.
   "Considering the unknowns" reduced overconfidence substantially and was
   more effective than the classic "consider the alternative" debiasing
   technique. Moreover, considering the unknowns selectively reduced
   confidence in domains where participants were overconfident but did not
   affect confidence in domains where participants were well-calibrated or
   underconfident.

AB When a firm introduces a product with new features, some consumers may
   find it difficult to assess their valuations for these new attributes.
   Their purchase decisions made under such uncertainty may lead to
   postpurchase regret. It has been experimentally shown that consumers may
   anticipate their potential postpurchase regret and make their current
   choices to mitigate or minimize it. That is, a consumer's anticipated
   regret can significantly impact his purchase decision. Given the trend
   that firms in various markets invoke regret to stimulate sales, this
   paper analytically explores whether and how anticipated regret affects
   competing firms' profits and product innovation. Our analyses reveal
   that the presence of anticipated regret can increase or decrease firms'
   profits, and foster or hinder product innovation depending on whether it
   makes the consumer segments more or less polarized; in other words,
   anticipated regret has a nonmonotonic effect on firms' profits and the
   entrant's optimal quality. Therefore, anticipated regret may sometimes
   create a win-win or a lose-lose situation for both firms. Regardless of
   whether the impact of anticipated regret on firms' profits is positive
   or negative, the magnitude of that impact tends to be higher for the
   low-quality firm.

AB In a name-your-own-price (NYOP) auction, consumers bid for a product or
   service. If a bid exceeds the concealed threshold price, the consumer
   receives the product at her bid price. This paper examines how to
   optimize the interactions between the NYOP retailer and service
   providers, while, at the same time, managing the bid acceptance rates in
   order to induce the desired consumer bidding behavior. Channel profit is
   impacted by how the retailer decides whether or not a given consumer bid
   will be accepted and, if so, which service provider is chosen to supply
   a unit of the product to the consumer. We devise a mechanism, the
   modified second-price auction, which maximizes channel profit.

AB We propose a structural model of consumer sequential search under
   uncertainty about attribute levels of products. Our identification of
   the search model relies on exclusion restriction variables that separate
   consumer utility and search cost. Because such exclusion restrictions
   are often available in online click-stream data, the identification and
   corresponding estimation strategy is generalizable for many online
   shopping websites where such data can be easily collected. Furthermore,
   one important feature of online search technology is that it gives
   consumers the ability to refine search results using tools such as
   sorting and filtering based on product attributes. The proposed model
   can integrate consumers' decisions of search and refinement. The model
   is instantiated using consumer click-stream data of online hotel
   bookings provided by a travel website. The results show that refinement
   tools have significant effects on consumer behavior and market
   structure. We find that the refinement tools encourage 33% more searches
   and enhance the utility of purchased products by 17%. Most websites by
   default rank search results according to their popularity, quality, or
   relevance to consumers (e.g., Google). When consumers are unaware of
   such default ranking rules, they may engage in disproportionately more
   searches using refinement tools. Consequently, overall consumer surplus
   may deteriorate when total search cost outweighs the enhanced utility.
   In contrast, if the website simply informs consumers that the default
   ranking already reflects product popularity, quality, or relevance,
   consumers search less and their surplus improves. We also find that
   refinement tools lead to a less concentrated market structure.

AB We study a supply chain comprised of a retailer who sources a product
   from a manufacturer. The retailer has superior forecast information
   about market demand, and the manufacturer builds the capacity and sets
   the wholesale price prior to demand realization. We explore forecast
   information sharing between the retailer and the manufacturer by means
   of cheap talk. We show that meaningful forecast information can be
   shared truthfully only before the manufacturer sets both the capacity
   and the wholesale price. By sharing the demand forecast with the
   manufacturer, the retailer faces the tradeoffs between inflating the
   forecast to convince the manufacturer to increase capacity and deflating
   the forecast to persuade the manufacturer to offer a lower wholesale
   price. When the value of forecast information sharing is high, the
   trade-offs are balanced, and incentives are aligned, leading to truthful
   information sharing. Moreover, we find that larger demand uncertainty
   can promote credible information sharing and, surprisingly, can benefit
   both firms. Finally, we demonstrate that under general distributions, in
   equilibrium, firms share forecasts as a form of range/interval, which
   has been also implemented in practice.

AB We analyze a finite-horizon dynamic pricing model in which demand at
   each period depends on not only the current price but also past prices
   through reference prices. A unique feature but also a significant
   challenge in this model is the asymmetry in reference price effect,
   which implies that the underlying optimization problem is nonsmooth and
   no standard optimization methods can be applied. We identify a few key
   structural properties of the problem, which enable us to develop
   strongly polynomial-time algorithms to compute the optimal prices for
   several plausible scenarios. We complement our exact algorithms by
   proposing an approximation heuristic and provide an upper bound on the
   optimal objective value. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to
   study the optimal price path and demonstrate the value of dynamic
   pricing when demands are seasonal. We further compare numerically one of
   the exact algorithms with the heuristic and offer managerial
   suggestions.

AB We propose a target-oriented robust optimization approach to solve a
   multiproduct, multiperiod inventory management problem subject to
   ordering capacity constraints. We assume the demand for each product in
   each period is characterized by an uncertainty set that depends only on
   a reference value and the bounds of the demand. Our goal is to find an
   ordering policy that maximizes the sizes of all the uncertainty sets
   such that all demand realizations from the sets will result in a total
   cost lower than a prespecified cost target. We prove that a static
   decision rule is optimal for an approximate formulation of the problem,
   which significantly reduces the computation burden. By tuning the cost
   target, the resultant policy can achieve a balance between the expected
   cost and the associated cost variance. Numerical experiments suggest
   that although only limited demand information is used, the proposed
   approach performs comparably to traditional methods based on dynamic
   programming and stochastic programming. More importantly, our approach
   significantly outperforms the traditional methods if the latter assume
   inaccurate demand distributions. We demonstrate the applicability of our
   approach through two case studies from different industries.

AB We develop a Bayesian methodology for systemic risk assessment in
   financial networks such as the interbank market. Nodes represent
   participants in the network, and weighted directed edges represent
   liabilities. Often, for every participant, only the total liabilities
   and total assets within this network are observable. However, systemic
   risk assessment needs the individual liabilities. We propose a model for
   the individual liabilities, which, following a Bayesian approach, we
   then condition on the observed total liabilities and assets and,
   potentially, on certain observed individual liabilities. We construct a
   Gibbs sampler to generate samples from this conditional distribution.
   These samples can be used in stress testing, giving probabilities for
   the outcomes of interest. As one application we derive default
   probabilities of individual banks and discuss their sensitivity with
   respect to prior information included to model the network. An R package
   implementing the methodology is provided.

   drop among these firms, and operating performance drops among firms

AB The relational contracts literature suggests that a principal can
   improve contract self-enforceability by specifying initial requirements
   that increase the agent's ex post rents. Initial requirements specified
   in hotel franchise agreements-size and quality tier of the hotel-offer a
   unique empirical setting to test this. Using proprietary data on 5,547
   new franchised hotels and their revenues, we find that hotels far away
   from their franchisor's headquarters are larger, more likely to belong
   to a high quality tier, and generate higher revenues ex post. This
   supports the idea that the agent's ex post rents can serve as a
   substitute to the principal's monitoring intensity in the mitigation of
   agency problems. Our findings shed light on how formal contract terms
   can influence informal (relational) contracts between business partners.

AB Using a novel experimental paradigm, we explore how the experience of
   generating an idea and the possibility that another investor might adopt
   a rejected investment opportunity, bias the investment decisions of
   innovator and imitator entrepreneurs. We find that individuals who
   generate a business idea form biased evaluations of the economic
   potential of ideas, be it their own idea or somebody else's idea. On the
   one hand, they are overconfident about the value of, and overly likely
   to invest in, their own idea. On the other hand, when investing in
   another person's idea, even if it is not competing with their own idea,
   they are underconfident about the value of, and insufficiently likely to
   invest in, the idea. Surprisingly, we find that entrepreneurial
   experience exacerbates this pattern of over-and underconfidence. In
   addition, we find that the threat that another investor can appropriate
   a declined investment opportunity increases willingness to invest. We
   propose a theoretical account to explain the observed pattern of
   over-and underconfidence in imitative and innovative entrepreneurship.
   Our findings challenge the traditional account that lowering the cost of
   imitation has a disincentive effect on the investment decisions of
   pioneer entrepreneurs and provide evidence that a more lenient
   appropriability regime may, unexpectedly, have positive effects on
   entrepreneurship. Our findings also identify new psychological
   mechanisms that can play a role in important phenomena such as the
   emergence of spin-offs and rush to market entry.

   actions? To answer this question, the current research investigates the
   impact of different framings of prosocial marketing messages on
   consumers' behaviors and choices more generally. Results from six
   laboratory studies and a field experiment demonstrate that exposure to
   messages that praise customers for good deeds can increase subsequent
   self-interested and self-indulgent behaviors more than messages that
   publicize a company's good deeds or thank consumers for their patronage.
   Our findings demonstrate the possibility that a temporary boost in one's
   self-concept drives this observed effect. In addition, the recipient's
   level of support for the issue praised for moderates the effect of
   customer-praise messages on the recipient's less altruistic behaviors.
   This paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial

AB We investigate the impact of pricing policies (i.e., flat pricing versus
   peak pricing) on the investment levels of a utility firm in two
   competing energy sources (renewable and conventional), with a focus on
   the renewable investment level. We consider generation patterns and
   intermittency of solar and wind energy in relation to the electricity
   demand throughout a day. Industry experts generally promote peak pricing
   policy as it smoothens the demand and reduces inefficiencies in the
   supply system. We find that the same pricing policy may lead to distinct
   outcomes for different renewable energy sources due to their generation
   patterns. Specifically, flat pricing leads to a higher investment level
   for solar energy, and it can lead to still more investments in wind
   energy if a considerable amount of wind energy is generated throughout
   the day. We validate these results by using electricity generation and
   demand data of the state of Texas. We also show that flat pricing can
   lead to substantially lower carbon emissions and a higher consumer
   surplus. Finally, we explore the effect of direct (e.g., tax credit) and
   indirect (e.g., carbon tax) subsidies on investment levels and carbon
   emissions. We show that both types of subsidies generally lead to a
   lower emission level but that indirect subsidies may result in lower
   renewable energy investments. Our study suggests that reducing carbon
   emissions through increasing renewable energy investments requires
   careful attention to the pricing policy and the market characteristics
   of each region.

   approaches (geo, surname, geo-surname, and Bayesian Improved Surname
   Geocoding (BISG)) as compared with the race/ethnicity reported under the
   Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The BISG proxy predicts the
   reported race/ethnicity the best as judged by prediction bias,
   correlation coefficient, and discriminatory power. In assessing fair
   lending risks where classification of race/ethnicity is called for, we
   propose the BISG maximum classification, which produces a more accurate
   estimation of mortgage pricing disparities than the current practices.
   The above conclusions withhold various robustness tests. Additional

   Rule already reduced their trading books relative to their total assets
   2.34% more than other banks. However, the announcement of the rule did
   not reduce the banks' overall risk taking. To keep their risk targets,
   the affected banks raised the riskiness of their asset returns. We also
   find some evidence that the affected banks raised their trading risk and
   decreased the hedging of their banking business.

AB Experimental tests of expected-utility theory (EU) have accumulated
   empirical observations in which the predictions of EU are systematically
   violated. The cumulative prospect theory (CPT) explains violations such
   as the Allais paradoxes and fourfold pattern of risk attitudes as
   resulting from nonlinear probability transformations. Here we show that
   the classical paradoxes for decisions under risk can be explained with
   preferences that are linear in probabilities for any choice set and that
   maximize an expectedutility function with respect to an endogenous
   target return. We introduce the maximin payoff as a plausible and even
   natural target return from a choice set and show that the resulting
   target-adjusted utility (TAU) model explains additional empirical
   observations such as the scale dependence of the Allais paradox that
   cannot be explained by standard specifications of CPT. Further, using
   data from three prominent laboratory experiments, we find that TAU is
   effective in explaining observed behaviors.

AB Since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, there has been a renewed
   interest in quantifying more appropriately the risks involved in
   financial positions. Popular risk measures such as variance and
   value-at-risk have been found inadequate because we now give more
   importance to properties such as monotonicity, convexity, translation
   invariance, positive homogeneity, and law invariance. Unfortunately, the
   challenge remains that it is unclear how to choose a risk measure that
   faithfully represents a decision maker's true risk attitude. In this
   work, we show that one can account precisely for (neither more nor less
   than) what we know of the risk preferences of an investor/policy maker
   when comparing and optimizing financial positions. We assume that the
   decision maker can commit to a subset of the above properties (the use
   of a law invariant convex risk measure for example) and that he can
   provide a series of assessments comparing pairs of potential risky
   payoffs. Given this information, we propose to seek financial positions
   that perform best with respect to the most pessimistic estimation of the
   level of risk potentially perceived by the decision maker. We present
   how this preference robust risk minimization problem can be solved
   numerically by formulating convex optimization problems of reasonable
   size. Numerical experiments on a portfolio selection problem, where the
   problem reduces to a linear program, will illustrate the advantages of
   accounting for the fact that the choice of a risk measure is ambiguous.

AB The business model of low-cost carriers is now well established and
   accounts for a large share of Western civil aviation, particularly in
   Europe. To understand why it has proven so successful, we develop a
   theoretical model that exploits the two-sided nature of flights as
   connectors of supply and demand for goods and services other than
   traveling itself across physical space. Carriers offer flights of
   different quality and may sign agreements with suppliers of goods and
   services at the destination so as to subsidize and foster demand from
   the carriers' travelers as in standard two-sided markets.
   Customers/travelers care about home and destination consumption and
   about the flight's quality. Hence, beyond the thickness of the connected
   sides of the market, the quality of the airline platform has an
   intrinsic value to travelers. We show that only low-income travelers fly
   with low-cost airlines, while no-frills carriers are more likely to act
   as a platform than legacy airlines. We study how the degree of
   substitution between home and destination consumption affects the
   equilibrium market structure of the airline industry.

AB Dual-sourcing inventory systems, in which one supplier is faster (i.e.,
   express) and more costly, while the other is slower (i.e., regular) and
   cheaper, arise naturally in many real-world supply chains. These systems
   are notoriously difficult to optimize because of the complex structure
   of the optimal solution and the curse of dimensionality, having resisted
   solution for over 40 years. Recently, so-called tailored base-surge
   (TBS) policies have been proposed as a heuristic for the dual-sourcing
   problem. Under such a policy, a constant order is placed at the regular
   source in each period, while the order placed at the express source
   follows a simple order-up-to rule. Numerical experiments by several
   authors have suggested that such policies perform well as the lead time
   difference between the two sources grows large, which is exactly the
   setting in which the curse of dimensionality leads to the problem
   becoming intractable. However, providing a theoretical foundation for
   this phenomenon has remained a major open problem. In this paper, we
   provide such a theoretical foundation by proving that a simple TBS
   policy is indeed asymptotically optimal as the lead time of the regular
   source grows large, with the lead time of the express source held fixed.
   Our main proof technique combines novel convexity and lower-bounding
   arguments, an explicit implementation of the vanishing discount factor
   approach to analyzing infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, and
   ideas from the theory of random walks and queues, significantly
   extending the methodology and applicability of a novel framework for
   analyzing inventory models with large lead times recently introduced by
   Goldberg and coauthors in the context of lost-sales models with positive
   lead times.

AB Digitization has impacted firm profitability in many media industries by

   impact of digital rights management (DRM), a prevalent strategy used by
   firms in media industries to address piracy concerns, on music sales. I
   exploit a natural experiment, where different labels remove DRM from
   their entire catalogue of music at different times, to examine whether
   relaxing an album's sharing restrictions increases sales. Using a large
   sample of albums from all four major record labels, I find that removing
   DRM increases digital music sales by 10%, but relaxing sharing
   restrictions does not impact all albums equally. It increases the sales
   of lower-selling albums (i.e., the "long tail") significantly (40%) but
   does not benefit top-selling albums. These results suggest that reducing
   search costs facilitates the discovery of niche products.

   governance have more valuable investment options during booms and more
   valuable divestiture options during busts than the ones with weak
   governance. Because investment options are riskier and divestiture
   options are less risky than assets in place, the expected returns of

AB We analyze the effect of accounting bias on the competition and market
   structure of an industry. In our model, firms' interim accounting
   reports on investment projects may contain bias introduced by the
   mandatory accounting system. We find that this bias strictly decreases
   firms' profits when investors do not have an abandonment option, but
   different results emerge when we allow the investors to divest in the
   interim. Specifically, a conservative accounting regime may increase the
   likelihood of projects being discontinued, inducing some firms to exit
   from the product market and leaving rivals to capture their market
   share. A conservative regime can thus soften market competition and
   result in ex ante higher investment payoff, higher consumer surplus, and
   higher total social welfare. Since industries often have common
   reporting standards, we also identify the degrees of industry-wide
   accounting bias that maximize the expected investor payoffs. Finally, we
   allow for investors to coordinate their divestment decisions when both
   firms report unfavorable costs and show an improvement to both firm
   profits and consumer surplus.

   the individual has made. A goal of this model fitting procedure is to
   identify parameters that correspond to stable underlying risk
   preferences. These preferences can be modeled as an individual

   show significant improvements in the reliability of individual risk
   preference parameter estimates over other common methods for cumulative
   prospect theory. This hierarchical procedure uses population-level
   information (in addition to an individual's choices) to break "ties" (or
   near ties) in the fit quality for sets of possible risk preference
   parameters. By breaking these statistical ties in a sensible way,
   researchers can avoid overfitting choice data and thus more resiliently

AB This study examines the effects of reputation in the nascent but rapidly
   growing online labor markets. In these markets, contract winners
   (vendors) provide clients with customized products such as computer
   software, business plans, and artistic designs. The products are used
   primarily for business purposes and require time for production after
   project-specific contracts are awarded. These characteristics render it
   unclear whether online reputation will have similar effects as in online
   retailing, where finished and standardized products are sold for
   consumption. We analyze field transaction data from a major online labor
   market. The analyses using matched contract samples and vendor panels
   consistently show that despite the governing power provided by contracts
   as well as the litigation and arbitration options, vendors' online
   reputation can still be influential on clients. Vendors who have no
   reputation ratings are less likely to be chosen, and those with higher
   ratings are more likely to win subsequent bids. Importantly, however,
   such influences depend on the contract form that is used for a
   particular transaction-they are significant in output-based contracts
   but nonsignificant in input-based contracts. Besides extending the
   research on online reputation to the markets of customized production,
   this study shows contract form as an important boundary condition for
   the effectiveness of reputational information. It also provides direct
   managerial implications for electronic commerce in general and online
   labor markets in particular.

AB This paper studies the strategy of sharing inventory information for a
   firm that sells two vertically differentiated products. The seller has
   private information on the aggregate inventory level and the inventory
   composition of two product variants. The seller credibly and
   discretionarily discloses inventory information to customers either
   fully or partially, i.e., disclosing the exact inventory of each product
   variant, the aggregate inventory level, or no information to customers.
   Customers form expectations of future availability and make rational
   purchasing decisions accordingly. In the disclosure literature,
   discretion usually leads to an unraveling result: sellers who learn
   favorable market information opt to disclose it, making full disclosure
   the equilibrium. This paper shows that aggregate inventory disclosure,
   i.e., partial disclosure, can be instead sustained as an ex post
   equilibrium. We demonstrate that inventory information aggregation
   arises when there is an ex post desire to reduce supply-demand
   mismatches in all inventory scenarios. Specifically, when customers'
   preferred products are more likely to stock out, the seller could entice
   more incoming consumers who hope that their desired products are in
   stock by withholding product composition but disclosing the aggregate
   inventory level. If customers' desired products are sold out, the seller
   can benefit from upselling or cross-selling customers' less preferred
   products. Alternatively, when the seller stocks more desired products,
   aggregate disclosure can dampen the flow of incoming customers and
   reduce the shortage penalty cost. This result is robust under various
   settings: risk-averse customers, heterogeneous customers, and
   horizontally differentiated products.

AB Using behavioral experiments, we study the impact of queue design on
   worker productivity in service systems that involve human servers.
   Specifically, we consider two queue design features: queue structure,
   which can be either parallel queues (multiple queues with a dedicated
   server per queue) or a single queue (a pooled queue served by multiple
   servers), and queue-length visibility, which can provide either full or
   blocked visibility. We find that (1) the single-queue structure slows
   down the servers, illustrating a drawback of pooling, and (2) poor
   visibility of the queue length slows down the servers; however, this
   effect may be mitigated, or even reversed, by pay schemes that
   incentivize the servers for fast performance. We provide additional
   managerial insights by isolating two behavioral drivers behind these
   results-task interdependence and saliency of feedback.

AB In many market settings, a customer often obtains assistance from a
   supplier (or service provider) to make better-informed decisions
   regarding the supplier's product (or service). Because the two parties
   often have conflicting pecuniary incentives, customer trust and supplier
   trustworthiness play important roles in the success of these
   interactions. We investigate whether and how the process through which
   assistance is provided can foster trust and trustworthiness, and thus
   facilitate better cooperation. We compare three prevalent assistance
   processes: information sharing, advice provision, and delegation. We
   propose that, even if the pecuniary incentives of both parties do not
   vary from one assistance process to another, the assistance process
   itself impacts the customer's and supplier's nonpecuniary motives that
   give rise to trust and trustworthiness. Consequently, the assistance
   process affects the level of cooperation and payoffs. We test our
   behavioral predictions through laboratory experiments based on a retail
   distribution setting. We quantify the impact of different assistance
   processes on trust, trustworthiness and channel performance, and
   identify the underlying drivers of those impacts. Our results offer
   insight into the role of the assistance process in managing supplier
   assistance effectively and why certain assistance processes may lead to
   more successful outcomes than others even if the pecuniary incentives
   remain unaltered.

AB This paper empirically investigates the interplay between buyer search
   behavior and firm pricing strategy in a commodity market where many
   firms compete in price to sell homogeneous products. We use the
   heterogeneity in buyer search cost to rationalize why a firm offers
   periodic price discounts and enjoys a high profit in such a market. An
   estimation method is proposed to recover the nonparametric distribution
   of buyer search cost from the price and transaction volume data. With
   both data, we show that the search cost distribution can be estimated
   nonparametrically in a sequential search model, and estimation results
   from a nonsequential search model are robust to the assumption on the
   maximum number of searches. We also show that the commonly observed
   high-low pricing strategy can be an optimal strategy for firms when
   buyers search for price information sequentially. As an empirical
   application, we use the proposed method to estimate the two search
   models using data on a commodity product sold by a firm in a
   business-to-business market. The models predict a high profit margin for
   the firm, which is consistent with the data, but the sequential search
   model fits with the observed price distributions and supply costs better
   than the nonsequential search model.

AB Many theories address how information technology (IT) affects the number
   of suppliers and supply chain governance. However, their predictions are
   at times contradictory and there is relatively little empirical evidence
   with which to evaluate them. We therefore develop an integrated,
   multiperiod model of the optimal number of suppliers that combines
   search and coordination theory, transaction cost economics, and
   incomplete contracts theory, and we assess our theoretical predictions
   using a large new data set on the global IT sourcing decisions of 1,355
   firms in 12 countries. Our empirical results support three key
   predictions about trust, IT, and supply base size. First, investments in
   coordination IT, which reduce search and coordination costs, are
   correlated with using more suppliers, while use of vendor-specific IT is
   associated with fewer suppliers. Second, repeated relationships and
   trust play a major role in supply chain governance. As firms work with
   fewer suppliers, they also engage in more repeated relationships. At the
   same time asset specificity and the need to induce relationship-specific
   investments are correlated not only with fewer suppliers, but also with
   a larger fraction of repeated relationships. Third, supply chain
   governance differs in human capital-intensive and physical
   capital-intensive industries. The correspondence between asset
   specificity and repetition is strong in physical capital-intensive firms
   and not significant in human capital-intensive firms, while the
   correspondence between fewer suppliers and more repeated relationships
   is strong in human capital-intensive firms but not significant in
   physical capital-intensive firms. This corroborates the differential
   implications of human and physical capital for bargaining power,
   contractual risk, and trust in buyer-supplier relationships.

AB When a cardiac lead fails, physicians implant a new lead and may opt to
   extract the failed lead and/or any previously abandoned leads. Because
   the risk of extraction increases in lead age, physicians may extract
   leads to reduce the future risk of mandatory extraction, due to either
   infection or limited space in the vein. We develop discrete-time
   semi-Markov decision process models for various types of cardiac devices
   to determine patient-specific, lifetime-maximizing extraction policies
   as a function of patient age and the age of every implanted lead. We use
   clinical data to calibrate these models and present insightful numerical
   results, including comparisons to policies commonly used in practice.
   Our numerical experiments suggest that extracting failed leads only when
   forced to because of space limitations is usually a good rule of thumb,
   but that following the optimal policy, as opposed to the commonly used
   heuristic policies, can extend an average patient's expected lifetime by
   up to 1.2 years and decrease the likelihood of device-related death by
   up to 94% in some cases.

AB In this paper, we study the effect of invention disclosure through
   patent publication on the market for ideas. We do so by analyzing the
   effects of the American Inventor's Protection Act of 1999 (AIPA)-which
   required U.S. patent applications to be published 18 months after their
   filing date rather than at patent grant-on the timing of licensing deals
   in the biomedical industry. We find that post-AIPA U.S. patent
   applications are significantly more likely to be licensed before patent
   grant and shortly after 18-month publication. Licensing delays are
   reduced by about 10 months, on average, after AIPA's enactment. These
   findings suggest a hitherto unexplored benefit of the patent system: by
   requiring inventions to be published through a credible, standardized,
   and centralized repository, it mitigates information costs for buyers
   and sellers, and thus facilitates transactions in the market for ideas.

AB This paper describes the incentives for firms to seek voluntary product
   safety certifications. We consider a firm that makes the decision of
   whether or not to seek certification prior to selling the product. We
   show that even when the firm and the consumers have the same beliefs
   about the product's safety, there are incentives for the firm to seek
   safety certification. The main analysis investigates the role of
   consumer moral hazard and shows that it can lead to greater incentives
   for voluntary certification when inherent product safety and effort are
   substitutes, but smaller incentives when they are complements. The
   analysis of consumer moral hazard provides a nuanced perspective on the
   so-called risk compensation or the "Peltzman effect" phenomenon, which
   postulates higher levels of accidents for safer products. In our paper,
   products that are successfully certified can end up with a higher
   incidence of accidents. We also uncover an interesting nonmonotonic
   relationship between effectiveness of consumers' effort and the firm's
   incentives to seek certification. Finally, we find that certification
   can be welfare enhancing in the presence of consumer moral hazard.

   Standards Board. Did this accounting rule change really have such far
   reaching implications? Using a difference-in-differences test and Canada
   as a counterfactual, this study reveals that it did. We also report
   several other results confirming the role of pooling abolishment,
   including (i) that the decrease in full stock payment relates to CEO
   incentives and (ii) that previously documented determinants of the M&A
   mode of payment cannot explain the post-pooling abolishment pattern.
   These results are also robust to controls for various factors, such as
   the Internet bubble, the exclusion of cross-border deals, the presence
   of Canadian cross-listed firms, the use of a constant sample of
   acquirers across the pooling and post-pooling abolishment periods, the

AB We propose a partitioning algorithm to solve a class of linear-quadratic
   Markov decision processes with inequality constraints and nonconvex
   stagewise cost; within each region of the partitioned state space, the
   value function and the optimal policy have analytical quadratic and
   linear forms, respectively. Compared to grid-based numerical schemes,
   the partitioning algorithm gives the closed-formsolution without
   discretization error, and in many cases does not suffer from the curse
   of dimensionality. The algorithm is applied to two applications. In the
   main application, we present a model for limit order books with
   stochastic market depth to study the optimal order execution problem;
   stochastic market depth is consistent with empirical studies and
   necessary to accommodate various order activities. The optimal execution
   policy obtained by the algorithm significantly outperforms that of a
   deterministic market depth model in numerical examples. In the second
   application, we use the algorithm to compute the exact optimal solution
   to the renewable electricity management problem, for which previously
   only an approximate solution was known. As a comparison, we show that
   the approximate solution can be quite inaccurate for some initial states
   and thus demonstrate an advantage of the exact solution.

AB Many models in operations management involve dynamic decision making
   that assumes optimal updating in response to information revelation.
   However, behavioral theory suggests that rather than updating their
   beliefs, individuals may persevere in their prior beliefs. In
   particular, we examine how individuals' prior experiences and the
   experiences of those around them alter their belief perseverance in
   operational decisions after the revelation of negative news. We draw on
   an exogenous announcement of negative news by the Food and Drug
   Administration and explore how it affects interventional cardiologists
   deciding between two types of cardiac stents. Analyzing 147,000 choices
   over six years, we find that individuals do respond to negative news by
   using the focal production tool less often. However, we find that both
   individuals' own experiences and others' experiences alter their
   responses. Moreover, although individual and other experience act as
   substitutes before negative news, we find that this substitution
   significantly curtails following the negative announcement. Finally, we
   find that experience leads doctors to discount negative news more
   rapidly over time. Two lab studies replicate our main findings and show
   that behavioral biases due to differences in perceptions of expertise
   drive the effect. Our research contributes not only to operations
   research but also to the practice of healthcare and operations.

   relegated to a lower division have more match appearances in the short
   run, and they play in better leagues and earn higher wages in the long
   run. This gain is concentrated among individuals who are young or less
   experienced at the time of relegation. Because other consequences of
   relegation would tend to work against individuals' long-run success, the
   positive net gain is most likely to be the result of greater on-the-job

   involve comparing options of different types (e.g., a car now versus a

   not allow time preference to depend on whether the comparisons to be
   made are unimodal or cross-modal. We test this restriction in an
   experiment using the delayed compensation method, a new extension of the
   standard method of eliciting intertemporal preferences that allows for
   assessment of time preference for nonmonetary and discrete outcomes, as
   well as for both cross-modal and unimodal comparisons. Participants were
   much more averse to delay for unimodal than cross-modal decisions. We
   provide two potential explanations for this effect: one drawing on
   multiattribute choice, the other drawing on construal-level theory.

   advocates for a protege, and in doing so, takes a stake in her success.
   We use a laboratory experiment to explore two channels through which
   sponsorship has been posited to increase advancement in a competitive
   workplace. In our setting, being sponsored provides a vote of confidence
   and/or creates a link between the protege's and sponsor's payoffs. We
   find that both features of sponsorship significantly increase
   willingness to compete among men on average, while neither of these
   channels significantly increases willingness to compete among women on
   average. As a result, sponsorship does not close the gender gap in
   competitiveness or earnings. We discuss how these insights from the

AB We study the problem of optimal dynamic pricing for a monopolist selling
   a product to consumers in a social network. In the proposed model, the
   only means of spread of information about the product is via
   word-of-mouth communication; consumers' knowledge of the product is only
   through friends who already know about the product's existence. Both
   buyers and nonbuyers contribute to information diffusion, while buyers
   are more likely to spread the news about the product. By analyzing the
   structure of the underlying endogenous dynamic process, we show that the
   optimal dynamic pricing policy for durable products with zero or
   negligible marginal cost drops the price to zero infinitely often. The
   firm uses free offers to attract low-valuation agents and to get them
   more engaged in the spread. As a result, the firm can reach potential
   high-valuation consumers in parts of the network that would otherwise
   remain untouched without the price drops. We provide evidence for this
   behavior from the smartphone app market, where price histories indicate
   frequent zero-price sales. Moreover, we show that despite dropping the
   price to zero infinitely often, the optimal price trajectory does not
   get trapped near zero. We demonstrate the validity of our results in the
   face of forward-looking consumers and homophily in word-of-mouth
   engagement. We further unravel the key role of the product type in the
   optimality of zero-price sales by showing that the price fluctuations
   disappear after a finite time for a nondurable product.

AB Firms in a vertical relationship are likely to affect each other's
   productivity. Exactly how does productivity spill over across this type
   of relationship (i.e., through which mechanisms)? Additionally, how does
   the relative importance of these mechanisms depend on the structure of
   the supply chain? To answer these questions, we decompose the channels
   of upstream productivity spillovers-from customers to suppliers-by
   developing a structural econometric model on a sample of approximately
   22,500 supply chain dyads. We find that the "endogenous channel" (i.e.,
   the effect of the customer's own productivity on the supplier's
   productivity) is by far the most important source of spillovers. This is
   especially true if (i) the supplier has a concentrated customer base,
   (ii) the supplier and the customer have similar operational
   characteristics, and (iii) the relationship has medium maturity. In the
   converse scenarios, we find, it is more important to have a partner with
   a portfolio of favorable "contextual" characteristics (high inventory
   turnover, financial liquidity, and asset turnover) than to have a
   productive partner.

AB To mitigate supply disruption risks, some manufacturers consider a
   flexible sourcing strategy, where they have an option of sourcing from
   multiple suppliers, including regular unreliable suppliers and backup
   reliable ones. Our objective is to evaluate the costs and benefits
   associated with flexible sourcing when suppliers are strategic price
   setters. We show that when each supplier announces a single (wholesale)
   price, such a game leads to a conflict of incentives and is not
   realistic in most practical settings. Therefore, we focus on a
   contingent-pricing game, with wholesale prices contingent on the
   manufacturer's sourcing strategy. We describe the resulting equilibrium
   outcomes corresponding to the manufacturer's different sourcing and
   inventory strategies. We show that in equilibrium, inventories are
   carried either by the manufacturer or by the unreliable supplier, but
   not both. The manufacturer does not necessarily benefit from the
   existence of a backup supplier and, in fact, is typically worse off.
   Similarly, supply chain performance may degrade. Thus, an up-front
   commitment to sole sourcing may be beneficial. Interestingly, suppliers
   may benefit from flexible sourcing even though the manufacturer does
   not. The main results extend to cases when partial backup sourcing is
   allowed, both suppliers are unreliable, recovery times are
   non-memoryless, an unreliable supplier may provide a richer set of
   contingent prices, or the supplier may be risk averse.

   affects the creation, growth, and survival of spinouts and other new
   entrants. The impact of noncompete enforceability on new firms is
   ambiguous, since noncompetes reduce knowledge leakage but impose hiring
   costs. However, we posit that enforceability screens formation of
   within-industry spinouts (WSOs) relative to non-WSOs by dissuading
   founders with lower human capital. Using data on 5.5 million new firms,
   we find greater enforceability is associated with fewer WSOs, but
   relative to non-WSOs, WSOs that are created tend to start and stay
   larger, are founded by higher-earners, and are more likely to survive
   their initial years. In contrast, we find no impact on non-WSO entry and
   a negative effect on size and short-term survival.

   seeding of industry knowledge can subsequently catalyze the growth of a
   developing country's industry by involuntarily propagating the knowledge
   to subsequent entrants. As industry knowledge has tacit elements, we
   focus on mechanisms that enable experienced workers from the pioneer to
   seed the knowledge to new entrants. We examine the relationship between
   entrants' characteristics and the mechanisms exploited to access the
   industry knowledge, and the impact of the mechanisms exploited on firm
   performance. Empirical findings from two historical episodes in the

AB It is well documented that losses are less persistent than profits and
   that stock prices anticipate the lower persistence of losses. Yet the
   underlying explanation for these results is unclear. One explanation
   lies in the abandonment option, whereby firms with losses are more
   likely to curtail operations (e.g., Hayn [Hayn C (1995) The information
   content of losses. J. Accounting Econom. 20(2):125-153]). Another
   explanation involves timely loss recognition stemming from conservative
   accounting (e.g., Basu [Basu S (1997) The conservatism principle and the
   asymmetric timeliness of earnings. J. Accounting Econom. 24(1):3-37]).
   We provide direct evidence that curtailments are an important factor
   contributing to the lower persistence of losses. An implication of our
   results is that popular measures of conservatism, such as the measure
   proposed by Basu, also reflect curtailments.

   effect of increasing buyers' discretion on procurement outcomes in a
   large database for public works in Italy. Works with a value above a
   given threshold have to be awarded through an open auction. Works below
   this threshold can be more easily awarded through a restricted auction,
   where the buyer has some discretion in terms of who (not) to invite to
   bid. Our main result is that discretion increases the probability that
   the same firm wins repeatedly, and it does not deteriorate (and may
   improve) the procurement outcomes we observe. The effects of discretion
   persist when we repeat the analysis controlling for the geographical
   location, corruption, social capital, and judicial efficiency in the

AB New technologies such as product simulators and virtual reality now
   allow firms to provide realistic product usage experiences and reduce
   buyer uncertainty about product quality. We argue that today's firms
   should view product design and investments to reduce buyer uncertainty
   as an integrated process, which is in turn influenced by how much
   information buyers can obtain from third-party infomediaries. We
   introduce a game-theoretic model of a competitive market where both
   quality production and quality disclosure are endogenous decisions,
   affected by information made available by third parties. We show that
   quality investment under uncertainty never exceeds the level of quality
   investment under perfect information. Furthermore, we show that
   information availability by third parties allows firms to free ride, and
   it especially favors lower quality firms, who can reduce their
   information disclosure investments more so than higherquality firms.
   Finally, we show that the intuitive argument that firms must improve
   their product quality when overall information availability in the
   market improves does not always hold. Instead, improved information
   availability may enable firms to reduce their quality in some
   situations.

   appeals that prime an individual's identity as a previous donor to the
   charity or as a member of a local community generate more donations. The
   primes are more effective when they highlight a facet of the potential
   donor's identity that we hypothesize to be more relevant to his sense of
   self: priming identity as a previous donor is more effective for more
   regular donors and priming identity as a local community member is more
   effective for people in smaller communities. Together, these results

AB Inattention and imperfect information bias behavior toward the salient
   and immediately visible. This distortion creates costs for individuals,
   the organizations in which they work, and society at large. We show that
   an effective way to overcome this bias is by making the implications of
   one's behavior salient in real time, while individuals can directly
   adapt. In a large-scale field experiment, we gave participants real-time
   feedback on the resource consumption of a daily, energy-intensive
   activity (showering). We find that real-time feedback reduced resource
   consumption for the target behavior by 22%. At the household level, this
   led to much larger conservation gains in absolute terms than
   conventional policy interventions that provide aggregate feedback on
   resource use. High baseline users displayed a larger conservation
   effect, in line with the notion that real-time feedback helps eliminate
   "slack" in resource use. The approach is cost effective, is technically
   applicable to the vast majority of households, and generated savings of
   1.2 kWh per day and household, which exceeds the average energy use for
   lighting. The intervention also shows how digitalization in our everyday
   lives makes information available that can help individuals overcome
   salience bias and act more in line with their preferences.

AB Although evidence-based algorithms consistently outperform human
   forecasters, people often fail to use them after learning that they are
   imperfect, a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. In this paper, we
   present three studies investigating how to reduce algorithm aversion. In
   incentivized forecasting tasks, participants chose between using their
   own forecasts or those of an algorithm that was built by experts.
   Participants were considerably more likely to choose to use an imperfect
   algorithm when they could modify its forecasts, and they performed
   better as a result. Notably, the preference for modifiable algorithms
   held even when participants were severely restricted in the
   modifications they could make (Studies 1-3). In fact, our results
   suggest that participants' preference for modifiable algorithms was
   indicative of a desire for some control over the forecasting outcome,
   and not for a desire for greater control over the forecasting outcome,
   as participants' preference for modifiable algorithms was relatively
   insensitive to the magnitude of the modifications they were able to make
   (Study 2). Additionally, we found that giving participants the freedom
   to modify an imperfect algorithm made them feel more satisfied with the
   forecasting process, more likely to believe that the algorithm was
   superior, and more likely to choose to use an algorithm to make
   subsequent forecasts (Study 3). This research suggests that one can
   reduce algorithm aversion by giving people some control-even a slight
   amount-over an imperfect algorithm's forecast.

AB This paper examines whether experience from entry in one market can
   potentially enhance profitability at a future market opportunity for a
   related product. We formulate and estimate a dynamic game of entry in
   which forward-looking firms make decisions not just based on present
   benefits of past entry but also anticipating potential future benefits
   of current entry. Dynamic spillovers of entry are incorporated through a
   firm-specific unobservable (to the researcher) cost that depends on past
   entry decisions. The unobserved costs may also be serially persistent.
   Thus, the model allows for firm-specific unobserved heterogeneity that
   evolves based on firm actions. The challenge of estimating a dynamic
   game with serially correlated unobserved state variables subject to
   endogenous feedback is overcome by embedding a particle filter-based
   technique in a nested fixed-point algorithm. Using an application to a
   stylized model of entry in the generic pharmaceutical industry, we
   underscore the motivation for the model specification and the
   methodology developed. Our estimates imply positive spillover effects of
   entry. Moreover, these spillovers suggest heterogeneity not just across
   firms but also within firms over time based on their history of entry
   decisions. Our results illustrate that entry may potentially provide
   firms with additional strategic advantage in later markets and that
   entry spillovers may be an important factor to consider in the
   equilibrium evolution of the generic drug industry.

   presence of switching costs by additionally modeling the strategic
   pricing role of the retailer within the distribution channel. In doing
   this, we study the relative dynamic pricing implications of how current
   retail and wholesale prices for a brand must optimally take into account
   past and future demand, respectively, for the brand. Using scanner data
   from the cola market, we find that while the retailer exploits the
   benefit of inertial demand by appropriately increasing the retail profit
   margin, the cost of investing is borne entirely by the manufacturers. We
   use simulation studies to show how the retailer will lose its ability to
   leverage the benefits of inertial demand as consumers become more price
   sensitive. We also show that when inertia of the more price-sensitive
   customer segment increases, the aggregate welfare of consumers, the
   retailer, and manufacturers may increase.

AB Products combine function and form. This paper focuses on product form.
   We combine state-of-the-art clustering techniques with experimental
   validation to identify styles (groupings of new product designs of
   similar form) among the more than 350,000 U.S. design patents granted
   from 1977 through 2010. Thus we compile, for the first time, a rich data
   set of styles that can serve as an empirical platform for a rigorous
   study of the role played by product form in new product development.
   Building on this platform, we analyze the determinants of "style
   turbulence"-the year-to-year unpredictability of changes in a style's
   prevalence. We find that (i) style turbulence follows a U-shaped
   relationship with respect to function turbulence (the turbulence of
   product functions associated with a given style), and (ii) style
   turbulence increases over time. We discuss the implications of these
   findings for managing design in new product development.

AB We examine a supply chain with a single supplier and multiple retailers
   to predict retailers' actual ordering behaviors. If retailer orders
   exceed supplier capacity, a proportional rationing rule applies to
   capacity allocation among retailers. We propose a behavior model based
   on cognitive hierarchy theory, in which retailers with different levels
   of strategic-reasoning capabilities form heterogeneous beliefs about
   other players' capabilities when choosing their orders. This behavioral
   model yields three interesting predictions. First, retailers' orders
   increase as the number of retailers decreases or the supplier's
   production capacity shrinks. Second, the orders tend to increase as the
   retailer population becomes more "sophisticated." Third, retailers'
   profits first increase in relation to their strategic-reasoning
   capabilities and then decrease, indicating an inverted U-shaped
   relationship between profits and strategic-reasoning capabilities. We
   experimentally examine the capacity allocation game with participants
   motivated by financial incentives. The experimental results and
   structural model estimation confirm the predictions of the behavioral
   model.

AB Online retail reduces the costs of obtaining information about a
   product's price and availability and of flexibly timing a purchase.
   Consequently, consumers can strategically time their purchases, weighing
   the costs of monitoring and the risk of inventory depletion against
   prospectively lower prices. At the same time, firms can observe and
   exploit their customers' monitoring behavior. Using a data set tracking
   customers of a North American specialty retail brand, we present
   empirical evidence that monitoring products online is associated with
   successfully obtaining discounts. We develop a structural model of
   consumers' dynamic monitoring to find substantial heterogeneity, with
   consumers' opportunity costs for an online visit ranging from $2 to $25
   in inverse relation to their price elasticities. Our estimation results
   have important implications for retail operations. The randomized
   markdown policy benefits retailers by combining price commitment with
   the exploitation of heterogeneity in consumers' monitoring costs. We
   estimate that the retailer's profit under randomized markdowns is 81%
   higher than from subgame-perfect, state-contingent pricing, because the
   retailer need not limit its inventory to credibly limit markdowns, which
   permits its jointly optimal inventory stock to expand by 133%. The
   welfare gain from these larger inventories splits nearly equally into
   retailer profit and consumer surplus. We also discuss targeting
   customers with price promotions using their online histories and the
   implications of reducing consumers' monitoring costs.

AB We study a simple game in which two sellers supply goods whose quality
   cannot be assessed by consumers even after consumption but can be
   verified with some probability by a public authority. Sellers may induce
   a prospective buyer into a bad purchase through comparative deceptive
   advertising. The central contribution of this paper is the
   characterization of a class of pooling equilibria in which low-quality
   sellers deceive a buyer who is Bayes-rational and makes a purchase
   decision on the basis of the available information. The analysis of
   these equilibria suggests that high-quality firms should pursue more
   intensive advertising campaigns than their low-quality competitors.
   Surprisingly, we find conditions under which sellers' expected profit is
   higher in pooling equilibria than in the separating equilibrium in which
   quality is reflected by prices and there is no need to waste resources
   in advertising. Hence, we show that there are plausible cases in which
   firms should be ex ante willing to tolerate some degree of deceptive
   advertising by low-quality competitors. In addition, although in these
   equilibria the buyer purchases low-quality goods with positive
   probability, the expected utility can be higher than in a separating
   equilibrium in which the buyer purchases the high-quality good for sure.
   In this sense, the model also offers an argument in favor of a lenient
   regulatory approach to deceptive advertising.

AB Procedures in assessing the impact of serial dependency on performance
   analysis are usually built on parametrically specified models. In this
   paper, we propose a robust, nonparametric approach to carry out this
   assessment, by computing the worst-case deviation of the performance
   measure due to arbitrary dependence. The approach is based on
   optimizations, posited on the model space, that have constraints
   specifying the level of dependency measured by a nonparametric distance
   to some nominal independent and identically distributed input model. We
   study approximation methods for these optimizations via simulation and
   analysis of variance. Numerical experiments demonstrate how the proposed
   approach can discover the hidden impacts of dependency beyond those
   revealed by conventional parametric modeling and correlation studies.

AB We examined whether people reduce the impact of negative outcomes
   through emotional hedging-betting against the occurrence of desired
   outcomes. We found substantial reluctance to bet against the success of
   preferred U.S. presidential candidates and Major League Baseball,
   National Football League, National Collegiate Athletic Association
   (NCAA) basketball, and NCAA hockey teams. This reluctance was not
   attributable to optimism or a general aversion to hedging. Reluctance to
   hedge desired outcomes stemmed from identity signaling, a desire to
   preserve an important aspect of the bettor's identity. Reluctance to
   hedge occurred when the diagnostic cost of the negative self-signal that
   hedging would produce outweighed the pecuniary rewards associated with
   hedging. Participants readily accepted hedges and pure gambles with no
   diagnostic costs. They also more readily accepted hedges with diagnostic
   costs when the pecuniary rewards associated with those hedges were
   greater. Reluctance to hedge identity-relevant outcomes produced two
   anomalies in decision making, risk seeking and dominance violations.
   More than 45% of NCAA fans in Studies 5 and 6, for instance, turned down
   a "free" real $5 bet against their team. The results elucidate anomalous
   decisions in which people exhibit disloyalty aversion, forgoing personal
   rewards that would conflict with their loyalties and commitments to
   others, beliefs, and ideals.

AB The executive suite and the board are closely bound to each other
   through their fiduciary responsibility to the same shareholders. With
   chief executive officers' (CEOs) prominent role in both governing
   bodies, their independence from CEOs' self-serving behavior might be
   related to each other. We explore the interdependence using an external
   shock increasing board independence. The shock weakens executive suite
   independence by increasing CEO connectedness within executive suites
   through appointments and preexisting social ties. We also uncover
   interesting dynamics between the two governing bodies: (1) the spillover
   does not occur when treated firms increase CEO-independent director
   social ties, suggesting CEO-executive connections and CEO-director
   connections are substitutes; (2) consistent with theories of board
   independence, when an information environment calls for dependent
   boards, increasing CEO-executive connections, which helps negate the
   shock effect on the board, has positive marginal effects on firm
   performance. Our findings are not driven by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
   are robust to a battery of other tests. We conclude that independence in
   the board and executive suite are inversely related; inferring the
   overall independence from board independence alone can be highly
   misleading.

   rated Baa in the post-regulation period are 19% more likely to be

AB The portfolio optimization model has limited impact in practice because
   of estimation issues when applied to real data. To address this, we
   adapt two machine learning methods, regularization and cross-validation,
   for portfolio optimization. First, we introduce performance-based
   regularization (PBR), where the idea is to constrain the sample
   variances of the estimated portfolio risk and return, which steers the
   solution toward one associated with less estimation error in the
   performance. We consider PBR for both mean-variance and mean-conditional
   value-at-risk (CVaR) problems. For the mean-variance problem, PBR
   introduces a quartic polynomial constraint, for which we make two convex
   approximations: one based on rank-1 approximation and another based on a
   convex quadratic approximation. The rank-1 approximation PBR adds a bias
   to the optimal allocation, and the convex quadratic approximation PBR
   shrinks the sample covariance matrix. For the mean-CVaR problem, the PBR
   model is a combinatorial optimization problem, but we prove its convex
   relaxation, a quadratically constrained quadratic program, is
   essentially tight. We show that the PBR models can be cast as robust
   optimization problems with novel uncertainty sets and establish
   asymptotic optimality of both sample average approximation (SAA) and PBR
   solutions and the corresponding efficient frontiers. To calibrate the
   right-hand sides of the PBR constraints, we develop new,
   performance-based k-fold cross-validation algorithms. Using these
   algorithms, we carry out an extensive empirical investigation of PBR
   against SAA, as well as L1 and L2 regularizations and the equally
   weighted portfolio. We find that PBR dominates all other benchmarks for
   two out of three Fama-French data sets.

AB Recent technological advances in online and mobile communications have
   enabled collaborative consumption or product sharing among consumers on
   a massive scale. Collaborative consumption has emerged as a major trend
   as the global economic recession and social concerns about consumption
   sustainability lead consumers and society as a whole to explore more
   efficient use of resources and products. We develop an analytical
   framework to examine the strategic and economic impact of product
   sharing among consumers. Aconsumer who purchased a firm's product can
   derive different usage values across different usage periods. In a
   period with low self-use value, the consumer may generate some income by
   renting out her purchased product through a third-party sharing platform
   as long as the rental fee net of transaction costs exceeds her own
   self-use value. Our analysis shows that transaction costs in the sharing
   market have a nonmonotonic effect on the firm's profits, consumer
   surplus, and social welfare. We find that when the firm strategically
   chooses its retail price, consumers' sharing of products with high
   marginal costs is a win-win situation for the firm and the consumers,
   whereas their sharing of products with low marginal costs can be a
   lose-lose situation. Furthermore, in the presence of the sharing market,
   the firm will find it optimal to strategically increase its quality,
   leading to higher profits but lower consumer surplus.

AB Recent work suggests that an excessive focus on "managing the
   numbers"-delivering quarterly earnings at the expense of longer-term
   performance-makes it difficult for firms to make the investments
   necessary to build competitive advantage. "Short termism" has been
   blamed for everything from the decline of the U.S. automobile industry
   to the low penetration of techniques such as total quality management
   and continuous improvement. Yet a significant body of research suggests
   that firms that sacrifice long-term investment to manage earnings are
   often rewarded for doing so. This paper presents a model to help
   reconcile the tension between these apparently contradictory
   perspectives. We show that if the source of long-term advantage is
   modeled as a stock of capability that accumulates over time, the
   intensity of the firm's effort to manage short-term earnings at the
   expense of long-term investment can have very different consequences
   depending on whether the firm's capability is close to a critical
   "tipping threshold." When the firm operates above this threshold,
   aggressively managing earnings smooths revenue and cash flow with few
   long-term consequences. Below it, managing earnings can tip the firm
   into a vicious cycle of accelerating decline. Our results have important
   implications for understanding managerial incentives and the internal
   processes that create sustained advantage.

AB Search advertising is the ordered list of advertisements that appears
   when a user searches for something in an online search engine. By
   construction, these ads differ in prominence: ads higher up the list are
   more prominent than ads lower down the list. However, search ads also
   differ in prominence in another way: prominence of advertiser. This
   paper examines how these two types of prominence interact in determining
   the click-through rate (CTR) of these ads. Using individual-level
   click-stream data from Microsoft's Live Search platform and measures of
   advertiser prominence from Alexa. com, we find that ad position and
   advertiser prominence are substitutes. Specifically, in searches for
   camera brands, a retailer not in the top 100 of Alexa rankings has a
   30%-50% higher CTR in position 1 than in position 2, whereas a retailer
   in the top 100 of Alexa rankings has only a 0%-13% higher CTR for the
   same position improvement. Qualitatively similar results are obtained
   for several other search strings. These findings demonstrate, first,
   that advertiser brand matters even for search ads, and, second, the way
   it matters is the opposite of what is usually assumed in the theoretical

AB Behavioral pricing and revenue management aim to incorporate realistic
   consumer behavior into firms' pricing and inventory models. The key
   input to these models is market demand, which is often assumed to
   inherit the characteristics of consumer behavior-as when, for example,
   one assumes that a market consisting of loss-averse consumers is more
   responsive to losses than to gains. Yet market demand and consumer
   behavior need not be related, and so, we argue, that approach to
   modeling market demand is misguided. This paper proposes an approach
   that accounts for the heterogeneity in consumer valuation: we aggregate
   the demand of individual loss-averse consumers to obtain market demand
   and show that market demand may be more responsive to gains or losses,
   or it may be equally responsive. Our results have profound implications
   not only for how best to characterize the market demand of behaviorally
   biased consumers but also for determining the firm's optimal pricing
   policy.

AB We examine the spillover effects that occur within Korean business
   groups (i.e., chaebols) by focusing on the market reactions of event
   firms to announcements of credit rating changes. We find that there are
   positive spillovers (caused by positive market reactions) and negative
   spillovers (caused by negative market reactions) that are driven by the
   market reactions of event firms. Our analyses indicate that negative
   spillovers are more dominant than positive spillovers. Moreover, a
   spillover that is driven by a leading firm within a business group has
   stronger effects on other firms in the group than a spillover that is
   driven by a nonleading firm. This suggests that the market evaluation of
   a business group is conducted more on the basis of a leading firm than a
   nonleading firm within a group. Finally, we show that the spillover
   effects that are analyzed in our study are more noticeable when the
   business relationship between an event firmand other affiliated firms is
   closer.

   their history through a moving-average component. Our preferred
   conditional mean model combines one moving average with the usual three
   Gaussian risk factors, closely matches the bond risk premium measured
   from predictive regressions, and provides better forecasts of bond
   returns. Our framework nests Duffee's models with a small "hidden"

AB What is the most credible way to convey the risk in expert forecasts to
   the nonexpert decision makers who use the forecast? We test two ways to
   communicate this information: provide an unequivocal recommendation or
   equivocate by providing the probability of the uncertain event of
   interest. We use a simple game in which human subjects (the forecast
   users) decide whether to take a risk of a loss or pay a cost to avoid
   the risk. We find that the influence of forecast information differs
   depending on whether the information implies that the decision maker
   should take the status quo action, the preforecast optimal action, or
   the siren action, optimal only if the period-by-period forecast implies
   it. Unequivocal recommendations are more successful at inducing the
   status quo action. Equivocating by providing probabilities is more
   successful at inducing the siren action. Unequivocal recommendations to
   take the siren action are less effective because the false certainty
   makes them more vulnerable to the "cry wolf" effect. A forecast that
   combines probabilities with recommendations captures most of the gains
   of the separate approaches. A follow-up study examines whether an
   explanation of how risk quantities inform recommendations can substitute
   for providing the risk quantities in the forecast. The study finds
   little evidence in support of this proposition.

AB We study how people reconcile conflicting moral intuitions by
   juxtaposing two versions of classic moral problems: the trolley problem
   and the footbridge problem. When viewed separately, most people favor
   action in the former and disapprove of action in the latter, despite
   identical consequences. The difference is often explained in terms of
   the intention principle-whether the consequences are intended or
   incidental. Our results suggest that when the two problems are
   considered together, a different judgment emerges: participants reject
   the intention principle and embrace either the principle of
   utilitarianism, which favors action in both problems, or the action
   principle, which rejects action in both problems. In subsequent studies,
   we find that when required to choose between two harmful actions, people
   prefer the action that saves more lives, despite its being more
   aversive. Our findings shed light on the formation of moral judgment
   under normative conflict, the conditions for preference reversal, and
   the potential polarization of moral judgment under joint evaluation.

   preferences. In each store visit, each customer samples a full
   preference list of the products consistent with her partial order, forms
   a consideration set, and then chooses to purchase the most preferred
   product among the considered ones. Our approach involves: (a) defining
   behavioral models to build consideration sets as subsets of the products
   on offer, (b) proposing a clustering algorithm for determining customer
   segments, and (c) deriving marginal distributions for partial
   preferences under the multinomial logit model. Numerical experiments on

   this normalization, we find conditions for a wide class of affine term
   structure models to exhibit unspanned stochastic volatility (USV). We
   show that the USV conditions restrict both the mean reversions of risk
   factors and the cross section of conditional yield volatilities. The
   restrictions imply that previously studied affine USV models are
   unlikely to be able to generate the observed cross section of yield

   model that states that accuracy gains from consulting a crowd's
   judgments of taste depend on the interplay among taste discrimination,
   crowd diversity, and the similarity between the crowd's preferences and
   those of the decision maker. The model also delineates the boundary
   conditions for such "crowd wisdom." Evidence supporting our hypotheses
   was found in two laboratory studies in which decision makers made

   with month-end applications being more complex than those filed on other

   work quality is lower for tasks completed at month-ends, more so for
   process measures of quality than for outcome measures. Calibration of
   our model to the data allows us to shed light on the benefits of
   deadlines and suggests small levels of task acceleration but potentially

   payoff is allocated to a competitive compensation scheme. This novel
   procedure allows us to distinguish between 101 levels of
   competitiveness, as opposed to the binary measure used in the
   literature. Whereas the binary measure allows researchers to conclude
   that about twice as many men as women choose to compete (typically
   two-thirds versus one-third), the new procedure sheds light on the
   intensive margin. We find that the intensity of the preference is more
   extreme than the binary measure could detect. For example, we find that
   only one-fifth of the most competitive 25% of our participants are
   women, and the most competitive 10% of our participants are all men. The

AB Resource pooling strategies have been widely used in industry to match
   supply with demand. However, effective implementation of these
   strategies can be challenging. Firms need to integrate the heterogeneous
   service level requirements of different customers into the pooling model
   and allocate the resources (inventory or capacity) appropriately in the
   most effective manner. The traditional analysis of inventory pooling,
   for instance, considers the performance metric in a centralized system
   and does not address the associated issue of inventory allocation. Using
   Blackwell's Approachability Theorem, we derive a set of necessary and
   sufficient conditions to relate the fill rate requirement of each
   customer to the resources needed in the system. This provides a new
   approach to studying the value of resource pooling in a system with
   differentiated service requirements. Furthermore, we show that with
   "allocation flexibility," the amount of safety stock needed in a system
   with independent and identically distributed demands does not grow with
   the number of customers but instead diminishes to zero and eventually
   becomes negative as the number of customers grows sufficiently large.
   This surprising result holds for all demand distributions with bounded
   first and second moments.

   to consumers, because advertisers may not reach some consumers and may
   impress others too many times. We find that when advertisers are
   heterogeneous in their valuations for reaching consumers, the
   switching-induced inefficiency leads lower-value advertisers to
   advertise on a limited set of publishers, reducing the effective demand
   for advertising and thus depressing prices. As the share of switching
   consumers expands (e.g., when consumers adopt the Internet for news or
   increase their use of aggregators), ad prices fall. We demonstrate that
   increased switching creates an incentive for publishers to invest in
   quality as well as extend the number of unique users, because larger
   publishers are favored by advertisers seeking broader "reach" (more
   unique users) while avoiding inefficient duplication.

AB Omnichannel environments where customers shop online and offline at the
   same retailer are ubiquitous, and are deployed by online-first and
   traditional retailers alike. We focus on the relatively understudied
   domain of online-first retailers and the engagement of a key omnichannel
   tactic; specifically, introduction of showrooms (physical locations
   where customers can view and try products) in combination with online
   fulfillment that uses centralized inventory management. We ask whether,
   and if so, how, showrooms benefit the two most basic retail objectives:
   demand generation and operational efficiency. Using quasi-experimental
   data on showroom openings by WarbyParker. com, the leading and iconic
   online-first eyewear retailer, we find that showrooms: (1) increase
   demand overall and in the online channel as well; (2) generate
   operational spillovers to the other channels by attracting customers
   who, on average, have a higher cost-to-serve; (3) improve overall
   operational efficiency by increasing conversion in a sampling channel
   and by decreasing returns; and (4) amplify these demand and operational
   benefits in dealing with customers who have the most acute need for the
   firm's products. Moreover, the effects we document strengthen with time
   as showrooms contribute not only to brand awareness but also to what we
   term channel awareness as well. We conclude by elaborating the
   underlying customer dynamics driving our findings and by offering
   implications for how online-first retailers might deploy omnichannel
   tactics.

AB We explore a novel mechanism of network change that occurs when a firm
   acquires another one and inherits its network ties. Such "node collapse"
   can radically restructure the network in one transaction, constituting a
   revolutionary change compared with the incremental effect of tie
   additions and deletions, which have been the focus of prior research. We
   explore several properties of node collapses: their efficacy in helping
   firms achieve superior network positions, the externalities they impose
   on other network actors, and how they provide exclusive control over
   both internal and network resources. Using a simulation in which actors
   compete to acquire one another, we model network dynamics driven by node
   collapses. We find that node collapses directly affect the performance
   of the acquirer and indirectly that of other actors, and that the
   direction of network evolution hinges on the degree to which firms
   pursue internal versus network synergies through node collapses.

AB Multiplicative growth processes that are subject to random shocks often
   have an asymmetric distribution of outcomes. In a series of incentivized
   laboratory experiments, we showthat a large majority of participants
   either strongly underestimate the asymmetry or ignore it completely.
   Participants misperceive the spread of the outcome distribution to be
   too narrowband, and they estimate the median and the mode to lie too
   close to the center of the distribution, failing to account for the
   compound nature of average growth. The observed biases are measured
   irrespective to risk preferences and they appear under a variety of
   conditions. The biases are largely consistent with a behavioral model in
   which geometric growth is confused with linear growth. This confusion is
   a possible driver of investors' difficulties with real-world financial

   plans.

AB Motivated by the proliferation of online platforms that collect and
   disseminate consumers' experiences with alternative substitutable
   products/ services, we investigate the problem of optimal information
   provision when the goal is to maximize aggregate consumer surplus. We
   develop a decentralized multiarmed bandit framework where a forward-
   looking principal (the platform designer) commits up front to a policy
   that dynamically discloses information regarding the history of outcomes
   to a series of shortlived rational agents (the consumers). We
   demonstrate that consumer surplus is nonmonotone in the accuracy of the
   designer's information- provision policy. Because consumers are
   constantly in "exploitation" mode, policies that disclose accurate
   information on past outcomes suffer from inadequate "exploration." We
   illustrate how the designer can (partially) alleviate this inefficiency
   by employing a policy that strategically obfuscates the information in
   the platform's possession; interestingly, such a policy is beneficial
   despite the fact that consumers are aware of both the designer's
   objective and the precise way by which information is being disclosed to
   them. More generally, we show that the optimal information- provision
   policy can be obtained as the solution of a large- scale linear program.
   Noting that such a solution is typically intractable, we use our
   structural findings to design an intuitive heuristic that underscores
   the value of information obfuscation in decentralized learning. We
   further highlight that obfuscation remains beneficial even if the
   designer can directly incentivize consumers to explore through monetary
   payments.

AB Does testosterone increase the tendency to engage in self-employment?
   The results presented to date have been mixed. Using three different
   studies, we provide additional evidence on the relationship between
   testosterone and self-employment. Drawing on a cross section of 2,146
   individuals (1,178 males and 968 females) from the National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Surveys' 2011-2012 sample, and controlling for
   endogeneity (with red blood cell count, percentage hematocrit, and zinc
   supplement intake in the past 30 days as instruments), we find that
   serum testosterone levels are positively associated with self-employment
   for males (marginally significant, two-tailed test). As testosterone
   levels could be affected by social, economic, and biological factors
   during one's life course, we draw more robust inferences by assessing
   whether the 2D:4D digit ratio, a marker of prenatal testosterone
   exposure, influences the likelihood of self-employment. From
   Understanding Society's Innovation Panel Wave 6, we tested separate
   models for 449 males and 525 females, and our results indicate that
   males (respectively, females) with a lower 2D:4D ratio in their left
   hand, or higher prenatal testosterone exposure, have a significantly
   greater (respectively, marginally significant) likelihood of
   self-employment (two-tailed test). Finally, we examine the twin
   testosterone transfer effect in a sample of opposite-sex and same-sex
   twins from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United
   States and provide additional support for the marginally significant
   (two-tailed test) positive association between testosterone and
   self-employment.

AB Over the past 10 years, many healthcare organizations have made
   significant investments in automating their clinical operations, mostly
   through the introduction of advanced information systems. Yet the impact
   of these investments on staffing is still not well understood. In this
   paper, we study the effect of information technology (IT)enabled
   automation on staffing decisions in healthcare facilities. Using unique
   nursing home IT data from 2006 to 2012, we find that the licensed nurse
   staffing level decreases by 5.8% in high-end nursing homes but increases
   by 7.6% in low-end homes after the adoption of automation technology.
   Our research explains this by analyzing the interplay of two competing
   effects of automation: the substitution of technology for labor and the
   leveraging of complementarity between technology and labor. We also find
   that increased automation improves the ratings on clinical quality by
   6.9% and decreases admissions of less profitable residents by 14.7% on
   average. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an
   analytical staffing model that incorporates technology adoption and
   vertical differentiation. Overall, these findings suggest that the
   impact of automation technology on staffing decisions depends crucially
   on a facility's vertical position in the local marketplace.

AB We investigate the factors that affect the growth of Groupon, the
   leading online daily deals platform. We concentrate on the
   online-to-offline (O2O) aspect of the business that differentiates it
   from other e-commerce platforms-its strong connection to local markets.
   We focus on travel cost and store density, the key local characteristics
   that affect consumer deal demand and merchant deal offering. Using a
   comprehensive longitudinal data set on deal offerings and sales across
   local markets, and combining it with local market characteristics, we
   estimate a simultaneous equation model of the weekly number of deal
   offerings and deal sales characterizing the two-sided nature of the
   platform. We find that the word-of-mouth effect on the consumer side and
   the observational learning effect on the merchant side contribute to and
   reinforce the expansion of a two-sided platform. However, a larger
   number of deals intensifies the competition, which then lowers per deal
   sales and limits the number of deal offerings. We find that local
   characteristics have significant impact on both the deal demand and the
   supply side. We further use model simulation to show how differences in
   growth patterns across markets may be driven by local characteristics,
   and we decompose their relative impact on the demand and supply sides.
   The paper provides managerial implications for firms specializing in O2O
   commerce.

AB A paradox in organizational research on judgment and decision making is
   that although the law-of-effect in adaptive learning suggests that
   people's tendency to take a decision decreases after the decision
   receives negative consequences, people often exhibit an opposite action
   pattern of escalation of commitment. To address this paradox, this paper
   proposes that the unit of law-of-effect can be extended from a decision
   level to a strategy level (i.e., a group of planned decisions). A
   strategy organizes decisions from being consistent with the
   law-of-effect in one extreme to being consistent with escalation of
   commitment in another extreme. This paper shows that the favorability of
   the law-ofeffect strategy (versus the escalation strategy) is likely to
   be underestimated at the beginning of a learning process. This
   underestimation stabilizes over time because negative consequences
   decrease the likelihood of choosing the law-of-effect strategy in the
   future. Accordingly, escalation strategy will be preferred more in the
   learning process, thereby developing a pattern of behaviors that is
   contradictory to the law-of-effect at the decision level but consistent
   with the law-of-effect at the strategy level. This learning pattern was
   demonstrated in three simulations with different combinations that were
   specified to capture different aspects of escalation of commitment. This
   learning perspective offers a novel explanation of escalation,
   suggesting that escalation may occur without distorted motivation or
   cognition.

   through performance in field trials for hybrid corn-to examine three
   potential factors that influence citations: (1) improvements in
   performance, (2) citing practices of patent attorneys, and (3) citing
   practices of patent examiners. This analysis reveals that citations are
   robustly correlated with performance, which confirms that citations are
   a useful quality-adjusted measure for innovation. The citing practices
   of patent attorneys and examiners, however, also influence citations.
   Patent attorneys cite early patents, which help establish the
   patentability of an invention; this practice may inflate citation counts
   for early patents, particularly for inventions that have only recently
   become patentable. Attorneys also add self-citations; our analysis
   indicates that self-citations are an indicator of follow-on invention.
   By comparison, examiner-added citations are typically unrelated to

   unclear whether these immigrants perform complementary tasks in addition
   to their substitutive role relative to native graduates. Empirical
   studies examining these questions in a focused setting are scarce,
   principally because of the nonavailability of data. We examine these
   questions using the audit industry as a setting because of the
   availability of client, city, and office characteristic data at each
   audit office. This setting also allows us to answer whether immigration
   can address the growing human capital constraint in the audit industry.
   We find evidence of a complementary role of highly skilled immigrants.
   In addition, our results indicate a reputational spillover of client
   restatements at the audit office level to the labor markets. Our

   behavior on a product category is positively correlated with a consumer
   having high preferences in another category, a firm may want to
   advertise more intensively to those consumers that purchased the former
   category, if possible. This paper finds that this can lead to lower
   prices in the initial category if the annoyance of receiving advertising
   is large, and to higher prices if the annoyance of receiving advertising
   is not too large, as consumers expect a possible additional surplus from
   the category affected by behavior-based advertising. If receiving
   advertising does not yield too much annoyance to consumers, firms end up
   better off due to both higher prices and the increased demand of better
   matching of advertising. Behavior-based advertising may also lead firms
   to sell less in the initial category than without behavior-based
   advertising, as a way to be able to better target the most valuable
   consumers. If the consumer annoyance of receiving advertising is large,
   firms may end up serving only a few consumers initially, as attracting
   more consumers requires prices that are too low, and the initial
   consumers are attracted because of the possibility of lower prices in
   the following period. The paper also investigates the effects of joint
   behavior-based pricing and advertising, and of different firms
   benefiting from the purchase information.

AB In hopes of motivating consumers to provide larger volumes of useful
   reviews, many retailers offer financial incentives. Here, we explore an
   alternative approach, social norms. We inform individuals about the
   volume of reviews authored by peers. We test the effectiveness of using
   financial incentives, social norms, and a combination of both strategies
   in motivating consumers. In two randomized experiments, one in the field
   conducted in partnership with a large online clothing retailer based in
   China and a second on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we compare the
   effectiveness of each strategy in stimulating online reviews in larger
   numbers and of greater length. We find that financial incentives are
   more effective at inducing larger volumes of reviews, but the reviews
   that result are not particularly lengthy, whereas social norms have a
   greater effect on the length of reviews. Importantly, we show that the
   combination of financial incentives and social norms yields the greatest
   overall benefit by motivating reviews in greater numbers and of greater
   length. We further assess treatment-induced self-selection and sentiment
   bias by triangulating the experimental results with findings from an
   observational study.

AB Gaudeul and Sugden [Gaudeul A, Sugden R (2012) Spurious complexity and
   common standards in markets for consumer goods. Economica 79(314):
   209-225] have hypothesized that when some but not all competing products
   are priced in a common standard, consumers who are liable to make errors
   in cross-standard price comparisons use decision rules that discriminate
   in favor of common-standard offers. Such behavior incentivizes sellers
   to use common standards. We report an experimental test of this
   hypothesis, using choice tasks similar to those represented in the
   Gaudeul-Sugden model. We find that offers priced in common standards
   were more likely to be inspected but less likely to be chosen, and that
   subjects gained little benefit from common pricing standards that
   applied to some but not all offers. Most subjects used "dominance
   editing" operations that eliminated transparently dominated offers,
   either as an initial shortlisting device or while offers were being
   sorted. Because these operations discriminate against common-standard
   offers, their use incentivizes sellers not to use common standards.

AB We study the optimal distribution strategy of a supplier with limited
   capacity. The supplier may adopt the supplier-only role, be the solo
   seller in the market, or use the dual-channel strategy and compete with
   its downstream buyer. In comparison to the case of unlimited capacity,
   we show that the supplier, the buyer, and consumers may all benefit from
   the supplier's limited capacity at the same time, leading to a
   "win-winwin" outcome. We also find that, under limited capacity, the
   downstream buyer may order the supplier's entire capacity and
   strategically withhold some supply from being sold to the market even if
   there is no underlying supply-side or demand-side uncertainty. Our
   result points to a new form of strategic purchasing behavior by the
   buyer in the face of upstream and downstream competition. Interestingly,
   we show that while buyer withholding is always beneficial for the
   supplier, it can reduce the buyer's profit under certain cases, although
   total supply chain profit is the first-best outcome. Also, counter to
   conventional antitrust concerns, buyer withholding at times may benefit
   consumers in spite of reduced downstream competition. Finally, in
   contrast to intuition, we find that the supplier's benefit from
   investing in direct selling capability is highest when its capacity size
   is moderate and not large.

AB Whereas most research on network evolution has focused on the role of
   interaction opportunities in the formation of new ties, this paper
   addresses tie decay choices. When the opportunity structure gets
   reorganized, social actors make choices about which ties to retain and
   which to allow to decay, informed by their past experience of the tie. I
   argue that, conditional on changes in opportunity, people (especially
   those with Machiavellian personalities) choose to retain ties to
   valuable contacts, they retain reciprocated ties (especially with highly
   empathic others), and they retain socially embedded ties (especially if
   they are low self-monitors). The empirical design, which exploits a
   randomized natural experiment, confirms these hypotheses and suggests
   that our understanding of tie decay choices-and, consequently, of
   network evolution-is enhanced by an integrated theoretical perspective
   that encompasses both social structure and social psychology.

AB Bringing a new product to market involves both a creative ideation stage
   and an execution stage. When time-to-market constraints are binding,
   important questions are how to divide limited time between the two
   stages and who should make this decision. We introduce a laboratory
   experiment that closely resembles this setting: it features a product
   development task with an open design space, a downstream cost increase,
   and two development stages. We show that performance is significantly
   worse when designers choose for themselves when to transition from
   ideation to execution and that decision control explains a large share
   of performance variation even after controlling for individual
   differences. How the time is allocated between ideation and execution
   does not affect mean performance, but later transition increases risk.
   One driver of poor design outcomes in the designer-initiated transition
   regime are delays in physical construction and testing of designs. We
   show that such delays can be prevented by "nudging" designers toward
   early prototyping. However, the most important performance driver is the
   lack of task structure in endogenous regimes, which can be remedied by
   demanding a concrete, performance-oriented deliverable prior to a
   transition.

   Using a nine-country panel and instrumental variables methods, we
   present evidence that near-term(one-year) rational forecasts of future
   movements in ARM rates do affect mortgage choice, particularly in more
   recent data since 2001. However, longer-term (three-year) rational
   forecasts of ARM rates have a relatively weak effect, and the current
   spread between FRM and ARM rates also matters, suggesting that
   households are concerned with current interest costs as well as with
   lifetime cost minimization. These conclusions are robust to alternative
   (adaptive and survey-based) models of household expectations.

AB Stocks with higher forecast dispersion earn lower future returns and
   have a greater upward bias in the mean reported earnings forecast in

   more transparent information environments, more developed stock markets,
   stronger investor protection, greater capital openness, and more intense
   usage of analysts' earnings forecasts. Using the 1997-1998 Asian
   financial crisis as a natural experiment, we find that both phenomena
   become weaker postcrisis in Malaysia, which imposed capital controls,
   relative to Thailand and South Korea, which opened their financial
   markets to foreigners. These results suggest that analysts in countries
   with greater demand for their forecasts and hence greater concerns for

AB We investigate the efficacy of monetary and relational incentives for
   managing the quality of a product in a two-tier supply chain. In our
   setting, a retailer offers a supplier contract terms for a product,
   where the product can be low or high quality. The supplier can choose to
   exert high effort, which is costly but guarantees high quality, or low
   effort, which does not assure high quality with certainty. We compare
   how monetary incentives, such as a bonus that is paid to the supplier
   when high quality is received by the retailer, and relational
   incentives, such as the two parties engaging in a long-term relationship
   where there is the threat of punishment, affect overall quality and
   supply chain efficiency. Two of our primary results suggest that (1)
   relational incentives improve both quality and supply chain efficiency,
   regardless of whether a monetary incentive is present, and (2) when
   relational incentives are present, the impact of adding monetary
   incentives is nonmonotonic: less efficient monetary incentives appear to
   crowd out the benefits of relational incentives leading even to a
   reduction in supply chain efficiency, whereas more efficient monetary
   incentives actually complement relational incentives and lead to
   significant increases in both quality and supply chain efficiency. We
   then proceed by demonstrating that a behavioral model of fairness can
   organize the data quite well.

AB We develop a framework to model the shopping and consumption decisions
   of forward-looking consumers. Assuming that the consumer's future
   utility for each product alternative can be characterized by a standard
   random utility model, we use dynamic programming to determine the
   optimal consumption policy and the maximum expected value of consuming
   any n substitutable products selected while shopping (an n-pack). We
   propose two models. In the first (canonical) model, we assume that an
   alternative is consumed on each successive consumption occasion and
   obtain a closed-form optimal policy and a closed-form value function.
   Given a consumer's preferences for the product alternatives in an
   assortment, we then show how to identify that consumer's optimal n-pack
   using a simple swapping algorithm that converges in at most n swaps. In
   the second (generalized) model, we introduce an outside option so that a
   product alternative need not be consumed on each consumption occasion.
   We obtain a closed-form value function for the generalized model and
   show that its optimal n-pack is related to that of the canonical model
   using a special type of majorization. Additional structural properties
   and implications of each model are explored, as are other applications.

AB Every attribute can be expressed in multiple ways. For example, car fuel
   economy can be expressed as fuel efficiency ("miles per gallon"), fuel
   cost in dollars, or tons of greenhouse gases emitted. Each expression,
   or "translation," highlights a different aspect of the same attribute.
   We describe a new mechanism whereby translated attributes can serve as
   decision "signposts" because they (1) activate otherwise dormant
   objectives, such as proenvironmental values and goals, and (2) direct
   the person toward the option that best achieves the activated objective.
   Across three experiments, we provide evidence for the occurrence of such
   signpost effects as well as the underlying psychological mechanism. We
   demonstrate that expressing an attribute such as fuel economy in terms
   of multiple translations can increase preference for the option that is
   better aligned with objectives congruent with this attribute (e.g., the
   more fuel-efficient car for those with proenvironmental attitudes), even
   when the new information is derivable from other known attributes. We
   discuss how using translated attributes appropriately can help align a
   person's choices with their personal objectives.

AB Do monetary incentives encourage volunteering? Or, do they introduce
   concerns about appearing greedy and crowd out the motivation to
   volunteer? Since the importance of such image concerns is normally
   unobserved, the answer is theoretically unclear, and corresponding
   empirical evidence is mixed. To help counter this ambiguity, this paper
   proposes that the importance of image concerns-such as the desire to
   appear prosocial and not to appear greedy-relates to individuals'
   volunteer reputations. Experimental results support this possibility.
   Individuals with past histories of volunteering are less responsive to
   image concerns if their histories are public, or if their prosocial
   tendencies are already known. Consistent with a decreased importance of
   appearing prosocial, they are less likely to volunteer. Consistent with
   a decreased importance of not appearing greedy, they are less likely to
   be discouraged by public incentives.

AB This paper examines patient preferences and choice behavior in
   scheduling medical appointments. We conduct four discrete choice
   experiments on two distinct populations and identify several
   "operational" attributes (e.g., delay to care and choice of doctor) that
   affect patient choice. We observe an interesting gender effect with
   respect to how patients trade off speed (delay to care) and quality
   (doctor of choice), and demonstrate that risk attitudes mediate the
   impact of gender on the perception of speed and quality. Specifically,
   females (versus males) are more averse to not seeing their own doctor,
   and, when delay to care is relatively long, females perceive greater
   utility loss than males. As many operational strategies in outpatient
   care aim to improve the patient experience by making trade-offs between
   speed and quality, we make suggestions for when managers should
   intervene to improve their practice and how such interventions might
   look based on the patient mix and current delay level.

AB We show that appropriate dynamic pricing strategies can be used to draw
   benefits from the presence of consumers who strategically time their
   purchase even if the arrival process is not known. In our model, a
   seller sells a stock of objects to a stream of randomly arriving
   long-lived agents. Agents are privately informed about their values, and
   about their arrival time to the market. The seller needs to learn about
   future demand from past arrivals. We characterize the revenue-maximizing
   direct mechanism. While the optimal mechanism cannot be reduced to
   posted prices (and requires personalized prices), we also present a
   simple, "learn and then sell" mechanism that is able to extract a large
   fraction of the maximal revenue. In this mechanism, the seller first
   charges a relatively low price that allows learning about the arrival
   process, and in a second stage, the seller charges the optimal posted
   price given the previously obtained information.

AB We argue in this paper that firms with foreign operations misallocate
   capital and underperform when they face political instability abroad. We
   develop and test a dynamic model of firm capital allocation under
   foreign political instability. The model shows that as a political
   regime becomes less stable, independent of whether the regime becomes
   less business-friendly or more business-friendly, firms invest
   suboptimally (i.e., they either overinvest or underinvest), and their
   marginal q's diverge further from an optimal level. Using elections and
   textual analysis of local media during national elections, we construct
   a novel index of political instability. We find that U.S. firms and
   industries with a greater exposure to election-induced political
   instability experience disruptions of investment efficiency that lead to
   lower valuations and lower total factor productivity. Therefore,
   international trade is a significant conduit of foreign political
   instability into U.S. markets.

AB In this paper, we extend the understanding of versioning strategy of an
   information goods monopolist and provide new insights on when versioning
   is optimal. To do so, we derive the optimal product line or versions of
   an information good and the corresponding prices. By relaxing common
   assumptions on consumers' usage costs, versioning costs and capital
   research and development costs, we provide new insights as well as
   reconcile extant findings on versioning. For a good with
   no-free-disposal (NFD), i.e., one where consumers have usage costs, our
   results show that a monopolist's marginal cost and consumers' usage
   costs have the same impact on its versioning strategy, and that these
   factors are the sole reason for optimality of versioning of information
   goods. By endogenizing the production of the highest-quality, we show
   that capital costs create a downward distortion of quality even for the
   highest types in the market even under full information. Presence of
   separate versioning costs also lowers the qualities served to the high
   types and reduces the segment of consumers who are served with product
   versions. However, versioning costs do not affect market coverage or the
   price-quality menu itself. Further, when some of the consumer usage
   costs are absorbed by the firm (as in case of cloud-based provisioning),
   it does not necessarily lead to market expansion.

AB This paper studies the effect of learning information on people's
   attitudes toward ambiguity. We propose a method to separate ambiguity
   attitudes from subjective probabilities and to decompose ambiguity
   attitudes into two components. Under models like prospect theory that
   represent ambiguity through nonadditive decision weights, these
   components reflect pessimism and likelihood insensitivity. Under
   multiple priors models, they reflect ambiguity aversion and perceived
   ambiguity. We apply our method in an experiment where we elicit the ask
   prices of options with payoffs depending on the returns of initial
   public offerings (IPOs) on the New York Stock Exchange. IPOs are a
   natural context to study the effect of learning, as prior information
   about their returns is unavailable. Subjects perceived substantial
   ambiguity and they were insensitive to likelihood information. We
   observed only little pessimism and ambiguity aversion. Subjective
   probabilities were well calibrated and close to the true frequencies.
   Subjects' behavior moved toward expected utility with more information,
   but substantial deviations remained even in the maximum information
   condition.

AB Capital gains taxation has important implications for investors'

   continuous time investment and consumption model with capital gains tax,
   Epstein-Zin recursive utility, and regime switching. We find that
   various factors, such as tax rate, risk aversion, interest rate, stock
   return, and volatility, jointly affect optimal portfolio allocation,
   whereas intertemporal substitution does not. In a regime switching
   market, investors may trade or stop trading purely because of a change
   in regime, and there is a distinct cross-regime effect on optimal
   portfolio allocation. In particular, investors tend to raise stock
   investment in a bear regime so as to reduce potential tax payments upon
   regime switching. Given reasonable parameter values, regime switching
   has a greater impact on optimal portfolio allocation in a bear regime
   than in a bull regime.

   that incumbent firms invest in physical capacity when threatened with a

   Consistent with an entry-deterrence motive, incumbents respond to the
   threat of entry when entry is uncertain, but not when entry is assured.
   The average capacity expansion of 2,300 square feet is associated with a
   6.8-percentage-point greater likelihood that the entry plan fails. These
   findings show that investments in deterrence are viable, especially when
   new entrants face other significant barriers to entry.

AB Motivated by the trend toward more collaboration in workflows, we study
   networks where some tasks require the simultaneous processing by
   multiple types of multitasking human or indivisible resources. The
   capacity of such networks is generally smaller than the bottleneck
   capacity. In Gurvich and Van Mieghem [Gurvich I, Van Mieghem JA (2015)
   Collaboration and multitasking in networks: Architectures, bottlenecks,
   and capacity. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management 17(1): 16-33], we
   proved that both capacities are equal in networks with a hierarchical
   collaboration architecture, which define a collaboration level for each
   task depending on how many types of resources it requires. This paper
   studies how task prioritization impacts the achievable capacity of such
   hierarchical networks using a conceptual queueing framework that
   formalizes coordination and switching idleness. To maximize the capacity
   of a collaborative network, highest priority must be given to the tasks
   that require the most collaboration. Otherwise, a mismatch between
   priority levels and collaboration levels inevitably inflicts a capacity
   loss. We demonstrate this fundamental tension between flexibility in
   task prioritization (ability to adjust quality of service) and capacity
   (productivity) in a basic collaborative network and in parallel
   networks. To manage this trade-off, we present a hierarchical threshold
   priority policy that balances switching and coordination idleness.

AB We study a multiserver queueing model of a revenue-maximizing firm
   providing a service to a market of heterogeneous price-and
   delay-sensitive customers with private individual preferences. The firm
   may offer a selection of service classes that are differentiated in
   prices and delays. Using a deterministic relaxation, which simplifies
   the problem by preserving the economic aspects of price-and-delay
   differentiation while ignoring queueing delays, we construct a solution
   to the fully stochastic problem that is incentive compatible and near
   optimal in systems with large capacity and market potential. Our
   approach provides several new insights for large-scale systems: (i) the
   deterministic analysis captures all pricing, differentiation, and delay
   characteristics of the stochastic solution that are nonnegligible at
   large scale; (ii) service differentiation is optimal when the less
   delay-sensitive market segment is sufficiently elastic; (iii) the use of
   "strategic delay" depends on system capacity and market
   heterogeneity-and it contributes significant delay when the system
   capacity is underutilized or when the firm offers three or more service
   classes; and (iv) connecting economic optimization to queueing theory,
   the revenue-optimized system has the premium class operating in a
   "quality-driven" regime and the lower-tier service classes operating
   with noticeable delays that arise either endogenously
   ("efficiency-driven" regime) or with the addition of strategic delay by
   the service provider.

AB Despite heated debate about the pros and cons of online physician
   ratings, little systematic work has examined the correlation between
   physicians' online ratings and their actual medical quality. Using the
   ratings of cardiac surgeons at RateMDs and the patient outcomes of
   coronary artery bypass graft surgeries in the 2013 Florida Hospital
   Inpatient Discharge Data, we investigate whether online ratings are
   informative about physicians' medical quality. To account for
   potentially nonrandom matchings of patients of different severity levels
   to surgeons of different rating categories, we focus on patients who
   arrived through the emergency department and explicitly consider how
   observed and unobserved patient health conditions jointly affect the
   matching arrangements and surgical outcomes. Both reduced form and
   two-stage estimation results show that, compared with surgeons rated
   four stars or higher, or those without rating information, lower rated
   surgeons are associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality
   rates. Our findings suggest that online physician ratings could be a
   valuable information source for patients to learn about physician
   quality, at least for cardiac surgeons, a specialty for which treatment
   outcomes are relatively observable to patients and their family members.

   with strong incentives to build a reputation (i.e., those who did not
   attend a top 10 university and those employed at small funds) are
   significantly more likely to share recommendations. Our findings
   indicate that analysts who share ideas are more likely to change jobs
   and that the likelihood of employment change is positively related to
   the ratings provided by peers. We also document that analyst
   recommendations generate significant returns when they are posted on

   Long-window returns are particularly strong for contrarian buy
   recommendations and for most sell recommendations. Overall, we show that

   the left censoring of device-version-specific experience variables that
   is a common problem in highly granular experience data, using maximum
   simulated likelihood estimation with simulation over unobservables
   conditional on observables. Even for experienced surgeons, the first use
   of certain device versions can result in at least a 32.4% increase in
   surgery duration, hurting quality and productivity. Furthermore, with
   the passage of time, surgeons can forget knowledge gained about the use
   of particular devices. For certain devices, when the time gap between
   repeat uses increases from its median to its 75th percentile, surgery
   duration increases by about 3.4%. The high productivity and quality
   costs associated with device variety suggest that the gain from a new

   We examine whether public RPF could be leveraged to facilitate adoption
   of best practices in an organization by enabling the validation of best
   practices shared by identifiable top performers. We use data from two
   emergency departments, both of which shared best practices for improving
   productivity and one of which changed from privately to publicly
   disclosing RPF to physicians. The public disclosure of RPF allowed
   workers to identify their top-performing coworkers, which in turn
   enabled the identification and validation of best practices within the
   work group. We find that the intervention is associated with a 10.9%
   improvement in physician productivity. We also find evidence for a
   significant reduction in variation in productivity across providers,
   which stems from bottom-ranked workers exhibiting differentially large
   improvements in productivity. These effects hold without sacrificing
   system-level performance, service quality, or worker attrition. Our
   results suggest that public disclosure of RPF, along with the validation
   of the best practices being shared, can improve worker productivity.

AB How would the growing prevalence of real-time delay information affect a
   service system? We consider a single-server queueing system where
   customers arrive according to a Poisson process and the service time
   follows an exponential distribution. There are two streams of customers,
   one informed about real-time delay and the other uninformed. The
   customers' uninformed behavior may be due to information ignorance or
   rational behavior in the presence of an information fee. We characterize
   the equilibrium behavior of customers with information heterogeneity and
   investigate how the presence of a larger fraction of informed customers
   affects the system performance measures, i.e., throughput and social
   welfare. We show that the effects of growing information prevalence on
   system performance measures are determined by the equilibrium joining
   behavior of uninformed customers. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that
   throughput and social welfare can be unimodal in the fraction of
   informed customers. In other words, some amount of information
   heterogeneity in the population can lead to more efficient outcomes, in
   terms of the system throughput or social welfare, than information
   homogeneity. For example, under a very mild condition, throughput in a
   system with an offered load of 1 will always suffer if there are more
   than 58% of informed customers in the population. Moreover, it is shown
   that for an overloaded system with offered load sufficiently higher than
   1, social welfare always reaches its maximum when some fraction of
   customers is uninformed of the congestion level in real time.

   provider. We show that under the two-part tariff, when effort is
   private, the provider can achieve the same profit as under public effort
   by contracting on reported effort and will be worse off by contracting
   on outcome. Under the hourly-rate contract, compared with the public
   effort case, the provider may be better or worse off in keeping effort
   private and contracting on the reported effort, and the trade-off is
   affected by the degree of outcome uncertainty in a nontrivial way. We

AB We study threshold discounting, or the practice of offering a
   discounted-price service if at least a prespecified number of customers
   signal interest in it, as pioneered by Groupon. We model a
   capacity-constrained firm, a random-sized population of strategic
   customers, a desirable hot period, and a less desirable slow period.
   Compared to a more traditional approach (slow period discounting or
   closure), threshold discounting has two operational advantages. First,
   the contingent discount temporally balances demand when the market for
   the service is large, and reduces supply of the service (preserving
   higher margins) when the market is small, allowing the firm to respond
   to the service's unobserved market potential. Second, activation of the
   threshold discount signals the market state and the consequent service
   availability to strategic customers, inducing them into self-selecting
   the consumption period to one that improves the firm's capacity
   utilization. Yet, threshold discounting can be harmful in situations
   with chronically low demand. In contrast with past work on strategic
   customers, their presence is advantageous to firms in our context. A
   calibrated numerical study shows that threshold discounting improves
   firm profits over a traditional approach by as much as 33% (7% on
   average).

AB We study the price-setting behavior in a competitive market for used
   cars and provide empirical evidence for coarse information processing.
   Based on detailed field data from one of Europe's largest online
   marketplaces for automotive vehicles, we document systematic and sizable
   price discontinuities at salient car-age and mileage thresholds. The
   price difference between two otherwise identical cars across
   registration years (where one was first registered in January and the
   other in December of the previous year) is up to five times larger than
   that between two cars first registered in any two subsequent months
   within a registration year. A similar pattern can be observed in the
   mileage dimension at 10,000-km odometer marks, which is in line with
   earlier findings in the literature. Being able to study discontinuities
   along two dimensions of the same good allows us to further our
   understanding toward a more general notion of inattentive behavior.
   While our results are compatible with a behavioral model of limited
   attention, we also provide evidence for a more traditional explanation
   based on search frictions.

AB Firms are increasingly selling through both offline and online channels,
   allowing customers to experience the touch and feel of product
   attributes before purchasing those products. Consequently, the selection
   of products offered offline affects the demand in both channels. We
   address how firms should select an optimal offline assortment to
   maximize profits across both channels; we call this the showcase
   decision problem. We incorporate the impact of physical evaluation on
   preferences into the consumer demand model. Under this model, we show
   that the decision problem is NP-hard. Analytically, we derive optimal
   results for special cases and near-optimal approximations for general
   cases. Empirically, we use conjoint analysis to identify changes in
   consumer preferences resulting from physically evaluating products. For
   this application, we demonstrate gains in expected revenue of up to 40%
   due to accounting for the impact of offline assortment on the online
   sales.

AB Previous research has documented a behavioral distinction between
   "social risk," or risk caused by human factors, and natural risk. In
   particular, people tend to demand a premium on the probability of a
   favorable outcome in order to expose themselves to a social source of
   risk rather than a natural source of risk. Several explanations for what
   drives this social risk premium have been offered-most prominently, (i)
   an aversion to a counterparty's potentially malign intentions and (ii) a
   more general aversion to ceding control to someone with conflicting
   interests. We propose that a fundamental determinant of the social risk
   premium may relate to a counterparty's capacity to engage in intentional
   action. We employ a between-subjects experimental design in which we
   manipulate subjects' capacity for intentional action. Our design allows
   us to identify the component of the social risk premium related to an
   aversion to betrayal, independent of any aversion to ceding control.
   Furthermore, our results show that intentions are a crucial determinant
   of the social risk premium. We identify factors that eliminate, and may
   even change the sign of, the social risk premium. Our results contribute
   to our understanding of the factors that influence the perception of
   social risk and have implications for optimal contract design in a wide
   variety of situations involving social risk.

AB We study how digital service firms can develop an active customer base,
   focusing on two questions. First, how does the way that customers use
   the service postadoption to meet their own needs (personal usage) and to
   interact with one another (social usage) vary across customer
   acquisition methods? Second, how do firm-to-customer and
   customer-to-customer communications promote different types of usage? We
   study these questions using two data sets and by developing a
   multivariate hierarchical Poisson hidden Markov model (HMM), which fits
   the data significantly better than univariate and latent class
   approaches. We indeed find that postadoption behavior varies depending
   on customer acquisition method and dynamic states. At the total usage
   level, in one context (an annotation and note-taking service), customers
   who heard about the service through search and mass-invite exhibited
   significantly higher usage compared to those who joined through word of
   mouth (WOM), whereas in another context (a cloud-based file storage
   service), customers who joined through WOM referrals tended to exhibit
   higher usage. Yet, examining how routes of adoption relate to specific
   types of behavior, personal versus social usages, reveals a more nuanced
   picture. Furthermore, in both contexts, communications postadoption
   influenced engagement, albeit in different ways. Firm-to-customer
   communications, through company posts to Twitter and blog entries, had
   varying effects on customer behavior and in some cases led to lower
   personal and/or social usage; however, customer-to-customer
   communications tended to increase personal-use engagement across latent
   states and in both data sets. The findings suggest that firms offering
   digital services should pay attention to how the mode of customer
   acquisition is related to subsequent usage intensity, accounting for
   both personal and social activity, and encourage customers to interact
   with each other postadoption.

AB A retailer following a competition-based dynamic-pricing strategy tracks
   competitors' price changes and then must answer the following questions:
   (i) Should we respond? (ii) If so, to whom? (iii) How much of a
   response? (iv) And on which products? The answers require unbiased
   measures of price elasticity as well as accurate estimates of competitor
   significance and the extent to which consumers compare prices across
   retailers. There are two key challenges to quantify these factors
   empirically: first, the endogeneity associated with almost any type of
   observational data, where prices are correlated with demand shocks
   observable to pricing managers but not to researchers, and second, the
   absence of competitor sales information, which prevents efficient
   estimation of a full consumer-choice model. We address the first issue
   by conducting a field experiment with randomized prices. We resolve the
   second issue by exploiting the retailer's own and competitors' stockouts
   as a source of variation to the consumer choice set, in addition to
   variations in competitors' prices. We estimate an empirical model
   capturing consumer choices among substitutable products from multiple
   retailers. Based on the estimates, we propose and test a best-response
   pricing strategy through a carefully controlled live experiment that
   lasts five weeks. The experiment documents an 11% revenue increase while
   maintaining a margin above a retailer-specified target.

AB Electronic health records (EHR) are often presumed to reduce the
   significant and accelerating healthcare costs in the United States.
   However, evidence on the relationship between EHR adoption and costs is
   mixed, leading to skepticism about the effectiveness of EHR in
   decreasing costs. We argue that simply looking at the hospital-level
   effects can be misleading because the benefits of EHR can go beyond the
   adopting hospital by creating regional spillovers via information and
   patient sharing. When patients move between hospitals, timely and
   high-quality records received at one hospital can affect the costs of
   care at another hospital. We provide evidence that although EHR adoption
   increases the costs of the adopting hospital, it has significant
   spillover effects by reducing the costs of neighboring hospitals. We
   further show that these spillovers are linked to information and patient
   sharing. Specifically, the spillovers are stronger when more hospitals
   in the region are in health information exchange networks and in the
   same integrated delivery systems, which can share information more
   easily. Furthermore, utilizing regional characteristics that can affect
   the extent of patient sharing such as urban versus rural areas,
   population density, average distance between hospitals, and hospital
   density, we find that locations with higher patient and hospital
   concentration experience stronger regional spillovers. Additionally,
   spillovers are stronger after the HITECH (Health Information Technology
   for Economic and Clinical Health) Act that increased EHR adoption and
   use. Overall, our findings suggest that we need to take into account
   externalities to understand the benefits of health IT investments and
   form policy decisions.

AB Regulatory agencies, auditing firms, and supply chain partners
   externally promote change in firms. To this end, they commonly employ
   two different and somewhat contradictory intervention approaches. One
   approach uses punitive tactics to coerce firms to change, while the
   other approach uses supportive tactics to encourage change. Using the
   context of government agencies promoting environmental improvements in
   firms, we examine whether such punitive (e.g., regulatory inspections
   with possible sanctions) and supportive (e.g., environmental assistance,
   improvement recommendations) tactics can be administered in a
   complementary manner. Using a unique and novel longitudinal data set
   collected from two state-level environmental agencies in Minnesota, we
   analyze over 1,000 supportive environmental improvement (EI) projects in
   combination with intermittent (but currently uncoordinated) punitive
   tactics. One key finding from our research is that the timing, severity,
   and relatedness of punitive tactics is critical for directing managerial
   attention and thus improving the efficacy of supportive tactics (i.e.,
   EI implementation). Contingent on their timing, inspections can increase
   EI implementation rates by up to 60% but can also reduce implementation
   rates by up to 50% compared with Els in facilities that do not
   experience inspections. Classifying regulatory inspections as (1) either
   clean or adverse and (2) either related or unrelated allows us to
   further explain the influence of such punitive tactics on EI
   implementation. Finally, we provide evidence for a positive effect of
   successful EI implementation on long-term environmental compliance.

AB In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for a subscription service.
   The evolution over time of the number of subscribers is governed by a
   differential equation combining two processes-namely, a customer
   acquisition process and a customer attrition process. Assuming
   profit-maximization behavior of the firm, we use dynamic programming to
   optimize the customer equity and determine optimal customer relationship
   marketing expenditures. We implement an augmented Kalman filter with
   continuous state and discrete observations to estimate the model's
   parameters using market data of two well-known companies in the
   telecommunications sector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first paper to model acquisition and retention efforts in the context of
   a diffusion model. By doing so, we extend the literature on product
   diffusion to services- that is, beyond its traditional area of durable
   (and occasionally nondurable) products. By the same token, we contribute
   to the literature on customer relationship marketing (CRM), where social
   interactions have been overlooked. Our analytical and numerical results
   provide a better understanding of the relationships among the optimal
   customer equity, the customer lifetime value, the prospect lifetime
   value, and the optimal acquisition and retention spending. Our model and
   estimation approach give the tools for assessing empirically the role of
   CRM spending, social interactions, and other factors in the service
   subscription dynamics. Our main empirical results are as follows: (i)
   CRM spending and external incentives have indeed a significant effect on
   acquisition and retention processes; (ii) the impact of CRM is market
   specific; (iii) compared with optimal levels, both firms underinvest in
   retention; and (iv) whereas we observe increasing spending in
   acquisition over time, the derived optimal policy recommends a
   decreasing level of spending over time.

AB In a contest in which solvers with heterogeneous expertise exert effort
   to develop solutions, a recent paper [Terwiesch C, Xu Y (2008)
   Innovation contests, open innovation, and multiagent problem solving.
   Management Sci. 54(9):1529-1543] argues that as more solvers enter the
   contest, every solver will reduce effort due to a lower probability of
   winning the contest. This paper corrects mistakes in this theory, and
   shows that there exist high-expertise solvers who may raise their effort
   in response to increased competition. This is because more entrants
   raise the expected best performance among other solvers, creating
   positive incentives for solvers to exert higher effort to win the
   contest. Because of this positive effect, we find that a free-entry open
   contest is more likely to be optimal to a contest organizer than what
   Terwiesch and Xu (2008) and other prior literature asserted.

AB The new perspective emerging from strategy's value-capture stream is
   that the effects of competition are twofold: competition for an agent
   bounds its performance from below, while that for its transaction
   partners bounds from above. Thus, assessing the intensity of competition
   on either side is essential to understanding firm performance. Yet, the
   literature provides no formal notion of "competitive intensity" with
   which to make such assessments. Rather, some authors use added value as
   their central analytic concept, others the core. Added value is simple
   but misses the crucial, for-an-agent side of competition. The core is
   theoretically complete but difficult to interpret and empirically
   intractable. This paper formalizes three, increasingly general notions
   of competitive intensity, all of which improve on added value while
   avoiding the complexity of the core. We analyze markets characterized by
   disjoint networks of agents (e.g., supply chains), providing several
   insights into competition and new tools for empirical work.

   sellers' pricing decisions and auction outcomes in the context of such
   multichannel retailing. Our analytical model provides a framework for
   studying how characteristics of the demand in an offline retail sales
   channel impact the seller's optimal reserve price in the auction
   channel, the probability that an auction ends in a sale, the probability
   that an item is sold through the auction channel, and the auction
   expected sale price. We then utilize data from eBay Motors auctions and
   examine empirically how the quality of a sellers' retail location
   impacts the seller's auctions outcomes. The results of our empirical

AB Many empirical studies focusing on how prior outcomes affect subsequent
   risk taking report conclusions that appear mutually contradictory. While
   some studies document increased risk taking after gains and risk
   aversion after losses, others report the opposite. This paper
   contributes to this literature by investigating horse race bettors'
   sequential risky decisions using individual-level data. A horse race
   betting market is a laboratory-like environment and can be used to
   analyze behavioral patterns associated with decision making under risk.
   We find evidence for (i) the "house money effect" as bettors take
   riskier wagers after gains and mostly spend the money they have won;
   (ii) risk aversion after prior losses, which we label a "playing safe
   effect"; and (iii) a preference for breakeven. Contrary to the widely
   held conception in the empirical literature, our findings suggest that
   the "break-even effect" does not necessarily imply an increased
   preference for riskier bets because bettors may seek to break even with
   less risky wagers.

   simple and well-defined generalization of expected utility theory in
   which utility depends on the range of lottery outcomes. Second, a
   special case of this framework is proposed for prediction. It is based
   on applying a single utility function (decision utility) to every
   normalized lottery range. The resultant decision utility model predicts
   well-known expected utility paradoxes without recourse to probability
   weighting. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the model to satisfy
   monotonicity with respect to first-order stochastic dominance are
   identified. The typical decision utility function, which is confirmed by
   both experimental data and normative considerations, is S shaped.

   addition, we find that investors place a greater value on new
   information in analyst reports when managers face greater incentives to
   withhold value-relevant information. Analyst interpretation is
   particularly valuable when the processing costs of conference call
   information increase. Finally, we document that investors react to
   analyst report content that simply confirms managers' conference call
   discussions. Overall, our study shows that analysts play the information
   intermediary roles by discovering information beyond corporate

AB Using hand-collected data on division manager (DM) pay contracts, we
   document that DM pay is related to the performance of both the DM's
   division and the other divisions in the firm. There is substantial
   heterogeneity in DM pay for performance. DM pay for division performance
   is lower in industries with less informative accounting earnings. DM pay
   is more sensitive to other-division performance if the DM's division is
   related to the rest of the firm, if the DM's division has fewer growth
   opportunities, and if the DM's division receives less capital from the
   rest of the firm. Consistent with optimal contracting view, DMs receive
   greater pay for other-division performance in better-governed firms.
   Overall, our evidence suggests that DM compensation is structured to
   account for the information and agency problems in multidivision firms.

AB This paper examines whether agency conflicts during venture capital (VC)
   fundraising impact investment behavior. Using novel investment-level
   decisions of VCs in the process of raising new funds, we find that
   venture capitalists take actions hidden from their investors-i.e.,
   limited partners (LPs)-that delay revealing negative information about
   VC fund performance until after a new fund is raised. After fundraising
   is complete, write-offs double and reinvestments in relatively worse-off
   entrepreneurial firms increase. We find that these observations cannot
   be explained by strategic bundling of news or effort constraints due to
   the newly raised fund. Funds with both long and short fundraising track
   record exhibit this behavior and the delay is costly for fund investors
   (LPs). This strategic delay shows that fundraising incentives have real
   impacts on VC fund investment decisions, which are often difficult for
   LPs to observe.

AB This paper investigates the role of institutional trading in the
   emergence of hedge fund activism-an important corporate governance
   mechanism. We demonstrate that institutional sales raise a firm's
   probability of becoming an activist target. Furthermore, by exploiting
   the funding circumstances of individual institutions, we establish that
   such effects occur through a liquidity channel, i.e., the activist
   camouflages his purchases among other institutions' liquidity sales.
   Additional evidence supports our conclusion. First, activist purchases
   closely track institutional sales at the daily frequency. Second, such
   synchronicity is stronger among targets with lower expected monitoring
   benefits, suggesting that gains from trading with other institutions
   supplement these benefits in the activist's targeting decision. Finally,
   we find that institutional sales accelerate the timing of a campaign at
   firms already followed by activists rather than attract attention to
   unlikely targets. Taken together, our findings offer a novel empirical
   perspective on the liquidity theories of activism; while activists
   screen firms on the basis of fundamentals, they pick specific targets at
   a particular time by exploiting institutional liquidity shocks.

AB Proxy advisory firms wield large influence with voting shareholders.
   However, conflicts of interest may arise when an advisor sells services
   to both investors and issuers. Using a unique data set on voting
   recommendations, I find that for most types of proposals, competition
   from a new entrant reduces favoritism toward management by an incumbent
   advisor that serves both corporations and investors. The results are not
   driven by factors that influence the entrant's coverage decision, such
   as the marginal cost of new coverage or previously biased
   recommendations by the incumbent. Similar to other information
   intermediaries, biased advice by proxy advisors is shown to have real,
   negative consequences that allow management to enjoy greater private
   benefits. These results suggest conflicts of interest are a real concern
   in the proxy advisory industry, and increasing competition could help
   alleviate them.

AB Online labor marketplaces facilitate the efficient matching of employers
   and workers across geographical boundaries. The exponential growth of
   this nascent online phenomenon holds important social and economic
   implications, as the hiring decisions made on these online platforms
   implicate the incomes of millions of workers worldwide. Despite this
   importance, limited effort has been devoted to understanding whether
   potential hiring biases exist in online labor platforms and how they may
   affect hiring outcomes. Using a novel proprietary data set from a
   leading online labor platform, we investigate the impact of gender-based
   stereotypes on hiring outcomes. After accounting for endogeneity via a
   holistic set of job and worker controls, a matched sample approach, and
   a quasi-experimental technique, we find evidence of a positive hiring
   bias in favor of female workers. An experiment was used to uncover the
   underlying gender-specific traits that could influence hiring outcomes.
   We find that the observed hiring bias diminishes as employers gain more
   hiring experience on the platform. In addition, the female hiring bias
   appears to stem solely from the consideration of applicants from
   developing countries, and not those from developed countries.
   Subanalyses show that women are preferred in feminine-typed occupations
   while men do not enjoy higher hiring likelihoods in masculine-typed
   occupations. We also find that female employers are more susceptible to
   the female hiring bias compared to male employers. Our findings provide
   key insights for several groups of stakeholders including policy makers,
   platform owners, hiring managers, and workers. Managerial and practical
   implications are discussed.

AB Online customer service chats provide new opportunities for firms to
   interact with their customers and have become increasingly popular in
   recent years for firms of all sizes. One reason for their popularity is
   the ability for customer service agents to multitask (i.e., interact
   with multiple customers at a time) thereby increasing the system
   "through-put" and agent productivity. Yet little is known about how
   multitasking impacts customer satisfaction-the ultimate goal of customer
   engagements. We address this question using a proprietary data set from
   an S&P 500 service firm that documents agent multitasking activities
   (unobservable to customers) in the form of server logs, customer service
   chat transcripts, and postservice customer surveys. We find that agent
   multitasking leads to longer in-service delays for customers and lower
   problem resolution rates. Both lead to lower customer satisfaction,
   although the impact varies for different customers. Our study is among
   the first to document the link between multitasking and customer
   satisfaction, and it has implications for the design of agent time
   allocation in contact centers and more broadly for how firms can best
   manage customer relations in new service channels enabled by information
   technology.

AB We study how queue configuration affects human servers' service time by
   comparing dedicated queues with shared queues using field data from a
   natural experiment in a supermarket. We hypothesize that queue
   configuration may affect servers' service rate through several
   mechanisms: pooling may affect service rate directly as a result of
   social loafing effect and competition effect and indirectly via its
   impact on queue length. To investigate these impacts, we take advantage
   of the supermarket's checkout layout and use a data set containing both
   checkout transaction details and queue information collected from video
   recordings in the supermarket. After we control for the queue length, we
   find that servers in dedicated queues are about 10.7% faster than those
   in shared queues, mainly because of the social loafing effect. We also
   demonstrate that pooling has an indirect negative effect on service time
   through its impact on queue length. In addition, the queue
   configuration's direct effect and its indirect queue length effect
   function independently of each other. In aggregation, the social loafing
   effect dominates, and servers slow down (a 6.86% increase in service
   time) in shared queues.

   measure the impact of copyright on knowledge reuse in Wikipedia. I
   exploit a feature of the 1909 Copyright Act whereby material published
   before 1964 has lapsed into the public domain, allowing for the causal
   estimation of the impact of copyright across this sharp cutoff. I find
   that, while digitization encourages knowledge reuse, copyright
   restrictions reduce citations to copyrighted issues of Baseball Digest
   by up to 135% and affect readership by reducing traffic to affected
   pages by 20%. These impacts are highly uneven: copyright hurts the reuse
   of images rather than text and affects Wikipedia pages for less-popular

AB Two competing principal-agent models explain why firms pay dividends.
   The substitute model proposes that corporate insiders pay dividends to
   signal and build trust with outside shareholders who lack legal
   protection. The outcome model, in contrast, surmises that when
   shareholders have legal protection, they demand dividends from insiders
   to prevent them from expropriating corporate funds. Either way,
   dividends represent an agency cost paid to align the interests of
   shareholders and insiders. Expropriations by insiders and reduced
   investment by shareholders are also agency costs, but they are difficult
   to identify with archival data. Using a laboratory experiment, we
   identify the impact of strengthened shareholder protection on all three
   types of agency costs. Dividend payout ratios are five times larger with
   stronger investor protection, insider expropriation ratios are twice as
   high, and outsider investment falls by 45%. Thus, we find evidence that
   strengthening shareholder protection introduces previously unidentified
   agency costs into the insider-investor relationship.

AB In light of recent calls for further validation of structural models,
   this paper evaluates the popular dynamic quality ladder (DQL) model
   using a nonrandom holdout approach. The model is used to predict data
   following a regime shift-that is, a change in the environment that
   produced the estimation data. The prediction performance is evaluated
   relative to a benchmark vector autoregression (VAR) model across three
   automotive categories and multiple prediction horizons. Whereas the VAR
   model performs better in all scenarios in the compact car category, the
   DQL model tends to perform better on multiple-year horizons in both the
   midsize car and full-size pickup categories. A supplementary data
   analysis suggests that DQL model performance in the nonrandom holdout
   prediction task is better in categories that are more affected by the
   regime shift, helping to validate the usefulness of the dynamic
   structural model for making predictions after policy changes.

AB Ellsberg and others suggested that decision under ambiguity is a rich
   empirical domain with many phenomena to be investigated beyond the
   Ellsberg urns. We provide a systematic empirical investigation of this
   richness by varying the uncertain events, the outcomes, and combinations
   of both. Although ambiguity aversion is prevailing, we also find
   systematic ambiguity seeking, confirming insensitivity. We find that
   ambiguity attitudes depend on the kind of uncertainty (the source) but
   not on the kind of outcomes. Ambiguity attitudes are closer to
   rationality (ambiguity neutrality) for natural uncertainties than for
   artificial Ellsberg urn uncertainties. This also appears from the
   reductions of monotonicity violations and of insensitivity. Ambiguity
   attitudes have predictive power across different outcomes and sources of
   uncertainty, with individual-specific components. Our rich domain serves
   well to test families of weighting functions for fitting ambiguity
   attitudes. We find that two-parameter families, capturing not only
   aversion but also insensitivity, are desirable for ambiguity even more
   than for risk. The Goldstein-Einhorn family performed best for
   ambiguity.

AB Theory and recent empirical literature suggest that social and

   inference may be biased by the possibility that firms who share peers
   also share unobserved characteristics that are correlated with observed
   policy. Using a novel identification strategy, we predict and find that
   director connections through well-known island tax havens have a
   significant effect on corporate tax policy. Specifically, we find that
   U.S. firms with directors who are connected to firms domiciled on the
   islands of the Bahamas, Bermuda, or the Caymans exhibit significantly
   greater tax avoidance than other U.S. firms. The presence or arrival of
   an island director is associated with a reduction of between one and
   three percentage points in the firm's effective tax rate. We also
   observe a significant increase in the use of tax haven subsidiaries
   following the arrival of the island director.

AB I investigate whether hedge funds that supply liquidity earn superior
   returns. Using transaction data, I find that hedge funds following
   short-term contrarian strategies (i.e., liquidity suppliers) earn
   significantly higher returns on their equity trades and holdings.
   Similarly, using commercial databases, I find that hedge funds with
   greater exposure to a liquidity provision factor earn significantly
   higher excess returns and Sharpe ratios. The superior performance of
   liquidity-supplying hedge funds arises from strategies that are more
   complex than mechanical short-term reversal strategies. For example,
   among stocks with similar past returns, liquidity-supplying funds are
   more likely to trade against stocks heavily traded by constrained mutual
   funds and less likely to trade against stocks heavily traded by
   unconstrained mutual funds. The outperformance of liquidity-supplying
   funds is also concentrated in periods of low funding liquidity,
   suggesting that less-binding financial constraints contribute to their
   superior returns.

AB There has been recent debate about whether prospect theory can explain
   the disposition effect. Using both theory and simulation, this paper
   shows that prospect theory often predicts the disposition effect when
   lagged expected final wealth is the reference point under the principle
   of preferred personal equilibrium, regardless of whether the reference
   point is updated or not. When initial wealth is the reference point,
   however, there is often no disposition effect. Models that use a
   reference point with no lag under the principle of preferred personal
   equilibrium or that determine the reference point using the principle of
   disappointment aversion cannot explain why the investor bought a stock
   in the first place. Reference point adjustment weakens the disposition
   effect, leads to more aggressive initial stock purchase strategies, and
   predicts history dependence in stock holding.

AB Senior leadership has two primary levers to influence a direct report:
   incentives and communication. Financial incentives are credible and
   precisely specified but offer limited flexibility. In contrast,
   communication is flexible but lacks precision, and must be deemed
   credible to affect a direct report's actions. We study a setting where
   senior leadership seeks to add a new initiative to their organization's
   portfolio. The initiative's potential to create value is not initially
   well understood. Senior leadership eventually obtains more precise
   information on the initiative's value and subsequently may communicate
   this information to their direct report. We analyze senior leadership's
   incentive and communication decisions, and ultimately their portfolio
   decision. We find that senior leadership's communication only affects a
   direct report's actions when a new initiative's potential to create
   value is sufficiently uncertain. Additionally, we find instances where

   driver of voting outcomes-we document the director and board
   characteristics on which voting shareholders focus (as well as those
   that they neglect), their evolution over time, and their relative
   importance. Absent a negative recommendation, high votes withheld are
   infrequent, highlighting the agenda-setting role of proxy advisors.
   While high votes withheld rarely result in director turnover, our
   analyses show that firms often respond to an adverse vote by explicitly
   addressing the underlying concern. Overall, it appears that shareholders
   use their votes in uncontested director elections to get directors to
   address specific problems, rather than to vote them onto or off of the
   board, but they do so only on matters highlighted by the proxy advisors.
