AB This paper examines cause-marketing promotions and finds that fit
   between social causes and consumer brands can be decomposed into ten
   "micro" sub-dimensions or two "macro" sub-dimensions (prominence and
   marketing strategy) of fit. Results indicate fit sub-dimensions are
   significantly related to the attitude toward the sponsorship and the
   brand, and that attitude toward sponsorship mediates the relationship
   between fit and attitude toward the brand. As such, managers should not
   only rely on natural fit between cause and brand, but they should also
   attempt to communicate fit to the consumers. Importantly, familiarity
   with the cause interacts with fit when attitudes toward the sponsorship
   and the brand are measured, such that fit matters less to those who are
   more familiar with the cause. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Consumers' confidence in companies has fallen due to recent and
   widespread violations of integrity and consumers' voicing of discontent
   in weblog (blog) posts. Current research on integrity restoration offers
   little guidance regarding appropriate responses. We posit that not only
   what (with which content) but also how (in which format) the company
   responds, contributes to an effective restoration of integrity and a
   reduction of consumers' intentions to switch. The results of Study 1
   show that the combination of denial content and analytical format as
   well as apologetic content and narrative format works better than
   combinations of opposing response content and format Comparing narrative
   apologies and denials in two consecutive studies, we demonstrate that
   the concept of "transportation" the engrossing effect of a narrative is
   the mechanism underlying narrative-based integrity restoration. We
   further assess in Study 2 how the use of empathy accounts for higher
   levels of transportation and perceived integrity. In Study 3, we
   establish that a personal response by the involved employee is more
   effective than a response issued by the company's spokesperson.
   Consumers trust in stories from the involved employee. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB This paper analyzes the effect of competition on product demonstration
   decisions. Pre-purchase product demonstration enables marketers to
   differentiate products that are ex-post differentiated but are judged
   according to perceived fit, rather than actual fit, due to pre-purchase
   consumer uncertainty. Imbalanced competition accompanied by fit
   uncertainty motivates the follower to offer demonstrations to avoid a
   price war. This paper explores the conditions that lead the leader to
   retaliate. In addition to effects on quantity, competition may increase
   the quality of demonstrations offered by the leader.
   We analyze a business case, showing that competition may increase the
   demonstration intensity and that the leading manufacturer's response to
   changes in competition is stronger than the responses of the followers.
   Our research has the potential to aid managers in formulating
   demonstration strategies and in responding to competitors' demonstration

AB This paper aims to improve current knowledge on the commoditization of
   industries, a unique phenomenon of evolving marketing competition
   characterized by increasing homogeneity of products, higher price
   sensitivity among customers, lower switching costs, and greater industry
   stability. As commoditization is relevant to an ever-greater number of
   diverse industries, this research addresses two main questions: (1) How
   can managers assess their industry's level of commoditization to be
   better informed about their firm's competitive environment? and (2) How
   does the level of commoditization in an industry affect the
   effectiveness of marketing strategies? Initially, in-depth field
   interviews identified the characteristics of the commoditization
   phenomenon. Subsequently, a survey study among 141 companies from ten
   industries applied a measure to assess an industry's commoditization
   level. The results showed significant differences between high and low
   commodity markets in terms of the impact of three different strategic
   orientations on firm performance. The application of the value
   disciplines framework revealed that as commoditization increases,
   operational excellence and product leadership lose impact, while
   customer intimacy becomes a more vital performance driver. The results
   indicate that commoditization assessment may become a vital part of a
   firm's strategic efforts to address evolving marketing competition. (C)

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that network effects should drive faster
   market growth due to the bandwagon effect. However, as we show, network
   externalities may also create an initial slowdown effect on growth
   because potential customers wait for early adopters, who provide them
   with more utility, before they adopt. In this study, we explore the
   financial implications of network externalities by taking the entire
   network process into account. Using an agent-based as well as an
   aggregate-level model, and separating network effects from word of
   mouth, we find that network externalities have a substantial chilling
   effect on the net present value associated with new products. This
   effect may occur not only in a competitive framework, such as a
   competing standards scenario, but also in the absence of competition.
   Drawing on the collective action literature in order to relate network
   effects to individual consumer threshold levels, we find that the
   chilling effect is stronger with a small variability in the threshold
   distribution, and is especially affected by the process early on in the
   product life cycle. We also find a "hockey stick" growth pattern by
   empirically examining the growth of fax machines, CB radios, CD players,
   DVD players, and cellular services. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Recent literature has established the importance of incentive-aligning
   research participants in conjoint analysis. Pertinent studies have also
   proposed and validated a fairly general incentive-aligning mechanism
   (willingness-to-pay, or WTP) that achieves incentive alignment by using
   respondents' data to determine their value for a reward product (Ding,
   2007). This mechanism, however, requires an estimation of the value of
   money and is relatively difficult for the average respondent to
   understand. We propose an alternative mechanism based on inferred rank
   order for situations where conjoint practitioners have more than one
   version of real products. In an empirical test of choice-based conjoint,
   we show that the RankOrder mechanism leads to substantial improvement in
   predictive performance when compared to non-aligned hypothetical
   choices. A second test shows that both incentive-aligned mechanisms -
   RankOrder and WTP produce very similar predictive performances.
   RankOrder, however, dominates the WTP mechanism in user preference, an
   outcome shown both by perceived understanding and by the
   incentive-aligned money that respondents are willing to pay to switch
   from one mechanism to the other. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Research on organizational market information processing in marketing
   has not yet examined a key issue associated with information collection:
   the role of top management team (TMT) involvement. Research in marketing
   has typically studied market information collection efforts from the
   perspective of employees and market research companies, overlooking the
   role that the TMT plays in these efforts. While prior research on top
   managers suggests that they are often not active participants in the
   collection of market information, this study examines whether and under
   what conditions TMT involvement in market information collection efforts
   can contribute to a firm's innovativeness and performance. The key
   contribution of the study involves the development and testing of a
   model that shows (1) the positive effect of TMT involvement in market
   information collection efforts on firm innovativeness above and beyond
   employees' market information collection efforts; (2) the moderating
   effect of firm size and industry context (i.e., high-technology versus
   low-technology) on model relationships, indicating that the relationship
   is stronger for smaller firms and high-technology companies; and (3) the
   mediating effect of firm innovativeness on the relationship between TMT
   involvement in market information collection efforts and overall
   business performance. We test our model in a business-to-business

AB What is sales strategy? How and when does it affect performance? This
   study attempts to provide answers to these overlooked questions by
   developing a comprehensive conceptualization of sales strategy and
   examining its impact on sales force and firm performance. Sales strategy
   was operationalized as a multidimensional construct consisting of four
   dimensions, namely customer segmentation, customer
   prioritization/targeting, developing relationship objectives/selling
   models, and use of multiple sales channels. Moreover, by drawing on the
   resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, as well as on industrial
   organization theory (IOT), the authors test the moderating effects of
   transformational leadership, customer solution orientation, and demand
   uncertainty on the sales strategy performance relationship. Analyses of
   survey and secondary data from a sample of 170 firms provide evidence
   that sales strategy is consistently and positively associated with
   performance while transformational leadership, customer solution
   orientation, and demand uncertainty were found to exert significant
   moderating effects on this relationship. The study's findings have
   important implications. For marketing researchers, they put forward an
   empirical operationalization of sales strategy and provide evidence
   regarding the usefulness of the RBV and IOT perspectives for explaining
   its performance implications. For managers, the findings show that a
   well-crafted sales strategy pays off and to get the most out of their
   sales strategy managers should (a) adopt a transformational leadership
   approach, (b) assess changes in demand, and (c) assess the degree to
   which their customers are demanding the provision of solutions. (C) 2009

AB In industrial selling situations, the questions of what factors drive
   pricing authority delegation to salespeople and under what conditions
   price delegation is beneficial for the firm are often asked. To advance
   knowledge in this area, we (1) develop and empirically test a framework
   of important drivers of price delegation based on agency-theoretic
   research and (2) investigate the impact of price delegation on firm
   performance, taking into account agency theory variables as potential
   moderators. The study is based on data from a sample of 181 companies
   from the industrial machinery and electrical engineering industry in
   Germany. The results indicate that the degree of pricing delegation
   increases as information asymmetry between the salesperson and sales
   manager increases and as it becomes more difficult to monitor
   salespeople's efforts. Conversely, risk-aversion of salespeople is
   negatively related to the degree of price delegation. Furthermore, we
   find a positive effect of price delegation on firm performance, which is
   amplified when market-related uncertainty is high and when salespeople
   possess better customer-related information than their managers. Hence,
   our results clearly show that rigid, "one price fits all" policies are
   inappropriate in many B2B market situations. Instead, sales managers
   should grant their salespeople sufficient leeway to adapt prices to
   changing customer requirements and market conditions, especially in
   firms that operate in highly uncertain selling environments. (C) 2009

AB As previous research demonstrates, few firms provide full pricing
   authority to their sales representatives (in the following: sales reps),
   and those sales representatives who do have full pricing authority may
   offer too many price concessions in their effort to close the sale.
   Thus, many sales managers lose the opportunity to use salespeople's
   superior customer knowledge to exploit their customers' willingness to
   pay. This study investigates how a company might steer sales reps during
   price negotiations while still giving them full pricing authority. The
   proposed instrument is simple to understand, easy to implement, fairly
   inexpensive, and effective; it posits that the kind of cost information
   that sales reps receive affects both their cognitive references and
   their negotiation behavior, which in turn affect negotiated prices.
   Electronically mediated negotiations in an experimental setting with 119
   student dyads (Study 1), as well as replications of the findings using
   41 dyads of key account managers (Study 2), indicate that
   undifferentiated cost information (full costs without information on
   direct costs) leads to higher reference prices (reservation price,
   target price, and first offer), as well as stronger attacking behavior
   and weaker coordinating behavior. These effects yield higher sales
   prices, and therefore more profit for the company. These results offer
   sales managers valuable insights into the "black box" of negotiations,
   which may be particularly helpful for steering sales reps in a situation
   in which they have full pricing authority. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

AB We present the results of a meta-analysis on drivers of organic sales
   growth conducted using a Hierarchical Bayes estimation technique. Based
   on a comprehensive review of a diverse set of literatures on organic
   sales growth, we identify eleven drivers of organic sales growth
   performance of firms: (i) innovation, (ii) marketing orientation (iii)
   advertising (iv) interorganizational networks, (v) entrepreneurial
   orientation, (vi) management capacity, (vii) firm age, (viii) firm size,
   (ix) competition, (x) munificence, and (xi) dynamism. Among the
   variables under a manager's control, innovation, advertising, market
   orientation, interorganizational networks, entrepreneurial orientation
   and managerial capacity serve as positive drivers of organic growth.
   Older firms and firms operating in dynamic and competitive environments
   face constraints in terms of organic growth. We find that the omission
   of marketing variables in empirical models biases the elasticities of
   eight of the drivers of organic growth. Three study design
   characteristics impact the magnitude of elasticity of organic growth
   drivers: using cross-sectional data instead of panel data, using growth
   rates instead of absolute change as operationalization of growth and
   using market share instead of sales as a measure of revenues. (C) 2009

AB This paper examines organic growth and its impact on shareholder value
   creation. At a conceptual level, organic and external growth are readily
   defined; yet, at a practical level, decomposing revenue growth into its
   constituent elements presents methodological challenges. We develop a
   method to decompose revenue growth into organic growth, external growth,
   exchange rate effects, and under- or outperformance. Using extensive
   data from three insurance companies, AXA, Generali and ING, we analyzed
   the period from 1995 to 2005. Exchange rate effects were of minor
   importance, unless companies entered markets at inopportune times.
   Primarily, the findings indicate that only organic revenue growth
   enhanced shareholder value. Therefore, managers should focus on
   marketing as a key driver of organic growth to create value. (C) 2009

AB Profit growth is one of the primary drivers of a firm's stock price and
   therefore is a clear priority for managers. Yet little is known about
   how a firm's marketing capabilities may be linked with its profit
   growth. In this study, we use data from a cross-industry sample of 114
   firms to investigate how market sensing, brand management, and customer
   relationship management (CRM) capabilities determine firms' revenue
   growth and margin growth-the two components of profit growth. Our
   results reveal that these marketing capabilities have direct and
   complementary effects on both revenue and margin growth rates.
   Critically, we find that brand management and CRM capabilities have
   opposing effects on revenue and margin growth rates, such that a failure
   to examine these two underlying components would mask the relationships
   between these marketing capabilities and ultimate profit growth rates.

AB While new venture growth performance has been studied extensively,
   little work has been done to examine the complex strategic choices
   through which growth is pursued and attained. Building on the
   resource-based view and social capital perspective, this study develops
   a conceptual framework that links combinations of ventures' (1)
   technological, (2) financial, and (3) networking capabilities to
   different growth strategies in terms of organic growth, partnership, and
   acquisition. We further assess the mechanisms through which a new
   venture's growth choices affect firm performance. Using data from 238
   new high-tech ventures in China, we find that new ventures with
   different resource combinations follow different growth strategies.
   While partnership growth leads to greater product diversity. and
   acquisition is more effective in realizing firm internationalization,
   both lead to a better chance of survival of new ventures. In addition,
   the study explicates the role of technological capability in moderating
   the relationship between growth strategies and new venture performance.

   low usage levels or decide to disadopt the service altogether. Here, the
   authors specifically examine the effects of adoption timing on
   post-adoption usage and disadoption. Using a longitudinal,
   individual-level usage data set of 6296 adopters of a new telecom
   service, they show that the earliest adopters have lower initial usage
   levels than do later adopters. However, early adopters show increasing
   usage after adoption, whereas late adopters tend to decrease their usage
   over time. Also, disadoption rates are higher among later adopters. (C)

AB The authors examine the performance impact of formal market information
   processes. Specifically, a theoretical model is developed that
   hypothesizes that formal processes for market information acquisition
   and utilization have direct and positive main effects on new venture
   success and is then tested using a sample of 222 new ventures located in
   China. Findings indicate that new venture success is positively
   correlated with the use of formal processes for market information
   acquisition and use. Moreover, the relative importance of formal
   processes to the acquisition and use of market information depends on
   whether the new venture serves an emerging or established market. In
   particular, the impact of formal processes for information acquisition
   is higher among new ventures that serve emerging markets. In contrast,
   the impact of formal processes for information use is higher among new
   ventures that serve established markets. We present managerial
   implications of our results. For example, a new venture with a strong
   market orientation can respond quickly to emerging marketplace needs,
   and can even seize the advantage from incumbents. If it is in an
   emerging market, however, the new venture management team should strive
   to excel at information acquisition; in an established market, it is
   important for the management team to excel at information utilization.

AB We study cause-related auctions where a percentage of the dynamically
   determined purchase price of an item is donated to charity. Little is
   known about the effectiveness of such auctions. Bidders who value
   donations to charity have an incentive to bid more aggressively in such
   auctions. Regardless of whether they win or not, these bidders can
   significantly affect prices. The purpose of this paper is to study
   bidders' willingness to pay a premium in charity auctions and the
   drivers that affect the charity premium. We use a carefully designed
   field experiment involving simultaneous pairs of auctions that are
   identical in all respects but percentage of the proceeds donated to
   charity. This design gives us the ability to look at bidder choice among
   auctions based on charitable considerations. We use a mixture model
   approach to allow for different types of individual preferences. We find
   that individuals fall into three segments: two altruistic segments and a
   selfish segment. The altruistic segments, which drive up the charity
   premium, can be classified as warm glow bidders who derive pleasure from
   the act of giving and other-regarding bidders who give for selfless
   reasons. Results show that the difference in donation percentages is the
   major factor influencing the charitable premium. However, bidders differ
   considerably in their responses to donation percentages. While
   other-regarding bidders tend to seek auctions where a greater percentage
   of revenue is donated to charity, warm glow bidders only contribute when
   the charity premium is sufficiently low. Thus, managers should focus
   their marketing efforts on appealing to these different segments,
   depending on the percentage donated to charity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Variance-based SEM, also known under the term partial least squares
   (PLS) analysis, is an approach that has gained increasing interest among
   marketing researchers in recent years. During the last 25 years, more
   than 30 articles have been published in leading marketing journals that
   have applied this approach instead of the more traditional alternative
   of covariance-based SEM (CBSEM). However, although an analysis of these
   previous publications shows that there seems to be at least an implicit
   agreement about the factors that should drive the choice between PLS
   analysis and CBSEM, no research has until now empirically compared the
   performance of these approaches given a set of different conditions. Our
   study addresses this open question by conducting a large-scale
   Monte-Carlo simulation. We show that justifying the choice of PLS due to
   a lack of assumptions regarding indicator distribution and measurement
   scale is often inappropriate, as CBSEM proves extremely robust with
   respect to violations of its underlying distributional assumptions.
   Additionally, CBSEM clearly outperforms PLS in terms of parameter
   consistency and is preferable in terms of parameter accuracy as long as
   the sample size exceeds a certain threshold (250 observations).
   Nevertheless, PLS analysis should be preferred when the emphasis is on
   prediction and theory development, as the statistical power of PLS is
   always larger than or equal to that of CBSEM; already, 100 observations
   can be sufficient to achieve acceptable levels of statistical power
   given a certain quality of the measurement model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB We investigate how incumbent manufacturers and retailers alter their
   pricing behavior in response to new product introduction. In performing
   our analysis, we need to be cognizant of the fact that the observed
   price changes can be due to entry-induced changes in a) demand
   conditions or b) costs or, on the other hand, to the competitive
   behavior of c) manufacturers and/or d) the retailer. In order to
   separate these four changes, we posit that manufacturer and retailer
   pricing is an outcome of maximizing a combination of shares and profits.
   This enhanced objective function allows us to measure competitive
   conduct benchmarked as less or more competitive than under the
   Bertrand-Nash framework. Our empirical analysis is based on the
   toothpaste category for the time period January 1993-February 1995.
   During this period, there were three brand introductions in two rounds
   of entry. Using the estimates from the demand and the supply model, we
   compute the changes in the retail and wholesale prices that are
   attributable to changes in demand conditions, manufacturer and retailer
   competitive conduct, and cost changes. These results support our
   conjecture that inferring the change in conduct solely based on a change
   in observed prices is likely to be erroneous. For the first new brand
   entry, we find that the brand introduction did not significantly
   increase competition between manufacturers. As a result, the balance of
   channel power between the manufacturers and the retailers remained
   unaltered. Both retailer and manufacturer profit margins increased after
   the first entry. However, subsequent to the second entry, retailer share
   of channel profits increased at the expense of the manufacturers;
   manufacturers even saw a decline in their absolute profit margins. We
   believe that this research will provide insight for manufacturers and
   retailers regarding how the various channel participants are likely to
   react to new product introduction. Furthermore, policymakers interested
   in understanding competitive reactions to new product introduction
   should find this research useful. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Marketers are increasingly making use of major TV events, such as the
   Super Bowl, to advertise their products. However, the economic value of
   such advertising is highly uncertain. Since an ad during the Super Bowl
   costs 2.5 times more per viewer reached than an ad during a network TV
   prime time show, developing methods for evaluating such advertising and
   for measuring its effects seems particularly important. Using the
   setting of the movie industry, this paper develops and estimates a model
   that includes both direct (on potential moviegoers) and indirect effects
   (on exhibitors) of regular and Super Bowl advertising. The model
   recognizes the endogeneity of advertising, and in particular develops a
   discrete choice model to control for the endogeneity of the Super Bowl
   advertising decision. The results indicate that Super Bowl advertising
   has a positive effect on box office revenues, but primarily through an
   indirect effect on exhibitors. In addition, regular TV advertising is
   more effective than Super Bowl advertising for initial advertising
   spending: a counterfactual analysis, by contrast, shows that for a movie
   already spending at our sample's average TV spending level of $13
   million, Super Bowl advertising has a greater effect on revenues than
   regular TV advertising. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Charities rely mainly on direct mailings to attract the attention of
   potential donors. Individuals may feel irritated by these mailings, in
   particular when they receive many mailings. This might harm the revenues
   charities receive from their mailing activities. Moreover, target
   selection by charities likely results in many mailings being sent to the
   best donors, and hence they might become most irritated. As such,
   irritation with direct mailings could well be endogenously determined.
   To ensure exogenous variation in irritation, we performed a unique
   controlled field experiment in cooperation with five of the largest
   charities in the Netherlands. Our analysis reveals that direct mailings
   do result in irritation, but surprisingly, this irritation affects
   neither stated nor actual donating behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This study compares prices offered by multiple Internet retailers. This
   task is challenging because e-tailers cannot present their entire
   assortments to each consumer. Therefore, the quality of the product
   assortments presented by different e-tailers to each consumer is not
   directly comparable on an item-by-item basis, resulting in
   non-homogeneous offerings across retailers. We further consider the
   interaction between retailers (product information presentation format)
   and consumers (product information search strategies), which makes price
   comparisons among the retailers even more non-homogeneous. To grapple
   with this quality-adjusted price comparison problem for non-homogeneous
   products, we use a stochastic-frontier hedonic-price regression model to
   find the "lowest" theoretical price for a product given its
   characteristics. We then assess the price efficiency of the product as
   the ratio between this lowest price and the offered market price. This
   framework allows for the comparison of retailers in their ability to
   offer the "best deals" even when their actual assortments are not
   directly comparable in quality. Moreover, this framework provides
   Internet retailers with a relative measure of price efficiency. This
   helps them understand when and where they offer competitive prices to
   consumers. We illustrate our approach empirically in a comparison of
   price efficiency among three major Internet travel agents on a sample of
   posted itineraries and airfares. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
   price efficiency of an Internet travel agent depends on the format of
   its website and on consumers' search strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The most comprehensive models of purchase behavior for frequently
   purchased supermarket items explain households' purchase incidence
   decisions (whether to buy), brand choice decisions (what to buy), and
   purchase quantity decisions (how much to buy). In this study, we develop
   a three-stage purchase incidence/brand choice/purchase quantity model
   for household-level data in which all three stages are specified with
   (i) random coefficient distributions for model covariates and (ii)
   random effect distributions to account for unobserved factors affecting
   demand (known as common demand shocks), while also (iii) controlling for
   the effects of endogeneity on prices. Compared to current
   state-of-the-art models for multi-stage purchase decisions, the results
   show improvements in fit and forecasting accuracy when purchase
   behaviors are modeled with all of these components in combination.
   Perhaps more importantly, when common demand shocks are ignored,
   substantial differences in parameter estimates and diagnostic
   information about consumer behavior are likely (median differences in
   parameter estimates are 10% and 20% in two product categories), which
   impact managerial deliberations about price and promotion policies.
   Further, failure to account for common demand shocks affects the mean
   and variance of random coefficient distributions in unpredictable
   directions, which could produce results that encourage managers to
   pursue inappropriate and costly micro-level product marketing
   strategies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent years, customer relationship management (CRM) has been a topic
   of the utmost importance for scholars and managers. Despite the evidence
   provided by numerous empirical studies, many companies that have
   implemented CRM systems report unsatisfactory levels of improvement.
   This study analyzes what influence companies can expect CRM
   implementation to have on performance and how they can leverage its
   impact. The authors propose a conceptual model that investigates the
   link between technological and organizational implementations, as well
   as the implementations' interactions with management and employee
   support and CRM process-related performance. By measuring CRM
   performance in terms of the initiation, maintenance, and retention of
   customer relationships, the study provides a detailed picture of what
   CRM implementations are capable of achieving. The results of the
   empirical study, conducted across four industries and ten European
   Countries, indicate that CRM implementation does not impact performance
   equally for different aspects of the CRM process, and that it has an
   impact only if adequately Supported by the appropriate company
   stakeholders. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research on customization suggests that a need exists to examine
   conditions under which selling customized versus non-customized
   offerings will be more beneficial to vendors. To this end, this paper
   empirically evaluates consumer response to and choice of customized
   systems (offerings that are integrated and customized) in relation to
   standardized systems (offerings that feature integration but not
   customization). Through a series of studies, we demonstrate that the
   relationship between a buyer's systems purchase strategy and their
   future repurchase intentions toward the seller is moderated by a buyer
   characteristic (that is, a consumer's insight into his/her own
   preferences, or the degree to which a consumer can confidently and
   consistently express his or her true preferences) as well as a seller
   characteristic (retailer reputation). Given that consumers who are
   experts have greater insight into their own preferences than novices,
   our work also suggests that this greater insight into one's own
   preferences is a plausible explanation for why experts are more likely
   to choose a customized system. The main practical implication of our
   research is that it prompts managers to challenge the contention in some
   mass customization writings that customized offerings have universal
   appeal. Although the participants in our studies also tended to be more
   attracted to customized systems in general, this proclivity was lower
   for consumers with less product category expertise. This is important
   because our results convey that repurchase intentions towards a vendor
   will be higher after the purchase of a non-customized system by those
   consumers who lack insight into their preferences. As such, firms should
   try to propose customized systems only to those prospective buyers who
   possess strong preference insight, and propose standardized systems to
   those buyers who do not. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The dominant approach in brand-extension research has focused on the
   role of fit in the extension evaluation process. Overemphasis on fit has
   resulted in research designs that involve singular evaluation of the
   extension without considering how competing brands in the target
   category might affect the evaluation of brand extensions. Singular
   evaluations are known to result in brand positivity effects; that is,
   brand extensions are evaluated more favorably than is warranted. This
   research finds that singular evaluations do indeed lead to brand
   positivity effects. However, brand positivity effects are mitigated when
   respondents were provided with competitive information along with
   target-category structure and comparative/non-comparative brand
   positioning statements. Results also suggest that parent brand-extension
   fit, though an important determinant of an extension's assessment, plays
   a less critical role in a comparative evaluation context when an
   extension's brand strength is accounted for in relation to its
   competition in the target category. Therefore, the findings stress the
   importance of both competition and parent-brand fit in making informed
   positioning decisions and more realistic predictions of extension
   success. The research demonstrates when, how and to what extent
   comparative evaluations result in lower extension ratings and provides
   managerial strategies to introduce an extension effectively. (C) 2009

   indicates sensitivity to the representativeness of a small sample. We
   argue that perceived representativeness depends on the causal inferences

AB Recommendation and repurchase intentions are the two most important
   dimensions of customer loyalty. Latent satisfaction thresholds at the
   individual level, if obtained, can function as an additional valid and
   effective criterion for satisfaction ratings in determining customer
   loyalty. To improve the existing estimation methodology on satisfaction
   thresholds, this paper proposes a joint heterogeneity response model to
   simultaneously calibrate the individual-level recommendation and
   repurchase thresholds through a joint specification over the
   heterogeneity. It conducts a simulation study to examine the parameter
   recovery and model validation. This paper further applies the method to
   two different datasets of satisfaction surveys in the automotive
   industry, with the first involving owners of vehicles of a single brand,
   and the second involving owners of vehicles of multiple brands. The
   results from the two empirical studies show that the proposed model
   consistently outperforms the two competing models and the extant
   approach. In addition, the results provide different insights into
   enhancing customer loyalty by using a new segmentation scheme based on
   estimated satisfaction thresholds. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB This paper is about a marketing decision support system in the movie
   industry. The decision support system of interest is a model that
   generates weekly movie schedules in a multiplex movie theater. A movie
   schedule specifies, for each day of the week, on which screen(s)
   different movies will be played, and at which time(s). The model
   integrates elements from marketing (the generation of demand figures)
   with approaches from operations research (the optimization procedure).
   Therefore, it consists of two parts: (i) conditional forecasts of the
   number of visitors per show for any possible starting time, and (ii) a
   scheduling procedure that quickly finds a near optimal schedule (which
   can be demonstrated to be close to the optimal schedule). To generate
   this schedule, we formulate the "movie scheduling problem" as a
   generalized set partitioning problem. The latter is solved with an
   algorithm based on column generation techniques. We tested the combined
   demand forecasting/schedule optimization procedure in a multiplex in
   Amsterdam, generating movie schedules for fourteen weeks. The proposed
   model not only makes movie scheduling easier and less time consuming,
   but also generates schedules that attract more visitors than current
   "intuition-based" schedules. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Extant studies concerning the relationship between market orientation

   on the contingency theory, the authors argue that one reason for these

   new product development process. This study theoretically and
   empirically examines the moderating role of reward systems in the
   relationship between market orientation and new product performance. The
   authors conducted interviews and surveys in China. The moderating
   effects suggest that Chinese firms should simultaneously use both a
   high-level, long-term-oriented reward system and a low-level,
   risk-taking reward system in order to enhance the positive effects of
   market orientation on new product performance. The results provide a
   more refined understanding of how the interplay between marketing and

AB The authors introduce hybrid individualized two-level choice-based
   conjoint (HIT-CBC), which combines self-explicated preference
   measurement (SE) with choice-based conjoint analysis (CBC). The CBC part
   is adapted individually to a choice design that uses only the best and
   worst levels of each attribute identified in the SE phase. Prior
   knowledge about the best and worst levels allows HIT-CBC to generate an
   adaptive efficient (i.e., Pareto-optimal, balanced, orthogonal,
   minimally overlapping) choice design that is easy to implement. Whereas
   existing conjoint measurement approaches suffer from the
   number-of-levels effect, HIT-CBC avoids this problem because it reduces
   every attribute to two levels. Thus, HIT-CBC is appropriate for problems
   with many and imbalanced attribute levels. Furthermore, the
   transformation to the best and worst levels exemplifies a new and
   favorable way to account for consumer heterogeneity. In addition,
   HIT-CBC introduces the possibility of using individualized
   willingness-to-pay measures as price levels, which results in more
   flexibility for modeling demand functions (e.g., identifying price
   thresholds). A simulation study and an empirical study show the robust
   predictive validity of HIT-CBC compared with a standard CBC approach,
   and illustrate the advantages of HIT-CBC with a pricing study. (C) 2009

AB This paper posits a new framework to model the trial of and repeat
   purchasing of a new product. While much research has examined underlying
   shifts in consumer purchasing patterns, the typical assumption has been
   that the underlying purchasing process remains the same although the
   purchasing rate may change over time. Motivated by Fader, Hardie, and
   Huang's development of a dynamic change point model [Fader, P. S.,
   Hardie, B. G. S., & Huang, C. -Y. (2004). A Dynamic Changepoint Model
   for New Product Sales Forecasting. Marketing Science, 23 (1), 50-65], we
   consider an evolving process as consumers gain more experience with a
   new product.
   Our framework assumes that consumers progress through two purchasing
   states, becoming more regular in their inter-purchase times as they gain
   experience with the product through repeat purchases. More specifically.
   they move from an initial state of exponential purchasing to a "steady
   state" that is characterized by a more regular Erlang-2 timing
   distribution. The proposed model is very flexible and nests a number of
   existing models, enabling it to explain a wide range of observed
   behavioral patterns. We apply our evolving process model to the same
   datasets used by Fader, Hardie, and Huang [Fader, P. S., Hardie, B. G.
   S., & Huang, C. -Y. (2004). A Dynamic Changepoint Model for New Product
   Sales Forecasting. Marketing Science, 23 (1), 50-65] and compare our
   results to a number of competing models. We find empirical evidence to
   support the use of a two-state model, since it yields relevant insights
   as well as improved empirical performance. We discuss the implications
   as they relate to forecasting new product sales. Published by Elsevier

AB In this paper, we focus on the perspective and business model of the
   rentailer - a retail outlet that rents and sells new and used home video
   titles. This requires predicting the consumer's decision to rent or buy
   a particular title, segmenting its customer base, and pricing new and
   used titles. We develop a new model based on a simple heuristic found in
   the behavioral marketing literature of how people predict their own
   usage of a service. We estimate the model using a unique panel dataset
   obtained from a large rentailer, and find it provides a good fit to the
   data. Using the model estimates we obtain a metric indicating a latent
   customer tendency to buy at full price (compared to buying at a lower
   price or renting). Other diagnostic information from the model may help
   convert renters into buyers. First, expected viewing may be pitched to
   the consumer in order to persuade consumers that the movie will be well
   utilized. Secondly, we use the model to generate customized new and used
   title prices. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Learning about a customer's preferences is a critical first step in the
   customization process. Broadly, firms adopt two alternative learning
   approaches: (1) ask, i.e., solicit preference information directly from
   the customer (S-Learning), or (2) infer, i.e., deduce preference
   information based on past observations of the customer as well as those
   of other customers (O-Learning). Most existing research on customization
   strategy focuses on a firm's marketing mix decisions, implicitly
   assuming away how the firm learns about customers. We contribute to this
   literature by examining how a firm's use of a specific learning approach
   impacts competition, particularly its rival's choice of learning
   approach. We find that O-Learning provides a credible signal for
   relaxing price competition, while S-Learning does not. Further,
   S-Learning by a firm creates a disincentive for rivals to also invest in
   S-Learning. We survey business customers and find significant evidence
   supporting our theory. We conclude with several managerial implications
   of our theory including how a firm can optimally select its learning
   strategy in order to impact its competitive environment. (C) 2009

   by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), and whether
   ACSI-based trading strategies provide market-beating returns. The
   current research aims to shed new light on these issues. We reexamine
   two ACSI-based trading strategies considered in prior research. Applying
   a methodology that deals with three interlinking issues, risk
   adjustment, abnormal returns estimation and portfolio aggregation, we
   find that the trading strategies do not provide compelling evidence that
   the market mis-prices the value of customer satisfaction. Our study
   contributes to the current debate on the (mis)pricing of customer
   satisfaction by demonstrating the application of a framework within
   which the robustness of observed anomalies can be more fully assessed.

AB This paper introduces the proximity effect model. The proximity effect
   model explains the correlation between two items as a function of (1)
   items' conceptual relationship (i.e., nonreversed items measuring the
   same construct; reversed items measuring the same construct; or items
   measuring unrelated constructs), and (2) items' proximity in a
   questionnaire. The proximity effect model draws from the belief-sampling
   literature. We first conduct cognitive interviews to better understand
   the ways that respondents process items in a questionnaire depending on
   items' conceptual relationships and proximity. Next, we quantitatively
   test the resultant model using primary data (N=3114). Finally, we use
   simulated correlation matrices to assess the impact of the proximity
   effect on factor structure and reliability. The results indicate that
   the (positive) correlation between a nonreversed item pair decreases
   with increasing inter-item distance. In contrast, the (negative)
   correlation between reversed item pairs decreases (i.e., becomes
   stronger) with increasing inter-item distance. This is partly due to the
   fact that respondents tend to minimize retrieval of additional
   information when answering nearby nonreversed items, and they tend to
   maximize retrieval of new and different information when answering
   nearby reversed items. The proximity effect model leads to a set of key
   recommendations pertaining to questionnaire construction (i.e., the use
   of reversed items dispersed throughout the questionnaire) and data
   analysis (i.e., the use of a confirmatory factor analysis model
   specification including a response style factor). (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Markets are dynamic by nature; and marketing-efforts can be directed to
   stimulate, reduce, or to utilize these dynamics. The field of marketing
   dynamics aims at modeling the effects of marketing actions and policies
   on short-term performance ("lift") and on long-term performance
   ("base"). One of the core questions within this field is: "How do
   marketing efforts affect outcome metrics such as revenues, profits, or
   shareholder value over time?" Developments in statistical modeling and
   new data sources allow marketing scientists to provide increasingly
   comprehensive answers to this question. We present an outlook on
   developments in modeling marketing dynamics and specify research

AB A major challenge for marketers is how to spend a marketing budget such
   that the impact on a target market is maximized; There are numerous
   organizations including marketing agencies, media experts and sales
   agents that promise to deliver more impact for the money a firm
   allocates to marketing. The service that these organizations offer are
   to organize and-coordinate spending such that a higher fraction of the
   potential market is effectively reached by a firm's marketing-effort. My
   objective is to understand the optimal strategy that marketing agencies,
   media experts and sales agents should use to sell these services. In
   particular, 1 analyze how these services should be priced and whether a
   seller gains by selling such services exclusively. The model consists of
   a seller of marketing services and two symmetric firms that compete in a
   differentiated market. A downstream firm that purchases the services
   reaches a higher fraction of the potential-market due to the efficiency
   provided by-the services: The analysis shows that the optimal selling
   strategy for the services is a function of three factors: a) the degree
   of differentiation between firms, b) the fraction of the target that is
   reached by firms (prior to using the seller's services) and c) the
   increase in "reach" provided by the seller's services. Non-exclusive
   selling is likely to be optimal, the less that downstream firms compete
   with each other due to strong differentiation in tile-downstream market
   or a low level of overlap in the customers reached by the marketing of
   each downstream firm. In contrast, exclusive selling is advantageous
   when many customers have been reached by the marketing of both firms or
   the level of differentiation between the firms is' low. Surprisingly, in
   many situations, the seller's profit is inversely related to the level
   of differentiation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   investigate the effect of consumers' "morningness"="eveningness"
   orientation and time of day on their performance. Two experiments
   explore whether synchrony between peak circadian periods and time of
   testing influences consumers' performance. Results suggest robust
   synchrony and time-of-day effects on the dependent variables. Study 1
   shows that circadian rhythm strongly influences customers' waiting time
   and service evaluations. The use of signal-detection methods in Study 2
   reveals that participants were better able to recall and recognize ads
   when tests were performed during their peak circadian time. Overall,
   subjects showed better performance at their peak than at their off-peak
   time of day. The authors discuss the theoretical significance of their
   findings and the managerial implications for marketing research and

   interpersonal interaction (such as good personal relationships) on
   supplier consideration. More specifically, it examines how the
   importance of these criteria depends upon service-related dimensions.
   This is an experimental study among client firms in the market research
   industry, which combines a conjoint and between-subjects design to lead
   to several new insights. First, while good personal relationships play
   an important role in the selection of a service provider, their impact
   increases if the service offering is subjective in nature, but it
   decreases if it is strategically important. Second, enriching the
   service offering with interpretation and advice is more important for
   subjective as well as for strategically important service offerings.
   Third, as to other selection criteria, the study results show some
   interesting differences between consideration and choice. Price has a
   substantive impact on choice alone, while a strong brand name is helpful
   for the service provider only in the consideration stage. (c) 2009

AB Patent expiration represents a turning point not only for the brand
   losing patent protection, as bioequivalent generic versions of the drug
   quickly enter the market at reduced prices, but also for the
   non-bioequivalent drugs that retain patent protection in the same
   therapeutic category. In this paper, we study how physician
   characteristics and prescribing decisions impact competition among
   molecules of a therapeutic class once generic versions of one of these
   molecules enter the market. Our results show that the traditional focus
   on the single molecule losing patent protection is not sufficient to
   understand the impact of generics in the category and their cost-saving
   potential. We find that generic entry in the category under analysis not
   only leads to the expected decrease in the prescription of the branded
   molecule bioequivalent to the generics, but also unexpectedly benefits
   other non-bioequivalent branded drugs as detailing-sensitive physicians
   switched from the contested molecule to these other branded
   alternatives. However, a group of price-sensitive physicians did
   increase their use of the new generics to the detriment of all branded
   alternatives, allowing for additional savings in health care costs. The
   overall market result is a slight decrease in the prescriptions of the
   now much cheaper molecule. This paradox was identified previously in
   several pharmaceutical categories [Caves, R.E., Whinston, M.D., &
   Hurwitz, M.A. (1992), "Patent expiration, entry and competition in the
   US pharmaceutical industry: An exploratory analysis", Brookings Papers
   on Economic Activity, Microeconomics, vol. 1991,1-48.], but lacked a
   systematic understanding and explanation. We show that the understanding
   of such market paradoxes requires marketers and policy makers to (1)
   determine the size of physician segments sensitive to marketing activity
   and prices, and (2) assess the marketing activity of all pharmaceutical
   firms, whether bioequivalent or not. We discuss the managerial and
   policy implications of our results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Drug development is the lifeblood of pharmaceutical firms and a critical
   source of innovation in the healthcare industry. Pharmaceutical firms
   maintain their competitiveness by continuously developing and
   introducing new drugs, which requires an efficient new drug portfolio
   management process. However, the current literature does not elaborate
   on strategies pertaining to these new drug (product) portfolios (i.e.,
   portfolios of drugs under development), nor does it provide the means
   with which to understand the future cash flow-generating potential of
   these portfolio strategies. To address this problem, we propose a set of
   generic descriptors of new drug portfolio strategies (i.e., portfolio
   breadth, portfolio depth, blockbuster strategy, and stages of the drug
   development process) and relate these descriptors to Tobin's q, a
   forward-looking measure of shareholder expectations. The results of a
   latent class regression analysis show that shareholder expectations of
   firms with broad new drug portfolios and potential blockbusters are
   positive. For most firms, shareholders focus on the final stage of the
   drug development process and deemphasize portfolio depth. In contrast,
   for a minority of mostly small firms, shareholders seem to value the
   earlier stages of the drug development process and stress portfolio
   depth. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Licensing out technologies is a main source of revenue for dedicated
   technology firms. While licensing exchange has received very little
   attention in prior marketing literature, it is economically important
   and poses particular challenges. One major obstacle for obtaining new
   licensing deals is the information asymmetry between licensors and
   licensees. The main premise of this study is that the variation among
   dedicated technology firms of the number of new licensing deals that
   they obtain can be explained by their voluntary disclosure of strategic
   information and their position in the industry's licensing and social
   networks. An empirical study of the biopharmaceutical industry shows
   that, while voluntarily disclosing strategic information enables
   dedicated biotechnology firms to sign more new licensing deals, firms
   should be careful not to disclose too much information. As to network
   structure, dedicated biotechnology firms with more central positions in
   the licensing exchange network obtain more new licensing deals, but
   again, the effect has an inverted-U shape, indicating a dark side of
   network centrality. Finally, the study provides evidence that licensing
   exchange is socially embedded. A central position in the social network
   of board interlocks leads to more new licensing deals. Dedicated
   technology firms can use these insights to address practical questions,
   such as how much strategic information they should reveal, as well as to
   set long-term directions regarding network position. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB Despite the proliferation of diffusion models and a plethora of
   applications in many different markets and domains, relatively little
   research has been conducted on prescription drug diffusion. Yet
   prescription pharmaceuticals are an increasingly important component of
   patient care and a critical factor for health economics. Based on
   clinical management and pharmacoepidemilogical concepts that consider
   the severity of health problems, and the medical practice of watchful
   waiting, we propose a dual-market model for the diffusion of new
   prescription pharmaceuticals. This model distinguishes between an
   "early" adoption market involving patients with severe health problems,
   for whom demand is accumulated prior to the pharmaceutical's launch, and
   a "late" market corresponding to prescriptions for patients with mild
   problems, which is developed after and potentially triggered by the
   product's launch. We applied the model to monthly data on new
   prescriptions and on corresponding marketing activities for a new
   prescription category, representing the first oral treatment available
   for the disease. The results suggest that the proposed model has good
   parameter face and forecasting validity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

   and assess purchases over multiple categories with multiple nutritional
   attributes. We estimate a multi-category brand choice model using
   purchase history of a large sample of households (1062) in ten commonly
   purchased grocery categories. We find that health-conscious households
   constitute 18% of the market and that the more health conscious a
   household is, the less price sensitive it is. We also show that the
   following household demographic characteristics have strong impacts on a
   household's health consciousness: household income, house ownership,
   employment status of male household head, education level of male
   household head, presence of young children in the household, and the

AB Prior studies have shown that information about health hazards may shift
   demand downward, because consumers devaluate the affected product
   attribute, while overlooking the effect of such information on attribute
   importance weights, implicitly considering them to be stable. This study
   shows that information about health hazards may affect both the
   perception of attributes and their importance weights. Using data from a
   field experiment and econometric analysis, we identify conditions that
   lead to cross-attribute effects (information on health hazards regarding
   the affected attribute changes the importance weight of other
   attributes), and to cross-category effects (information on health
   hazards regarding the affected product changes the importance weights of
   substitute products' attributes). These insights might help policy
   makers in designing public campaigns aimed at changing unhealthy diets.
   For example, obesity has become a major problem in the developed world.
   However, the public campaigns targeted to obesity highlight the
   relationship between fat-laden food and health hazards. Our results hint
   that such campaigns may at the same time increase the importance weight
   of the taste attribute and therefore become less effective. (C) 2008

AB With allegations of food contamination rapidly increasing, people face
   numerous consumption decisions regarding food safety. This paper
   examines the roles of cultural similarity and personal relevance in
   consumers' perceptions of the risk of food-borne contamination and their
   intentions to reduce consumption of this food. We demonstrate that
   consumers are more concerned by the threat of a likely food-borne
   illness if the contamination occurred in a culturally similar location,
   regardless of physical or geographical proximity to the consumer.
   However, when the event is highly personally relevant, consumers feel
   threatened, which leads to message denial and a reversal of the
   facilitating effects of cultural similarity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

TI Is 1/10 > 10/100? The effect of denominator salience on perceptions of

AB This paper examines how people process base rate information (r = n/N)
   to estimate risk. We propose that the more salient the denominator of a
   base rate (N) is, the more the information draws attention to the people
   on which it is based. Information concerning smaller populations or
   sample groups (N = 1000 vs. 100.000), as well as geographically
   proximate populations, makes it easier for consumers to bring to mind
   the population involved. This increased salience of the denominator
   increases the attention paid to the numerator and translates into
   perceptions of greater risk.
   This investigation consists of three studies. Study 1 shows that when a
   constant numerator (viz., number of deaths by a certain cause in a given
   age group) is expressed in terms of a large denominator (viz., number of
   deaths by a given cause across all ages), the resulting smaller nominal
   rate, r, leads to a lower perceived risk than when expressed in terms of
   a larger denominator (viz., number of deaths by a given cause across all
   age groups). Studies 2 and 3 show that the smaller the nominal scale of
   the denominator (e.g., n/1000 vs. 100n/100,000), the population size
   (e.g., a campus of 32,000 vs. a state of 35 million), and the
   geographical distance of the population group in question (e.g., closer
   vs. further), the higher the estimated risk for a given base rate.
   Combined, the studies show that risk estimates are biased towards the
   numerator information when the denominator on which they are compared
   against is salient, as information presented in this way allows
   consumers to more easily bring to mind the population on which it is
   based. Implications for health risk communication include restating
   percentage base rates in terms of levels of incidence in a population
   group that is easy to bring to mind (i.e., smaller, more proximate
   populations).

AB With the growth and evolution of the Internet, electronic peer-to-peer
   referrals have become an important phenomenon, and marketers have tried
   to exploit their potential through viral marketing campaigns. At the
   same time, spam and e-mail-based viruses have cluttered electronic
   communications, making viral marketing campaigns problematic and
   challenging to deploy. The key driver in viral marketing is the
   effectiveness of unsolicited, electronic referrals to create awareness,
   trigger interest, and generate sales or product adoption. Yet, despite a
   large literature concerning interpersonal influence, little is known
   about how this electronic, or, indeed, any word-of-mouth process
   influences consumers' actual behaviors, particularly in a cluttered
   online environment. In this paper, we develop a model to help identify
   the role word-of-mouth plays during each stage of a viral marketing
   recipients' decision-making process, including the conditions that
   moderate such influence. We then present an innovative methodology for
   collecting data unobtrusively and in real time. We empirically test the
   model and methodology via a field study, where we observed the reactions
   of 1100 individuals after they received an unsolicited e-mail from one
   of their acquaintances, inviting them to take a survey and in turn
   spread the word about it. We found that characteristics of the social
   tie influenced recipients' behaviors, but had different effects at
   different stages: tie strength facilitated awareness, perceptual
   affinity triggered recipients' interest, and demographic similarity had
   a negative influence on each stage of the decision-making process. We
   conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological
   contributions of our work and of managerial implications of these
   findings for online marketers interested in strategies for leveraging
   peer-to-peer referral networks. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB To what extent does competitive entry create a structural change in key
   marketing metrics? New players mayjust be a temporal nuisance to
   incumbents, but could also fundamentally change the latter's performance
   evolution, or induce them to permanently alter their spending levels
   and/or pricing decisions. Similarly, the addition of a new marketing
   channel could permanently shift shopping preferences, or could just
   create a short-lived migration from existing channels. The steady-state
   impact of a given entry or channel addition on various marketing metrics
   is intrinsically an empirical issue for which we need an appropriate
   testing procedure. In this study, we introduce a testing sequence that
   allows for the endogenous determination of potential change (break)
   locations, thereby accounting for lead and/or lagged effects of the
   introduction of interest. By not restricting the number of potential
   breaks to one (as is commonly done in the marketing literature), we
   quantify the impact of the new entrant(s) while controlling for other
   events that may have taken place in the market. We illustrate the
   methodology in the context of the Dutch television advertising market,
   which was characterized by the entry ofseveral late movers. We find that
   the steady-state growth ofprivate incumbents'revenues was slowed by the
   quasi-simultaneous entry of three new players. Contrary to industry
   observers' expectations, such a slowdown was not experienced in the
   related markets of print and radio advertising. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recognizing that strategic alliances represent an important means for
   developing knowledge in critical arenas such as new product development,
   the authors advance the notion of collateral learning that assesses
   knowledge acquisition internal to a firm in the alliance. To examine its
   antecedents, the authors build on the behavioral theory of the firm and
   propose strategic importance and performance vulnerability as the
   motivational components and organizational similarity and alliance
   experience as the awareness components advocated in the theory. Results
   from 133 alliance firms suggest that both the motivational and awareness
   components are important in influencing collateral learning in new
   product alliances. Specifically, to develop collateral learning, firms
   should have extensive alliance experience and an acknowledged stake in
   their alliance partners. The results also support the theorized U-shaped
   relationship between organizational similarity of the alliance partners
   and collateral learning. Thus, collateral learning is facilitated when
   organizations are either similar or dissimilar, while medium levels of
   organizational similarity facilitate collateral learning to a relatively
   lower extent. Although performance vulnerability is found to be
   associated negatively with collateral learning, extensive alliance
   experience can attenuate this negative effect. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Extant research on the decomposition of unit sales bumps due to price
   promotions considers these effects only within a single product
   category. This article introduces a framework that accommodates specific
   cross-category effects. Empirical results based on daily data measured
   at the item/SKU level show that the effects of promotions on sales in
   other categories are modest. Between-category complementary effects
   (20%) are, on average, substantially larger than between-category
   substitution effects (11 %). Hence, a promotion of an item has an
   average net spin-off effect of (20 - 11 =) 9% of its own effect. The
   number of significant cross-category effects is low, which means that we
   expect that, most of the time, it is sufficient to look at
   within-category effects only. We also find within-category complementary
   effects, which implies that competitive items within the category may
   benefit from a promotion. We find small stockpiling effects (6%), modest
   cross-item effects (22%), and substantial category-expansion effects
   (72%). The cross-item effects are the result of cross-item substitution
   effects within the category (26%) and within-category complementary
   effects (4%). Approximately 15% (=11% / 72%) of the category-expansion
   effect is due to between-category substitution effects of dependent
   categories. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   positive and negative word of mouth (PWOM, NWOM) on brand purchase
   probability.
   For familiar brands, we find that:
   1. The impact of PWOM is generally greater than NWOM. The pre-WOM
   probability of purchase tends to be below 0.5, which gives more latitude
   for PWOM to increase purchase probability than for NWOM to reduce it.
   2. The impact of both PWOM and NWOM is strongly related to the pre-WOM
   probability of purchase, the strength of expression of the WOM, and
   whether the WOM is about the respondent's preferred brand.
   3. PWOM and NWOM appear to be similar forms of advice-giving behavior,
   except for their opposed effects on choice.
   4. Respondents resist NWOM on brands they are very likely to choose, and
   resist PWOM on brands they are very unlikely to choose. In the

   realistic. In the literature, three different models are used to analyze
   the results of a conjoint choice experiment with a no-choice option: the
   no-choice multinomial logit model, the extended no-choice multinomial
   logit model, and the nested no-choice multinomial logit model. We
   develop optimal designs for the two most appealing of these models using
   the D-optimality criterion and the modified Fedorov algorithm and
   compare these optimal designs with a reference design, which is
   constructed while ignoring the no-choice option, in terms of estimation
   and prediction accuracy. We conclude that taking into account the
   no-choice option when designing a no-choice experiment only has a
   marginal effect on the estimation and prediction accuracy as long as the
   model used for estimation matches the data-generating model. (C) 2008

   (2005). Measuring and modeling the (limited) reliability of free choice
   attitude questions. International Journal of Research in Marketing,
   22(3), 309-318.] can be partly explained by the prevailing methods used
   in market research, which can often lead consumers to construct
   temporary associations. To increase the proportion of stable
   brand-attribute associations, we recommend the following improvements in
   market research methods: use of a shorter, brand-prompted attribute
   association task; inclusion of an "don't know this brand" option to
   isolate ratings of brands unknown to the individual; omission of the
   standard instruction to guess when uncertain; and, in cross-cultural
   studies, translation of instructions and attribute descriptions into
   appropriate first languages. Even with these improvements, however, the
   maximal stability of associations that brands can achieve is less than
   100% after correcting for methodological influences. This imperfect
   stability may mean that consumers learn brand-specific attribute
   associations that are temporary but stable enough to lead them to try or
   re-try the brand, after which consumers replace the specific brand
   associations with a summary brand attitude. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This research proposes a framework for relating governance mechanisms
   (power, contracts, and trust) to the generation of creative approaches
   to business activities in buyer-seller relationships. The framework is
   tested with a survey of 262 purchasing agents. The results indicate that
   trust and contract affect the three facilitators of inter-organizational
   creativity: (1) knowledge-sharing routines (resources), (2) learning
   orientation (motivation), and (3) managerial support and open-mindedness
   (managerial practices). Also, the effects of trust and contract on the
   creativity in buyer-seller relationships are fully mediated by the above
   three facilitators. In particular, trust plays a more influential role
   in stimulating creativity. While power is not significantly associated
   with any of the facilitators, its overall effect on creativity is
   negative. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High tech firms can mitigate potential risks by diversifying their
   product-market portfolios. A key research question is how such
   diversification influences firm survival. A firm exits the market in two
   ways, specifically, dissolution and acquisition. Here, we model how the
   diversity of a new firm's product-market portfolio influences the times
   to both types of exits. Specifically, we allow for interaction effects
   of the competitive intensity of a firm's environment and the diversity
   of a firm's product-market portfolio with its patents and trademarks.
   Using a competing risk hazard model, we estimate the effects of various
   covariates on the time to exit for 1435 US high tech firms.
   We observed that a more diverse product-market portfolio, in conjunction
   with a larger number of patents, hastens the time to a firm's exit by
   dissolution (9% decrease in survival duration), while in conjunction
   with a larger number of trademarks, portfolio diversity delays the time
   to exit by dissolution (12% increase). A more competitive firm
   environment results in a greater effect on the portfolio's diversity in
   delaying its exit by dissolution (7% increase). On the other hand, a
   diverse product-market portfolio, combined with either a larger number
   of patents or trademarks, hastens the firm's exit by acquisition (19%
   and 11% decrease respectively). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Brand managers are increasingly confronted with the option of licensing
   their brands when pursuing brand extensions. Such decisions are
   typically based on evaluation of the risks associated with such a
   contractual form, and with the nature of the asset at stake, i.e., the
   brand. Drawing on transaction cost economics and the brand extension
   literature, the authors investigate how managers balance the advantages
   of rapidly accessing new product categories through licensing with the
   risk of negative reciprocal effects and licensees' opportunistic
   behavior. Our results suggests that firms tend to be strategically
   conservative when examining how to extend their brands, as managers see
   the risk of negative effects on the parent brand as outweighing the
   advantages associated with licensing. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All tights

AB In this paper, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
   single-purpose multiple-store shopping is not only driven by
   opportunistic, promotion-based motivations, but that it may also result
   from a longer-term planning process based on stable store
   characteristics. We find that consumers may systernatically visit
   multiple stores to take advantage of two types of store complementarity.
   In the case of 'fixed cost complementarity', consumers alternate visits
   to high and low fixed cost stores to balance transportation and holding
   costs against acquisition costs. 'Category-preference complementarity'
   occurs when different stores offer the best value for different product
   categories; this may induce consumers to visit these stores together on
   combined shopping trips. In both cases, multiple-store shopping leads to
   a shift from share-of customers to share-of-wallet retail competition.

AB In this paper we investigate whether consideration of store-level
   heterogeneity in marketing mix effects improves the accuracy of the
   marketing mix elasticities, fit, and forecasting accuracy of the
   widely-applied SCAN*PRO model of store sales. Models with continuous and
   discrete representations of heterogeneity, estimated using hierarchical
   Bayes (HB) and finite mixture (FM) techniques, respectively, are
   empirically compared to the original model, which does not account for
   store-level heterogeneity in marketing mix effects, and is estimated
   using ordinary least squares (OLS). The empirical comparisons are
   conducted in two contexts: Dutch store-level scanner data for the
   shampoo product category; and an extensive simulation experiment. The
   simulation investigates how between- and within-segment variance in
   marketing mix effects, error variance, the number of weeks of data, and
   the number of stores impact the accuracy of marketing mix elasticities,
   model fit, and forecasting accuracy. Contrary to expectations,
   accommodating store-level heterogeneity does not improve the accuracy of
   marketing mix elasticities relative to the homogeneous SCAN*PRO model,
   suggesting that little may be lost by employing the original homogeneous
   SCAN*PRO model estimated using ordinary least squares. Improvements in
   fit and forecasting accuracy are also fairly modest. We pursue an
   explanation for this result since research in other contexts has shown
   clear advantages from assuming some type of heterogeneity in market
   response models. In an Afterthought section. we comment on the
   controversial nature of our result, distinguishing factors inherent to
   household-level data and associated models vs. general store-level data
   and associated models vs. the unique SCAN*PRO model specification. (c)

   consumers; one reason for this is that they are oftentimes prone to
   dismissing their more common ecological behaviors (e.g., avoid

   of commonly performed ecological behaviors as environmentally triendly
   (what we call positive cueing) renders both cued and non-cued common
   ecological behaviors more diagnostic for the inference of
   pro-environmental attitudes (Study 1). As a result, positive cueing
   increases the likelihood that people will see themselves as consumers
   who are concerried with the degree to which their behavior is
   environmentally responsible (Study 2). The cueing of common ecological
   behaviors leads participants to choose environmentally triendly products
   with greater frequency, and even to use scrap paper more efficiently
   (Study 3). We discuss the implications for effective social marketing

   the degree of technological unpredictability. An empirical test is

AB This study seeks to answer the following question: Can sales
   representatives enhance their performance through their acceptance of
   information technology (IT) tools? Using data collected from two
   companies, we show that despite uncertain results and the frequent
   resistance among salespeople to IT interventions, IT acceptance indeed
   has a positive effect on sales performance. This occurs because
   salespeople using IT expand their knowledge and, in turn, gain improved
   targeting abilities, enhanced presentation skills, and increased call
   productivity. Thus, sales representatives have a strong incentive to
   accept IT because doing so is likely to sharpen their own job
   performance. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We explore the effects of individual-and network-level negative
   word-of-mouth on a firm's profits using an agent-based model,
   specifically an extended small-world analysis. We include both permanent
   strong ties within the social network, and changing, often random, weak
   ties with other networks. The effect of negative word-of-mouth on the
   Net Present Value (NPV) of the firm was found to be substantial, even
   when the initial number of dissatisfied customers is relatively small.
   We show that the well-known phenomenon of the strength of weak ties has
   contradictory effects when taking into account negative word-of-mouth:
   Weak ties help to spread harmful information through networks and can
   become a negative force for the product's spread. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB The benefits of retaining customers have led companies to search for
   means of profiling their customers individually and tracking their
   retention and defection behaviors. To this end, the main issues
   addressed in customer base analysis are identification of customer
   active/inactive status and prediction of future purchase levels. We
   compare the predictive performance of Pareto/NBD and BG/NBD models from
   the customer base analysis literature-in terms of repeat purchase levels
   and active status - using grocery retail transaction data. We also
   modify the BG/NBD model to incorporate zero repeat purchasers. All
   models capture the main characteristics of the purchase and dropout
   process of individual customers and produce similar forecasts. There are
   some deviations in the cumulative purchase estimates of the models,
   which may be due to the characteristics of grocery purchasing. (C) 2007

AB Despite the conventional wisdom that relationship marketing will
   generate favorable financial results, extant marketing research provides
   inconsistent evidence for this effect. Here, we investigate this
   important question: Does a firm's relationship marketing truly pay off
   by enhancing financial outcomes? We examine the effects of relationship
   marketing on a buyer's concurrent person-to-firm relationship with the
   selling firm and his/her interpersonal relationship with the
   salesperson. Drawing on social judgment and attribution theories, we
   offer and test a theoretical model explicating (1) how a seller's
   social, structural, and financial relationship marketing programs affect
   buyer relationship quality with the salesperson and the selling firm and
   (2) bow those relationship qualities ultimately generate seller
   financial outcomes. Relationship marketing programs indeed build buyer
   relationship quality, but whether those relationship-building effects
   reside with the salesperson or the selling firm depends on buyer
   perceptions regarding salesperson versus selling firm control of those
   programs. Buyer relationship quality with both salesperson and selling
   firm positively affect seller financial outcomes, but the effect of
   relationship quality with the selling firm is enhanced as perceived
   selling firm consistency increases. Employing triadic data from matched
   buyer, salesperson, and sales manager, this research presents an
   end-to-end empirical examination of how a seller's relationship
   marketing affects its financial outcomes through the buyer's
   relationships with the salesperson and selling firm. (C) 2007 Elsevier

AB This paper presents and estimates an attribute-based choice model where
   pure inertial and pure variety seeking behaviors are incorporated as,
   sometimes transient, particular cases of a general utility function. In
   light of the evidence of several state-dependent patterns, the standard
   framework is extended by considering non-linear partial utilities that
   allow for a wide spectrum of behavioral patterns. Under the inverted-U
   hybrid utility assumption, the consumer behaves inertially among
   unfamiliar items, but eventually switches to variety-seeking behavior
   when a high level of familiarity with the implied attributes is
   approached. An empirical analysis is run using scanner databases for
   fabric softener, saltine cracker, and catsup product categories.
   Non-linear specifications provide the best fit of the data and reveal
   that the gradual trend, to seek variety as the level of familiarity with
   the purchased items increases, can be forecasted with higher predictive
   ability. The results confirm significant differences in the purchasing
   patterns across segments, as well as relevant segments presenting hybrid
   behavior for most attributes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Being well-calibrated means that a person is realistic in his or her
   assessment of the level of knowledge that he or she possesses. This
   study finds that involvement leads to better calibration and that
   calibration is higher for procedural knowledge and common knowledge, as
   compared to declarative knowledge and specialized knowledge. Neither
   usage, nor experience, has any effect on calibration of knowledge of the
   web. No difference in calibration is observed between genders. But, in
   agreement with previous findings, this study also finds that males are
   more confident in their knowledge of the web. The results point out that
   calibration could be more a function of knowledge-specific factors and
   less that of individual-specific factors. The study also identifies flow
   and frustration with the web as consequences of calibration of knowledge
   of the web and draws the attention of future researchers to examine

AB This paper examines the trend in service firms to integrate an emotional
   dimension into provider responses to consumer emotions. An empirical
   study showed that such a strategy is effective only if the consumer
   coping demonstrates an emotional engagement with the service episode.
   Because both angry and anxious consumers cope primarily by planful
   problem solving (i.e., attempting to resolve the situation and attain
   their consumption goal), provider responses that offered solutions
   (instrumental support) were more effective than responses that offered
   emotional support. Further, angry consumers were emotionally engaged
   with the situation while anxious consumers emotionally disengaged from
   it. Consequently, provider response that included emotional support and
   instrumental support was the most effective for angry consumers, but
   there was no benefit to also including emotional support for anxious
   consumers. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The introduction of new products is widely recognized as one of the most
   important marketing activities of companies. Nevertheless, an intensive
   new product strategy is risky, as many new products fail in their first
   year. The purpose of this article is to increase our understanding of
   the factors affecting the first-year consumer acceptance of new
   products. To study this, we use two metrics of acceptance, viz., the
   first-year level of purchases and the first-year trend in purchases of
   new products at the level of the individual household. We develop
   hypotheses pertaining to the effect of product, competitive environment,
   and consumer factors on these two metrics of consumer acceptance. Our
   data comprise the sales in the first four quarters after introduction
   for 301 new CPGs launched in the U.K. (74 CPG introductions), France
   (104), Germany (67), and Spain (56), using Europanel household panels in
   each country, involving a total of over 16,000 households. The extensive
   data used in this study provide a strong test of the generalizability of
   the findings. The empirical results support the hypotheses and allow us
   to derive cross-national empirical generalizations, as well as to
   identify differences regarding factors underlying new product
   acceptance. Particularly noteworthy is that, across all four countries,
   acceptance of new products is systematically affected in the same way by
   consumer characteristics. This implies that these variables can be used
   for national, as well as for international, market segmentation. In
   addition to recommendations for pan-European segmentation strategies,
   the results allow us to make suggestions for the R&D process and local
   marketing activities. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ongoing unification taking place in the European political scene,
   along with recent advances in consumer mobility and communication
   technology, raises the question of whether the European Union can be
   treated as a single market to exploit potential synergy effects from
   pan-European marketing strategies. Previous research, which mostly used
   domain-specific segmentation bases, has resulted in mixed conclusions.
   In this paper, a more general segmentation basis is adopted, as we
   consider the homogeneity in the European countries' Consumer Confidence
   Indicators. Moreover, rather than analyzing more traditional static
   similarity measures, we adopt the concepts of dynamic correlation and
   cohesion between countries. The short-run fluctuations in consumer
   confidence are found to be largely country specific. A myopic focus on
   these fluctuations may inspire management to adopt multicountry
   strategies, forgoing the potential longer-run benefits from more
   standardized marketing strategies. Indeed, the Consumer Confidence
   Indicators become much more homogeneous as the planning horizon is
   extended. Moreover, this homogeneity is inversely related to the
   economic and cultural distance among the various member states. Hence,
   pan-regional rather than pan-European strategies are called for. (c)

   important results of brand extension research generalize, to a certain
   extent, across all five areas of empirical generalization. However, some
   notable differences occurred (e.g., between different types of parent

   levels of PWOM, and individuals who produce NWOM also tend to produce
   PWOM. In follow-up studies, using two alternative measures of WOM, we
   confirm that PWOM occurs approximately three times as often as NWOM.
   Further exploratory studies indicate that most PWOM is about a
   consumer's main brand; as a consequence, the incidence of PWOM in a

   of customer and technology orientations on business performance are
   contingent on the competitive environment. Specifically, as market
   demand becomes increasingly uncertain, the effect of a customer
   orientation on performance turns from positive to negative. Meanwhile,
   the impact of a technology orientation on performance changes from
   negative to positive with an increasing level of technological
   turbulence. However, a competitor orientation has a positive and robust
   effect on business performance, regardless of whether competition is low
   or intense. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasingly, firms use more and different routes to market. This study
   investigates whether such heterogeneity in the variety of routes to
   market can be explained systematically. More specifically, the authors
   examine how (1) the type and level of a firm's customer orientation and
   (2) the type and degree of customer search behavior influences the
   firm's adoption of a variety of routes. They collect primary data on 210
   firms in four consumer industries across three countries to test the
   hypotheses. The authors find strong evidence for a link between a firm's
   customer orientation and the breadth of its variety of routes but only
   partial evidence for a link between customer search behavior and the
   breadth of the variety of routes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All tights

AB One of the pressing issues in marketing is whether loyalty programs
   really enhance behavioral loyalty. Loyalty program members may have a
   much higher share-of-wallet at the firm with the loyalty program than
   non-members have, but this does not necessarily imply that loyalty
   programs are effective. Loyal customers may select themselves to become
   members in order to benefit from the program. Since this implies that
   program membership is endogenous, we estimate models for both the
   membership decision (using instrumental variables) and for the effect of
   membership on share-of-wallet, our measure of behavioral loyalty. We use
   panel data from a representative sample of Dutch households who report
   their loyalty program memberships for all seven loyalty programs in
   grocery retailing as well as their expenditures at each of the 20 major
   supermarket chains. We find a small positive yet significant effect of
   loyalty program membership on share-of-wallet. This effect is seven
   times smaller than is suggested by a naive model that ignores the
   endogeneity of program membership. The predictive validity of the
   proposed model is much better than for the naive model. Our results show
   that creating loyalty program membership is a crucial step to enhance
   share-of-wallet, and we provide guidelines on how to achieve this. (c)

   distributors often employ variant payment periods in their transactions
   with the same manufacturing company. This study sets out to analyze the
   causes that spark such intra-brand differences by considering two groups
   of antecedents: (1) those linked to the balance of power in the
   supplier-distributor relationship and (2) those that derive from the
   quest for efficiency in the marketing channel. The results of the study
   highlight how efficiency-based antecedents play a key role and arc:
   complementary to power-based analyses in explaining the phenomenon of

AB Voluntary turnover among trained salespeople that have ongoing customer
   relationships is of concern to managers, due to the high costs involved
   in recruiting and training replacements and re-establishing
   relationships with customers. This research examines a new approach to
   assessing the impact of personal sales expectations on job satisfaction
   and tendency to leave or remain with a company. The modeling approach is
   tested in the case of an industrial commodity manufacturer wishing to
   improve retention of a large business-to-business sales force. Job
   satisfaction is related to the gap between actual and expected
   performance, so a model is developed for individual sales expectations
   and updated monthly using readily available data. Estimation of a hazard
   model for turnover confirms that salespeople whose performance exhibits
   larger negative gaps are more likely to leave, whereas those exhibiting
   larger positive gaps are more likely to remain with the company. This
   model permits more accurate and more frequent predictions of turnover
   than is possible using attitude surveys, as well as predictions for
   employees that do not respond to surveys. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

   reason that these anticipated identification costs are conceptually and

   extrinsic product attributes, which are not consumable themselves, can
   reduce anticipated identification costs and improve assortment
   evaluation, by highlighting intrinsic product differences. In addition,

AB In the last decades, our discipline has made tremendous progress in
   addressing scientific and managerial marketing problems. However, our
   knowledge of marketing phenomena derives almost exclusively from
   research conducted in high income, industrialized countries. We believe
   it is paramount for the future of marketing science and practice that we
   conduct more research in so-called emerging markets (EMs). EMs present
   significant departures from the assumptions of theories developed in the
   Western world that challenge our conventional wisdom. In this article,
   we take the view that marketing science is built on the gencralizability
   of our findings across studies, across cultures, across national
   boundaries. EMs are natural laboratories in which theories and
   assumptions about their underlying mechanisms can be tested,
   generalizations derived and boundary conditions identified. We propose a
   framework delineating four stages through which EM research contributes
   to the growth of marketing science. The four stages are 1) theory
   development, 2) acquisition of meaningful data, 3) analysis of the data
   to test one's theories, and 4) learning. Through the process of
   deductive logic, general theories are operationalized in specific
   settings while, through the process of inductive logic, specific
   findings are used to arrive at more general conclusions. We discuss the
   unique issues and contributions of EM research for each of the four
   stages of this framework. Subsequently, we elaborate on the implications
   of EM research for development and implementation of marketing
   strategies. Our discussion reveals that some research has started to
   address these issues, but we have only begun to scratch the surface. In
   this spirit, we present an agenda for future research in EMs. (c) 2006

AB Although economically very important, local-service sectors have
   received little attention in the extensive literature on competitive
   interactions. Detailed data gathering in these sectors is hard, not only
   because of the multitude of local players, but also because key service
   dimensions are hard to quantify. Using empirical entry models in the
   tradition of Bresnahan and Reiss [Bresnahan, T.F., and Reiss, P.C.
   (1990). Entry in monopoly markets. Review of Economic Studies, 57 (192),
   531-553, Bresnahan, T.F., and Reiss, P.C. (1991). Entry and competition
   in concentrated markets. Journal of Political Economy, 99 (5),
   977-1009], we infer information on these sectors' degree of competition
   from the observed entry decisions in different local markets.
   We apply the empirical entry model to the video-rental market.
   Additional entries of video stores are found to significantly increase
   the level of competition. This occurs not only when a second player
   enters the market, but also in markets already characterized by two or
   more incumbents. Unlike the predictions of many economic models, we find
   this increase to be larger when the entry occurs in a duopoly than in a
   monopoly.
   Several control variables included in the model offer additional
   insights. As such, we find evidence of cannibalization from the upstream
   channel (movie theatres), but not from the downstream channel (premium
   cable). In addition, various socio-demographic characteristics of the
   trading zone, such as income and household size, are found to also have
   a significant impact on store performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The methods proposed in the new empirical industrial organization (NEIO)
   literature have made significant contributions to our understanding of
   competitive behavior. However, these methods have yet to be compared
   with each other for their performance in explaining and diagnosing
   competitive market conduct. This inter-method comparison is important
   because conclusions about competitive behavior based on these methods
   have significant strategic as well as policy implications for firms. Our
   objective in this paper is to examine the performance of these different
   NEIO methods in terms of their discriminatory power, ability to identify
   strategic variables, and robustness in estimation. For empirical
   demonstration, we use data from diverse industries such as
   microprocessors, personal computers, facial tissue, disposable diapers
   and automobiles. Our results suggest that two commonly used NEIO
   methods-conjectural variation and non-nested model comparison-exhibit
   quite good convergence with each other and are consistent with a
   traditional time series method. This suggests that simpler methods such
   as conjectural variations deserve more credit. We also find that using
   these methods in tandem provides valuable additional information that
   may not be available when using any one method alone. While the emphasis
   in this study is on comparing different methods of analyzing competitive
   interaction, the findings also reveal some substantive insights about
   each market studied. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   In three experiments, we find that the perceived differences between two
   options loom larger when equivalent attribute information is expressed
   in a large ratio frame than when it is expressed in a small ratio frame.
   Moreover, preferences shift toward an option when its superior attribute
   is presented in a large rather than a small ratio condition. We also

   desire for upward mobility) and managerial (control system,
   participation in decision making, feedback, recognition) factors. The
   test of the proposed model shows that desire for upward mobility is the
   only individual determinant of behavior. Other than participation in
   decision making, all the managerial factors play influential roles in

AB Why do managers choose one sales compensation form rather than another?
   Theoretical answers typically focus on the type of plans managers should
   design, not on the factors that managers actually consider. Managers
   from various national origins pursue and weigh objectives through
   experience in a way that theoretical models may not capture.
   Incorporating conceptualizations from a wide range of disciplines, we
   specify a model examining the influence of cultural factors on sales
   compensation decisions of managers (incentive vs. fixed pay and parity
   vs. equity allocation). The model, tested with data collected from bank
   managers across six European countries, illustrates the importance of
   considering national culture when designing sales force compensation
   policies applied across multiple countries. We also find evidence that
   most European bank managers accept incentive pay to motivate salespeople
   but, perhaps paradoxically, overwhelmingly reject equity allocations to
   achieve control and parity. We discuss the implications of our findings
   for research on international governance systems and the diffusion of
   sales force management practices. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB It is now well recognized that an effective service recovery program is
   essential to generating customer satisfaction and loyalty. A number of
   studies have investigated the impact of service recovery efforts
   (compensation, speed of response, etc) on post-recovery satisfaction.
   However, despite the importance of global markets, none have examined
   the impact of customers' cultural value orientation (i.e., cultural
   values measured at the individual level) in implementing effective
   service recovery programs. In this research we use the individual rather
   than the nation as the unit of analysis. Using an experimental design
   with data from both Eastern and Western cultures, we investigate how
   customer evaluations of recovery efforts are influenced by interplay of
   consumers' value orientation and service recovery attributes (apology,
   cognitive control, and recovery initiation). The results reveal that
   cultural values of individual Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance and
   Collectivism do indeed interact with a firm's recovery tactics to
   influence perceptions of fairness (justice). Finally, all three forms of
   justice (distributive, procedural, interactional) positively impact on
   overall service recovery satisfaction. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB This research focuses on the impact that salesperson knowledge and
   empowering leader behaviors have on salesperson working smarter and
   working harder behaviors. In turn, we examine the impact of working
   harder and smarter on customer service, customer satisfaction, and
   ultimately, on sales performance. Moreover, we propose an interactive
   relationship, whereby the influences of leader empowering behaviors and
   salespersons' knowledge will be moderated by salespersons' experience.
   We tested our hypotheses using survey data from a sample of 175 sales
   people in the pharmaceutical field, along with external ratings of
   salespersons' knowledge from sales managers, customer ratings of sales
   satisfaction and service, and archival measures of salespersons' effort
   and performance. Results indicate that contrary to popular belief,
   employees with low levels of product/industry experience benefit the
   most from leader empowering behaviors. Also, we find that employees with
   lower levels of experience and higher levels of knowledge are more
   inclined to work harder. We conclude with directions for future
   research. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the effect of secondhand markets for durable goods
   on the firm's dynamic pricing and new product introduction strategies.
   Our model differs from previous new product studies because we
   simultaneously consider several factors: secondhand markets,
   industry-specific differences (i.e., general cost conditions), different
   pricing strategies (uniform pricing and price discrimination), and
   demand externalities. In addition, the model allows nonbuyers from the
   past to remain in the market in the future.
   The main managerial results are twofold. Contrary to intuition, for
   well-defined scenarios, secondhand markets can actually increase the
   firm's profitability. In addition, secondhand markets will have
   differential effects on pricing across industries depending on the
   magnitude of the innovation (major, moderate, or minor) and whether
   demand externalities are present. For industries in which innovations
   are typically minor or moderate, the firm should not use a price
   discrimination strategy. For industries where innovations are major, the
   firm should not introduce the first-generation product; instead, the
   optimal strategy is to leapfrog and directly introduce the
   second-generation product in the future. Interestingly, for industries
   in which demand externalities are sufficiently strong (e.g., software),
   the secondhand market disappears.
   The effect of the secondhand market on product-line pricing is as
   follows. In the second period, new customers pay a lower price for the
   second-generation product. However, upgraders pay a higher price when
   secondhand markets exist. In the first period, the effect of secondhand
   markets on the price of the first-generation product is conditional and
   depends on whether the innovation is major, moderate, or minor. The
   effect of market growth on prices is unambiguous: all prices, including
   the secondhand and upgrade prices, increase (decrease) when the market
   is growing (declining). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A key change in the retail environment over the last 20 years has been
   the emergence and growth of low priced quality-equivalent store brands.
   National brand manufacturers with popular products seem to help
   retailers by supplying them with quality-equivalent store brands that
   are then sold for lower prices. Nevertheless, empirical research has
   found that this phenomenon often leads to higher average category
   prices. We explain this apparent contradiction using a model where a
   national brand manufacturer supports its product with advertising and
   the retailer may introduce a store brand to better serve its customers.
   Our analysis shows that when both the manufacturer and the retailer have
   market power, the launch of a quality-equivalent store brand by the
   retailer can lead to higher average category prices. Rather than leading
   to what some call "private label competition", both the manufacturer and
   the retailer benefit with the launch of quality-equivalent store brands.
   As a result, even a dominant manufacturer has an incentive to agree to a
   retailer's request to supply a quality-equivalent store brand. (c) 2006

   to evaluate the simultaneous interrelationships among different aspects

   issues. We draw on structural equation modeling techniques and use a
   sample of 636 purchases to develop and test a parsimonious integrative
   model of interrelationships among key aspects of the procurement
   process. In general, our results support our model of the procurement
   process, including relationships among purchase importance,

   have dealt with the existence of moderating variables of the
   relationship. These studies focused essentially on the moderating role
   of the environmental conditions. Based on a survey of 142 product
   managers or sales directors, this article offers a new approach.
   Firstly, it completely models this moderating effect, providing a
   structured framework for future research. Secondly, thanks to the use of
   an original measurement scale, it apprehends objective environmental
   conditions. Thirdly, it details the market orientation-new product
   performance relationship, by modeling a new mediator, the instrumental
   use of available information, thus giving a clearer insight into how and

AB This paper examines new product introductions and failures when firms
   make new product introduction decisions under some uncertainty about
   future demand or cost conditions. It shows that increased uncertainty is
   not necessarily detrimental to new product introductions; it can
   incentivize more firms to introduce new products, and can lead to more
   new product failures, too. The paper also shows that markets that have
   firms with more positively correlated cost structures may attract fewer
   new product introductions and have fewer new product failures. Such cost
   correlations can arise, for example, if firms choose to cooperate on
   R&D, have common labor unions, or use the same suppliers, etc. Finally,
   we show that if firms are risk-averse, then the relationship between
   degree of uncertainty and number of new product introductions can be

   is a friendship group of consumers with a shared enthusiasm for the

   in group actions to accomplish collective goals and/or to express mutual
   sentiments and commitments. Group activities centered on the brand
   intermingle with other social activities in these brand communities. A
   comprehensive model is proposed based on a broadening and deepening of
   the theory of planned behavior to incorporate social intentions, three
   aspects of social identity (cognitive self-awareness of membership in
   the brand community, affective commitment, and evaluative significance
   of membership), anticipated positive and negative emotions toward
   achieving or failing to achieve group participation goals, and desire as
   a transformative mechanism translating reasons for acting into social
   intentions to do so. The proposed theoretical framework is tested on a

AB This empirical paper explores economic and social origins of relational
   governance. Previous empirical research has provided substantial support
   for the positive relationship between exchange hazards (such as
   transaction specific assets or decision uncertainty) and relational
   governance. In contrast, we use transaction cost economics to argue that
   exchange hazards might limit the use of relational governance when power
   asymmetry exists within a marketing channel. Moreover, from a
   sociological perspective, a governance mechanism is not determined
   solely by initial exchange conditions; the process in which the
   interorganizational exchange emerges and develops also influences it. We
   argue that the social contact that occurs through inter-organizational
   communication not only is a critical determinant of relational
   governance, but it also may moderate opportunism arising from exchange
   hazards, thus increasing the establishment of relational governance.
   Overall, the empirical results support our hypotheses. (c) 2006 Elsevier

AB Customer relationships with service personnel have been recognised as a
   means by which a firm can gain service loyalty. However, loyalty to any
   one service worker (personal loyalty) has been generally discouraged by
   management due to the vulnerability of customer retention in situations
   where key employees leave the firm. We examine a personal services
   context where loyalty to an individual service worker is commonly formed
   and employee turnover is high. It was found that both perceived
   credibility of the service worker and the degree of personal loyalty
   were the most important contributors to service business loyalty. Hence
   rather than fear, and therefore discourage personal loyalty from
   developing, managers should capitalize on personal loyalty's
   contribution to service loyalty and safeguard this loyalty by ensuring
   that all service personnel working at the firm are perceived as credible
   by the customer. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the most important applications of the Bass model is "guessing by
   analogy" - the parameter estimates of the Bass model for analogous
   products can be used to predict the diffusion pattern of a new product.
   However, estimates based on left-hand truncated data will be biased
   unless care is taken to adjust for the bias. We demonstrate the
   prevalence of left truncation in historical sales data and present a
   method for dealing with the bias by the Virtual Bass Model. We use the
   model to develop a database of parameter estimates that may be used in
   "guessing by analogy." (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Firms introducing new products into multi-markets often face the dilemma
   of how to dynamically allocate their marketing resources during
   penetration. The aim of this study is to examine which responsive
   allocation strategy is more effective for these firms. We explore three
   major resource allocation strategies: uniform strategy, in which the
   firm distributes the marketing efforts evenly among its regions
   regardless of market development; support-the-strong strategy, under
   which the firm invests its efforts proportional to the number of
   adopters in that region (at least up to a certain market coverage); and
   support-the-weak strategy, in which the firm invests its efforts
   proportional to the remaining market potential.
   Using both formal analysis and complex systems simulations, we find that
   strategies that disperse marketing efforts, such as support-the-weak and
   uniform strategies, are generally superior to support-the-strong
   strategy. Not only is this finding surprisingly robust to market
   conditions and variations on these strategies, but it also runs counter
   to conventional wisdom prevailing in international marketing. The
   conditions under which support-the-strong policy might become more
   effective include: (a) fixed entry or operation costs above a certain
   level; and (b) substantial variance between regions in responsiveness to
   marketing efforts. However, variance in intrinsic innovativeness between
   regions does not imply the superiority of support-the-strong strategy.

AB We present analyses of an extraordinary new dataset that reveals the
   path taken by individual shoppers in an actual grocery store, as
   provided by RFID (radio frequency identification) tags located on their
   shopping carts. The analysis is performed using a multivariate
   clustering algorithm not yet seen in the marketing literature that is
   able to handle data sets with unique (and numerous) spatial constraints.
   This allows us to take into account physical impediments (such as the
   location of aisles and other inaccessible areas of the store) to ensure
   that we only report feasible centroid paths. We also recognize that time
   spent in the store plays an important role, leading to different cluster
   configurations for short, medium, and long trips. The resulting three
   sets of clusters identify a total of 14 "canonical path types" that are
   typical of grocery store travel, and we carefully describe (and
   cross-validate) each set of clusters. These results dispel certain myths
   about shopper travel behavior that common intuition perpetuates,
   including behavior related to aisles, end-cap displays, and the
   "racetrack." We briefly relate these results to previous research (using
   much more limited datasets) covering travel behavior in retail stores
   and other related settings. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We apply a model that accommodates dynamic phenomena in demand- and
   reaction functions. The latter functions capture reactions to actions as
   well as to consequences of actions. We estimate a fixed effects VARX
   model with dynamic and interactive effects for multiple brands based on
   pooled time series and cross-sectional data for two product categories.
   The Impulse Response Analysis (IRA) results for one category (tuna)
   under different scenarios show that the inclusion/exclusion of
   competitive reaction-and feedback effects matters a lot, consistent with
   a high degree of competitive interaction in this market. We find that
   the role of cross-brand feedback effects is greater than the role of
   traditional competitive reaction effects. Intrafirm effects (internal
   decisions) also play an important role. In a decomposition study we show
   that the exclusion of these effects may either increase (up to 12%) or
   decrease (by as much as 50%) the net unit sales effect of a 20% price
   reduction. By contrast, in the second category (shampoo), where brands
   have distinct positions, the exclusion of these effects matters very
   little. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To have a productive sales force, firms must provide their salespeople
   with sales training. But from a profit-maximizing perspective, there are
   also reasons to limit training: training is expensive, it has
   diminishing returns. and trained salespeople need to be compensated at a
   higher level since their value in the outside labor market has
   increased. Due to these reasons, the following inter-related questions
   are not straightforward to answer: (1) How much training should be
   provided and how should training be scheduled over time? (2) How should
   compensation vary with training? (3) Should salespeople be asked to pay
   for some or all of their training? An analytical model is developed and
   analyzed using optimal control theory to provide answers to these
   questions. Thereafter, an empirical investigation is undertaken that
   broadly corroborates the analytical findings. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

AB While a significant literature has emerged recently on the longer-term
   effects of price promotions, as inferred from persistence models, there
   is very little if any attention paid to whether such longer-term effects
   vary across different types of consumers. This paper takes a first step
   in that direction by exploring whether the adjustment, permanent, and
   total effects of price promotions, and the duration of the adjustment
   period, differ between consumers segmented based on their usage rates in
   a product category and their loyalty to a brand. We also investigate
   whether such consumer segmentation will improve the forecasting
   performance of persistence models at both product category and brand
   levels. Expectations are developed based on consumer behavior theory on
   various effects of price promotions, such as the post-deal trough, the
   mere purchase effect, the promotion usage effect, and responsiveness to
   competitor's reactions. Evidence from household-level supermarket
   scanner data on four product categories is provided. We find substantial
   differences between consumer segments and provide insights on how
   managers can increase the longer-term effectiveness of price promotions
   by targeting each consumer segment with a different promotion program.
   In addition, consumer segmentation is found to significantly improve the
   forecasting performance of the persistence model for two of the four
   product categories. For the other two product categories, consumer
   segmentation provides forecasting performance similar to that obtained
   from aggregate-level persistence models. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   usefulness of this benchmark for detecting irregularities in prices, and
   a clear trend towards psychological pricing after the nominal shock of

AB Much research has focused on the effects of reference prices on brand
   choice decisions using scanner panel data. The theory and application
   are well-documented and accepted. However, researchers have found
   contrary results on the existence of loss aversion in consumer goods
   markets. Loss aversion is a phenomenon based on the reference dependent
   theory that consumers respond more to losses (reference price<price)
   than to gains (reference price>price). The mixed results on the
   existence of loss aversion can be a result of not adequately accounting
   for consumer heterogeneity in response to marketing effects. Therefore,
   we focus our analysis on loss aversion and adequately accounting for
   consumer heterogeneity. We estimate a reference dependent model with a
   mixed logit specification that allows for a continuous distribution of
   response heterogeneity in the population. We use Gibbs Sampling to
   obtain individual estimates. Our estimation results from two different
   consumer goods categories, which show that the degree of loss aversion
   is small after properly accounting for heterogeneity. Further, we
   accomplish a posterior analysis and investigate whether the individual
   response to gains and losses can be attributed to consumer specific
   characteristics. The relation of the estimated individual specific
   variables to households' sociodemographic and psychographic variables as
   well as to observed purchase behavior reveal interesting insights into
   which consumers respond more or less to price deviations from their
   reference point. Hence, our results are important for the development of
   effective pricing strategies and the timing of price promotions. (c)

AB Over the past two decades, marketing scientists in academia and industry
   have employed consumer choice models calibrated using supermarket
   scanner data to assess the impact of price and promotion on consumer
   choice, and they continue to do so today. Despite the extensive usage of
   scanner panel data for choice modeling, very little is known about the
   impact of data preparation strategies on the results of modeling
   efforts. In most cases, scanner panel data is pruned prior to model
   estimation to eliminate less significant brands, sizes, product forms,
   etc., as well as households with purchase histories not long enough to
   provide information on key consumer behavior concepts such as loyalty,
   variety seeking, and brand consideration. Further, product entity
   aggregation is usually part of data preparation also since hundreds of
   SKUs are available as choice alternatives in many product categories.
   This study conducts an extensive simulation experiment to investigate
   the effects of data pruning and entity aggregation strategies on
   estimated price and promotion sensitivities. Characteristics of the data
   that may moderate the effects of data preparation strategies are also
   manipulated. The results show that data preparation strategies can
   result in significant bias in estimated parameters. Based on the
   results, we make recommendations on how the model builder can prepare
   scanner panel data so as to avoid significant biases in estimated price

   that examines this relationship under varying levels of environmental

   under conditions of high environmental turbulence, functionally diverse
   TMTs will be less able to achieve greater strategic orientation due to
   their functional differences. Conversely, when equipped with
   inter-functional coordination, we posit that TMT functional diversity
   will lead to greater strategic orientations under conditions of high
   environmental turbulence. Using data obtained from TMT executives in the
   manufacturing industry, we tested our model and found support for a

AB Advance selling before the time of consumption is now possible for even
   very small service providers, given new technologies (specifically,
   web-based transactions, biometrics and smart card technology). Moreover,
   recent research has revealed that advance selling can substantially
   improve profits without traditional price discrimination. However, that
   research was limited to monopoly settings.
   This paper explores the impact of competition on advance selling driven
   by consumer uncertainty about future consumption states (rather than
   price discrimination). We employ several different demand specifications
   to provide three major findings. First, unlike yield management (driven
   by price discrimination), the relative profit advantage from advance
   selling (driven by consumer uncertainty about future consumption states)
   in a competitive market can be higher or the same as that in a monopoly
   market. For every demand specification that we investigate, competition
   does not diminish the advantage of advance selling. The reason is that
   price discrimination leaves some groups (i.e., those being discriminated
   against) vulnerable to competitors (e.g., price discounts) and
   competition weakens discrimination. In contrast, consumer uncertainty
   applies to all consumers in the advance period so a competitor is unable
   to focus attention on only one group of consumers. However, in some
   demand specifications, the existence of competitors can limit the
   situations when an advance selling equilibrium exists because of the
   ability to unilaterally spot sell and damage profits of the seller who
   advance sells. Second, in some demand specifications, advance selling
   can create a win-win-win situation where the profits of two competitors
   increase while consumer surplus increases because advance selling allows
   greater market participation. Third, competition can strengthen the
   conditions under which advance selling is advantageous compared with
   spot selling.
   Hence, advance selling can be a very effective marketing tool in a
   competitive setting (albeit under more restrictive conditions than in a
   monopoly setting). It is a tool that can diminish competition and,
   unlike price discrimination, increase buyer surplus. Published by

AB Recessions can severely affect the performance of firms, and even their
   very survival. However, all firms are not equally affected by a
   recession. Some firms view recessions as opportunities to strengthen
   their businesses, invest aggressively and establish their advantage over
   their weaker competitors, whereas others cut back, waiting for the
   recession to pass. Why do some firms view the recession as an
   opportunity and develop an aggressive marketing response to it? What are
   the effects of such a marketing response on the performance of the firm?
   These are the two central questions we address in this paper.
   We propose a new construct, which we call proactive marketing in a
   recession, as the firm's interpretation of the recession as an
   opportunity (opportunity interpretation) and development and execution
   of a response to capitalize on the perceived opportunity created by the
   change (offensive response). We develop and test a model of the
   antecedents and consequences of proactive marketing during a recession.
   The results of a survey of 154 senior marketing executives show that
   some firms do indeed adopt proactive marketing during a recession. Both
   organizational and environmental contexts influence firms' proactive
   response to a recession. Finns that have a strategic emphasis on
   marketing, an entrepreneurial culture, and slack resources are proactive
   in their marketing activities during a recession, while the severity of
   the recession in the industry negatively affects proactive marketing
   response. In addition, firms that have a proactive marketing response in
   a recession achieve superior business performance even during the
   recession.
   Our results suggest that not all firms do, or should, respond in a
   proactive manner during a recession. Those firms with a strategic
   emphasis on marketing already have programs in place (e.g.,
   well-recognized brands, differentiated products, targeted
   communications, good support and service, etc.) that enable them to
   derive benefits from a proactive marketing response during the
   recession. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a model of competitive positioning and pricing of new
   products in a multisegmented market that is useful not only for new
   entrants, but also for brand managers of incumbents to assess the
   potential threats inherent in existing market structures. We do this for
   a multisegmented market in which the ideal point for each segment is
   located in a multidimensional discrete-attribute space with fixed
   demands at a given point in time. Firms launch new products sequentially
   at positions in this attribute space, incurring fixed and variable
   costs, and then decide on their product prices. Each firm acts to
   maximize its profit. We allow free entry, regardless of whether or not
   an entry location is occupied by an incumbent, and the position and
   price of a firm's product determine its market share. The number of
   firms that can make a profit in the market is determined endogenously,
   and the model determines the number of survivors. Free and endogenous
   entry removes from the brand manager the need to evaluate millions of
   potential entry threats from combinations of new products and possible
   positions. Instead, the methods developed here determine a much smaller
   set of threats that need to be considered. We adopt from the
   facility-location literature another equilibrium concept, the stable
   set, and relate it to the Nash equilibrium. Location decisions are
   stable, if, and only if, the entrants make a profit (viability) and the
   non-entrants cannot find any location such that their profit after entry
   is non-negative (survival). We design a heuristic algorithm based on
   genetic algorithms to empirically obtain the Nash equilibrium. The
   illustration involves the prospect of new brands attempting to enter the
   established liquid detergent market. Using aggregated share data from
   heavy user and light user segments, we model the segment-level market
   share as a function of distance from segment-specific ideal points, with
   segment-specific price sensitivities. We use segment-level shares to
   locate heavy and light user ideal points in a product-positioning space
   derived from Consumer Reports ratings of the real brands. The results
   show that the only open position for successful entry matches the
   effectiveness of Tide (the market leader) in removing stains, and lowers
   costs (and price) by sacrificing on the other attribute in the space.
   The reduced price appeals to the heavy user segment, leading to
   profitable entry. This position for entry remains profitable even if
   Tide opportunistically relocates. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights

AB This paper proposes a dynamic state-space AIDS model of brand share. The
   model structure separates the transitory and permanent components of the
   data and offers several key advantages over conventional share modelling
   approaches. Firstly, it provides a general framework to examine the time
   series properties of brand share. Secondly, it provides an accurate
   assessment of the short-run effects of marketing mechanics. Thirdly, the
   extracted permanent component can be used in a separate auxiliary
   analysis of the long-run effects of marketing mechanics. The model is
   applied to a small segment of the toiletries category comprising four
   differentiated brands and covering over five years of quad-weekly time
   series data. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the
   conventional AIDS model and indicate short-run competition on the basis
   of price and promotional activity. Long-run analysis, however, suggests
   that such activity exerts no sustainable impact on the share of
   competing brands. Out of sample forecasts are satisfactory and provide
   an improvement over both a standard dynamic AIDS and
   time-varying-parameter MNL model. Brand share forecasts, in conjunction
   with price and segment value forecasts, are then used to produce brand
   volume forecasts. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB An important phenomenon in recent years has been the growth of
   low-service manufacturer-operated stores in malls located a significant
   distance from the shopping districts of major metropolitan areas. For
   the most part, these "outlet" stores offer minimal service, attractive
   pricing and a full product line. However, the "outlet" store phenomenon
   is not universal and there are a number of categories where
   manufacturers restrict their distribution to primary retailers.
   Our objective is to provide a rationale for the popularity of outlet
   stores in some categories and the absence of outlet stores in others. We
   build an analytical model with two manufacturers that distribute (a)
   through primary retailers or (b) with dual distribution (through primary
   retailers and outlet malls). The manufacturers compete in a market of
   buyers that are heterogeneous in terms of price and service sensitivity.
   The motivation for dual or segmented distribution is certainly related
   to differences between consumers. However, the attractiveness of
   retailing through outlet stores and through primary retailers is not a
   straightforward function of the degree to which consumers are different.
   It is related to how consumers are different. In particular, when the
   range of service sensitivity across consumers is high relative to the
   range of price sensitivity, manufacturers will find that single channel
   distribution is superior. When the opposite is true, manufacturers have
   higher profits in a market where dual distribution with outlet stores is
   utilized. This key result holds because outlet malls attract
   price-sensitive, non-service-sensitive consumers, leaving more
   service-sensitive (and less price-sensitive) consumers in the primary
   market. Decreasing the sensitivity of demand to price in the primary
   market is a welcome result if and only if the consumers who stay in the
   primary market are not overly sensitive to service. In sum, the model
   demonstrates both the value and the danger of segmentation under
   competitive conditions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The financial services sector has internationalized over the last few
   decades. Important differences and similarities in financial behavior
   can be anticipated between both consumers within a particular country
   and those living in different countries. For companies in this market,
   the appropriate choice between strategic options and the resulting
   international performance may critically depend on the cross-national
   market structure of the various financial products. Insight into country
   segments and international consumer segments based on domain-specific
   behavioral variables will therefore be of key strategic importance. We
   present a multi-level latent class framework for obtaining
   simultaneously such country and consumer segments. In an empirical
   study, we apply this methodology and several alternative modeling
   approaches to data on ownership of eight financial products. Information
   is available for 15 European countries, with a sample size of about 1000
   consumers per country. We find that both country segments and consumer
   segments are highly interpretable. Also, consumer segmentation is
   related to demographic variables such as age and income. Our conclusions
   feature implications, both academic and managerial, and directions for

AB In the context of introducing new products around the world, it is
   important to understand the relative attractiveness of various countries
   in terms of maximum penetration potential and diffusion speed. In this
   paper, we examine these market characteristics for a new category of
   prescription drugs in both developing and developed countries. Using
   data from 15 countries and a logistic specification in the hierarchical
   Bayesian framework, we report the differences in diffusion speed and
   maximum penetration potential between developing and developed nations.
   Our methodology accounts for the limited number of data observations, as
   well as serial correlation and endogencity problems that arise in the
   analysis. The principal findings are as follows. (i) Compared to
   developed countries, developing nations tend to have lower diffusion
   speeds and maximum penetration levels. (ii) Laggard developed countries

AB This paper addresses a gap in the international literature aimed at
   understanding the impact of the marketing mix on choosing and upgrading
   business-to-business financial services dealers. This study involves two
   important financial services markets (foreign exchange and bonds) in two
   leading countries in financial services (the United States and the
   United Kingdom). It provides a comparative analysis of the effectiveness
   of marketing mix variables ("price", "product", and "promotion" in this
   case) in determining (a) choice of dealers and (b) how a utilized dealer
   may achieve the sought-after status of being among the top three dealers
   of a customer. The impact of the marketing mix variables on the choice
   of dealer is significantly greater in the US relative to the UK.
   However, a two-stage analysis shows no significant country differences
   in the impact of the marketing mix on how a dealer is upgraded to a top
   three status with a customer. Further, the effects of the individual
   marketing mix variables are more nearly equal in the determination of
   whether a utilized dealer is among the top three dealers relative to the
   choice stage. Finally, consistent with our hypothesis, the bond market
   is more price sensitive relative to foreign exchange and the foreign
   exchange market is more product sensitive than the bond market. (C) 2004

AB Previous studies on international marketing have typically asked the
   question: "how is the demand characterized across countries"' Such
   analysis is then used to provide guidelines for firms to enter new
   markets and/or to allocate marketing resources across countries. To
   provide such normative guidelines, however, one also needs to analyze
   the supply-side of the problem, i.e., ask: "what is the likely market
   power that firms will be able to command in different countries?"
   Building on the New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) framework,
   recent research in marketing provides marketers with a variety of models
   to explore competitive interactions among firms in the context of a
   single market. The goal of this paper is to extend this literature to a
   multimarket/multinational context to help international marketers assess
   the likely market power they face when entering new countries. We
   illustrate the proposed method on the mobile telecommunications
   industry, using price and quantity data from 10 countries around the
   world, estimating firms' market power as a function of a number of
   country characteristics.
   The results indicate that, while the simple presence of competition
   diminishes firms' market power, it does not lead to perfect competition.
   Interestingly, a higher number of competitors in a country does not seem
   to have significant incremental effect on market power. In contrast, the
   country's commitment to a severe antitrust policy has a significant
   negative effect, while the monopolist's lead-time before competition is
   allowed has a significant positive effect on market power. These
   findings, together with a change in price elasticities as a result of
   competition, suggest that market power in different countries may
   originate from two sources: (i) collusive pricing among cellular
   operators and (ii) consumers' switching costs across service providers.
   For international marketers, the findings imply that the attractiveness
   of wealthier countries (with usually faster diffusion rates and larger
   market potential) may be mitigated by higher levels of competition (as a
   result of developed antitrust regulation and more consumer exposure to
   competitive marketing practices). From a policy point of view, it
   suggests that (in contrast to the conventional wisdom) simple
   deregulation may not be enough to reduce prices to competitive levels.
   In addition, a severe antitrust policy is crucial to achieve this goal.

AB A growing body of research on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in
   marketing has shown that (1) CSR plays a role in consumers' brand and
   product evaluations, over and above economic or 'rational'
   considerations such as product attributes; and (2) CSR has a spillover
   or 'halo effect' on otherwise unrelated consumer judgments, such as the
   evaluation of new products. Yet CSR's halo on consumer behavior may
   extend beyond product evaluations, into nonroutine types of judgments
   such as attributions. We examine the possibility that the CSR halo
   affects consumers' attributions in a product-harm crisis situation. In
   two studies that employ experimental manipulations of prior CSR on a
   sample of consumers, we examine whether attributions that are influenced
   by CSR mediate the impact of product-harm crises on consumers' brand
   evaluations. The results of Study I support the hypothesis. Study 2
   introduces a boundary condition on the results of Study 1, showing that
   mediation effects are only found for consumers that are CSR-sensitive.
   The findings point to a role of CSR in consumer behavior that is more
   complex than previously conceptualized. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Marketing strategy can improve a firm's current expertise (marketing
   exploitation strategy) and/or require the development of new knowledge
   and skills (marketing exploration strategy). Research in strategy and
   organizational learning suggests that utilizing both approaches may
   compromise firm effectiveness in each individual area and reduce firm
   financial performance. We argue that a firm's market orientation allows
   it to combine marketing exploitation and exploration strategies
   effectively by providing a unifying frame of reference focused on
   customer goals, facilitating market information flows between the two
   strategy processes, and integrating the two activities by serving as a
   dynamic market linking capability. A study of Dutch firms in the
   packaged food industry indicates that a firm's strong market orientation
   facilitates a complementarity of high levels of marketing exploration
   and marketing exploitation project-level strategies which results in
   improved new product financial performance measured at two distinct
   points of time. However, as predicted by the tradeoff, firms with a weak
   market orientation engaging in high levels of both strategies display a
   significant reduction in new product financial performance. (C) 2004

   rep decision and the design of compensation plans in German salesforces.
   We test, with a single data set, a set of established and new hypotheses
   of both theories in the context of both decisions. This allows us to
   assess the complementarity of AT and TCA by estimating the relative
   explanatory power of the two frameworks for each of the two decisions.
   On the one hand, we find support for most of the established hypotheses.
   However, the hypothesized effect of uncertainty is rejected in our data
   set. Moreover, we document the impact of some new variables. We also
   find that, while AT does not add much to explain the decision of direct
   vs. rep in our data, TCA is equally limiting in helping understand the
   design of salesforce compensation plans. Therefore, one has to be
   cautious in treating AT and TCA as complementary theories. (C) 2004

   dominates the RCM if the underlying distribution is strictly discrete

AB We consider a product line design problem with multiple quality-type
   attributes for a monopolist who serves multiple customer segments. We
   show that it is possible to get the first best solution (FBS) for this
   problem and develop a condition for it. We introduce the notion of
   inclination of a segment for a given bundle of attributes that measures
   the customer segment's overall preference for the bundle of attributes
   that are in the product category. We show that FBS implementability
   requires that the part worth between segments must be sufficiently
   separated. In fact, for a firm to price discriminate via a variety in
   the product line, this separation of parts worth between any pair of
   customer segments must be more than the separation in their
   inclinations. If inclination towards the product category varies vastly
   across segments, it will be harder to utilize the differences in part
   worth to offer separating products. We provide an elegant
   characterization of this condition in terms of divergence index between
   pairs of customers, which states that the divergence index must be less
   than one for FBS to be implementable. If inclination is equal across
   segments, then one can always design a differentiating product line no
   matter how many segments there are. We also provide a geometric
   interpretation of the FBS condition that is helpful in generating
   insights. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multinational enterprises (MNEs) can either start up new ventures or
   acquire existing firms to enter foreign markets. Although many reputable

   studies have systematically verified the proposition that MNEs choose
   acquisitions over startups to overcome reputation barriers abroad. In
   this study, we hypothesize that the choice of acquisitions vs. startups

   reputation barriers they face in the foreign industry entered. We
   compile a vector of variables that distinguish between firm-specific
   advertising investments and industry-specific reputation barriers to
   analyze Japanese manufacturers' entry strategies into the US. Our
   results show that Japanese investors facing higher reputation barriers
   in the target industry are more inclined to acquire existing firms,
   whereas those spending more on advertising prior to an entry are more
   likely to start up new ventures. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Building upon a multiple-product channel structure, this paper develops
   a model to test channel price leadership on the basis of time series
   observations on retail and wholesale prices and using absence of double
   marginalisation as a criterion for channel price leadership. The model
   studies strategic pricing decisions in a two-stage (suppliers-retailers)
   channel, dealing with several products. Possible long-run relationships
   between wholesale and retail prices are investigated in relation to
   three cases. Case 1: suppliers have sufficient power vis-a-vis retailers
   to enforce double marginalisation; Case 2: retailers do not allow
   suppliers to enforce double marginalisation; and Case 3: one retailer
   not only keeps its suppliers from double marginalisation, but is also
   the horizontal price leader vis-a-vis competing retailers. We explicitly
   take the time series properties into account to derive the testable
   implications of strategic price interactions in marketing channels. An
   attractive feature of our methodology is that price leadership can be
   tested on the basis of time series on retail prices and wholesale prices
   only. The procedure for testing the long-run causality implications of
   the model uses the definition of long-run causality as formulated by
   Bruneau and Jondeau [Oxf. Bull. Econ. Stat. 61 (4) (1999) 545], but does
   not use their Wald statistic, which suffers from the undesirable
   properties of the Wald test when there are nonlinear parameter
   restrictions. To interpret restrictions on the common stochastic trends
   of retail and wholesale prices, we show that the common stochastic
   trends and the deviations from the long-run equilibriums must explicitly
   be assigned to variables in the channel model. If a common stochastic
   trend consists of both the retail price and the wholesale price of a
   product, then the suppliers are able to enforce double marginalisation
   vis-a-vis the retailers (Case 1). If a common stochastic trend consists
   solely of a product's wholesale price, then the retailers do not allow
   suppliers to enforce double marginalisation (Case 2). The opposite
   situation is a common stochastic trend consisting solely of a product's
   retail price. In this situation, one of the retailers not only keeps its
   suppliers from double marginalisation, but is also the horizontal price
   leader in the retail market for the product (Case 3). The model is
   applied to a typical multiple product channel allowing various vertical
   and horizontal interactions between the channel members to co-occur. (C)

   weekly scanner data. We develop a market share attraction model with
   which we can handle a changing number of brands.
   The usefulness of our approach is illustrated in a simulation experiment
   where its implementation is compared with various alternative methods.
   We further develop tests to infer whether there are competitive
   reactions to an entry. Our illustration to scanner data for the
   detergent category emphasizes the usefulness of our approach. (C) 2004

AB Market orientation has emerged as a significant antecedent of
   performance and is presumed to contribute to long-term success. To
   investigate the impact of this predictor, a meta-analysis was conducted
   and findings suggest that the relationship between market orientation
   and business performance is positive and consistent worldwide. One of
   the unique contributions of this research is a sample that includes
   studies conducted in 23 countries spanning five continents. The
   moderating effects of business objective (profit, not-for-profit),
   industry type (manufacturing, service), socioeconomic development [gross
   domestic product (GDP) per capita, Human Development Index (HDI)), and
   Hofstede's individualism cultural dimension] are examined. Stronger
   correlations between market orientation and business performance were
   found for not-for-profit compared to profit firms and service compared
   to manufacturing firms. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we chronicle a research program spanning a decade and a
   dozen countries. The studies were framed in an extended model of
   competing values of organizational culture, and focused on how
   organizational culture, market orientation, and innovativeness affect
   the performance of firms competing in business-to-business markets. The
   design was developed and first tested in Japan. It was used throughout
   the research program, with the exception of a simplification of the
   sampling unit. We summarize substantive conclusions, including
   discussion of empirical similarities and differences in different
   cultures, in rich and poor countries, in the Orient and the Occident, in
   emerging economies, and in economies in transition towards a more
   market-driven form. As a general pattern, we find significant
   differences across countries in the means of all of the variables under
   study, and these differences generally reflect characteristics of
   national cultures. However, we find that slopes relating these variables
   to firm performance do not differ systematically over countries. We also
   examine buyer-seller relationships in the framework of an international
   "natural experiment" based on aspects of national culture. A brief
   research agenda is included. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Much research relating to consumer attitudes toward foreign products has
   been conducted in large industrialized countries, with big internal
   markets and a wide range of domestic brands. Little attention has been
   paid to the case of countries with high levels of foreign trade where,
   in some product markets, no domestic brands or alternatives are
   available and hence consumers have no choice but to purchase foreign
   brands in that product category. The lack of domestic brands is,
   however, likely to affect feelings of ethnocentrism, nationality and
   animosity as well as attitudes towards the purchase of foreign products.
   This study examines consumer attitudes towards the purchase of foreign
   cars and TVs in the Netherlands. The Netherlands is viewed as a
   prototypical example of a country with high levels of foreign trade,
   well integrated into the global economy. In one category-cars, there are
   no domestic brands, while for TVs, Philips, a Dutch multinational, holds
   major market share. The results show that consumer ethnocentrism and
   feelings of animosity have an important impact on the evaluation of
   foreign products, even when no domestic brands are available. (C) 2004

AB In the academic literature pertaining to store choice, studies have
   traditionally limited the choice to stores within a certain format. The
   role played by different retail formats has not been studied
   extensively. This paper, therefore, develops a general model of retail
   format choice for non-durable goods. Using one common model, we are able
   to isolate the states under which patronizing supermarkets, convenience
   stores, and food warehouses would be optimal. The optimality of the
   different formats is shown to depend on membership fees, travel costs,
   consumption rates, perishability of products, inventory holding costs of
   consumers, and cost structures of retailers. We develop several
   hypotheses regarding format choice by consumers. We test the hypotheses
   on self-reports of shopping behavior in hypothetical situations. (C)

   the firm's product at a trade show. Overall profits are shown to be
   greater when the trade show is used in conjunction with optimal levels
   of sales effort. The study also suggests that return-on-sales figures
   are higher among show attendees than non-attendees and that the trade

AB Asian brands have often struggled to develop quality images. The visual
   aspects of branding have received little attention on how they might be
   used to strengthen brand perceptions in Asia. Guidelines for designing
   visual brand stimuli are developed using evaluations of logos in China
   and Singapore. There is a significant relationship between design and
   the responses companies seek, including positive affect, perceptions of
   quality, recognition, consensus in meaning, and feng shui. How designs
   are perceived, and their effect on consumer responses, were similar
   between China and Singapore. Companies are encouraged to leverage design
   to strengthen their brands. In particular, they should select logo
   designs that are elaborate, natural, and harmonious as these created
   positive affect and quality perceptions, clear meaning, true
   recognition, and feng shui. Many of these relationships hold in the
   United Sates as well, implying that the visual aspects of brand
   strategies may accomplish companies' goals across international borders.

AB Product design and marketing mix decisions for segmented markets depend
   crucially on the correct specification of marketing models used as input
   to these decisions. With real-world data, the true number of segments in
   a market is unknown. Current evidence from simulation studies suggests
   that the accuracy of commonly used criteria for determining the number
   of segments in a market depends on the usage context, including the type
   of distribution being used to describe the data, the model
   specification, and the characteristics of the market. This study
   investigates via simulation the performance of seven segment retention
   criteria used with finite mixture regression models for normal data.
   This is one of the most important analysis contexts in marketing
   research since regression models are used, for example, in conjoint
   analysis and market response analysis, yet no previous study in either
   the marketing or statistics literatures explores the segment retention
   problem for mixture regression models. The study shows that one
   criterion, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) with a per-parameter
   penalty factor of 3 (AIC3), is clearly the best criterion to use across
   a wide variety of model specifications and data configurations, having
   the highest success rate and producing very low parameter bias.
   Currently, this criterion is rarely, if ever, used in the marketing
   literature. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The selection of the right brand name is one of the most important

   responses to Chinese brand names. Through two experiments, the findings
   demonstrate the ability of both character-level and radical-level
   suggestiveness in improving the memory for brand name and target claim.

   can be justified since it speeds up software diffusion. The question is,
   how much should be tolerated? Using innovation diffusion models of
   software adoption by legal buyers and pirates, answers to this question
   are obtained for the three scenarios of monopoly, multiple generations
   of software and competitive markets. Results include, for example, that
   a monopoly should start with minimum protection of its software but well

   strategies to firms' customer and competitor orientation as well as
   their new product development and introduction activity. We use this
   framework to develop a simultaneous equations model that is tested on
   survey data from 175 Dutch firms of varying size and across different
   industries in the manufacturing sector. The surprising findings are that
   a greater emphasis on a focus strategy results in a decreased emphasis
   on customer orientation and that competitor orientation has a negative
   direct influence on new product activity and an indirect positive effect
   via customer orientation. We discuss the implications of these findings

   negative impacts on selling behavior. Next, we examine how embarrassment
   differs from sales call anxiety (SCA). The results show that
   embarrassment is manifest as an awkward, abashed chagrin provoked either
   by what a salesperson does that is inappropriate (self-provoked
   embarrassment) or what a customer does that is inappropriate or
   offensive to a salesperson (customer-provoked embarrassment). Self- and
   customer-provoked embarrassment each induce distinct coping responses
   and both diminish adaptive resource utilization during interactions with

AB The authors argue that reducing consumer attitudes to their underlying

   They propose that consumer attitudes be best represented by a
   hierarchical structure that preserves, at the first level, clusters of
   attributes formed on the basis of their immediate vs. deliberative
   nature, these clusters being nested at the second level within affective
   and cognitive bases. The superiority of this hierarchical structure over
   alternative models is supported for food attitudes, in a sample of two
   cultures (French and Chinese) known for different relations between
   affective and cognitive bases (Study 1). The hierarchical model also
   demonstrates superior ability to predict behaviors for two food items
   for which the affective and cognitive bases have a different influence
   on consumption (i.e., chocolate and raw milk; Study 2). Theoretical and

AB This paper investigates the impact of retailer stockouts on whether, how
   much, and what consumers buy in a category during the out-of-stock
   period. It adds to previous literature by investigating the stockouts'
   impact on purchase quantities, by uncovering the pattern of
   within-category shifts triggered by them, and by analyzing dynamic
   effects on incidence, quantity, and choice decisions. Although essential
   for an accurate assessment of stockout implications, these aspects of
   out-of-stock (OOS) behavior have received little attention so far.
   Moreover, while most of the previous literature on stockouts relies on
   surveys measuring reported or intended behavior, this research examines
   revealed stockout response in a natural store environment. To this end,
   traditional purchase incidence, quantity and choice models are adapted
   to account for various stockout effects, and estimated based on scanner
   panel data for two product categories. While tractable, the models
   capture various aspects of stockout reactions within the store, allowing
   to trace the implications of stockouts for specific SKUs and household
   (segment)s. The estimation results demonstrate that out-of-stocks can
   affect all three purchase decisions: they may reduce the probability of
   purchase incidence, lead to the purchase of smaller quantities, and
   induce asymmetric, non-IIA choice shifts. Simulation of aggregate
   implications further suggests that, on the whole, retailer losses from
   stockouts remain limited, while manufacturer losses can be quite
   substantial, depending on the stockout item and the store's assortment
   composition. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increased globalization has generated considerable interest in testing
   theories in other countries that were developed in the United States. A
   requirement for any cross-national research should be that measures
   (scales) of constructs are generalizable across countries, and an
   important related issue is how many items and subjects are needed to
   generalize the scale across countries. This article discusses the use of
   generalizability theory (G theory) to assess the extent to which a
   previously administered scale can be generalized across countries and
   also to estimate the number of scale items and subjects needed to obtain
   a desired level of generalizability for future studies. The article
   further illustrates how G theory can be used in conjunction with a
   confirmatory factor analysis (CIA) framework to provide supplementary
   evidence of measurement invariance across countries. An empirical
   illustration of both G theory and the CFA-based framework is provided
   using data collected from multiple countries. The article concludes with
   a discussion of the unique benefits of CIA and G theory and suggests
   that the two techniques should be treated as complementary techniques
   for assessing measurement invariance and estimating the number of items
   and subjects needed to generalize the scale across countries. (C) 2003

AB This paper evaluates complete versus partial classification for the
   problem of identifying customers at risk. We define customers at risk as
   customers reporting overall satisfaction, but these customers also
   possess characteristics that are strongly associated with dissatisfied
   customers. This definition enables two viable methodological approaches
   for identifying such customers, i.e. complete and partial
   classification. Complete classification entails the induction of a
   classification model to discriminate between overall dissatisfied and
   overall satisfied instances, where customers at risk are defined as
   overall satisfied customers who are classified as overall dissatisfied.
   Partial classification entails the induction of the most prevalent
   characteristics of overall dissatisfied customers in order to discover
   overall satisfied customers who match these characteristics. In our
   empirical work, we evaluate complete and partial classification
   techniques and compare their performance on both quantitative and
   qualitative criteria. The intent of the paper is not on proving the
   superiority of partial classification, but rather to provide an
   alternative and valuable approach that offers new and different
   insights. In fact, taking predictive accuracy as the performance
   criterion, results for this study show the superiority of the complete
   classification approach. On the other hand, partial classification
   offers additional insights that complete classification techniques do
   not offer, i.e. it offers a rule-based description of criteria that lead
   to dissatisfaction for locally dense regions in the multidimensional
   instance space. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An important outcome of a firm's interorganisational relationships is
   the attainment of resources and capabilities required to attain a
   competitive advantage. Although market orientation has been considered
   one of those critical resources, there is little understanding regarding
   how it is created and nurtured in business relationships. In the context
   of asymmetrical channel partnerships dominated by a downstream leader,
   in this paper we present a model where the upstream follower's market
   orientation is promoted as a consequence of the leader's use of
   authoritative mechanisms of coordination. Some hypotheses are presented
   and empirically tested in a sample of agricultural cooperatives that
   maintain channel partnerships with second-order marketing cooperatives.
   The results indicate that formalization, participation, input control,
   and behaviour control are coordination mechanisms that lead to
   improvements in market orientation. Implications for interorganisational
   theory and managerial activities are discussed at the end of the paper.

AB We address the following questions that are becoming increasingly
   important to managers in service industries: Are the levels of customer
   satisfaction and loyalty for the same service different when customers
   choose the service online versus offline? If yes, what factors might
   explain these differences? How is the relationship between customer
   satisfaction and loyalty in the online environment different from that
   in the offline environment? We propose a conceptual framework and
   develop hypotheses about the effects of the online medium on customer
   satisfaction and loyalty and on the relationships between satisfaction
   and loyalty. We test the hypotheses through a simultaneous equation
   model using two data sets of online and offline customers of the lodging
   industry. The results are somewhat counterintuitive in that they show
   that whereas the levels of customer satisfaction for a service chosen
   online is the same as when it is chosen offline, loyalty to the service
   provider is higher when the service is chosen online than offline. We
   also find that loyalty and satisfaction have a reciprocal relationship
   such that each positively reinforces the other, and this relationship
   between overall satisfaction and loyalty is further strengthened online.

   and validate alternative mixture model-based procedures for segmenting
   households using choice behaviors and household characteristics.
   Compared to existing two-stage approaches, a new method known as the
   joint approach produced 23-27% less error in estimates of
   characteristics and 30-38% less error in estimates of choice model
   parameters. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the joint approach, which

AB Extant literature on channel management highlights the important link

   attitudes. The study reported here expands the scope of this research
   stream in two ways. First, expanding the national scope of the research,
   the author contrasts the United States with Japan and suggests that the
   interdependence structure and its links with distributor attitudes are
   contingent on the cultural context of a distribution channel system: the
   extent of group orientation. Second, expanding the scope of the research
   beyond consumer product channels, the author examines distribution
   channels for industrial products. The author conducts a two-stage
   analysis with the data from national surveys of industrial distributors
   in the United States and Japan. The results of the cross-national
   analysis support the moderating effect of group orientation on the link
   between interdependence asymmetry and distributor attitudes partially.
   The results of the country-level analysis show some intriguing
   similarities and differences between the United States and Japan. (C)

AB Media providers frequently have to trade-off revenues from advertisers
   and subscribers. However, with contemporary electronic media, such as
   Internet websites, there exists the possibility of giving viewers of the
   same program the option to pay a higher price and view fewer
   advertisements, or pay a lower price but view more advertisements. With
   heterogeneous consumers, there will be some takers for both options,
   thereby allowing the media provider to derive the advantages of both
   subscription and advertising revenues. In this paper, we examine the
   number of options, the subscription price and the amount of advertising
   that should be offered to consumers. We find conditions where a pure
   advertiser-supported strategy or a pure pay-per-view strategy can be
   optimal. However, except under specified conditions, the optimal
   strategy is to charge a subscription price and have advertisements, but
   offer options to consumers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights

AB Trust is a key factor in the establishment of long-term relationships
   between business suppliers and their clients. The development of trust
   is particularly important within service industries because of the
   abstract nature of most service products. Prior research has documented
   that both "personality-related" (e.g., empathy, politeness, and
   customer/service representative similarity) and "performance-related"
   (customization, competence, reliability, and promptness) service
   representative characteristics have an impact upon trust in the service
   provider. However, the relative importance of these characteristics, and
   in some cases the direction of their relationships with trust, has
   varied across studies. In this paper, we posit a contingency model of
   trust, suggesting that the effects of the above variables on trust are
   moderated by a customer's knowledge of, or familiarity with, the service
   industry in question. Our model is tested in a business-to-business
   context by means of mail surveys involving a large sample of small
   business owners. The small business owners provided data about their
   relationships with their health insurance, management consulting,
   telecommunications, or travel industry service providers. Our results
   demonstrate how service representatives and firms can work toward the
   establishment of trust with their clients under varying market
   conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An important aspect of the new orientation on customer relationship
   marketing is the use of customer transaction databases for the
   cross-selling of new services and products. In this study, we propose a
   mixed data factor analyzer that combines information from a survey with
   data from the customer database on service usage and transaction volume,
   to make probabilistic predictions of ownership of services with the
   service provider and with competitors. This data-augmentation tool is
   more flexible in dealing with the type of data that are usually present
   in transaction databases. We test the proposed model using survey and
   transaction data from a large commercial bank. We assume four different
   types of distributions for the data: Bernoulli for binary service usage
   items, rank-order binomial for satisfaction rankings, Poisson for
   service usage frequency, and normal for transaction volumes. We estimate
   the model using simulated likelihood (SML). The graphical representation
   of the weights produced by the model provides managers with the
   opportunity to quickly identify cross-selling opportunities. We
   exemplify this and show the predictive validity of the model on a
   hold-out sample of customers, where survey data on service usage with
   competitors is lacking. We use Gini concentration coefficients to
   summarize power curves of prediction, which reveals that our model
   outperforms a competing latent trait model on the majority of service
   predictions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Brand choice models estimated on scanner panel data typically show that
   a household's brand choice process is characterized by state dependence,
   i.e. a household's brand choices are serially correlated over time. Two
   approaches have been employed by marketing researchers to estimate state
   dependence effects using brand choice data. The first approach is based
   on probability models-such as Markov Chains and Linear Learning
   Models-that directly allow a household's brand choice probabilities to
   be temporally correlated. The second approach is based on random utility
   models-such as the Multinomial Probit with serially correlated error
   terms-that allow a household's latent utilities for brands to be
   temporally correlated, and then derive the household's brand choice
   probabilities as the first-order conditions for the household's
   utility-maximization problem. The random utility approach has acquired
   prominence in recent years given the increasing influence of economic
   models, and hence a utility-based view of consumer decision-making, in
   marketing. However, the first approach has served a fruitful role for
   over four decades in terms of accurately tracking and predicting brand
   choices. In this study, we explicitly compare a probabilistic model
   versus a random utility model of state dependence both in terms of their
   ability to explain and predict observed brand choices of households, and
   in terms of the marketing mix elasticities that they yield. We estimate
   both models using scanner panel data on households' purchases in four
   different categories of packaged goods. Using either model, we quantify
   significant state dependence effects along two dimensions.
   Interestingly, despite the differences in their mathematical
   foundations, we find both models to be remarkably similar in terms of
   predicting observed brand choices and in terms of the their recovery of
   marketing-mix elasticities. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   In C-OAR-SE, constructs are defined in terms of Object, Attribute, and

   steps in C-OAR-SE produce a framework (six types of scales) indicating
   when to use single-item vs. multiple-item scales and, for multiple-item
   scales, when to use an index of essential items rather than selecting
   unidimensional items with a high coefficient alpha. The Rater Entity

AB During the past decade, irrational exuberance has tamed into a possibly
   equally irrational pessimism about what the Internet can accomplish. The
   fear of getting ruined through cannibalization losses has recently
   deterred many firms from deploying the Internet as a distribution
   channel. But do Internet channels really cannibalize firms' entrenched
   channels, or is this widely held assumption exaggerated? To answer this
   question, we apply recent structural-break time-series econometrics to
   quantify the impact of an Internet channel addition on the long-run
   performance evolution of a firm's established channels. Using a database
   of 85 Internet channel additions over the last 10 years in the newspaper
   industries of the UK and The Netherlands, we find that the often-cited
   cannibalization fears have, at least in this information-goods industry,
   been largely overstated. The Internet therefore need not be disruptive
   to established companies and channels. This does not, however, imply
   that firms enjoy free play in setting up Internet channels. In cases
   where the newly established Internet channel too closely mimics the
   entrenched channels, substantial cannibalization is more likely to take
   place. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The price-quality schema rests on an assumption that price is credible
   information about product quality. However, the credibility of price
   information varies across different markets, In an inefficient market,
   consumers would believe in the price-quality relationship to a lesser
   extent because price information is less credible. Paradoxically, in
   such a market, sometimes consumers have to rely more on price to infer
   quality because other product information is less available. With a
   cross-national perspective, this study investigated the influences of
   market efficiency and consumer risk aversion on the price-quality schema
   between the China and the US markets. We found that due to the
   inefficient market environment, Chinese consumers possess a weaker
   price-quality schema than American consumers. Chinese consumers are more
   risk averse than their American counterparts. However, in China,
   risk-averse consumers are more likely to use price to infer product
   quality. Implications for global marketing are discussed, and directions

AB We propose that the manner in which a purchase decision is initiated has
   an important influence on subsequent product evaluation and choice.
   Specifically, we propose that the problem recognition "event" and the
   consequent retrieval of pre-decisional constraints from memory
   significantly influence the ensuing processes of external information
   search and consideration set formation. Several hypotheses are developed
   to model these interrelationships. The data were collected from a
   national probability sample of new automobile buyers. Log-linear,
   logistic regression and linear regression analyses were used to test the
   hypotheses. The results suggest that the type of pre-decisional
   constraints that are activated as a consequence of the problem
   recognition event significantly influences the "route" consumers follow
   through the remainder of the purchase process. The findings have
   important theoretical and practical implications for understanding the
   consumer decision process for consumer durables. (C) 2002 Elsevier

AB With the increasing globalization of the business world, international
   segmentation becomes an ever more important concept in marketing. The
   globalization forces now at work push many companies to extend or
   reorganize their marketing strategies across borders and target
   international segments of consumers. It is the purpose of this paper to
   review the international market segmentation literature and to identify
   its future prospects and threats. We critically assess the current
   status of international market segmentation research and provide a
   systematic overview of 25 previous empirical studies with respect to the
   samples used for segmentation, segmentation bases and methods,
   geographic configuration of segments, and validation efforts, We discuss
   a number of conceptual and methodological issues that deserve more
   attention if international market segmentation is to fulfill its high
   potential. The conceptual issues include construct equivalence of the
   segmentation basis used, level of aggregation in the segmentation
   process, and choice of the segmentation basis. The methodological issues
   include measure equivalence and sample equivalence of the segmentation
   basis, segmentation methods employed, and whether national sample sizes
   should be proportional to population sizes. We describe a case study to
   illustrate and integrate the various issues and conclude with
   suggestions for future research to stimulate further advances in the
   area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB There is increasing interest in understanding and characterizing the
   behavior of consumers across multiple categories. In this research we
   examine insights from segmentation derived from considering consumer
   behavior in multiple categories jointly. To derive the segmentation we
   develop a logit-mixture model of brand choice that considers the
   behavior of customers in multiple categories jointly. When a brand
   competes in multiple categories we generalize the effect of purchase
   feedback to include the effect of purchases of the brand in multiple
   categories. An application using data on purchases made by a panel of
   consumers in three baby products categories, two of which contain some
   common brands, is presented. We discuss the insights from deriving
   segmentation in which multiple categories are considered jointly and the
   implications of our results for a manager whose brand competes in more
   than one category. Our results should also be of interest to a manager
   of a brand that is marketed only in a single category yet competes
   against multiple-category competitors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Value systems are central to understanding consumer behavior and they
   are an important basis for market segmentation. This study addresses
   changes in individual value systems across time. First, we conceptualize
   main ways in which value systems may change over time. Next, we extend
   Kamakura and Mazzon's [J. Consum. Res. 18 (1991) 208] segmentation
   approach to accommodate these value system changes. We present a
   continuum of value segment change opportunities, with intermediate
   models in-between. We apply the models to a data set consisting of
   longitudinal (Rokeach Terminal Values) value measurements in a
   nationwide sample in the Netherlands. The results support the stability
   of value systems within segments, but reveal that subjects show
   substantial switching among segments in the 3 years of the study. We
   then discuss the implications of our modeling approach for value theory

AB Advances in information technology (e.g., scanner data, cookies, and
   other electronically based data collection methodologies) have enabled
   researchers to collect unprecedented amounts of individual-level
   customer data. As a result, customer databases are becoming increasingly
   larger and more complex, and may tax the capabilities and exacerbate the
   shortcomings of the techniques currently used to analyze them. To
   address this challenge, we examine the use of artificial neural networks
   (ANNs) as an alternative means of segmenting retail databases. In
   particular, we investigate the Hopfield-Kagmar (HK) clustering
   algorithm, an ANN technique based on Hopfield networks, and empirically
   compare it to K-means and mixture model clustering algorithms. Our
   results indicate that ANNs may be more useful to retailers for
   segmenting markets because they provide more homogeneous segmentation
   solutions than mixture model and K-means clustering algorithms, and are
   less sensitive to initial starting conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

AB More than 80% of the world's consumers live in emerging consumer markets
   and transitional economies (ECMs). A fuller understanding of consumer
   behavior and further advancement of consumer research as an academic
   discipline require that the validity of theories and models of consumer
   behavior developed in a Western cultural context be examined in ECMs as
   well. In this paper, we examine the measurement invariance and
   nomological relations involving optimum stimulation level (OSL) in one
   of Africa's most important ECMs-South Africa. Our research setting
   presents an especially stringent context for testing consumer behavior
   theories. Many respondents are challenged by severe economic and
   educational disadvantages, many have probably never had a job, and some
   are illiterate. Nevertheless, the results provide evidence on the
   cross-cultural generalizability of OSL and exploratory consumer behavior
   theory, We found a high degree of stability in the OSL structure across
   the three major cultural-ethnic groups in South Africa. Meaningful and
   theoretically predictable nomological relations are obtained with
   values, sociodemographics, and exploratory consumer behaviors. Moreover,
   we find systematic effects of gender, income, and level of education on
   exploratory consumer behaviors. Suggestions for future research on OSL
   and for consumer behavior research in general in ECMs are discussed. (C)

   bias, timeliness and cost. The model is estimated using data from a
   survey of export sales forecasting practices and several hypotheses
   linking the aforementioned criteria on effectiveness are tested. The
   findings indicate that evaluations of forecasting effectiveness are
   equally influenced by short-term accuracy and absence of overestimating
   bias, while timely delivery of the forecast to management is somewhat
   less important. Long-term accuracy, underestimation and timing of

AB Repeated measures data sets are a very common data structure in
   marketing, ranging from weekly household purchase data obtained via
   supermarket scanners, household penetration rates for products over
   time, panel survey questionnaire responses. etc. In many circumstances,
   it is desirable to glean key features of the data without having to run
   a formal model and/or perform a large number of exploratory analyses.
   Such features of interest may include defining market segments,
   identifying change points (a sudden shift in aggregate behavior), and.
   in general, identifying "typical" behavior patterns. In this research,
   we apply an exploratory approach for analyzing repeated measures data
   sets, initially considered by Tucker [Psychometrika 23 (1958) 19] and
   fatly explicated in Jones and Rice [Am. Stat. 46 (1992)], that utilizes
   Principal Components Analysis (as its core), regression, and simple
   bivariate plots. It is clearly our intention, via the algorithm
   provided, that a user can read this manuscript and then sit down at his
   or her computer and implement the approach immediately. We first
   demonstrate our approach on simulated data, therefore providing a
   "blueprint" for users of this approach, i.e. we simulate different types
   of structural variation and provide the corresponding principal
   component rotation curves, and how to glean features from them. Our
   approach is then applied to a data set on cumulative penetration rates
   for a set of durable products. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B,V. All rights

AB Brands can affect various stages of consumer choice processes, and
   hence, various components of consumer utility fanctions. Previous
   conceptual and empirical work focused on the effects of brands on
   consumer perceptions of tangible and intangible product attributes. In
   this paper, we extend the work on brand effects with information
   economics underpinnings to analyze whether consumer price sensitivity,
   that is, the weight attached to price in a consumer valuation of a
   product's overall attractiveness or utility, is impacted by brand
   credibility. In other words, we investigate how the impact of product
   price on consumer utility is moderated by brand credibility. To explore
   the impact of brand credibility on consumer price sensitivity across
   categories that may involve different levels of consumer uncertainty, we
   conduct our analysis for four products: frozen concentrate juice, jeans,
   shampoo and personal computers. These categories vary in the degree of
   potential consumer uncertainty about product attributes, as well as in a
   number of other category-specific features that may affect consumer
   sensitivity to uncertainty. Our results indicate that brand credibility
   decreases price sensitivity. Our results also indicate that although the
   direction of the impact is the same, the magnitude of brand
   credibility's impact on consumer choices and price sensitivity vary
   across product categories, as a function of product category
   characteristics that affect potential consumer uncertainty and consumer
   sensitivity to such uncertainty. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   types of after-sales service contact modes. The results suggest that, in

AB Because consumers are limited information processors seeking to conserve
   cognitive energy, it is likely that at least some use identical decision
   heuristics across product categories. This study develops a finite
   mixture logit model that identifies segments of households with
   identical behaviors across product categories. The proposed model is
   shown to fit in-sample choices and forecast out-of-sample choices at
   least as well as an unrestricted model in which all choice behaviors are
   independent across product categories. The results show that about 32%
   of the sample households have choice behaviors that are identical across
   at least two of the three product categories studied, while the
   remaining households have choice behaviors that are independent across
   all three categories. The empirical results show that the segment with
   identical behaviors is quite price sensitive, not at all sensitive to
   store feature advertising, and not very brand- or size-loyal. These
   households are more likely to have larger families and marginally lower
   incomes and to shop less frequently and spend less per shopping trip.
   They are also lighter users in two of the three product categories
   investigated. Implications of the model for manufacturers and retailers
   are discussed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The well-known NBD-Dirichlet model of purchase incidence and brand
   choice is usually estimated from aggregate market statistics such as
   penetration, average purchase frequency, and market share. In practice,
   panel data have been the only accurate source of this information. This
   research developed estimators of these market statistics based on the
   Juster scale, an 11-point purchase probability scale that can be applied
   using a survey. A validation study, involving comparisons with panel
   data for 16 brands in three categories, showed that the Juster-based
   estimators performed very well. This result allows the data requirements
   of the NBD-Dirichlet model to now be satisfied using a survey. (C) 2002

AB What drives the behavior of consumers when faced with a product-related
   crisis, such as that involving food contamination or life-threatening
   design flaws? For both consumers and companies, these crises have become
   of increasing importance because of the globalization of markets and an
   increased coverage by the media. Marketers need to understand why and
   how consumers react to a crisis. We show that by decoupling risk
   response behavior of consumers into the separate components of risk
   perception and risk attitude, a more robust conceptualization and
   prediction of consumers' reactions is possible. Such a framework helps
   provide answers on how marketers can deal with such types of crises. The
   merits of this conceptualization are illustrated in two field studies
   that examine the reactions of German, Dutch, and American consumers to
   the BSE (mad cow disease) crisis.

AB The central premise of this paper is that firm level characteristics or
   behavioral traits, referred to as predispositions, influence how the
   firm behaves and interacts in its interfirm relationships (IFRs). This
   augments traditional approaches that focus on the intra-relationship
   perspective and/or on environmental influences on the relationship. Firm
   predispositions of strategic intent and relational proclivity are
   expected to individually, and in combination, increase the extent of
   connectedness between partners in interfirm relationships. In turn,
   through connectedness, they affect relationship effectiveness in terms
   of reciprocity, information exchange, and cooperation. Results indicated
   that the predispositions increased connectedness, but combinational
   effects were not present. Connectedness strongly influenced interfirm
   relationship effectiveness, indicating substantial mediational effects
   for connectedness. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we examine the role of disconfirmation as an important
   determinant of household preference revisions and decision making.
   Although prior research has examined decision influence and information
   exchange in household decision making, the impact of disconfirmation on
   individual family member preferences and the joint household preference
   has not been explicitly studied. Analogous to the main types of social
   influence found within groups, we identify two types of disconfirmation
   that impact individual preferences arising from family interaction or
   discussion. These two types of disconfirmation are informational
   disconfirmation, related to new product information revealed in family
   discussion being different than one's prior beliefs, and preference
   disconfirmation, where a family member has incorrect expectations of the
   preferences of other influential household members. An empirical study
   involving a household vacation decision demonstrates significant
   disconfirmation effects in explaining individuals' post-discussion
   preferences, as well as the joint household preference and decision.
   Based on the empirical results, we discuss various implications and
   suggest future research to study the specific consequences of
   disconfirmation in household decisions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB For the past four decades, dozens of researchers have studied consumer
   price knowledge, often with disagreements on the extent of consumer'
   ignorance about prices. While some of these disagreements have been
   attributed to research design variations among studies, no inquiry has
   yet been made on the role of the economic environment on consumer price
   knowledge. Nevertheless, environmental factors such as interest rates,
   unemployment, and economic growth may significantly influence consumers'
   knowledge of prices. Certain economic environments may therefore provide
   marketers with the ability to utilize pricing tactics which rely on
   limitations in consumers' knowledge of product prices. Using a
   meta-analytic framework, this paper synthesizes the results of 297
   previous price knowledge studies to document the effects of inflation,
   unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, country of study, and passage
   of time on consumer price knowledge. The meta-analysis results
   demonstrate that economic factors have considerable influence on
   explaining variations in consumer price knowledge. Managerial and public
   policy implications of the findings in light of turbulent economic
   environments are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   provision of structure increases brand recall and decreases inhibitory
   effects of part-set cues. In a second study, we show that these positive
   effects on recall carry over to brand choice, in a memory-based
   decision. Consumers are able to make choices that are consistent with
   their preferences when they use an existing category structure to

AB In many of the industries where durable products are used with
   complementary products, companies announce their new durable products
   long before their market introduction. This paper analyzes the rationale
   for product preannouncements in the context of indirect network
   externalities. A product preannouncement helps to build consumers' and
   program providers' prior-to-launch perceptions of the forthcoming
   product. We develop a model to analyze how those perceptions affect the
   new hardware product's penetration. After an empirical calibration of
   the model based on the CD audio market, we run simulations that show the
   strong impact of the prior-to-launch expectations of both actors on the
   long-term market success of the new product. While higher consumer
   expectations always induce a higher penetration rate in the long run, it
   might occur that the higher expectations amongst the providers of
   complementary products lead to a lower penetration rate if such
   expectations remain lower than the ones that consumers have.
   Consequently, product preannouncements should first target consumers and
   only be directed at program providers if they can succeed in creating
   highly favorable prior-to-launch expectations among this latter group.

AB This study uses data from matched sets of suppliers, manufacturers and

   orientation on the behaviors of salespersons and purchasers, the impact
   of these behaviors on relationships with customers and suppliers, and
   the effect of these relationships on the manufacturer's financial
   performance. The results show that market orientation positively
   influences customer-oriented behaviors of salespersons and
   supplier-oriented behaviors of purchasers. The behaviors of salespersons
   also have a positive effect on the customer's trust in, cooperative
   norms in, and satisfaction with the relationship with the manufacturer.
   The behaviors of purchasers positively affect the supplier's trust and
   cooperative norms in the relationship. The customer's perception of
   trust, cooperative norms, and satisfaction positively influences the
   manufacturer's financial performance. The supplier's trust and
   cooperative norms in the relationship also positively affect the
   manufacturer's financial performance. An important managerial
   implication is that the manufacturer is partly dependent upon the
   behaviors of purchasers and salespersons for using market orientation to
   build and maintain channel relationships. This implication provides
   ample opportunities for further research on market orientation. (C) 2001

AB The retailing industry, in the United States and Europe alike, faces
   maturing markets and stiffening domestic competition. In response, many
   of the industry's main players have shown a growing interest in
   cross-border initiatives. The success of such foreign entries obviously
   depends on the appropriateness of the retail firm's post-entry
   decisions, but may also depend on the strategic choices made at the time
   of entry, as they shape the platform from which competitive advantages
   can be gained. Little empirical evidence is available, however, on the
   contribution of these time-of-entry choices to post-entry performance,
   especially in the longer run.
   In this paper, we consider simultaneously five strategic entry
   decisions: scale of entry, mode of entry, order of entry, the adaptation
   of the retail format to local market conditions and the familiarity of
   the store format to the parent company. We focus on the estimation of
   these decisions' effects on the long-run performance of a retail firm's
   foreign operations. In addition, we account for the moderating impact of
   three sets of control variables: characteristics of the foreign
   operations' retail mix, the parent firm's resources and the
   host-market's characteristics. Formally, the strategic choices and
   control variables are linked to the foreign operation's asymptotic
   performance level, which we derive from S-shaped growth models. We
   calibrate these models on a data set covering the post-entry performance
   of over 160 foreign entries made by Europe's top 75 food retailers, both
   towards Western-European countries and to a variety of transition
   economies in Eastern Europe.
   The empirical findings suggest that the strategic decisions made at the
   time of entry continue to influence the foreign subsidiary's future
   performance, both in terms of sales performance and in terms of
   efficiency (sales/m(2)). Specifically, higher long-run post-entry sales
   and efficiency can be expected when entering early, with substantial
   scale, using no partners or acquired assets while offering a store
   format that is at the same time new to the host market and familiar to
   the parent firm. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A critical outcome of competitive strategy is the attainment of
   competitive advantages. Recently, there has been a growing recognition
   that such advantages may reside in the boundaries of a firm-via its
   relationships with outside organizations. However, there is little
   understanding regarding how such advantages are created, eroded, and
   preserved in such relationships. In this paper, I summarize the findings
   around competitive advantages from three studies, all of which involve
   longitudinal empirical tests of over 200 industrial buyers and their
   suppliers in a variety of industries. The collective results indicate
   that specialized investments facilitate the attainment of joint
   competitive advantages and these advantages are positively correlated
   with economic outcomes, organizational behavior, and expectations of
   continuity. Competitive advantages can also be eroded over time for
   buyers by suspicions of ex post opportunism that arise within the course
   of the relationship. However, the detrimental effects of opportunism
   suspicions for both firms can be mitigated via the strategic use of
   various governance modes such as bilateral investments, goal congruence,
   and interpersonal trust. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

   competitive behavior based on the nature of company objectives, reward
   systems, organizational structures and information systems for managers.
   We consider questions related to this area of inquiry in a setting in
   which managers make pricing decisions over time. We manipulate the
   nature of objectives the managers are instructed to pursue and the
   frequency with which they are told their performance will be evaluated.
   We find that a long time horizon (reduced frequency of evaluation)
   results in managers engaging in more price experimentation, presumably
   to learn the demand function, and in reduced competitive reactivity,
   compared with a shorter horizon. If the objective is "do the best you
   can", managers tend to pursue relative performance objectives. This
   pursuit tends to result in higher competitive reaction effects, compared
   with "profit maximization". In the experiment, the combination of a long
   time horizon and profit maximization as the objective produces highest
   average profits. Our results suggest that firms may want to reconsider
   the formulation of objectives and the time horizon of performance
   evaluation systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims to improve our understanding of the unique phenomenon of
   market competition, called price wars, as little is known about their
   nature and how they erupt. More precisely, we offer selected
   illustrations of the reality of price wars, identify key attributes of
   price wars, propose a definition of price wars, and offer a conceptual
   framework in which early warning signals (EWSs) of price wars are
   distilled and linked to the likelihood and the intensity of such wars.
   Also, initial empirical findings on some of the effects of price wars
   are offered, showing that price wars inflict substantial damage on the
   companies involved. Implications for researchers entail that numerous
   research opportunities exist to better understand price wars and to
   eventually develop a theory of price wars that may become a vital part
   of a firm's portfolio of competitive pricing strategies. (C) 2001

   to firm performance. Moreover, this effect was strongest for the "best"

   self-ratings. These findings suggest that, over time, the best

AB Changes in promotional expenditure decisions for a brand, as in other
   marketing decisions, should be based on the expected impact on purchase
   and consumption behavior as well as on the likely reactions by
   competitors. Purchase behavior may be predicted from estimated demand
   functions. Competitive reactions can be anticipated based on estimated
   reaction functions, which show how changes in an instrument for one
   brand depend on changes in one or more instruments for other brands.
   Economic and other arguments suggest that the parameters of such
   reaction functions (e.g. reaction elasticities) should exhibit
   systematic patterns. We consider these parameters in an economic
   framework that also contains two other useful measures, viz. net- and
   gross demand elasticities. For a defender, the net demand elasticity is
   the difference between the (positive) demand effect of a reaction (the
   competitive reaction elasticity multiplied by the corresponding
   own-brand demand elasticity) and the (negative) cross-brand effect
   (cross-brand demand elasticity). The gross demand elasticity captures
   just the (positive) demand effect of the reaction. Net demand-, gross
   demand- and reaction elasticities are useful yardsticks for managers.
   Our empirical results suggest that managers' competitive reactions do
   take into account the consumer response to cross-brand and own-brand
   activities. For example, the greater a cross-brand elasticity, the
   greater the corresponding reaction elasticity. Similarly, the greater
   the own-brand elasticity, the smaller the corresponding reaction
   elasticity. These effects are consistent with managerial behavior that
   aims to preserve market shares. We also find that the frequency of
   changes in other brands' marketing variables has a negative impact on
   competitive reactions. Interestingly, we do not find that average
   within-firm competitive reaction elasticities are smaller than for
   brands offered by different firms. However, we do find that for one
   firm, this reaction incidence is far lower for sister brands (presumably
   due to the use of category management), while for another firm, this
   incidence is higher relative to non-sister brands, consistent with
   expectations derived from personal interviews of all brand managers. The
   latter result suggests that the characteristics of reward or resource
   allocation systems may influence the competitive intensity between
   managers in the same firm. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB The methodology developed in this paper provides a means to analyze
   price competition between corporate brands. Corporate brands are
   considered to be produced and marketed by the same company. We establish
   price competition from an array of cross-price elasticities across time,
   which provides the necessary information to uncover the competitive
   interaction effects between corporate brands. The cross-price
   elasticities across time form a three-mode three-way array. The
   Constrained TUCKALS3-approach is developed and introduced for the
   analysis of the complex array of cross-elasticities. The approach takes
   explicitly a priori information about the competitive reaction or
   pattern of the marketing activities in a competitive market into
   account. This new methodology will enable brand management to gain
   further and deeper insight into the competitive interaction effects in
   the market. The Constrained TUCKALS3-model parameters provide the basis
   to investigate cannibalistic effects between corporate brands and thus
   helps to improve the marketing-mix, especially the price management of
   these brands. Furthermore, the results of the Constrained
   TUCKALS3-approach can serve to determine idealized market share
   estimates for certain a priori defined competitive conditions. The
   applicability and the methodological advantages of this approach will be
   shown by an empirical study on the price competition between two
   corporate brands. The reported results provide managerial useful
   information for the development and improvement of
   marketing-mix-strategies of these corporate brands. (C) 2001 Elsevier

AB The impact of a firm's strategic marketing mix choices on profitability
   can be evaluated by understanding the impact of those choices on
   consumer demand for the firm's products and on the firm's costs.
   Additionally, a firm's strategic marketing mix choices, and its demand
   and costs can be affected by rival firms' strategic choices. Therefore,
   to understand the effects of choice of marketing mix on profitability,
   we have to understand its effects on demand, cost and competitor
   reactions. The effects of choices of marketing mix on consumer demand
   have been analyzed in great depth in marketing, but research on the
   strategic reactions of competitors to such choices have been far more
   limited. The New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) framework
   provides us with a source of methods that has potential to substantially
   add to our insights about competitive interactions among firms.
   In this paper, we first discuss a simple NEIO model to illustrate the
   basic methodology. We then discuss the contributions of this literature
   to our knowledge of competitive marketing strategy. In the process, we
   discuss methodological extensions of the basic model that are needed to
   model the institutional realities of specific markets. We also summarize
   how the existing literature has evolved, and provide our view of where
   the literature might profitably proceed from here. In particular, we
   discuss how future methodological innovations in the dynamics of
   competition, discrete strategy choice, and asymmetric information
   estimation will enable wider application of this methodology to
   competitive marketing strategy issues. The main advantage of NEIO
   studies is that they provide greater understanding of the competitive
   behavior in specific markets or industries compared to cross-sectional
   studies across industries. Bountiful opportunities exist for additional
   studies that focus on similar phenomena in different markets to draw
   generalizable conclusions from this Line of research. (C) 2001 Published

   trading area characteristics on category and store performance, which
   integrates acid extends previous geomarketing research. Building upon
   this framework, we propose a tractable and flexible procedure for
   assessing location influences, and derive optimal space allocation rules
   for different location profiles. Empirical application to national
   stores of a European retail chain confirms the differential impact of
   location characteristics on categories' attractiveness. Tailoring the
   allocation of store space to these location-based differences in
   category appeal leads to a significant increase in overall chain

AB Managing pricing is a challenging task due to the significant impact on
   shares and the likelihood of strong consumer and competitor reaction.
   The major contributions of this paper are to assess comprehensive share
   response to temporary, evolving and structural changes in prices and to
   determine the level of market share as a function of levels of prices.
   For the empirical analysis, we examine two consumer product categories
   and find that it is valuable to distinguish among temporary, evolving
   and structural changes in prices, as their impact on market shares tends
   to differ. Further, we find that subsequent competitive reaction will
   influence predictions of price response. Accordingly, it is important
   for managers to use conjectures regarding competitive price reactions in
   assessing the impact of policy changes. We conclude with the strategic
   implications of the findings and discuss a number of opportunities for
   future research. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   cultures, strategic orientations, and management styles. Less clear,
   however, is whether there are significant patterns of differences in how

   firms [Deshpande et al., 1993. Journal of Marketing 57, 22-27], an
   exploratory study compared samples of business-to-business relationships
   of Japanese, English, French, German, and US companies. We found the
   expected significant differences in organizational cultures, but found
   no country-specific slopes or intercepts in regressions relating factors
   such as innovativeness, organizational climate and culture, and market
   orientation to business performance. Successful firms appear to
   transcend differences in national culture and develop a common pattern
   of drivers of success which include primary focus on organizational
   innovativeness, a participative work climate, and an externally oriented
   organizational culture. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   approaches pushes the practical use of models in new areas. The latter

   models are not standardized due to the lack of cumulative
   knowledge-building, (2) the penetration of models into actual use is
   somewhat overstated, (3) there is still much we do not know about
   marketing phenomena, and (4) marketing is still a borrower rather than a
   creator of new methods and models. The increased amount of data becoming

AB This paper contrasts a classic example of a logit decision model with a
   widely used descriptive model, the Dirichlet. Decision modeling,
   reviewed by Leeflang and Wittink in this issue of IJRM, aims to help
   make marketing-mix decisions. However, we have serious doubts about this
   sort of modeling: its inputs, its outputs, its assumed causality, and
   its frequent lack of empirically grounded predictability. It also seems
   to seldom really take account of already well-established marketing
   knowledge.
   In contrast, descriptive modeling more simply aims to depict actual or

   companies do not frequently apply optimization models because the profit
   improvements of the determination of the optimal level of a variable
   like price or advertising budget are small acid heavily depend on hardly
   predictable competitive reactions. Models are more often applied for the
   differentiation of product attributes or prices to serve the needs of

AB We investigate the dynamic aspects of a co-marketing alliance and offer
   guidelines to establish profitable and self-sustaining alliances. Our
   specific objective is to assess the attractiveness of forming a
   medium-term exclusive alliance between two brands or their manufacturers
   to produce a series of co-branded products jointly against the
   alternative of separate production. Relying on a diffusion framework,
   our study examines two questions. First, under what market-driven
   characteristics (e.g., size of each brand's customer base) should either
   brand manufacturer forge or sustain the alliance. Second, what product
   market characteristics should the alliance promoter (e.g., a recording
   company) seek or alter to increase its payoffs from the alliance. The
   model identifies the market-driven characteristics of the partnering
   brands at the start of the alliance and tracks their changes over time.
   Results show that a brand manufacturer would be better off not to form
   (or sustain) the alliance unless the market is expected to expand by an
   amount suggested by the model. From the alliance coordinator's
   standpoint. for a given overall strength, the alliance is most
   attractive if the strengths of the partnering brands an comparable. We
   demonstrate the real-world applicability of the model using survey data
   on three real alliances in the music CD industry. Limitations and future
   research directions are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

AB The focus of this paper is the process of homeostasis by which the body
   seeks to regulate its internal environment. In particular, we present a
   global model for a set of consumer behaviors that may vary across
   cultures as a direct response to the intensity and duration of sunlight
   and experienced temperature. This process creates physical and
   psychological needs, so that changes in sunlight and temperature may be
   reflected in various behaviors. We integrate research findings from the
   neural sciences and psychology to generate testable predictions of
   relevance to the marketing literature. These hypotheses predict how the
   physical environment motivates variations in the consumption of
   different types of products, and how mood, expressed affect, and related
   affective behaviors may vary across cultures. We also consider how
   variations in sunlight and temperature may affect consumer behaviors
   related to consumers' optimal stimulation levels. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of a physiological model on the debate of
   global convergence in consumer behavior. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

AB Are brand names more valuable online or in traditional supermarkets?
   Does the increasing availability of comparative price information online
   make consumers more price-sensitive? We address these and related
   questions by first conceptualizing how different store environments
   (online and traditional stores) can differentially affect consumer
   choices. We use the Liquid detergent, soft margarine spread, and paper
   towel categories to test our hypotheses. Our hypotheses and the
   empirical results from our choice models indicate that: (1) Brand names
   become more important online in some categories but not in others
   depending on the extent of information available to consumers - brand
   names are more valuable when information on fewer attributes is
   available online. (2) Sensory search attributes, particularly visual
   cues about the product (e.g., paper towel design), have lower impact on
   choices online, and factual information (i.e., non-sensory attributes,
   such as the fat content of margarine) have higher impact on choices
   online. (3) Price sensitivity is higher online, but this is due to
   online promotions being stronger signals of price discounts. The
   combined effect of price and promotion on choice is weaker online than
   offline, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Country of origin has been identified in the literature as an important
   cue that might be used by global marketers to influence consumers'
   valuation of the brand. Its effect on consumer perceptions, affect and
   behavioral intentions has been widely documented, based on consumer
   surveys and laboratory experiments. Despite this empirical evidence, we
   argue that country of origin is only one extrinsic cue among many
   extrinsic and intrinsic cues available to the consumer in a real
   purchase situation. Furthermore, in real life, consumers are likely to
   engage in some level of information search, which would further dilute
   the country of origin effect in the marketplace. Based on these
   arguments, we conclude that country of origin might not necessarily lead
   to a competitive (dis)advantage in terms of a price premium or discount.
   For a sample of products, we show that the objective product quality
   varies significantly by country of origin, and that these differences
   are consistent with extant research on country of origin effects on
   consumers' perceptions. After controlling for quality differences across
   brands, we demonstrate that marketers from different countries charge
   prices that are justified by differences in product quality. Price
   premiums or discounts are therefore explained by differences in product
   quality rather than the image effect produced by the country of origin
   cue. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper evaluates empirically the most commonly used methods of
   incorporating heterogeneity and purchase event feedback in choice
   models. We evaluate each method with respect to model fit, forecast
   accuracy, differences in estimated marketing mix response, and stability
   of estimated market segments. Our general findings are that (a) feedback
   and preference heterogeneity contribute substantially to fit and
   forecast accuracy; response heterogeneity improves upon this but not
   substantially; (b) estimated response parameters vary significantly
   across methods, but the corresponding elasticities do not; and (c) large
   segments are fairly stable in their preference and elasticity structures
   but small segments are much less so. Our comparison of specific methods
   suggests that, if researchers wish to use feedback and heterogeneity as
   controls for forecasting purposes or for estimating marketing mix
   response, BLOY, a smoothed measure of previous purchases, may be used in
   conjunction with a simple preference heterogeneity measure. If
   researchers wish to study heterogeneity and feedback per se, they should
   use a relatively complex heterogeneity method such as a finite mixture
   model, but they must make a trade-off between BLOY and a simple
   last-purchase indicator variable (LAST). BLOY provides a better fit but
   yields less stable market segments. LAST yields poorer fit but the
   market segments are more stable. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

AB A common hypothesis regarding interaction effects between brand name and
   country of production (COP) in the context of consumers' product quality
   judgments is that the latter are affected less by changes in COP from
   the brand's home country to another country for stronger than for weaker
   brands. However, the empirical support for this brand-strength
   hypothesis has been very weak. The authors propose an alternative
   explanation of brand X COP interactions that is based on the concept of
   brand-COP congruity. The latter is defined as the equality of a
   product's COP and the home country of the brand. Furthermore, the degree
   of brand-COP congruity is conceptualized as the strength with which a
   brand is associated with its home country. Brand-COP congruity is
   hypothesized to have a positive effect on product quality judgments
   above and beyond brand and COP main effects. In addition, the magnitude
   of this effect is expected to be positively related to the degree of
   brand-COP congruity. The results of an empirical study of consumers'
   evaluations of alpine skis provide strong support for both of these
   hypotheses. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite a recent surge of interest in relationship marketing, knowledge
   of the behavioral element of relational exchange in downstream channels
   remains tenuous. The author suggests that relational exchange involves
   both an attitudinal and a behavioral shift and maintains that joint
   action, a behavioral element of relational exchange, is driven not only
   by economizing motives to save transaction cost, but also by
   strategizing motives to serve customer needs better than competitors do.
   In particular, specialized investment is proposed as a common motive
   that has both economizing and strategizing aspects. Results of the
   hypothesis tests based on the survey of industrial distributors suggest
   that both economizing considerations and strategizing considerations
   motivate joint action in marketing channels. The dual motives of
   specialized investment are also supported. The author suggests that
   further research should clarify the link between relational exchange and
   channel performance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several reasons have been advanced to explain the remarkable success and
   growth of private label brands (PLBs) in Western Europe and North
   America. One important factor that has not been adequately highlighted
   is the role of consumer price consciousness and consequent consumer
   resistance to the prices of national brands. We develop a framework for
   understanding consumer price consciousness, why it Varies across product
   categories, and how it may result in PLB purchase, and calibrate the
   model on category-level field data. Our findings establish that
   perceived category risk and perceived price unfairness of national
   brands in that category are significant antecedents of consumer price
   consciousness, and that variations in such price consciousness across
   categories is a significant reason why consumers buy PLBs more in some
   categories than in others. Additionally, we show that perceived
   price-quality association has a significant effect on private label
   purchase in risky categories. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science

AB Diffusion of innovation has been the focus of an entire stream of
   research in marketing, and firm entry and exit decisions have been
   investigated by marketers, strategists, and economists. However, little
   attention has been paid to the relationship between changing demand and
   the entry and exit behaviors of competitors in the marketplace.
   Understanding this relationship is essential in making resource
   commitments, as profitability of options depends not only on the size
   and growth of the market, but also on the number of competitors likely
   to be encountered. This is particularly important in innovative markets,
   where changes occur rapidly and one cannot assume that either customer
   needs or competitors faced tomorrow will be the same as today. We
   simultaneously model demand and number of competitors, including the
   interactive relationship between these dynamics in the marketplace, and
   empirically investigate three technology-intensive markets-video
   cassette recorders, personal computers, and workstations. Our results
   suggest that competition and demand impact entry and exit, but that the
   nature of this impact may depend on whether or not a 'shakeout' has
   occurred in the marketplace. Further, an increasing number of
   competitors may lead to improved marketplace offerings, resulting in
   demand expansion. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The bundling of multiple products or components at a set price has
   become a popular marketing strategy. Although little is known of how
   bundled price information should be presented to consumers, mental
   accounting principles provide guidelines. These principles suggest that
   more positive evaluations should result from bundling or integrating
   component prices into a single price and debundling or segregating
   component discounts into a set of discounts. A study is reported in
   which consumers were presented an offer for an automobile and then asked
   to evaluate their satisfaction with the offer, likelihood of
   recommending, and likelihood of repurchasing the brand. The study
   supports the predictions as all three evaluations increase when price
   information is bundled and price discount information is debundled. (C)

   (though contradicting others), our industry study reveals that retailers
   can react to the heavy advertising amongst national brands by increasing
   prices, revenues, and economic profits generated from both national
   brands and private-label brands. For the category studied, retailers'
   strategies may include setting collusive prices for both national brands

   consumers adapt to time pressure by accelerating the visual scanning
   sequence, by filtering information and by changing their scanning
   strategy. In addition, consumers with high task motivation filter brand
   information less and pictorial information more. Consumers under time
   pressure filter textual ingredient information more, and pictorial
   information less. The results of a conditional legit analysis reveal
   that the chosen brand receives significantly more intra-brand and
   inter-brand saccades and longer fixation durations than non-chosen
   brands, independent of time pressure and task motivation conditions.

AB Unobserved variables correlated with market share are largely

   this paper is to empirically determine the cost/sales ratios through
   which unobserved variables affect profitability, and to use this
   information to identify specific unobserved variables. We find that
   firm-specific unobserved variables, generally called 'management skill'
   in the literature, decrease the purchase costs/sales ratio much more
   than they do any other costs/sales ratio. This finding allows us to
   identify three specific 'skills' utilized by market share leaders-(i)
   exploiting product/process efficiencies; (ii) negotiating better
   supplier discounts; and (iii) vertically integrating or developing
   strategic partnerships with key suppliers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

AB Customer satisfaction and supplier loyalty in markets where products are
   mainly undifferentiated are heavily affected by assurance of supply.
   Marketers manage production capacity in such markets to assure supply,
   but the resulting capacity competition leads to cycles of over-capacity
   followed by capacity deletions, which lead to under-capacity. We
   investigate some of the possible causes of this form of industry
   behavior in two ways. First, we report on an exploratory empirical
   investigation, motivated by in-depth interviews with industry
   executives, and develop a set of structural principles. We formalize
   those principles in a set of statistical models. Next, we review some
   related theory and identify a number of possible reasons that may
   combine to cause this phenomenon. We develop some simple, game theoretic
   models that focus on the issues of strategic interaction with demand
   uncertainty and different values of capacity change. We use the theory
   results to illustrate how over- and under-capacity situations arise. We
   compare our theoretical and empirical results and find an encouraging
   degree of convergence. We discuss the implications of these findings for
   individual firm strategies. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB We investigate two ways to increase sales and customer loyalty by taking
   advantage of a store's installed base of current customers. We propose a
   classification of products into two types. Products of Type 1 are
   products for which consumers have a loyalty to a specific retailer and,
   as far as possible, always shop at that retailer for these products. The
   other products (Type 2) are not associated with any retailer and are
   bought at whichever retailer consumers happen to shop when they plan or
   remember to buy the product. With this in mind, we test the potential of
   two marketing tools to help retailers increase their share of sales of
   the Type 2 segment. Using a category destination program we show that
   one can successfully transform Type 2 into Type 1 products. Using
   cross-merchandising promotions, we show that one can increase the sales
   of Type 2 products thereby gaining a larger share of discretionary
   purchases than what one would receive from a straight random allocation.
   Both series of tests yielded significant increases in sales and profits
   and were deemed successful by the retailers who implemented them. (C)

   individual stores for a multi-store, multi-market retailer employing
   Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Incorporating assurance regions into a
   DEA model allowed for a more complete specification of inputs and
   outcomes than usually found in DEA applications. This procedure
   permitted the researchers to capture top management's strategic
   thinking. Practical usefulness of the process' results is illustrated
   with respect to two management issues: evaluating store managers and

AB Productivity in retailing usually has been narrowly defined in short
   term economic performance. Although this is important, underlying
   salespersons' decisions are at work. As the core encounter of the entire
   value adding process from beginning to end, the interaction between
   salespeople and customers in the final step before consumption must be
   vital to understand the underlying human factors at work. We argue that
   this 'soft' side (human factor) determines the 'hard' productivity
   outcomes and that the dynamics of the service delivery process must be
   understood. Therefore, in this paper the point of sale has been studied
   second-by-second from the customer perspective to simulate how
   evaluations and perceptions vary during the encounter. By mapping the
   dynamic aspects we attempt to unravel the hidden side of how
   productivity is generated. The results obtained in two different
   'non-productive' retail encounters show that there is a substantial
   correlation between perceived warmth during the service encounter as a
   measure of perceived relationship and Likeability, perceived service
   quality and loyalty. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research on consumers' gifts to themselves has been mainly exploratory
   and descriptive. Toward more theoretical understanding, we conducted an
   experiment on self-gift behavior as it is precipitated by everyday
   achievement tasks. We manipulated (1) achievement outcomes
   (success/failure) and (2) consumers' explanations for those outcomes
   (attributions) to examine their effects on self-gift likelihood. We also
   measured emotions and deservingness as potential mediators. Results
   showed that self-gifts are more likely following successes; however,
   depending on whether the attribution is to an internal versus external
   cause, the levels of self-gift likelihood within successful and failed
   contexts are reversed. Also, happiness, pride, confidence, and
   deservingness mediated a substantial amount of these effects. Discussion
   focuses on implications for self-gift theory, attribution research, and
   the marketing management of consumer self-gift behavior. (C) 1998

AB Can the evolution of consumption emotions and satisfaction along the
   normal course of extended service transactions be traced and predicted?
   Ninety-three (49 male, 44 female) consumers of health care services
   reported in-process positive and negative emotions and satisfaction
   every day of their hospital stay (median length of stay of 5 days) and
   global retrospective judgments of the same variables upon departure.
   Trends in consumption emotions and satisfaction were tested using a
   dynamic nonlinear model based on assumptions of monotonicity and
   habituation. Results confirmed that trends in consumption emotions
   (increasing positive and decreasing negative) and satisfaction (under
   high in-process positive emotions only) could be modeled with
   statistical confidence and the model showed a good ability to predict
   retrospective global judgments. Revealing complex in-process dynamics,
   higher states of positive emotions magnified increasing trends in
   satisfaction and higher states of negative emotions dampened increasing
   trends in positive emotions. In-process satisfaction judgments had no
   significant impact on trends in either positive or negative emotions.
   Trends in emotions were influenced by individual (gender) and contextual
   (health status) conditions. A steeper increasing trend in positive
   emotions was observed for men (compared to women) while a smoother
   increasing trend in positive emotions and a smoother decreasing trend in
   negative emotions were obtained for consumers with poor health status
   (compared to those with good health status). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

AB A major concern for service managers is to counteract negative effects
   of waiting. In this study, the effects of objective waiting time and
   waiting environment on satisfaction with the service were investigated.
   Two elements of the waiting environment were distinguished: the
   attractiveness of the waiting room and the presence of television (TV)
   as an explicit distracter. The mediating role of three subjective
   variables (perceived waiting time, acceptable waiting time and the
   (cognitive and affective) appraisal of the wait) was explored. Waiting
   appears to influence satisfaction quite strongly. The adverse effects of
   waiting can be soothed more effectively by improving the attractiveness
   of the waiting environment than by shortening the objective waiting
   time. Objective waiting time influences satisfaction mainly via a
   cognitive route: through perceived waiting time (in minutes) and the
   long/short judgment of the wait. Perceived attractiveness of the waiting
   environment operates mainly through affect, and thus serves as a mood
   inducer. The acceptable waiting time appears to be a critical point of
   reference, since surpassing it provokes strong affective responses.
   Although the presence of TV did not result in the expected effect of
   distraction, the tendency to watch it was found to be dependent on the
   length of the wait (and thus, boredom). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The use of multi-item scales in marketing research is common practice,
   with many researcher's borrowing 'off the shelf scales. Yet, there is
   little literature which provides researchers with techniques for
   discriminating between prima facie, similar measures of constructs. This
   study develops a simple procedure for discriminating between measurement
   scales, combining non-nested econometric tests with two-stage least
   squares (2SLS) estimators for latent variables. The authors examine two
   measures of the construct market orientation, MARKOR and MKTOR, which
   are central to the marketing discipline and are commonly employed.
   Results suggest that MKTOR, in general, is superior to MARKOR in
   explaining variations in measures of business performance. Evidence also
   suggests that results from non-nested tests based on standard OLS
   regressions and summated scales may be misleading. (C) 1998 Elsevier

AB This paper proposes and illustrates an approach to probing a consumption
   experience in depth by means of integrating five perspectives on
   marketing or consumer research-namely, those that focus on (1) the
   nature of the consumption experience; (2) photography as a means of
   collecting data; (3) the photo essay as an approach to presenting
   findings; (4) stereography as a technique for enhancing the vividness,
   clarity, realism, and depth of the visual images used to represent
   consumption; and (5) collective collaboration as a way of applying the
   foregoing concerns to the gathering and communication of findings that
   represent a relevant group of consumers. Toward this end, the authors
   describe an integrative method and report an illustrative study of
   informants' verbal and pictorial responses to the topic "What New York
   Means To Me". When these inputs are focused on consumption experiences,
   captured via self-photography, explained by means of introspective
   vignettes, presented as printed stereo pairs or electronic 3-D
   anaglyphs, and analyzed as a collaborative sample of responses, they
   combine to generate a collective stereographic photo essay whose
   vividness, clarity, and realism help to probe the depths of this
   illustrative consumption experience. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier

AB This meta-analysis examines the role of trust in marketing channels.
   First, the analysis of painwise relationships involving trust indicates
   that trust, on average, exhibits a robust and strong relationship with
   other channel relationship constructs under a wide range of different
   conditions. Next, we explored systematic patterns of variation in the
   correlations. The results demonstrate that the use of experiments,
   samples drawn from multiple industries, and US data tend to produce
   larger effects than the use of field studies, samples drawn from a
   single industry, and European data respectively do. Various other
   methodological characteristics of studies did not have significant
   effects. Finally, we examined the role of trust in a nomological net,
   involving some of the most frequently studied antecedents and
   consequences of trust. We find that trust contributes to satisfaction
   and long-term orientation over and beyond the effects of economic
   outcomes of the relationship. Both trust and economic outcomes-not just
   one or the other-are conducive to relationship marketing success. (C)

   pairwise similarity judgments between brands, and how familiarity with
   the brands, serial position of the pair in a sequence, and the
   presentation format affect these judgments. Within the similarity
   judgment process both the formation of a consumer's mental similarity
   perception and the mapping of the judgment on the scale are examined. We
   investigate the occurrence of different response patterns, i.e. the
   distribution of judgments on the scale, in two studies: one using an
   input-output approach, and one using a process-tracing approach. In
   study I, judgments of brand similarity are obtained for soft drinks and
   magazines from 240 subjects. In study 2, 36 subjects judged, while
   thinking aloud, the similarity between soft drink brands. In both
   studies, the presentation format is varied between subjects, and
   familiar and unfamiliar brands are included. Familiarity with the
   brands, and to a lesser extent, the presentation format affect the
   response patterns, whereas serial position has no effect. Implications
   for similarity data collection, statistical modelling of similarity
   data, and conceptual models based on brand similarity are discussed. (C)

AB We present a research model that allows the investigation of many of the

   hypothesized relationships among launch strategy decisions, shed light
   on the ways in which managers tend to build choices among launch
   decision options into generic launch strategies and link new product
   performance to managers' generic strategies. Analyses of over 900
   manufactured goods new product launches show that over half the
   decisions in launch strategies are interdependent, that is, the decision
   made for one variable is associated with a decision choice made
   previously in the product development process. Thus, several decisions
   managers make in the new product launch require choosing launch decision
   options consistent with already-made launch choices. From the data we
   also identify three generic launch strategies across which new product
   performance statistically varies. Although the set of decisions which
   comprises each strategy is only a smaller portion of the full set
   investigated, we find that these decision sets are associated with
   different levels of performance across multiple industries, products and

AB The allocation of marketing budgets across advertising and sales
   promotions has changed over the past decade with a marked decrease in
   the percentage of budgets directed towards advertising. Moreover, there
   has been much speculation regarding how these changes have affected a
   brand's positioning vis-a-vis its competitors. In spite of this
   speculation, previous research has not examined the impact of changes in
   promotion and advertising on market structure. The purpose of this paper
   is therefore to ascertain how changes in promotional and advertising
   policy affect market structure over the long-term. The eight and one
   quarter years of scanner panel data used for our analysis indicate that
   brands in the analyzed product category tend to fall into
   premium/non-premium and attribute-based (mildness) tiers. Furthermore,
   the data suggest that the differentiation between non-premium and
   premium brands has diminished during the period of our study
   (1984-1992). The data also suggest that increases in price promotions
   and reductions in advertising have led to decreased differentiation
   between brands. These findings suggest that shifts in marketing dollars
   from advertising to promotions have made national brands more vulnerable
   to store brands' marketing activity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Marketing controllers traditionally analyze the profit contribution
   variance between actual and plan by decomposing it into a quantity and a
   price variance. This, however, enables them only to identify areas where
   problems exist rather than to diagnose their causes. In order to get
   more insights, this paper proposes making the planning assumptions for
   achieving a certain profit contribution explicit beforehand by
   specifying appropriate response functions. This information can be used
   after the fact to calculate the amount of profit contribution variance
   associated with different sources. In particular, the paper offers a
   novel decomposition principle of total variance into partial variances
   associated with possible sources such as incorrect market response
   assumptions (planning variance), deviations of actual marketing actions
   from planned ones (execution variance) and misanticipation of
   competitive reactions (reaction variance). Each of these variances can
   be decomposed further into the separate effects of single marketing
   instruments. By distinguishing between a response function for market
   share and one for market size, controllers can also estimate for which
   part of the variance the product manager may be responsible. (C) 1998

AB In probit brand choice models, researchers increasingly focus on random
   variation of key parameters of interest. An important source of such
   variation may be due to differing consumer response to marketing efforts
   across purchase occasions, Also, variables common across alternatives
   influence purchase behavior, but may not be measured. Failure to
   adequately control for both these factors may cause biased estimates.
   More importantly, the incorrect estimates may lead to erroneous
   managerial conclusions. While either problem can be directly addressed
   in a (non-independent) probit model, we focus on whether a joint
   specification of both factors is necessary. We highlight the potential
   for misleading managerial inferences by contrasting the model with both
   sources of variation against nested models, using empirical data on
   ketchup product category. Further, in a simulation study we establish
   the extent of bias in recovery of parameters due to different

AB Finland constitutes a rare laboratory for investigating the impact of
   substantial economic change on consumption and consumer behavior. Like
   most European countries Finland enjoyed almost 10 years of constant
   economic growth during the 1980s. Within 2-3 years the economy suffered
   the deepest depression since the Great Depression. Consumption was cut
   by 10% between 1989 and 1992 and unemployment increased from 3.3% in
   1990 to 17.7% in 1994, unheard-of figures in the wealthy Nordic
   countries, We examine the impact of these economic changes on Finnish
   consumption and marketing. One prominent finding is that not only
   consumption patterns but also consumers' values rapidly adjusted to the
   change. Another major theme we discuss is the consequences of Finland's
   joining the European Union for the markets and competition in Finland.

AB We introduce a model that accounts for the effects of habit-persistence
   and variety-seeking on consumer choice behavior, while simultaneously
   accounting for the effects of such time-varying marketing variables as
   price and promotions. While papers in the stochastic choice literature
   modeling higher-order behavior, i.e. habit-persistence and
   variety-seeking, do not account for the effects of marketing variables,
   models in the discrete choice literature account for the effects of
   marketing variables without explicitly modeling inertia and
   variety-seeking behavior. We use the stochastic model proposed by Given
   (1984) that accommodates habit-persistence and variety-seeking, and
   embellish it by including marketing variables. These variables influence
   not only the brand choice probabilities at any given point in time but
   can also influence the transition probabilities across purchase
   occasions. The model is empirically tested on scanner panel data. The
   results indicate that consumers display strongly inertial behavior and
   are price insensitive for the product category under study. We also
   examine the effect of imposing a specific form of choice dynamics, i.e.
   either inertia or variety-seeking, on the substantive implications of
   the model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Means-end chain theory links products to consumers by postulating
   hierarchical relations between attributes of the product, consequences
   of product use and values of consumers. It has served as an important
   conceptual framework for studies in marketing. The authors investigate
   the association pattern technique (APT) as a supplement to laddering,
   the most popular, qualitative measurement methodology in means-end
   chains research. APT is a structured method for measuring means-end
   chains, suitable for large-scale surveys. It can be used in personal as
   well as quantitative mail interviews. APT separately measures the
   attribute-consequence, and the consequence-value links. The independence
   of attribute-consequence, and consequence-value links is crucial to the
   validity of APT. Using loglinear models, we investigate this assumption
   for empirical data on four different products. Consistent support for
   independence is found. In addition, we use loglinear models to test the
   convergent validity of APT and laddering with respect to the content and
   structure of the means-end chains network that they reveal. The results
   show that the content of the APT and laddering networks differs. This
   result is explained from the different task formats. Most importantly,
   the hypothesis that the structure of APT and laddering networks is the
   same could not be rejected. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In this paper, we examine the over-time behavior of brand loyalty for a
   large set of brands drawn from 21 consumer packaged goods categories.
   Using the brand-loyalty operationalization of Colombo and Morrison
   (1989), the following conclusions are obtained. First, little support is
   found for the often-heard contention that brand loyalty is gradually
   declining over time. Second, while the short-run variability around a
   brand's mean loyalty level is not negligible, no evidence is found that
   this variability has systematically increased over time, and it can be
   reduced considerably through a simple smoothing procedure. Finally, the
   brand-loyalty pattern for market-share leaders is found to be more
   stable than for other brands. The study findings were robust to
   variation in the time interval used to construct the switching matrices,
   and to different treatments of multiple purchases. (C) 1997 Elsevier

AB This paper formally investigates the factors that relate to the
   deviations of brands' actual loyalty levels from theoretical norms in
   packaged goods markets. An aggregate measure of brand loyalty, share of
   category requirements, commonly tracked by marketing managers is used
   for this analysis. The comparison is conducted against the estimated
   share of requirements provided by the well established Dirichlet model
   of purchasing behavior. We posit that a brand's positioning strategy and
   marketing mix can influence the magnitude and the direction of the
   deviation from the norm. We use a two step modeling procedure where we
   first compute the deviation from the norm for each brand and
   subsequently conduct a regression analysis of this brand-level data to
   test the proposed hypotheses. We find that on average, brands that cater
   to some market niche, are bought in higher quantities, have lower
   prices, promote to a lesser extent, and have shallower price-cuts and
   enjoy higher than expected loyalty levels. We discuss possible
   implications of these results and offer guidelines that managers can use
   to better assess both the actual and the theoretical loyalty levels of
   their brands. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Consumers' expressed attitudes to brands are often thought to show their
   commitment and loyalty. But when consumers were re-interviewed, on
   average only about 50% gave the same attitudinal Yes or No response as
   before, implying that attitude beliefs are often not very firmly held.
   This paper reports that the attitudinal repeat-rates for different
   brands vary about this overall 50% average. These variations for
   different brands are, however, systematic. They are largely dependent
   upon the level of initial attitudinal responses, as a further instance
   of Double Jeopardy effects. The variation of repeat-rates is therefore
   not brand-specific and it does not reflect idiosyncratic differences in
   brand loyalty. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper uses the perspective of interpersonal relationship theory to
   critically examine, reposition, and extend the notion of brand loyalty.
   Depth interviews among eight coffee-consuming adults who qualified as
   brand loyal by traditional criteria provide the data. The result is a
   deeper appreciation of the character of loyal consumer-brand relations
   and a sharper awareness of the Limitations to understanding that current
   theoretical frameworks impose. Specifically, the authors suggest that:
   (1) not all loyal brand relationships are alike, in strength or in
   character; (2) many brand relationships not identified as 'loyal'
   according to dominant theoretical conceptions are especially meaningful
   from the consumer's point of view; and (3) current approaches to
   classification accept some brand relationships that, upon close
   scrutiny, do not possess assumed characteristics of 'loyalty' or
   'strength' at all. Ideas stemming from a reframing of loyalty as one
   component in a multifaceted construct of relationship strength are put
   forth, encouraging a move from the metaphor of 'loyalty' to the broader
   notion of 'relationships' that encompasses it. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

AB Loyalty programs are currently increasing in popularity around the
   world. This paper discusses the potential of loyalty programs to alter
   the normal market patterns of repeat-purchase behaviour which
   characterise competitive repeat-purchase markets. In line with this
   thinking, a large scale loyalty program is evaluated in terms of its
   ability to change normal repeat-purchase patterns by generating 'excess
   loyalty' for brands in the program. Panel data were used to develop
   Dirichlet estimates of expected repeat-purchase loyalty statistics by
   brand. These estimates were compared with the observed market
   repeat-purchase behaviour. Overall a trend towards a weak level of
   excess loyalty was observed, although the expected deviation was not
   consistently observed for all the loyalty program brands. Only two of
   the six loyalty program participant brands showed substantial excess
   loyalty deviations. However, these deviations in repeat-purchase loyalty
   were observed for non-members of the loyalty program as well as members
   and appear likely to be at least partially the result of other loyalty
   efforts particular to these brands. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB An important factor in retail store loyalty is interpersonal
   relationships between retail salespeople and customers. However,
   relationships can also exist at the person-to-store level. This paper
   examines the linkages between trust in a salesperson, trust in the
   store, and repeat purchase intention. A model of store loyalty which
   includes relationships at both the person-to-store as well as
   person-to-person level is tested. The findings reveal that for those
   with an interpersonal relationship, trust and commitment to the
   salesperson are directly linked with purchase intention as well as
   indirectly through store attitude. For customers without a salesperson
   relationship, trust in the store leads to loyalty indirectly through
   store attitude, but does not have a direct impact on purchase intention.
   The results illustrate the existence of multi-level relationships
   between customers and stores and how those relationships link to store
   loyalty. The research adds to our understanding of the complexity of
   relationship retailing, while providing further evidence of the value of
   generating and maintaining interpersonal relationships as a retail
   strategy. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A perceptual mapping technique for the analysis of two-way two-mode
   frequency data is presented: probability matrix decomposition. The
   technique is compared, both theoretically and empirically, to two
   alternative techniques: latent class analysis by the binomial model and
   correspondence analysis. From a theoretical perspective the most salient
   difference is that probability matrix decomposition (PMD) allows for
   testing several decision rules, each of which constitutes a different
   model of the psychological process assumed to give rise to the data,
   This distinguishes PMD from both correspondence analysis and latent
   class analysis, which can be considered tools for 'data reduction'
   without any underlying theory. when PMD models adequately reflect the
   underlying decision process, the technique is expected to lead to a more
   accurate representation of the data, The empirical comparison was based
   on a set of judgments obtained from 50 consumers concerning the
   appropriateness of 11 attributes for 41 sandwich fillings. Applying each
   of the three techniques to the binary judgments aggregated across
   respondents showed that PMD had the best fit in representing the data
   and also had the largest predictive power with respect to the
   preferences of consumers for the sandwich fillings. These findings
   support the hypothesis that modelling the underlying process may lead to
   a more accurate representation. Regarding the interpretability of the
   resulting perceptual maps, there also was an advantage for PMD. When
   considering the ease of data analysis however, correspondence analysis
   seems to be superior. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The problem of separating the effects of household heterogeneity from
   state dependence in brand choice models is important from a theoretical
   as well as a managerial perspective. To address this problem we propose
   a choice model that treats a household's string of purchases as the unit
   of analysis, in contrast with conventional models of individual
   purchases. Our formulation accounts for unobserved household
   heterogeneity in preferences and in responsiveness to marketing
   variables, as well as Markovian state dependence. We use three scanner
   panel data sets to test models that differ in the nature and extent of
   heterogeneity and state dependence accommodated. We find empirical
   evidence for state dependence as well as heterogeneity in each product
   category. We demonstrate via simulation of a price promotion bow the
   separation of the effects of state dependence from unobserved
   heterogeneity enables us to (1) correctly evaluate the profitability of
   a promotion by explicitly taking into account the multiperiod effects of
   promotions resulting from state dependence, and (2) prioritize market
   segments for the targeting of promotional activities. (C) 1997 Elsevier

   known about the relative appropriateness of alternative model
   specifications that differ in constraints. We propose hierarchical
   models, and we compare different possible hierarchies against each other
   and against recently developed nonhierarchical specifications. We
   discuss how the alternative specifications accommodate asymmetry in
   competition, We also show analytical linkages between the different
   models, and we provide a preliminary empirical comparison of these

AB This research investigates the impact of children's affective reactions
   elicited by TV ads on two essential indicators of advertising
   effectiveness: the attitude toward the ad (A(ad)) and post exposure
   brand attitude (A(bp)). Working with children as subjects, minimizing
   forced exposure and using a real program in which real commercials were
   embedded, were the authors' methodological choices. This offered a
   setting as naturalistic as possible to assess the impact of verbal as
   well as non-verbal affective reactions, the latter being measured
   through facial expressions. It was clearly found that the evaluative
   judgments of the ad elements of execution - but not of the ad arguments
   - are instrumental in shaping children's A(ad) and A(bp). Verbal
   affective reactions, especially the positive ones, are important
   predictors of A(ad) and A(bp). The link between A(ad) and A(bp) is
   significant both for known and unknown brands. The contribution of
   facial expressions is limited. A(ad) does not mediate the impact of
   affective reactions on A(bp). Finally, limitations of this study are
   pinpointed and issues for further research are offered. (C) 1997

   to an overall satisfaction judgement. The results of a cross-cultural
   study are reported in which the museum visit was chosen as the service
   delivery process. Our findings suggest that the museum Visit can be

AB Although attention is a key construct in models of marketing
   communication and consumer choice, its selective nature has rarely been
   examined in common time-pressured conditions. We focus on the role of
   benefit salience, that is, the readiness with which particular benefits
   are brought to mind by consumers in relation to a given product
   category. Study I demonstrated that when product feature information was
   presented rapidly, individuals for whom the benefit of personalised
   customer service had high habitual salience displayed selective
   attention as evidenced by elevated recall and recognition of a target
   feature (a bank's ''friendly employees''). Also, as expected, individual
   differences in habitual benefit salience affected judgements of the
   target product. Study 2 showed that when subjects were additionally
   informed about a specific product usage situation, selective attention
   was primarily influenced by the relevance of the target feature to
   benefits made salient by the usage situation; individual differences
   played a less important role. Discussion emphasises theoretical aspects
   of the findings as well as managerial implications with respect to
   person-situation approaches to benefit segmentation. (C) 1997 Elsevier

AB What kind of consumer dynamism can be expected in a close-to-zero growth
   economy and how will the supply side develop in such an economic
   environment? As this Swedish case demonstrates, advanced consumer
   behaviour is not as closely related to growth in private incomes as is
   usually believed. Education, new norms and values and extensive
   labour-force participation among women appear to create alert consumers,
   who demand high quality products whilst also showing a pronounced
   awareness of prices. Hence, the same consumers can be seen drinking
   champagne and buying things second-hand. It seems that such post-modem
   qualities are more clearly evident in Sweden than in other European
   countries, as Swedish family members tend to be more independent and
   experience-seeking in their consumption. Companies facing this complex
   and paradoxical consumer behaviour exhibit a dynamic response, however,
   which triggers new ways of achieving efficiency and creating value. In
   this reorganisation, information technology plays an important role. (C)

AB This paper deals with marketing decision support systems (MDSS) in
   companies. In a conceptual framework five categories of factors are
   distinguished that potentially affect adoption, use, and satisfaction:
   external environment factors, organizational factors, task environment
   factors, user factors and implementation factors. Hypotheses are
   developed and tested on data from a survey of 525 companies. The factors
   that determine the adoption of an MDSS are different from the factors
   that affect the success of an MDSS, once it has been installed. For
   adoption, support from inside the company, communication and knowledge
   about MDSS are crucial. For the subsequent success of an MDSS,
   involvement of the user, sophistication, adaptability of the system and
   the possibility of direct interaction with the system are important.
   MDSS are primarily adopted to obtain information and not to upgrade (add
   value to) existing information. Companies in consumer goods are ahead of
   companies in the business-to-business sector, but this difference is
   likely to decrease in the future. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

   upon presentation of the cue. Hypotheses: (H1) top-of-mind,

AB 'Relevance' is a quality widely attributed to research that closes the
   gap between theory and practice. It is an attribute well worth
   attracting these days. For some marketing scholars and practitioners
   closing this gap has assumed the proportions of an heroic and perennial
   struggle between the high-mindedness of marketing theory and the low
   deeds of marketing practice. Many different perspectives are offered by
   way of an analysis of the origins of this particular species. Yet,
   despite our best efforts to the contrary, the beast continues to prosper
   and to defy understanding.
   Through critically appraising the social location of marketing
   management and its ensuing rhetoric, this paper provides an alternative
   understanding of this gap and the 'slings and arrows' we suffer in our
   quest to achieve the 'Holy Grail' of closure. This understanding
   implicates the marketing academy in the perpetuation of the belief that
   the gap exists 'out there' and that it should and can be closed.
   Controversially, we suggest that, despite the marketing academy's
   declared quest for 'relevance' through providing clues to better
   marketing practice, perhaps it is in the academy's own interest to
   continue to perpetuate this particular marketing myth.
   We argue that if this is so, then the marketing management discourse is
   in danger of being trapped in the aspic of its own prejudices. The paper
   maps out the contours of this danger. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

   and identifies relevant constructs useful to understand the effects of

   empirical investigation which shows that provocation may be a valid
   strategy to attract attention, but may affect negatively the attitude
   toward the brand. However, it is not certain that it does affect
   negatively the behavior of consumers in any significant manner. More
   research is therefore needed on the roles of variables such as the level

   trends in Spain and discuss changes in consumer buying behaviour and in
   the macromarketing environment. The implications for marketing are
   developed throughout the article and we conclude by presenting a number
   of challenges for marketers over the next decade.

AB In this paper, the authors examine a phenomenon, which has been observed
   in the grocery channel recently, called ''guarantee of margins''.
   Guarantee of margins is a clause inserted in the contract between the
   manufacturer and the retailer that ensures a certain profit margin for
   the retailer irrespective of the retail price he/she is charging. In the
   wake of increasing retail level concentration and competition, the
   retailers' ability of extracting these guarantees from the manufacturers
   is a clear demonstration of retailer power. Our analysis provides new
   insights into the growing debate about the power shift to the retailers
   in the grocery channel. It shows how the retailers can and have utilized
   this power to maintain their margins by extracting these guarantees from
   the manufacturers. We specifically model the ability of the retailers to
   play one manufacturer against another and to use the private label
   brands as a lever to extract more profits.

AB We discuss an approach for modeling the evolution of preference segments
   over multiple time periods (e.g., before and well after new product
   introductions), using panel survey data that are easy to collect on a
   large scale from different regional markets and countries where scanner
   panel data are limited or unavailable. We explicitly model the evolution
   among market segments (e.g., from the period before new products are
   introduced to a period well after the new product introductions), while
   simultaneously estimating the preference segmentation structure in each
   period. We discuss the managerial usefulness of the proposed approach
   via an illustrative empirical application entailing consumer purchase
   data, collected before and well after the (almost) concurrent
   introduction of two new brands from a test market. Further, using
   synthetic data, we illustrate the ability of the proposed approach to
   accommodate and detect different segment evolution scenarios, recover
   known model parameters, and accurately segment the market in each
   period. We conclude with a discussion of the benefits, limitations, and
   potential extensions of the proposed approach.

AB Similarity and preference judgements often do not correspond, in that
   products which are perceived as very similar are not similarly
   preferred. Lefkoff-Hagius and Mason (1993) found that this effect is due
   to the consumers' use of different product attributes in making
   similarity and preference judgements. We extended their study, by using
   actual products and letting subjects write down the reasons underlying
   their judgements, instead of using verbal product descriptions in a
   conjoint measurement framework. In accordance with the hypotheses of
   Lefkoff-Hagius and Mason, we found that more subjects mentioned
   beneficial and imagery attributes underlying their preference judgement.
   The hypothesis that more subjects mention characteristic attributes as
   underlying their similarity judgement is only partially supported The
   implications of these findings are discussed.
