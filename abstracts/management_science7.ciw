AB Organizations engage in search whenever they perform nonroutine tasks,
   such as the definition and validation of a new strategy, the acquisition
   of new capabilities, or new product development. Previous work on search
   and organizational hierarchy has discovered that a hierarchy with a
   central decision maker at the top can speed up problem solving, but
   possibly at the cost of solution quality compared with results of a
   decentralized search. Our study uses a formal model and simulations to
   explore the effect of an organizational hierarchy on solution stability,
   solution quality, and search speed. Three insights arise on how a
   hierarchy can improve organizational search: (1) assigning a lead
   function that "anchors" a solution speeds up problem solving; (2) local
   solution choice should be delegated to the lowest level; and (3)
   structure matters little at the middle management level, but it matters
   at the front line; front-line groups should be kept small. These results
   highlight the importance for every organization of adapting its
   hierarchical structure to its search requirements.

AB In this paper, we analyze the contracting issues that arise in
   collaborative services, such as consulting,financial planning, and
   information technology outsourcing. In particular, we investigate how
   the choice of contract type-among fixed-fee, time-and-materials, and
   performance-based contracts-is driven by the service environment
   characteristics. We find that fixed-fee contracts contingent on
   performance are preferred when the service output is more sensitive to
   the vendor's effort, that time-and-materials contracts are optimal when
   the output is more sensitive to the buyer's effort, and that
   performance-based contracts dominate when the output is equally
   sensitive to both the buyer's and the vendor's inputs. We also discuss
   how the performance of these contracts is affected with output
   uncertainty, process improvement opportunities, and the involvement of
   multiple buyers and vendors in the joint-production process. Our model
   highlights the trade-offs underlying the choice of contracts in a
   collaborative service environment and identifies service process design
   changes that improve contract efficiency.

AB A seller in an online marketplace with an effective reputation mechanism
   should expect that dishonest behavior results in higher payments now
   whereas honest behavior results in a better reputation-and thus higher
   payments-in the future. We study the Window Aggregation Mechanism, a
   widely used class of mechanisms that shows the average value of the
   seller's ratings within some fixed window of past transactions. We
   suggest approaches for choosing the window size that maximizes the range
   of parameters for which it is optimal for the seller to be truthful. We
   show that mechanisms that use information from a larger number of past
   transactions tend to provide incentives for patient sellers to be more

AB Hiring away inventors has long been recognized as a way of learning used
   by innovative firms. This paper claims that the characteristics of the
   knowledge accumulated by an inventor at his current employer affect what
   hiring firms can learn from him. The implication is that some inventors
   are more likely to be hired away than their coworkers. We analyze the
   relationship between the type of knowledge embodied by inventors working
   at IBM and their probability of moving. Relying on patent data to track
   the movement of inventors across firms and to characterize the kind of
   know-how they hold, we identify the following drivers of inventor
   mobility: the quality of their work; the complementarity of their
   knowledge with that of other inventors; and, to a lower extent, their
   expertise in the firm's core areas in which the firm is not a dominant
   player. Results confirm the role of knowledge characteristics behind the
   mobility of research and development personnel and suggest that learning
   is a relevant force in the market for inventors.

AB Product line design decisions are determinant for a firm's market
   success and, simultaneously, very costly to implement and change. To
   evaluate the profitability of a design, a number of mathematical
   programming approaches have been proposed in the last three
   decades-typically nonlinear integer optimization problems that can only
   be tackled heuristically for real-world instances. Recently, Chen and
   Hausman (2000) efficiently exploited the fractional programming
   properties of a stylized model for product line and price selection with
   the objective to maximize contribution given homogeneous customer
   behavior by an aggregate multinomial logit choice model. We extend the
   approach of Chen and Hausman (Chen, K. D., W. H. Hausman. 2000.

   46(2) 327-332) to determine an optimal product line under a personalized

   Personalized/group pricing is a growing discrimination strategy that
   more and more businesses are realizing is not only very pro. table, but
   also often implementable in the era of e-business. Our problem
   formulation allows to incorporate commonly applied attraction choice
   models including the multinomial logit, the Bradley-Terry-Luce, and
   approximately the first choice model. Though the problem is generally
   nonlinear, we show that the fractional substructure resulting from
   attraction choice models can still be exploited to globally solve
   real-world instances in reasonable time.

AB A key result of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is that the
   market portfolio-the portfolio of all assets in which each asset's
   weight is proportional to its total market capitalization-lies on the
   mean-variance-efficient frontier, the set of portfolios having
   mean-variance characteristics that cannot be improved upon. Therefore,
   the CAPM cannot be consistent with efficient frontiers for which every
   frontier portfolio has at least one negative weight or short position.
   We call such efficient frontiers "impossible," and show that impossible
   frontiers are difficult to avoid. In particular, as the number of
   assets, n, grows, we prove that the probability that a generically
   chosen frontier is impossible tends to one at a geometric rate. In fact,
   for one natural class of distributions, nearly one-eighth of all assets
   on a frontier is expected to have negative weights for every portfolio
   on the frontier. We also show that the expected minimum amount of short
   selling across frontier portfolios grows linearly with n, and even when
   short sales are constrained to some finite level, an impossible frontier
   remains impossible. Using daily and monthly U. S. stock returns, we
   document the impossibility of efficient frontiers in the data.

AB Reputational concerns have commonly been perceived to have a positive
   effect on auditing firms' execution of their monitoring and attesting
   functions. This paper demonstrates that this need not always be the case
   by studying a two-period game of repeated interaction between a manager
   and an auditor under the assessment of the market for audit services.
   Regarding reputation as the sole motivator for the auditor, we
   illustrate how reputational concerns induce an auditing firm to
   misreport. We investigate the reasons and circumstances under which such
   misreporting takes place. In particular, a strategic manager can induce
   the audit firm down a slippery slope, wherein the managerial fraud
   increases as the tenure of the audit firm progresses, whereas the
   auditor's fraud reporting probability decreases.

AB Various commentators have praised the WorldCom and Enron settlements for
   holding outside directors personally liable, arguing that heightened
   director liability will induce greater board oversight. This paper shows
   that the connection between director liability and board behavior is
   more subtle, because directors have multiple means to respond to an
   increase in liability exposure: They can increase oversight to prevent
   accounting manipulation and/or reduce performance-based CEO pay to
   mitigate the CEO's ex ante incentive to engage in manipulation. These
   two decisions are interrelated, implying that the effects of director
   liability on board oversight and CEO incentive pay are ambiguous. In
   particular, the model predicts that, for firms in which board oversight
   is difficult and costly (e. g., large firms with complex business
   operations), a stricter legal environment for directors leads to a lower
   level of board oversight, lower CEO incentive pay, and lower shareholder
   value.

AB We study competitive positioning and pricing strategies in markets where
   consumers seek variety. Variety seeking behavior is modeled as a
   decrease in the willingness to pay for the product purchased on the
   previous purchase occasion. Using a three-stage Hotelling-type model, we
   show that the presence of variety seeking consumers reduces product
   differentiation offered in equilibrium, thereby explaining some
   otherwise counterintuitive findings in empirical research. We find that
   firms charge higher prices in Period 1 and lower prices in Period 2. The
   lower price in Period 2 represents the price incentive that firms need
   to offer to prevent the variety seeking consumers from switching.
   Furthermore, we find that the observed switching in a market may not
   fully capture the true magnitude of the underlying variety seeking
   tendencies among consumers. Finally, we show that the presence of
   variety seeking consumers leads to lower firm profits and a higher
   consumer surplus. Surplus increases for variety seeking consumers as
   well as regular consumers. Therefore, the presence of variety seeking
   consumers benefits everyone in the market.

AB The benefits of supply chain innovations such as quick response (QR)
   have been extensively investigated. This paper highlights a potentially
   damaging impact of QR on retailer effort. By lowering downstream
   inventories, QR may compromise retailer incentives to exert sales effort
   on a manufacturer's product and may lead instead to greater sales effort
   on a competing product. Manufacturer-initiated quick response can
   therefore back. re, leading to lower sales of the manufacturer's product
   and, in some cases, to higher sales of a competing product. Evidence
   from case studies and interviews shows that some manufacturers view high
   retailer inventory as a means of increasing retailer commitment ("a
   loaded customer is a loyal customer"). By implication, manufacturers
   should recognize the effect we highlight in this paper: the potential of
   QR to lessen retailer sales effort. We show that relatively simple
   distribution contracts such as minimum-take contracts, advance-purchase
   discounts, and exclusive dealing, when adopted in conjunction with QR,
   can remedy the distortionary impact of QR on retailers' incentives. In
   two recent antitrust cases we find evidence that, consistent with our
   theory, manufacturers adopted exclusive dealing at almost the same time
   that they were making QR-type supply chain improvements.

AB W e examine the heterogeneous returns to third-party quality signals in
   the context of the Indian software services industry. Prior theory has
   argued that quality certification is important in markets characterized
   by information asymmetry. However, there is limited understanding of the
   contingent factors that influence the efficacy of the quality signal. We
   focus on capability maturity model (CMM) certification, which is granted
   on the basis of a rigorous audit of software vendor's internal
   quality-oriented software construction practices, as a signal of
   unobservable quality. Drawing upon prior research in strategy and
   economics, we theorize that the impacts of CMM certification on a
   vendor's export performance are conditional on factors reflecting the
   vendor's strategy (diversification and location) and its competitive
   environment (the extent of CMM penetration in the vendor's competition).
   Analysis of panel data supports our predictions related to the
   contingent value of CMM certification, and shows that a software service
   provider gains more from certification in terms of its software exports
   when its service offerings are diversified, when it chooses to locate
   away from a cluster of other software service firms, and when the extent
   of CMM penetration in the competition is low. This study extends prior
   research in the information value of a quality signal on a firm's demand
   side that has, for the most part, focused solely on direct effects. We
   discuss the implications of our findings for the strategic trade-offs
   that managers of software service firms need to make.

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that investors' independent biases should
   cancel each other out and have little impact on equilibrium at the
   aggregate level. In contrast to this intuition, this paper analyzes
   models with biased investors and finds that biases often have a
   significant impact on the equilibrium even if they are independent
   across investors. First, independent biases affect the equilibrium asset
   price if investor demand for the asset is a nonlinear function of the
   bias. Second, even if the demand function is linear in the bias, it may
   still have a significant impact on the equilibrium because of the
   fluctuation of the wealth distribution. An initial run-up of the stock
   price makes optimistic investors richer, which then further pushes the
   stock price up and leads to lower future returns. This effect can lead
   to price overshooting, i.e., a negative expected future return.
   Similarly, an initial drop of the stock price leads to higher future
   returns. Simple calibrations show that a modest amount of biases can
   have a large impact on the equilibrium.

AB We study settings where a number of sellers simultaneously offer
   vertically differentiated Vickrey auctions for imperfect substitute
   goods to unit-demand buyers. Vertical differentiation can arise from
   differences in item quality, item value certainty, seller reliability,
   or a combination of these factors. We characterize the form of the
   bidding equilibria and derive expressions for the corresponding
   allocative efficiency and expected seller revenue. When bidders are
   restricted to submit at most one bid, our theory predicts the existence
   of a unique Bayes-Nash equilibrium that resembles a form of
   probabilistic "mating-of-likes." Allowing unit-demand bidders to place
   an arbitrary number of bids induces complex strategy profiles where
   bidders place positive bids in all available auctions. Higher bidder
   types tend to follow more targeted strategies, focusing their "serious"
   bids on fewer and, generally, higher quality auctions. The nature of the
   bidding equilibria introduces allocative inefficiencies that arise from
   the lack of coordination in auction selection among bidders. We test our
   theoretical propositions in a controlled laboratory experiment while
   also utilizing a domain specific risk score to help assess how the
   bidders' risk type affects their bidding behavior. In support of our
   theory we find evidence of a probabilistic assortative matching between
   bidder and auction types. We also find that low risk type bidders tend
   to crowd on the highest auction and will pay a premium for the certainty
   it offers, whereas high risk type bidders fail to appropriately adjust
   for risk associated with the lowest auction, leading to overbidding.
   These lead to an interesting focal anomaly whereby bids are concentrated
   on the highest and lowest auctions, bypassing intermediate auctions.

AB We consider the problem of staffing call centers with multiple customer
   classes and agent types operating under quality-of-service (QoS)
   constraints and demand rate uncertainty. We introduce a formulation of
   the staffing problem that requires that the QoS constraints are met with
   high probability with respect to the uncertainty in the demand rate. We
   contrast this chance-constrained formulation with the
   average-performance constraints that have been used so far in the
   literature. We then propose a two-step solution for the staffing problem
   under chance constraints. In the first step, we introduce a random
   static planning problem (RSPP) and discuss how it can be solved using
   two different methods. The RSPP provides us with a first-order (or
   fluid) approximation for the true optimal staffing levels and a staffing
   frontier. In the second step, we solve a finite number of staffing
   problems with known arrival rates-the arrival rates on the optimal
   staffing frontier. Hence, our formulation and solution approach has the
   important property that it translates the problem with uncertain demand
   rates to one with known arrival rates. The output of our procedure is a
   solution that is feasible with respect to the chance constraint and
   nearly optimal for large call centers.

   this question with a recombination and selection model of knowledge
   transfer operating through a social network. We find that ideation is
   accelerated when people in the organization dynamically churn through a
   large (ideally the entire population) set of conversational partners
   over time, which naturally begets short path lengths and eliminates
   information bottlenecks. Group meetings, in which the content of
   conversations is available to all for consideration, are another way to
   learn in parallel and accelerate the ideation process, although for
   complex problems they may not offer significant advantages over the best

AB This paper provides a methodology for detecting management fraud using
   basic financial data. The methodology is based on support vector
   machines. An important aspect therein is a kernel that increases the
   power of the learning machine by allowing an implicit and generally
   nonlinear mapping of points, usually into a higher dimensional feature
   space. A kernel specific to the domain of finance is developed. This
   financial kernel constructs features shown in prior research to be
   helpful in detecting management fraud. A large empirical data set was
   collected, which included quantitative financial attributes for
   fraudulent and nonfraudulent public companies. Support vector machines
   using the financial kernel correctly labeled 80% of the fraudulent cases
   and 90.6% of the nonfraudulent cases on a holdout set. Furthermore, we
   replicate other leading fraud research studies using our data and find
   that our method has the highest accuracy on fraudulent cases and
   competitive accuracy on nonfraudulent cases. The results validate the
   financial kernel together with support vector machines as a useful
   method for discriminating between fraudulent and nonfraudulent companies
   using only publicly available quantitative financial attributes. The
   results also show that the methodology has predictive value because,
   using only historical data, it was able to distinguish fraudulent from
   nonfraudulent companies in subsequent years.

AB It is puzzling that firms often continue to invest in product
   development projects when they should know that demand will be low. We
   argue that bad products are hard to kill because firms face an inherent
   conflict when designing managers' incentives. Rewarding success
   encourages managers to forge ahead even when demand is low. To avoid
   investing in low-demand products, the firm must also reward decisions to
   kill products. However, rewarding managers for killing products
   effectively undermines the rewards for success. The inability to resolve
   this tension forces the firm to choose between paying an even larger
   bonus for success and accepting continued investment in low-demand
   products. We explore the boundaries of this argument by analyzing how
   the timing of demand information affects product investment decisions.

   be used to assist the decisions of a store manager in two ways. First,
   we show how to quantify the lost sales induced by out-of-stock products.
   Second, we provide insights on the financial consequences of

   decisions that takes this regime switching into account, together with
   asset pricing model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. The findings
   reveal that the economic value of accounting for regimes is
   substantially independent of whether or not model and parameter
   uncertainties are incorporated: the certainty-equivalent losses
   associated with ignoring regime switching are generally above 2% per
   year and can be as high as 10%. These results suggest that the more
   realistic regime switching model is fundamentally different from the

   in portfolio decisions irrespective of concerns about model or parameter

AB We use a social contagion lens to study the dynamic, temporal process of
   the diffusion of electronic medical records in the population of U. S.
   hospitals. Social contagion acknowledges the mutual influence among
   organizations within an institutional field and implicates information
   transmission through direct contact and observation as the mechanisms
   underlying influence transfer. We propose hypotheses predicting a
   hospital's likelihood of adopting electronic medical records as a
   function of its susceptibility to the influence of prior adopters, the
   infectiousness or potency of influence exerted by adopting hospitals,
   and its social and spatial proximity to prior adopters. Results obtained
   by fitting a heterogeneous diffusion model to data from a sample drawn
   from an annual survey, spanning 1975 to 2005, of almost 4,000 U. S.
   hospitals suggest that diffusion can be accelerated if specific
   attention is given to increasing social contagion effects. In
   particular, with respect to susceptibility to influence, greater
   hospital size and age are positively related to the likelihood of
   adoption for nonadopters, whereas younger hospitals are associated with
   greater infectiousness for adopters. A hospital's "celebrity" status
   also contributes to its infectiousness. We further find strong effects
   for social proximity and significant regional effects for spatial
   proximity and hospital size, suggesting that geographical covariates
   should be included in diffusion studies. Results also reinforce the
   importance of theorizing about and including interactions in
   examinations of social contagion.

   and start-up size. The relationship between prior wealth and start-up
   performance, as measured by profitability on assets, increases in the
   first three wealth quartiles. In the top wealth quartile, however,
   profitability drops sharply in wealth. Our findings are consistent with
   a luxury good interpretation of entrepreneurship and that higher wealth

   effects of entry on future potential entrants. This paper shows that the
   ability of early entry to deter future competitors' entry leads firms to
   enter the market at a rate faster than demand is expanding. If there is
   the potential for many firms to enter the market, firms may be less
   likely to enter because of future competitor entry to correct any market

   feelings and the risk of disappointment ex post. We characterize the
   optimal beliefs and the preferences under risk generated by this mental
   process and apply this criterion to a simple portfolio choice/insurance
   problem. We show that these preferences are compatible with first-degree
   and second-degree stochastic dominance and yield a preference for early
   resolution of uncertainty. Furthermore, they are consistent with
   observed violations of the independence axiom, such as the preference
   reversal in the Allais paradox, and predict that the decision maker

   "level-k flexibility" refers to the ability to process k different
   product types. We present an exact set-theoretic methodology to analyze
   newsvendor networks with multiple products and parallel resources. This
   simple approach is sufficiently powerful to prove that (i) flexibility
   exhibits decreasing returns and (ii) the optimal portfolio will invest
   in at most two, adjacent levels of flexibility in symmetric systems, and
   to characterize (iii) the optimal flexibility configuration for
   asymmetric systems as well. The optimal flexibility configuration can
   serve as a theoretical performance benchmark for other configurations
   suggested in the literature. For example, although chaining is not
   optimal in our setting, the gap is small and the inclusion of scale
   economies quickly favors chaining over pairing. We also demonstrate how
   this methodology can be applied to other settings such as product

AB In response to competitive pressures, firms are increasingly adopting
   revenue management opportunities afforded by advances in information and
   communication technologies. Motivated by these revenue management
   initiatives in industry, we consider a dynamic pricing problem facing a
   firm that sells given initial inventories of multiple substitutable and
   perishable products over a finite selling horizon. Because the products
   are substitutable, individual product demands are linked through
   consumer choice processes. Hence, the seller must formulate a joint
   dynamic pricing strategy while explicitly incorporating consumer
   behavior. For an integrative model of consumer choice based on linear
   random consumer utilities, we model this multiproduct dynamic pricing
   problem as a stochastic dynamic program and analyze its optimal prices.
   The consumer choice model allows us to capture the linkage between
   product differentiation and consumer choice, and readily specializes to
   the cases of vertically and horizontally differentiated assortments.
   When products are vertically differentiated, our results show
   monotonicity properties (with respect to quality, inventory, and time)
   of the optimal prices and reveal that the optimal price of a product
   depends on higher quality product inventories only through their
   aggregate inventory rather than individual availabilities. Furthermore,
   we show that the price of a product can be decomposed into the price of
   its adjacent lower quality product and a markup over this price, with
   the markup depending solely on the aggregate inventory. We exploit these
   properties to develop a polynomial-time, exact algorithm for determining
   the optimal prices and the profit. For a horizontally differentiated
   assortment, we show that the profit function is unimodal in prices. We
   also show that individual, rather than aggregate, product inventory
   availability drives pricing. However, we find that monotonicity
   properties observed in vertically differentiated assortments do not
   hold.

AB The relationship between commodity inventory and short-term price

   has been limited to single-stage cross-sectional relation. In this
   paper, we aim to deepen our understanding of the inventory-price
   relationship in two dimensions: across time and across production
   stages. We first examine an individual firm controlling production and
   two stages of inventory under uncertain input and output prices and
   operating costs. We next establish and characterize the rational
   expectations equilibrium for an economy in which competitive production
   firms link a raw material market and a finished goods market, with
   uncertain and price-sensitive supply and demand. We characterize the
   dynamics of inventory, market price, and gross margin based on
   theoretical analysis, simulation, and empirical evidence from the
   petroleum industry. We find that inventory fluctuations lag behind price
   variations, and the length of the lags depend on how far the inventory
   is from the source of the supply or demand shocks. We also find that
   shocks are both dampened and delayed when propagating through the
   production stages, and that shocks have a prolonged effect on
   inventories and prices at both stages.

AB We consider a manufacturer-retailer supply chain for a seasonal product
   whose demand is weather sensitive. The retailer orders from the
   manufacturer (supplier) prior to the selling season and then sells to
   the market. We examine how a manufacturer can structure a weather-linked
   rebate to improve his expected profit. The proposed class of rebate
   contracts offers several advantages over many other contract structures,
   including no required verification of leftover inventory and/or markdown
   amounts, and no adverse effect on sales effort by the retailer. We
   provide a thorough analysis of the manufacturer's and retailer's
   decisions in this context. We show that the weather-linked rebate can
   take many different forms, and this flexibility allows the supplier to
   design contracts that are Pareto improving and/or limit his risk in
   offering the contract and the retailer's risk in accepting it. For
   weather rebates with certain characteristics, the manufacturer can fully
   hedge his risks of offering a weather rebate by paying a risk premium;
   we show how this can be accomplished. We also show that the basic
   structural results extend to settings in which the two parties would
   like to limit their risk.

AB We explore why some employees may be at a disadvantage in searching for
   information in organizations. The "small-world" argument in social
   network theory emphasizes that people are, on average, only a few
   connections away from the information they seek. However, we argue that
   such a network structure does not benefit everyone: some employees may
   have longer search paths in locating knowledge in an organization-their
   world may be large. We theorize that this disadvantage is the result of
   more than just an inferior network position. Instead, two
   mechanisms-periphery status and homophily-jointly operate to aggravate
   the inefficiency of search for knowledge. Employees who belong to the
   periphery of an organization because of their minority gender status,
   lower tenure, or poor connectedness have limited awareness of who knows
   what and a lower ability to seek help from others best suited to guide
   the search. When they start a search chain, they are likely to engage in
   homophilous search by contacting colleagues like themselves, thus
   contacting others who also belong to the periphery. To search
   effectively, employees on the periphery need to engage in heterophilous
   search behaviors by crossing social boundaries. We find support for
   these arguments in a network field experiment consisting of 381
   unfolding search chains in a large multinational professional services
   firm. The framework helps explain employees' unequal access to the
   knowledge they seek, a poorly understood yet important type of
   organizational inequity in an information economy.

   research-active life scientists. We analyzed a random sample of 3,114
   research-active life scientists from 314 U.S. institutions over a
   25-year period and find that the availability of BITNET on a scientist's
   campus has a positive effect on his or her productivity and
   collaborative network. Our findings also support the hypothesis of a
   differential effect of IT across subgroups of the scientific labor
   force. Women scientists and those working at nonelite institutions
   benefit more from the availability of IT in terms of overall research
   output and an increase in the number of new coauthors they work with
   than do men or individuals at elite institutions. These results suggest
   that IT is an equalizing force, providing a greater boost to
   productivity and more collaboration opportunities for scientists who are
   more marginally positioned in academe.

AB Young male CEOs appear to be combative: they are 4% more likely to be
   acquisitive and, having initiated an acquisition, they are over 20% more
   likely to withdraw an offer. Furthermore, a young target male CEO is 2%
   more likely to force a bidder to resort to a tender offer. We argue that
   this combative nature is a result of testosterone levels that are higher
   in young males. Testosterone, a hormone associated with male dominance
   seeking, has been shown to influence prospects for a cooperative outcome
   of the ultimatum game. Specifically, high-testosterone responders tend
   to reject low offers even though this is against their interest. It has
   been argued that this is consistent with a low offer being seen as
   dominance seeking. The acts of attempting or resisting an acquisition
   can be viewed as striving to achieve dominance. We argue that the
   evidence reported in this paper is consistent with the presence of a
   significant hormone effect in mergers and acquisitions.

AB We analyze the optimal strategy of a high-quality incumbent that faces a
   low-quality ad-sponsored competitor. In addition to competing through
   adjustments of tactical variables such as price or the number of ads a
   product carries, we allow the incumbent to consider changes in its
   business model. We consider four alternative business models: a
   subscription-based model; an ad-sponsored model; a mixed model in which
   the incumbent offers a product that is both subscription based and ad
   sponsored; and a dual model in which the incumbent offers two products,
   one based on the ad-sponsored model and the other based on the mixed
   business model. We show that the optimal response to an ad-sponsored
   rival often entails business model reconfigurations. We also find that
   when there is an ad-sponsored entrant, the incumbent is more likely to
   prefer to compete through the subscription-based or the ad-sponsored
   model, rather than the mixed or the dual model, because of
   cannibalization and endogenous vertical differentiation concerns. We
   discuss how our study helps improve our understanding of notions of

AB We propose a new investment strategy employing "factor funds" to

   diversification. Our approach is motivated by the increasing evidence
   that size (SMB), book-to-market (HML), and momentum (MOM) factors, along
   with the market factor, adequately describe international stock returns,
   and by the direct link between investors' portfolio choice problems and
   international asset pricing theories and tests. Using data from 10
   developed countries during the period 1981-2008, we show that the
   "augmented" optimal portfolio involving local factor funds substantially
   outperforms the "benchmark" optimal portfolio comprising country market
   indices only as measured by their portfolio Sharpe ratios. This strongly
   rejects the intersection hypothesis which posits that the local factor
   funds do not span investment opportunities beyond what country market
   indices do. Among the three classes of factor funds, HML funds
   contribute most to the efficiency gains. In addition, the local version
   of factor funds outperforms the global factor funds. The added gains
   from local factor diversification are significant for both in-sample and
   out-of-sample periods, and for a realistic range of additional
   investment costs for factor funds, and remain robust over time.

AB This paper studies how firms reorganize following diversification,
   proposing that firms use outsourcing, or vertical disintegration, to
   manage diseconomies of scope. We also consider the origins of scope
   diseconomies, showing how different underlying mechanisms generate
   contrasting predictions about the link between within-firm task
   heterogeneity and the incentive to outsource following diversification.
   We test these propositions using microdata on taxicab and limousine
   fleets from the Economic Census. The results show that taxicab firms
   outsource, by shifting the composition of their fleets toward
   owner-operator drivers, when they diversify into the limousine business.
   The magnitude of the shift toward driver ownership is larger in less
   urban markets, where the tasks performed by taxicab and limousine
   drivers are more similar. These findings suggest that (1) firms use
   outsourcing to manage diseconomies of scope at a particular point in the
   value chain and (2) interagent conflicts can be an important source of
   scope diseconomies.

AB Firms that rely on functioning mission-critical equipment for their
   businesses cannot afford significant operational downtime due to system
   disruptions. To minimize the impact of disruptions, a proper incentive
   mechanism has to be in place so that the suppliers provide prompt
   restoration and recovery services to the customer. A widely adopted
   incentive mechanism is performance-based contracting (PBC), in which
   suppliers receive compensation based on realized system uptime. A key
   obstacle is that disruptions occur infrequently, making it very
   expensive for a supplier to commit the necessary resources for recovery
   because they will be idle most of the time. In this paper, we show that
   designing a successful PBC creates nontrivial challenges that are unique
   to this environment. Namely, because of the infrequent and random nature
   of disruptions, a seemingly innocuous choice of performance measures
   used in contracts may create unexpected incentives, resulting in
   counterintuitive optimal behavior. We compare the efficiencies of two
   widely used contracts, one based on sample-average downtime and the
   other based on cumulative downtime, and identify the supplier's ability
   to influence the frequency of disruptions as an important factor in
   determining which contract performs better. We also show that
   implementing PBC may create high agency cost when equipment is very
   reliable. This counterintuitive situation arises because the realized
   downtimes from which the customer might intuit about the supplier's
   capacity investment are highly uncertain when there are not many samples
   of downtimes, i.e., when disruptions occur rarely.

AB This paper studies a three-sided moral hazard problem with one agent
   exerting up-front effort and two agents exerting ongoing effort in a
   continuous-time model. The agents' efforts jointly affect the
   probability of survival and thus the expected cash flow of the project.
   In the optimal contract, the timing of payments reflects the timing of
   effort: payments for up-front effort precede payments for ongoing
   effort. Several patterns are possible for the cash allocation between
   the two agents with ongoing effort. In one case, where the two agents
   face equally severe moral hazard, they share the cash flow equally at
   each point of time. In another case, where the two agents have different
   severities of moral hazard, their payments are sequential. In a more
   general case, the two agents with ongoing effort first receive the cash
   flow alternately with an increasing frequency of switches and then
   divide the cash flow at each point of time. This study provides a
   framework for understanding a broad set of business-contracting issues.
   The characteristics suggested in the optimal contract help us analyze
   the causes of business failure such as the recent debacle of

   effort are diverted away from academic knowledge production. This is a
   form of brain drain on the not-for-profit research sector that may
   reduce knowledge accumulation and adversely impact long-run economic
   growth. In this paper, we examine the economic significance of the brain
   drain phenomenon using scientist-level panel data. We identify life
   scientists who start or join for-profit firms using information from the
   Small Business Innovation Research program and analyze the research
   performance of these scientists relative to a control group of randomly
   selected research peers. Combining our statistical results with data on
   the number of university spin-offs in the United States from 1994 to

AB We study a supply chain with one supplier and many retailers that face
   exogenous end-customer demands. The supplier and the retailers all try
   to minimize their own inventory-related costs. In contrast to the
   retailers' newsvendor-type ordering behavior (under which retailers may
   place orders freely in every period), we propose two scheduled ordering
   policies: the scheduled balanced ordering policy (SBOP) and the
   scheduled synchronized ordering policy (SSOP). Under both the SBOP and
   SSOP, retailers are allowed to order freely only in one period of an
   ordering cycle, and receive fixed shipments in other periods. Retailers
   take turns to order freely under the SBOP, while under the SSOP all
   retailers order freely in the same period. With the average supply chain
   cost per period as the performance measure, we identify mathematical
   conditions under which scheduled ordering policies outperform the
   newsvendor-type ordering. Through a large-scale numerical study, we find
   that scheduled ordering policies are most effective when (i) the
   supplier's holding and expediting costs are high and the retailer's
   backorder cost is small, (ii) the end-customer demand variance and
   correlation are high, and (iii) the supplier's capacity is high. In
   addition, we observe that the behavior of the SSOP often complements
   that of the SBOP. Whereas the SBOP is better than SSOP when the
   supplier's capacity is low and when the end-customer demand correlation
   level is high, the SSOP is better when the opposite conditions prevail.

AB We study a capacity sizing problem in a service system that is modeled
   as a single-class queue with multiple servers and where customers may
   renege while waiting for service. A salient feature of the model is that
   the mean arrival rate of work is random (in practice this is a typical
   consequence of forecasting errors). The paper elucidates the impact of
   uncertainty on the nature of capacity prescriptions, and relates these
   to well established rules-of-thumb such as the square-root safety
   staffing principle. We establish a simple and intuitive relationship
   between the incoming load (measured in Erlangs) and the extent of
   uncertainty in arrival rates (measured via the coefficient of variation)
   that characterizes the extent to which uncertainty dominates stochastic
   variability or vice versa. In the former case it is shown that
   traditional square-root safety staffing logic is no longer valid, yet
   simple capacity prescriptions derived via a suitable newsvendor problem
   are surprisingly accurate.

   Kariv. 2005. An experimental test of observational learning under
   imperfect information. Econom. Theory 26(3) 677-699). The experiments
   are designed so that both pieces of information-action and advice-are
   equally informative (in fact, identical) in equilibrium. Despite the
   informational equivalence of advice and actions, we find that subjects
   in a laboratory social-learning situation appear to be more willing to
   follow the advice given to them by their predecessor than to copy their
   action, and that the presence of advice increases subjects' welfare.

AB It has become widely accepted that information technology (IT) has had a
   profound influence on market transactions, with lower search costs for
   buyers often considered the key to lower prices and higher consumer
   welfare. However, sellers also use online channels to search for buyers
   whose product preferences and valuations match the sellers' offerings,
   and limited research has examined the impact of IT on sellers' search
   strategies or associated market outcomes. In this study, we investigate
   how market characteristics, the length of time the seller searches the
   auction marketplace for a buyer, and seller search in other websites
   influence the final sale price in online auctions. The online auction
   market for used vehicles provides a valuable opportunity to observe
   search processes of sellers, as the unique vehicle identification number
   associated with each vehicle enables the tracking of an individual item
   across both subsequent auctions and across other websites. We find that
   the market characteristics, duration of search, and search in other
   websites are each associated with a higher final sale price. Our
   findings highlight the importance of examining both buyer and seller
   search behaviors to further our understanding of the impacts of IT on
   market outcomes and efficiency.

   corporate culture-in the sense of shared beliefs and values-in order to
   study the effects of "culture clash" in mergers and acquisitions. I
   first use a simple analytical framework to show that shared beliefs lead
   to more delegation, less monitoring, higher utility (or satisfaction),
   higher execution effort (or motivation), faster coordination, less
   influence activities, and more communication, but also to less
   experimentation and less information collection. When two firms that are
   each internally homogeneous but different from each other merge, the
   above results translate to specific predictions about how the change in
   homogeneity will affect firm behavior. This paper's predictions can also
   serve more in general as a test for the theory of culture as shared

AB Many retailers designate one national brand manufacturer in each product
   category as a "category captain" to help manage the entire category. A
   category captain may perform demand-enhancing services such as better
   shelf arrangements, shelf-space management, and design and management of
   in-store displays. In this paper, we examine when and why a retailer may
   engage one manufacturer exclusively as a category captain to provide
   such service and the implications. We find that demand substitutability
   of competing brands gives rise to a service efficiency effect-service
   that expands the category is more effective in increasing a
   manufacturer's sales and margin than service that shifts demand from a
   rival's brand. We show that the service efficiency effect may motivate a
   category captain to provide a service that benefits all brands in the
   category even though doing so is more costly. We further show that, in
   categories that are less price competitive, there is higher competition
   between manufacturers to become the category captain. Consequently, a
   retailer may obtain better service by using a category captain than by
   engaging both manufacturers simultaneously. Our findings may help
   explain why a retailer may rely on a category captain despite concerns
   regarding opportunism and why there is limited empirical evidence of
   harm to rival manufacturers.

AB Online personalization services belong to a class of economic goods with
   a "no free disposal" (NFD) property where consumers do not always prefer
   more services to less because of the privacy concerns. These concerns
   arise from the revelation of information necessary for the provision of
   personalization services. We examine vendor strategies in a market where
   consumers have heterogeneous concerns about privacy. In successive
   generalizations, we allow the vendor to offer a fixed level of
   personalization, variable levels of personalization, and monetary
   transfers (coupons) to the consumers that depend on the level of
   personalization chosen. We show that a vendor offering a fixed level of
   personalization does not offer a coupon unless his marginal value of
   information (MVI) is sufficiently high, and even when personalization is
   costless, the vendor does not cover the market. Under a fixed services
   offering, the vendor serves the same market with or without couponing.
   Next, we demonstrate that in the absence of couponing, the vendor's
   optimal variable personalization services contract maximizes surplus for
   all heterogeneous consumers, which is in contrast to standard results
   from monopolistic screening. When the vendor can offer coupons that vary
   according to personalization levels, the optimal contract is not fully
   revealing unless his MVI is high and he will not offer coupons when this
   MVI is low. However, a vendor with a moderate MVI (between certain
   thresholds) offers a bunched contract, wherein consumers with low
   privacy concerns receive a variable services-coupon contract, those with
   moderate privacy concerns receive a fixed services-coupon contract, and
   those with high privacy concerns do not participate in the market. The
   coupon value is decreasing in privacy sensitivity of consumers.

AB In this paper, we consider a class of two-stage stochastic optimization
   problems arising in the protection of vital arcs in a critical path
   network. A project is completed after a series of dependent tasks are
   all finished. We analyze a problem in which task finishing times are
   uncertain but can be insured a priori to mitigate potential delays. A
   decision maker must trade off costs incurred in insuring arcs with
   expected penalties associated with late project completion times, where
   lateness penalties are assumed to be lower semicontinuous nondecreasing
   functions of completion time. We provide decomposition strategies to
   solve this problem with respect to either convex or nonconvex penalty
   functions. In particular, for the nonconvex penalty case, we employ the
   reformulation-linearization technique to make the problem amenable to
   solution via Benders decomposition. We also consider a
   chance-constrained version of this problem, in which the probability of
   completing a project on time is sufficiently large. We demonstrate the
   computational efficacy of our approach by testing a set of size-
   and-complexity diversified problems, using the sample average
   approximation method to guide our scenario generation.

AB This study develops and estimates a model to empirically identify two
   behavioral effects (namely consumption flexibility and state dependence)
   that may underlie temporal and horizontal assortment choice, using
   scanner panel data where consumption information is unavailable. The
   proposed approach permits a consumer's consumption utility to be
   dependent on previous consumptions, thus capturing state dependence both
   across purchase occasions and within horizontal assortments. Moreover,
   consumers' purchase and consumption decisions are modeled at two
   distinctive and sequentially related stages, which allows for
   incorporating the effect of consumption flexibility. The model is
   estimated on scanner panel data of yogurt purchase. It is found that the
   two captured effects provide strong empirical support with face validity
   for the temporal and horizontal assortment choice patterns observed in
   the data. The behavioral insights derived from estimating the proposed
   model can also be translated into significant managerial implications.

   instrument in the portfolio at the horizon conditional on the drawn risk
   factors. Practitioners may perceive the computational burden of such
   nested schemes to be unacceptable and adopt a variety of second-best
   pricing techniques to avoid the inner simulation. In this paper, we
   question whether such short cuts are necessary. We show that a
   relatively small number of trials in the inner step can yield accurate
   estimates, and we analyze how a fixed computational budget may be
   allocated to the inner and the outer step to minimize the mean square
   error of the resultant estimator. Finally, we introduce a jackknife

AB This paper studies two fundamentally distinct approaches to opening a
   technology platform and their different impacts on innovation. One
   approach is to grant access to a platform and thereby open up markets
   for complementary components around the platform. Another approach is to
   give up control over the platform itself. Using data on 21 handheld
   computing systems (1990-2004), I find that granting greater levels of
   access to independent hardware developer firms produces up to a fivefold
   acceleration in the rate of new handheld device development, depending
   on the precise degree of access and how this policy was implemented.
   Where operating system platform owners went further to give up control
   (beyond just granting access to their platforms) the incremental effect
   on new device development was still positive but an order of magnitude
   smaller. The evidence from the industry and theoretical arguments both
   suggest that distinct economic mechanisms were set in motion by these
   two approaches to opening.

   these technologies? Does consumers' technology usage have an effect on
   the sales to them or their purchasing patterns? This paper empirically
   measures consumers' usage of website technologies by analyzing server
   log data. We match technology usage data to sales data, controlling for
   consumers' historical purchasing behavior. Our unique data set allows us
   to reveal the relationship between technology usage and online sales.
   Our analyses show that consumers' information technology usage has a
   significant effect on the sales to them, but this effect varies for
   different technologies and across different products. In particular, the
   use of directed search has a positive effect on the sales of promoted
   products, whereas it has a negative effect on the sales of nonpromoted
   products. In contrast, the use of a recommendation system has a positive
   effect on the sales of both promoted and nonpromoted products.
   Surprisingly, the use of nondirected search has an insignificant effect
   on online sales.

AB We analyze the problem of an investor who needs to unwind a portfolio in
   the face of recurring and uncertain liquidity needs, with a model that
   accounts for both permanent and temporary price impact of trading. We
   first show that a risk-neutral investor who myopically deleverages his
   position to meet an immediate need for cash always prefers to sell more
   liquid assets. If the investor faces the possibility of a downstream
   shock, however, the solution differs in several important ways. If the
   ensuing shock is sufficiently large, the nonmyopic investor unwinds
   positions more than immediately necessary and, all else being equal,
   prefers to retain more of the assets with low temporary price impact in
   order to hedge against possible distress. More generally, optimal
   liquidation involves selling strictly more of the assets with a lower
   ratio of permanent to temporary impact, even if these assets are
   relatively illiquid. The results suggest that properly accounting for
   the possibility of future shocks should play a role in managing large

   this paper we emphasize instead the role of complementary knowledge
   stocks and knowledge dynamics, which have received surprisingly limited
   attention relative to social capital as forces behind the formation and
   dynamics of innovation networks. To marshal evidence in this regard, we
   design a simple model of partner selection in which firms ally for the
   purpose of learning and innovating, and in doing so create an industry
   network. We abstract completely from network-based structural and
   strategic motives for partner selection and focus instead on the idea
   that firms' knowledge bases must "fit" for joint learning and innovation
   to be possible, and thus for an alliance to be feasible. The striking
   result is that, despite containing no social capital considerations,
   this simple model replicates the firm conduct, network structure, and
   contingent effects of network position on performance observed and
   discussed in the empirical literature.

AB In the health-care domain, diagnostic service centers provide advice to
   patients over the phone about what the most appropriate course of action
   is based on their symptoms. Managers of such centers must strike a
   balance between accuracy of advice, callers' waiting time, and staffing
   costs by setting the appropriate capacity (staffing) and service depth.
   We model this problem as a multiple-server queueing system, with the
   servers performing a sequential testing process and the customers
   deciding whether or not to use the service, based on their expectation
   of accuracy and congestion. We find the dual concerns of accuracy and
   congestion lead to a counterintuitive impact of capacity: Increasing
   capacity might increase congestion. In addition, (i) patient population
   size is an important driver in management decisions, not only in
   staffing but also in accuracy of advice; (ii) increasing asymmetry in
   error costs may not increase asymmetry in the corresponding error rates;
   and (iii) the error costs for the two major stakeholders-the service
   manager and the patient-may impact the optimal staffing level in
   different ways. Finally, we highlight the relevance of our model and
   results to challenges in practice elicited during interviews with
   current clinical researchers and practitioners.

AB We propose a behavioral theory to predict actual ordering behavior in
   multilocation inventory systems. The theory rests on a well-known
   stylized fact of human behavior: people's preferences are reference
   dependent. We incorporate reference dependence into the newsvendor
   framework by assuming that there are psychological costs of leftovers
   and stockouts. We also hypothesize that the psychological aversion to
   leftovers is greater than the disutility for stockouts. We then
   experimentally test the proposed theory in both the centralized and
   decentralized inventory structures using subjects motivated by
   substantial financial incentives. Consistent with the proposed theory,
   actual orders exhibit the so-called "pull-to-center" bias and the degree
   of bias is greater in the high-profit margin than in the low-profit
   margin condition. These systematic biases are shown to eliminate the
   risk-pooling benefit when the demands across store locations are
   strongly correlated. Because the proposed model nests the standard
   inventory and ex post inventory error minimization theories as special
   cases, one can systematically evaluate the predictive power of each
   alternative using the generalized likelihood principle. We structurally
   estimate all three theories using the experimental data, and the
   estimation results strongly suggest that the proposed behavioral theory
   captures actual orders and profits better. We also conduct two
   experiments to validate the behavioral model by manipulating the
   relative salience of the psychological costs of leftovers versus that of
   stockouts to alleviate the pull-to-center bias.

AB Faced with the sustained problem of piracy that costs nearly $40 billion
   in annual revenue losses, the software industry has adopted a number of
   technical, legal, and economic strategies to curb piracy and stem the
   resulting losses. Our work complements and contributes to the existing
   literature by exploring the possible effect of another economic
   lever-product bundling-on the relationship governing piracy and seller
   profits. The traditional economic rationale of demand pooling from
   bundling that enables sellers to extract higher surplus and its
   particular attractiveness for information goods with negligible marginal
   and bundling costs carry over to our analysis. However, the presence of
   piracy injects several new facets to our analysis. Bundling creates a
   shared level of piracy of disparate products, and under certain
   conditions to the detriment of one of the products. We argue that by
   construction of the copyright laws, the act of bundling itself can have
   a deterrence effect. This deterrence effect, along with shared piracy of
   products and demand pooling are ingredients that together dictate the
   overall piracy, pricing, profit, and welfare outcomes. Our analysis
   reveals several interesting insights. Bundling can be profitable even
   when the very act of bundling increases the piracy level of one of the
   products in the bundle. Termed phantom piracy, this represents a
   situation where sellers trade off higher piracy for one product in favor
   of lower piracy for the other product while deriving overall higher
   profits. Extensive simulation analysis shows that the region of phantom
   piracy is vastly expanded when additional products are introduced to the
   bundle. Conversely, under certain conditions, a profit maximizing seller
   opts not to bundle even when bundling can serve to lower the overall
   level of piracy. Price discounts that are typically offered by bundling
   are sharply deepened when piracy enters the equation. When piracy is a
   phenomenon to contend with, product bundling always increases consumer
   surplus even in scenarios where the seller may not realize higher
   profits. Unlike other forms of price discrimination that are often
   viewed by consumers with a jaundiced eye as they attempt to extract
   additional surplus from the consumers, product bundling in the software
   context can be a win-win scenario for both the buyers and the sellers.

AB We develop a framework for the optimal bundling problem of a

   valuations that are random draws from a distribution with heavy tails.
   We show that in the Vickrey auction setting, the buyers prefer separate
   provision of the goods to any bundles. We also provide a complete
   characterization of the optimal bundling strategies for a monopolist
   producer, who provides goods for profit-maximizing prices. For products
   with low marginal costs, the seller's optimal strategy is to provide
   goods separately when consumers' valuations are heavy-tailed and in a
   single bundle when valuations are thin-tailed. These conclusions are
   reversed for goods with high marginal costs. For simplicity, we use a
   specific class of independent and identically distributed random
   variables, but our results can be generalized to include dependence,
   skewness, and the case of nonidentical one-dimensional distributions.

   empirical purposes, we can measure discount functions without requiring
   any measurement of or assumption about utility. We can quantitatively
   measure time inconsistencies and simplify their qualitative tests. TTO
   sequences can be administered and analyzed very easily, using only
   pencil and paper. For theoretical purposes, we use TTO sequences to
   axiomatize (quasi-) hyperbolic discount functions. We demonstrate the
   feasibility of measuring TTO sequences in an experiment, in which we
   tested the axiomatizations. Our findings suggest rejections of several
   currently popular discount functions and call for the development of new
   ones. It is especially desirable that such discount functions can

AB The mean-variance approach is an influential theory of decision under

   first-order stochastic dominance not commonly observed in the data. This
   paper proposes a new model in the spirit of the classical mean-variance
   approach without violations of stochastic dominance. The proposed model
   represents preferences by a functional U(L) - rho.gamma (L), where U(L)
   denotes the expected utility of lottery L, rho is an element of[-1, 1]
   is a subjective constant, and gamma(L) is the mean absolute (utility)
   semideviation of lottery L. The model comprises a linear trade-off
   between expected utility and utility dispersion. The model can
   accommodate several behavioral regularities such as the Allais paradox
   and switching behavior in Samuelson's example.

   its importance, there has been little empirical research on the timing
   of acquisition decisions in high-technology environments. Should
   organizations wait until more information is available about the target
   and its markets so that a better valuation can be obtained? Or should
   the target be acquired early to lower acquisition cost and gain early
   access to key technologies? Applying an event study methodology to
   technology acquisitions in the telecommunications industry from 1995 to
   2001, we find evidence that supports acquiring early in the face of
   uncertainty. Our analytical model and empirical analysis uncover two
   characteristics of young targets that drive benefits from early
   acquisitions-flexible growth options that provide greater opportunities
   for synergistic fit, and greater valuation uncertainty that leads to
   lower prices. However, the negative effect of target age on acquirer
   value is partially mitigated if the target has recent patents or is
   privately held. In addition, the probability of acquisition is higher
   for targets that have signals of higher quality, and lower for targets
   that have superior access to capital and resources.

AB The Robinson-Patman Act (RP), an antitrust statute aimed at protecting

   avoid costly penalties under RP, managers take a variety of precautions
   when pricing to retailers and wholesalers. But how likely is a court to
   find a defendant guilty of violating the RP? We find that this
   likelihood has dropped drastically as a result of recent Supreme Court
   rulings from more than 1 in 3 before 1993 to less than 1 in 20 for the
   period 2006-2010. The analysis also points to an increased success of
   the no harm to competition defense, which reflects the view that the
   courts have raised the hurdle for plaintiffs to establish competitive
   harm. Finally, our results indicate that smaller plaintiffs over time
   have fared worse than larger ones, a trend that challenges the notion
   that RP protects small businesses.

AB Economists studying innovation and technological change have made
   significant progress toward understanding firms' profit incentives as
   drivers of innovation. However, innovative performance in firms should
   also depend heavily on the pecuniary and nonpecuniary motives of the
   employees actually working in research and development. Using data on
   more than 1,700 Ph.D. scientists and engineers, we examine the
   relationships between individuals' motives (e. g., desire for
   intellectual challenge, income, or responsibility) and their innovative
   performance. We find that motives matter, but different motives have
   very different effects: Motives regarding intellectual challenge,
   independence, and money have a strong positive relationship with
   innovative output, whereas motives regarding job security and
   responsibility tend to have a negative relationship. We also explore
   possible mechanisms underlying the observed relationships between
   motives and performance. Although hours worked (quantity of effort) have
   a strong positive effect on performance, motives appear to affect
   innovative performance primarily via other dimensions of effort
   (character of effort). Finally, we find some evidence that the role of
   motives differs in upstream research versus downstream development.

AB This paper examines an integrated decision-making process regarding
   pricing for uncertain demand and sourcing from uncertain supply, which
   are often studied separately in the literature. Our analysis of the
   integrated system suggests that the base stock list price policy fails
   to achieve optimality even under deterministic demand. Instead, the
   optimal policy is characterized by two critical values: a reorder point
   and a target safety stock. Under this policy, a positive order is issued
   if and only if the inventory level is below the reorder point. When this
   happens, the optimal order and price are coordinated to achieve a
   constant target safety stock, which aims at hedging the demand
   uncertainty. We further investigate the profit improvement obtained from
   deploying dynamic pricing, as opposed to static pricing. Our results
   indicate that either supply limit or supply uncertainty may induce a
   significant benefit from dynamic pricing, and the compound effect of
   supply limit and uncertainty can be much more pronounced than the
   individual effects. Whether or not the supply capacity is limited has a
   major implication on the value of dynamic pricing. Under unlimited
   supply, dynamic pricing is more valuable when procurement cost is high
   or when demand is more sensitive to price. With limited supply, however,
   the capacity restriction tends to be relaxed, reducing the value of
   dynamic pricing.

AB We analyze a revenue management problem in which a seller endowed with
   an initial inventory operates a selling with binding reservations
   scheme. Upon arrival, each consumer, trying to maximize his own utility,
   must decide either to buy at the full price and get the item immediately
   or to place a nonwithdrawable reservation at a discount price and wait
   until the end of the sales season where the leftover units are allocated
   according to first-come-first-serve priority. We prove the existence of
   an equilibrium consumer's strategy in this game and develop a simple and
   accurate asymptotic approximation for it. Through an extensive numerical
   study, we find that our proposed mechanism delivers higher revenues than
   the markdown practice with a preannounced fixed discount. The benefit is
   more emphasized when the seller is more patient than the consumers and
   (1) the ratio between the number of units put up for sale and the
   expected demand is moderate and/or (2) the heterogeneity of the
   consumers' valuations is moderate to high. In our numerical experiments,
   the revenue gap can reach more than 12%, which is quite significant for
   retail businesses that typically operate with narrow margins.

AB We consider a seller who owns two capacity-constrained resources and
   markets two products (components) corresponding to these resources as
   well as a bundle comprising the two components. In an environment where
   all customers agree that one of the two components is of higher quality
   than the other and that the bundle is of the highest quality, we derive
   the seller's optimal bundling strategy. We demonstrate that the optimal
   solution depends on the absolute and relative availabilities of the two
   resources as well as upon the extent of subadditivity of the quality of
   the products. The possible strategies that can arise as equilibrium
   behavior include a pure components strategy, a partial-or full-spectrum
   mixed bundling strategy, and a pure bundling strategy, where the latter
   strategy is optimal when capacities are unconstrained. These conclusions
   are contrary to findings in the prior literature on bundling that
   demonstrated the unambiguous dominance of the full-spectrum mixed
   bundling strategy. Thus, our work expands the frontier of bundling to an
   environment with vertically differentiated components and limited
   resources. We also explore how the bundling strategies change as we
   introduce an element of horizontal differentiation wherein different

AB We consider a dynamic inventory (production) model with general convex
   order (production) costs and excess demand that can be accepted or
   refused by the firm. Excess demand that is accepted is backlogged and
   results in a backlog cost whereas demand that is refused results in a
   lost sales charge. Endogenizing the sales decision is appropriate in the
   presence of general convex order costs so that the firm is not forced to
   backlog a unit whose subsequent satisfaction would reduce total profits.
   In each period, the firm must determine the optimal order and sales
   strategy. We show that the optimal policy is characterized by an optimal
   buy-up-to level that increases with the initial inventory level and an
   order quantity that decreases with the initial inventory level. More
   importantly, we show the optimal sales strategy is characterized by a
   critical threshold, a backlog limit, that dictates when to stop selling.
   This threshold is independent of the initial inventory level and the
   amount purchased. We investigate various properties of this new policy.
   As demand stochastically increases, the amount purchased increases but
   the amount backlogged decreases, reflecting a shift in the way excess
   demand is managed. We develop two regularity conditions, one that
   ensures some backlogs are allowed in each period, and another that
   ensures the amount backlogged is nondecreasing in the length of the
   planning horizon. We illustrate the buy-up-to levels in our model are
   bounded above by buy-up-to levels from the pure lost sales and pure
   backlogging models. We explore additional extensions using numerical
   experiments.

   The algorithm uses a composite linear objective function and finds all
   the desired points in a finite number of steps by changing the weights
   of the objective functions in a systematic way. We develop further
   variations of the algorithm to improve its computational performance and
   demonstrate our algorithm's performance on multiobjective assignment,

AB This paper presents a case study of the impact of manufacturing offshore
   on technology competitiveness in the optoelectronics industry. It
   examines a critical design/facility location decision being faced by
   optoelectronic component manufacturers. This paper uses a combination of
   simulation modeling and empirical data to demonstrate the economic
   constraints facing these firms. The results show that production
   location changes the relative production economics of the two competing
   designs-one emerging, one prevailing-that are currently perfect
   substitutes for each other on the telecom market, but not necessarily
   perfect substitutes in other markets in the long term. Specifically, if
   optoelectronic component firms shift production from the United States
   to countries in developing East Asia, the emerging designs that were
   developed in the United States no longer pay. Production characteristics
   are different abroad, and the prevailing design can be more cost
   effective in developing country production environments. The emerging
   designs, however, have performance characteristics that may be valuable
   in the long term to the larger computing market and to pushing forward
   Moore's law. This paper concludes by exploring the dilemma this creates
   for the optoelectronic component manufacturers and recommending a
   framework based on which the results may be generalized to other
   industries.

AB Cadaveric liver transplantation is the only viable therapy for end-stage
   liver disease patients without a living donor. However, this type of
   transplantation is hindered in the United States by donor scarcity and
   rapid viability decay. Given these difficulties, the current U. S. liver
   allocation policy balances allocation likelihood and geographic
   proximity by allocating cadaveric livers hierarchically. We consider the
   problem of maximizing the efficiency of intraregional transplants
   through the redesign of liver allocation regions. We formulate the
   problem as a set partitioning problem that clusters organ procurement
   organizations into regions. We develop an estimate of viability-adjusted
   intraregional transplants to capture the trade-off between large and
   small regions. We utilize branch and price because the set partitioning
   formulation includes too many potential regions to handle explicitly. We
   formulate the pricing problem as a mixed-integer program and design a
   geographic-decomposition heuristic to generate promising columns
   quickly. Because the optimal solution depends on the design of
   geographic decomposition, we develop an iterative procedure that
   integrates branch and price with local search to alleviate this
   dependency. Finally, we present computational studies that show the
   benefit of region redesign and the efficacy of our solution approach.
   Our carefully calibrated test instances can be solved within a
   reasonable amount of time, and the resulting region designs yield a
   noticeable improvement over the current configuration.

AB For many high-tech and Internet-related products, utility to consumers
   depends in part on the size of the user base, a phenomenon called
   network externality. A firm with a portfolio of these and other
   products-that are often asymmetric in their degree of network
   externality or marginal cost-may have to look beyond the traditional
   strategies of pure components, pure bundling, and mixed bundling. One
   such strategic alternative in a two-product case would be a so-called
   mixed bundling-1 under which the bundle and product 1 are offered, but
   the other product can only be purchased in a bundled form. The purpose
   of this study is to compare and contrast the impact of such asymmetry or
   symmetry in (direct) network externality and cost on the choice of
   bundling strategies. We model a monopolist firm that has a product in
   each of two categories and faces heterogeneous consumers. Results
   suggest that pure bundling is more profitable when both products have
   low marginal costs or high network externality whereas pure components
   or mixed bundling-1 is more profitable when the products diverge in
   their costs and network externality (e. g., only one product has network
   externality). Traditional mixed bundling is optimal in other instances.

AB The competition between Island and Nasdaq at the beginning of the
   century offers a natural laboratory to study competition between and
   within trading platforms and its consequences for liquidity supply. Our
   empirical strategy takes advantage of the difference between the pricing
   grids used on Island and Nasdaq, as well as of the decline in the Nasdaq
   tick. Using the finer grid prevailing on their market, Island limit
   order traders undercut Nasdaq quotes, much more than they undercut one
   another. The drop in the Nasdaq tick size triggered a drop in Island
   spreads, despite the Island tick already being very thin before Nasdaq
   decimalization. We also estimate a structural model of liquidity supply
   and find that Island limit order traders earned rents before Nasdaq
   decimalization. Our results suggest that perfect competition cannot be
   taken for granted, even on transparent open limit order books with a
   very thin pricing grid.

   three key variations during the period from March 1999 to March 2001.
   First, return volatility increased together with the rising Nasdaq index
   level, even though the two tend to move in opposite directions. Second,
   although the market price of diffusion return risk averages around 1.82
   over the whole sample, the estimates reached negative territory at the
   end of 1999. The estimates reverted back to highly positive values after
   the collapse of the Nasdaq market. Third, the market price of jump risk
   increased with the rising Nasdaq valuation, and this increase in market
   price coincided with an increased imbalance in open interest between put

AB In many services, the quality or value provided by the service increases
   with the time the service provider spends with the customer. However,
   longer service times also result in longer waits for customers. We term
   such services, in which the interaction between quality and speed is
   critical, as customer-intensive services. In a queueing framework, we
   parameterize the degree of customer intensity of the service. The
   service speed chosen by the service provider affects the quality of the
   service through its customer intensity. Customers queue for the service
   based on service quality, delay costs, and price. We study how a service
   provider facing such customers makes the optimal "quality-speed
   trade-off." Our results demonstrate that the customer intensity of the
   service is a critical driver of equilibrium price, service speed,
   demand, congestion in queues, and service provider revenues. Customer
   intensity leads to outcomes very different from those of traditional
   models of service rate competition. For instance, as the number of
   competing servers increases, the price increases, and the servers become
   slower.

   This has heightened consumers' privacy concerns, leading governments to

   advertisers' ability to collect data on Web users in order to target ad

AB When firms recruit inventors, they acquire not only the use of their
   skills but also enhanced access to their stock of ideas. But do hiring
   firms actually increase their use of new recruits' prior inventions? Our
   estimates suggest they do, quite significantly in fact, by approximately
   219% on average. However, this does not necessarily reflect widespread
   "learning by hiring." In fact, we estimate that a recruit's exploitation
   of her own prior ideas accounts for almost half of the above effect,
   with much of the diffusion to others being limited to the recruit's
   immediate collaborative network. Furthermore, although one might expect
   the recruit's role to diminish rapidly as her tacit knowledge diffuses
   across her new firm, our estimates indicate that her importance is
   surprisingly persistent over time. We base these findings on an
   empirical strategy that exploits the variation over time in hiring
   firms' citations to the recruits' premove patents. Specifically, we
   employ a difference-indifferences approach to compare premove versus
   postmove citation rates for the recruits' prior patents and
   corresponding matched-pair control patents. Our methodology has three
   benefits compared to previous studies that also examine the link between
   labor mobility and knowledge flow: (1) it does not suffer from the
   upward bias inherent in the conventional cross-sectional comparison, (2)
   it generates results that are robust to a more stringently matched
   control sample, and (3) it enables a temporal examination of knowledge
   flow patterns.

AB For fossil fuel power plants to be built in the future, carbon capture
   and storage (CCS) technologies offer the potential for significant
   reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We examine the break-even
   value for CCS adoptions, that is, the critical value in the charge for
   CO2 emissions that would justify investment in CCS capabilities. Our
   analysis takes explicitly into account that the supply of electricity at
   the wholesale level (generation) is organized competitively in some U.
   S. jurisdictions, whereas in others a regulated utility provides
   integrated generation and distribution services. For either market
   structure, we find that emissions charges near $30 per tonne of CO2
   would be the break-even value for adopting CCS capabilities at new
   coal-fired power plants. The corresponding break-even values for natural
   gas plants are substantially higher, near $60 per tonne. Our break-even
   estimates serve as a basis for projecting the change in electricity
   prices once carbon emissions become costly. CCS capabilities effectively
   put an upper bound on the increase in electricity prices resulting from
   carbon regulations, and we estimate this bound to be near 30% at the
   retail level for both coal and natural gas plants. In contrast to the
   competitive power supply scenario, however, these price increases
   materialize only gradually for a regulated utility. The delay in price
   adjustments reflects that for regulated firms the basis for setting
   product prices is historical cost, rather than current cost.

AB Prior research hypothesizes managers use "real actions," including the
   reduction of discretionary expenditures, to manage earnings to meet or
   beat key benchmarks. This paper examines this hypothesis by testing how
   different types of marketing expenditures are used to boost earnings for
   a durable commodity consumer product that can be easily stockpiled by
   end consumers. Combining supermarket scanner data with firm-level
   financial data, we find evidence that differs from prior literature.
   Instead of reducing expenditures to boost earnings, soup manufacturers
   roughly double the frequency and change the mix of marketing promotions
   (price discounts, feature advertisements, and aisle displays) at the
   fiscal quarter-end when they have greater incentive to boost earnings.
   Our results confirm managers' stated willingness to sacrifice long-term
   value in order to smooth earnings and their stated preference to use
   real actions to boost earnings to meet different types of earnings
   benchmarks. We estimate that marketing actions can be used to boost
   quarterly net income by up to 5% depending on the depth and duration of
   promotion. However, there is a price to pay, with the cost in the
   following period being approximately 7.5% of quarterly net income.
   Finally, a unique aspect of the research setting allows tests of who is
   responsible for the earnings management. Although firms appear unable to
   increase the frequency of aisle display promotions in the short run,
   they can reallocate these promotions within their portfolio of brands.
   Results show firms shifting display promotions away from smaller revenue
   brands toward larger ones following periods of poor financial
   performance. This indicates the behavior is determined by parties above
   brand managers in the firm. These findings are consistent with firms
   engaging in real earnings management and suggest that effects on
   subsequent reporting periods and competitor behavior are greater than
   previously documented.

   compete with other advice sellers. In the second, advisors and their

   helps advisors sell their advice. However, competition between advisors
   in the market further exacerbates overconfidence. In a third study, we

AB A common approach to innovation, parallel search, is to identify a large
   number of opportunities and then to select a subset for further
   development, with just a few coming to fruition. One potential weakness
   with parallel search is that it permits repetition. The same, or a
   similar, idea might be generated multiple times, because parallel
   exploration processes typically operate without information about the
   ideas that have already been identified. In this paper we analyze
   repetition in five data sets comprising 1,368 opportunities and use that
   analysis to address three questions: (1) When a large number of efforts
   to generate ideas are conducted in parallel, how likely are the
   resulting ideas to be redundant? (2) How large are the opportunity
   spaces? (3) Are the unique ideas more valuable than those similar to
   many others? The answer to the first question is that although there is
   clearly some redundancy in the ideas generated by aggregating parallel
   efforts, this redundancy is quite small in absolute terms in our data,
   even for a narrowly defined domain. For the second question, we propose
   a method to extrapolate how many unique ideas would result from an
   unbounded effort by an unlimited number of comparable idea generators.
   Applying that method, and for the settings we study, the estimated total
   number of unique ideas is about one thousand for the most narrowly

   between the number of similar ideas and idea value: the ideas that are
   least similar to others are not generally the most valuable ones.

AB This paper presents a new implicit formulation for shift scheduling
   problems, using context-free grammars to model the rules for the
   composition of shifts. From the grammar, we generate an integer
   programming (IP) model having a linear programming relaxation equivalent
   to that of the classical set covering model. When solved by a
   state-of-the-art IP solver on problem instances with a small number of
   shifts, our model, the set covering formulation, and a typical implicit
   model from the literature yield comparable solution times. On instances
   with a large number of shifts, our formulation shows superior
   performance and can model a wider variety of constraints. In particular,
   multiactivity cases, which cannot be modeled by existing implicit
   formulations, can easily be handled with grammars. We present
   comparative experimental results on a large set of instances involving
   one work activity, as well as on problems dealing with up to 10 work
   activities.

AB We investigate how auctioneers set reserve prices in auctions. A
   well-established theoretical result, assuming risk neutrality of the
   seller, is that the optimal reserve price should not depend on the
   number of participating bidders. In a set of controlled laboratory
   experiments, we find that seller behavior often deviates from the
   theoretical benchmarks. We extend the existing theory to explore three
   alternative explanations for our results: risk aversion, anticipated
   regret, and probability weighting. After fitting our data to each of
   these models through parameter estimation techniques on both an
   aggregate and individual level, we find that all three models are
   consistent with some of the characteristics of our data, but that the
   regret model provides a slightly more favorable fit overall.

AB Cumulative prospect theory introduced the weighting of probabilities as
   an additional component to capture risk attitudes. However, this
   addition would be a less significant challenge to expected utility
   theory (EU) if utility curvature and probability weighting showed strong
   positive correlation. In that case the utility curvature in EU alone,
   although not properly describing risky behavior in general, would still
   capture most of the variance of individual risk aversion. This study
   provides experimental evidence that such a strong and positive
   correlation does not exist. Although most individuals exhibit concave
   utility and convex probability weighting, the two components show no
   strong positive correlation.

   based on the decision-making units' (DMUs') relative efficiencies over
   sets of feasible weights that characterize preferences for input and

   which indicate the best and worst efficiency rankings that a DMU can
   attain relative to other DMUs; (ii) dominance relations, which show what
   other DMUs a given DMU dominates in pairwise efficiency comparisons; and
   (iii) efficiency bounds, which show how much more efficient a given DMU
   can be relative to some other DMU or a subset of other DMUs. Unlike
   conventional efficiency scores, these results are insensitive to outlier
   DMUs. They also show how the DMUs' efficiency ratios relate to each
   other for all feasible weights, rather than for those weights only for
   which the data envelopment analysis (DEA) efficiency score of some DMU
   is maximized. We illustrate the usefulness of these results by
   revisiting reported DEA studies and by describing a recent case study on
   the efficiency comparison of university departments.

AB The conventional method of estimating a probability prediction model by
   maximum likelihood (MLE) is a form of maximum score estimation with
   economic meaning. Of all the probabilities that a given model might have
   produced, those obtained by MLE yield maximum in-sample betting return
   to a log utility investor. Recognition of this affinity between MLE and
   log utility begs the wider methodological question of whether different
   decision makers benefit in different degrees from different
   probabilities. Probabilities produced by MLE can be either too
   conservative or too bold relative to those found by maximizing utility
   under more risk-tolerant or risk-averse score functions. A very (not
   very) risk-averse user, who bets characteristically small (large)
   fractions of wealth based on a conservative forecast, is bound to make a
   rapidly (slowly) increasing bet as the forecast probability becomes
   progressively bolder or more distant from the market probability. The
   effect of this interaction between risk aversion and forecast is that a
   highly risk-averse user may need a much bolder forecast to obtain the
   same certainty equivalent as a more risk-tolerant investor. It follows
   more broadly that professional forecasters should anticipate how a
   client with given risk aversion expects to gain from any given forecast,
   or forecast revision, before committing resources toward making a better
   informed (but still honest) forecast.

AB This paper investigates the effect of founders' professional-education
   background on the adoption of an open-science technology strategy, using
   a sample of 512 young biotechnology firms. After controlling for
   founders' prior work experience and other organizational and
   environmental factors, I find that firms with proportionally more
   Ph.D.-holding entrepreneurs on the founding team have a higher
   probability of adopting open science. In addition, founders' educational
   background can mitigate the constraint of organizational environments on
   strategy. A crowded technological niche provides a more challenging
   environment for firms to implement open science, due to higher scooping
   risks. The deterrent effect, however, of such a high-risk environment is
   smaller among firms founded by proportionally more Ph.D.-holding
   entrepreneurs. There is also some evidence of a stronger effect of
   founders' educational background on open science in an institutional
   environment in which open science has yet to become the industry norm.
   This finding is consistent with and complements the growing body of
   research that emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurial background in
   developing knowledge about new-venture strategy and structure.

   under Kahneman and Tversky's cumulative prospect theory (CPT). We
   introduce a new measure of loss aversion for large payoffs, called the

   determinant of the well-posedness of the model. The sensitivity of the
   CPT value function with respect to the stock allocation is then
   investigated, which, as a by-product, demonstrates that this function is
   neither concave nor convex. We finally derive optimal solutions
   explicitly for the cases in which the reference point is the risk-free
   return and those in which it is not (while the utility function is
   piecewise linear), and we employ these results to investigate
   comparative statics of optimal risky exposures with respect to the

   duopoly facing consumers who have heterogeneous tastes for the products
   and who must experience a product before knowing how well it matches
   with their preferences. The analysis yields several key insights.
   Restocking fees not only can be sustained in a competitive environment,
   but also are more severe when consumers are less informed about product
   fit and when consumers place a greater importance on how well products'
   attributes fit with their preferences. We compare the competitive
   equilibrium prices to a scenario in which consumers are certain about
   their preferences and find conditions defining when consumer uncertainty
   results in higher equilibrium prices. Comparison to a monopoly setting
   yields a surprising result: Equilibrium restocking fees in a competitive
   environment can be higher than those charged by a monopolist.

AB Websites typically provide several links on each page visited by a user.
   Whereas some of these links help users easily navigate the site, others
   are typically used to provide targeted recommendations based on the
   available user profile. When the user profile is not available ( or is
   inadequate), the site cannot effectively target products, promotions,
   and advertisements. In those situations, the site can learn the profile
   of a user as the user traverses the site. Naturally, the faster the site
   can learn a user's profile, the sooner the site can benefit from
   personalization. We develop a technique that sites can use to learn the
   profile as quickly as possible. The technique identifies links for sites
   to make available that will lead to a more informative profile when the
   user chooses one of the offered links. Experiments conducted using our
   approach demonstrate that it enables learning the profiles markedly
   better after very few user interactions as compared to benchmark
   approaches. The approach effectively learns multiple attributes
   simultaneously, can learn well classes that have highly skewed priors,
   and remains quite effective even when the distribution of link profiles
   at a site is relatively homogeneous. The approach works particularly
   well when a user's traversal is influenced by the most recently visited
   pages on a site. Finally, we show that the approach is robust to noise
   in the estimates for the probability parameters needed for its
   implementation.

   1,517 of the largest Danish organizations. The findings suggest that the
   risk of receiving stress-related medication increases significantly for
   employees at organizations that change, especially those that undergo
   broad simultaneous changes along several dimensions. Thus,
   organizational changes are associated with significant risks of employee
   health problems. These effects are further explored with respect to

   service activity, profitability, loyalty). We relate Internet banking
   adoption to customer demand for banking services, the availability of
   alternative channels, customers' efficiency in service coproduction
   ("customer efficiency"), and local Internet banking penetration. We find
   that customers who have greater transaction demand and higher
   efficiency, and reside in areas with a greater density of online banking
   adopters, are faster to adopt online banking after controlling for time,
   regional, and individual characteristics. Consistent with prior work, we
   find that customers significantly increase their banking activity,
   acquire more products, and perform more transactions. These changes in
   behavior are not associated with short-run increases in customer
   profitability, but customers who adopt online banking have a lower
   propensity to leave the bank. Building on these observations we also
   find that the adoption drivers are linked to the postadoption changes in
   behavior or profitability. Customers who live in areas with a high
   branch density or high Internet banking penetration increase their
   product acquisition and transaction activity more than Internet banking
   adopters in other regions. Efficient customers and those with high
   service demand show greater postadoption profitability.

AB We study how a manager's short-term interest in the firm's market value
   may motivate channel stuffing: shipping excess inventory to the
   downstream channel. Channel stuffing allows a manager to report sales in
   excess of demand in order to influence investors' valuation of the firm.
   We apply an inventory model that highlights the potential role of
   inventory in the manager's channel stuffing and the investors' valuation
   strategies. Sales in our model are constrained by available inventory.
   Our model yields a semiseparating and semipooling equilibrium contingent
   on the initial inventory level: When the demand is lower than a
   threshold that depends on and is below the initial inventory level, the
   manager pads sales by a part of the excess inventory and releases the
   inflated sales report. The investors "correct" the reported sales and
   are able to infer perfectly the firm's value. When the demand reaches or
   exceeds this threshold, the manager pads any excess inventory to the
   sales and reports the initial inventory is sold out, which censors large
   demand realizations. Then the investors only infer the real demand is no
   less than the threshold and value the firm accordingly by expectation.
   Channel stuffing can influence the inventory decision, too. We find both
   over- and underinvestment in the initial inventory can arise in our
   model. We discuss empirical and managerial implications of our findings.

   make meting out severe punishments-even below-(stage) minimax

AB Medical devices play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of
   health care today. However, persistent quality problems with medical
   devices and the associated recalls present potential health risks to
   patients and personnel using these devices. This study addresses three
   key issues in this regard. First, it empirically assesses the financial
   implications of medical device recalls to understand if these
   consequences are severe enough to deter firms from introducing
   potentially hazardous medical devices into the market, as can be
   inferred from the literature. Second, the study considers a cross
   section of medical device manufacturers to examine the effect of firm
   characteristics on the costs of poor quality. Third, in an attempt to
   explore the sources of recalls, this study investigates firm
   characteristics that are likely to be associated with device recalls.
   The econometric analyses in the study are based on data from
   manufacturers in the medical device industry over a four-year period
   (2002-2005). Contrary to our expectations, the findings of the study
   indicate that at an aggregate level, the market penalties for medical
   device recalls are not significant, i.e., at the aggregate level, the
   costs of poor quality are not severe. Furthermore, we find that the
   magnitude of financial consequences of device recalls is affected by the
   product scope, sales, growth prospects, and the capital structure of a
   firm. In our analyses exploring the sources of device recalls, we find
   that firms with a research and development focus, developing broader
   product portfolios, have a higher likelihood of device recalls. Also, we
   find that the likelihood of recalls decreases with prior recall
   experience, indicating the presence of learning. Implications of the
   study findings, limitations, and directions for future research are
   identified.

   entrepreneurship and employment growth. Based on a panel of metropolitan
   areas in the United States from 1993 to 2002, our results indicate that,
   relative to states that enforce noncompete covenants, an increase in the
   local supply of venture capital in states that restrict the scope of
   these agreements has significantly stronger positive effects on (i) the
   number of patents, (ii) the number of firm starts, and (iii) employment.
   We address potential endogeneity in the supply of venture capital by
   using endowment returns as an instrumental variable. Our results point
   to a strong interaction between financial intermediation and the legal
   regime in promoting entrepreneurship and economic growth.

AB Reference-dependent preferences have been well accepted in decision
   sciences, experimental economics, behavioral finance, and marketing.
   However, we still know very little about how decision makers form and
   update their reference points given a sequence of information. Our paper
   provides some novel experiments in a financial context to advance the
   understanding of reference-point formation over time. Our subjects'
   reference price is best described as a combination of the first and the
   last price of the time series, with intermediate prices receiving
   smaller and nondecaying weights. Hence, reference prices are not
   recursive. We provide a parsimonious formula to predict the reference
   points, which we test out-of-sample. The fit of the model is reasonably
   good.

   risk. In this model, a decision maker always satisfies first-order
   stochastic dominance. If neither lottery stochastically dominates the
   other alternative, a decision maker chooses in a probabilistic manner.
   The proposed model is derived from four standard axioms (completeness,
   weak stochastic transitivity, continuity, and common consequence
   independence) and two relatively new axioms. The proposed model provides
   a better fit to experimental data than do existing models. The baseline
   model can be extended to other domains such as modeling variable
   consumer demand.

AB What is the best way to design tournaments for status, in which
   individuals labor primarily for the esteem of their peers? What process,
   in other words, should organizers of status-based contests impose upon
   those who covet peer recognition? We propose a formal model of
   status-based competition that contrasts two competing alternatives. The
   first, following Merton, is the "Matthew Effect," according to which a
   tournament's architect directs slack resources to elite actors and thus
   widens the distribution of rewards by favoring cumulative advantage. The
   second is the " Mark Effect," under which a tournament's designer
   instead pushes slack resources to marginal actors and thus tightens the
   distribution of rewards. Our results suggest that although the Mark
   Effect is better for the social welfare of most tournaments, the Matthew
   Effect is preferable in two distinct contexts: in small tournaments
   where variation in underlying ability translates into acute advantages
   for the most capable contestants; and in large tournaments whose
   contestants face constant, rather than rising, marginal costs-a
   condition we relate to contestants' perception of their work as
   intrinsically valuable. Our contributions are twofold: We find, counter
   to the thrust of Merton's work, that cumulative advantage is not
   invariably optimal for the functioning of status contests; and we
   identify circumstances in which the production of superstars is likely
   to make contests for status better off in aggregate. Implications for
   future research on status and management are discussed.

AB Multiservice providers, such as telecommunication and financial service
   companies, can benefit from understanding how customers' service
   portfolios evolve over the course of their relationships. This can
   provide guidance for managerial issues such as customer valuation and
   predicting customers' future behavior, whether it is acquiring
   additional services, selectively dropping current services, or ending
   the relationship entirely. In this research, we develop a dynamic hidden
   Markov model to identify latent states that govern customers' affinity
   for the available services through which customers evolve. In addition,
   we incorporate and demonstrate the importance of separating two other
   sources of dynamics: portfolio inertia and service stickiness. We then
   examine the relationship between state membership and managerially
   relevant metrics, including customers' propensities for acquiring
   additional services or terminating the relationship, and customer
   lifetime value. Through a series of illustrative vignettes, we show that
   customers who have discarded a particular service may have an increased
   risk of canceling all services in the near future (as intuition would
   suggest) but also may be more prone to acquire more services, a
   provocative finding of interest to service providers. Our findings also
   emphasize the need to look beyond the previous period, as in much
   current research, and consider how customers have evolved over their
   entire relationship in order to predict their future actions.

AB We develop a new goodness-of-fit test for validating the performance of
   probability forecasts. Our test statistic is particularly powerful under
   sparseness and dependence in the observed data. To build our test
   statistic, we start from a formal definition of calibrated forecasts,
   which we operationalize by introducing two components. The first
   component tests the level of the estimated probabilities; the second
   validates the shape, measuring the differentiation between high and low
   probability events. After constructing test statistics for both level
   and shape, we provide a global goodness-of-fit statistic, which is
   asymptotically chi(2) distributed. In a simulation exercise, we find
   that our approach is correctly sized and more powerful than alternative
   statistics. In particular, our shape statistic is significantly more
   powerful than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Under independence, our
   global test has significantly greater power than the popular
   Hosmer-Lemeshow's chi(2) test. Moreover, even under dependence, our
   global test remains correctly sized and consistent. As a timely and
   important empirical application of our method, we study the validation
   of a forecasting model for credit default events.

AB The academic and practitioner literature justifies firms' use of product
   costs in product pricing and capacity planning decisions as heuristics
   to address an otherwise intractable problem. However, product costs are
   the output of a cost reporting system, which itself is the outcome of
   heuristic design choices. In particular, because of informational
   limitations, when designing cost systems firms use simple rules of thumb
   to group resources into cost pools and to select drivers used to
   allocate the pooled costs to products. Using simulations, we examine how
   popular choices in costing system design influence the error in reported
   costs. Taking information needs into account, we offer alternative ways
   to translate the vague guidance in the literature to implementable
   methods. Specifically, we compare size-based rules for forming cost
   pools with more informationally demanding correlation-based rules and
   develop a blended method that performs well in terms of accuracy. In
   addition, our analysis suggests that significant gains can be made from
   using a composite driver rather than selecting a driver based on the
   consumption pattern for the largest resource only, especially when
   combined with correlation-based rules to group resources. We vary
   properties of the underlying cost structure (such as the skewness in
   resource costs, the traceability of resources to products, the sharing
   of resources across products, and the variance in resource consumption
   patterns) to address the generalizability of our findings and to show
   when different heuristics might be preferred.

AB Prior firm experience, firm capabilities, and the industry environment
   are known to be important determinants of new-venture performance. We
   hypothesize that firm experience prior to setting up a new venture
   influences the ability to learn from experience after start-up (which is
   a key capability), and that this relationship is moderated by the
   importance of learning by doing within the new venture's industry (which
   is a critical aspect of the industry environment). We argue that
   together, these relationships influence performance differences among
   new plant ventures of incumbents, diversifying entrants, and
   entrepreneurial (de novo) entrants. Using data on 47,915 new plant
   ventures in U.S. manufacturing, we find that incumbents and diversifying
   entrants establish significantly more productive new plants than de novo
   entrants, and that this advantage significantly increases with the
   importance of learning by doing in an industry (industry learning
   intensity). These productivity differences appear to be driven more by
   learning subsequent to plant start-up than by initial disparities in
   productivity. Together, these findings strongly suggest that
   pre-start-up experience adds to the process of post-start-up learning,
   and that the industry learning environment plays an important role in
   whether entrepreneurial firms can achieve a competitive advantage over
   existing firms.

AB This paper studies the incentive for vertical information sharing in
   competing supply chains with production technologies that exhibit
   diseconomies of scale. We consider a model of two supply chains each
   consisting of one manufacturer selling to one retailer, with the
   retailers engaging in Cournot or Bertrand competition. For Cournot
   retail competition, we show that information sharing benefits a supply
   chain when (1) the production diseconomy is large and (2) either
   competition is less intense or at least one retailer's information is
   less accurate. A supply chain may become worse off when making its
   information more accurate or production diseconomy smaller, if such an
   improvement induces the firms in the rival supply chain to cease sharing
   information. For Bertrand retail competition, we show that information
   sharing benefits a supply chain when (1) the production diseconomy is
   large and (2) either competition is less intense or information is more
   accurate. Under Bertrand competition a manufacturer may be worse off by
   receiving information, which is never the case under Cournot
   competition. Information sharing in one supply chain triggers a
   competitive reaction from the other supply chain and this reaction is
   damaging to the first supply chain under Cournot competition but may be
   beneficial under Bertrand competition.

AB This paper introduces a parameter-free method for measuring the
   weighting functions of prospect theory and rank-dependent utility. These
   weighting functions capture risk attitudes, subjective beliefs, and
   ambiguity attitudes. Our method, called the midweight method, is based
   on a convenient way to obtain midpoints in the weighting function scale.
   It can be used both for risk (known probabilities) and for uncertainty
   (unknown probabilities). The resulting integrated treatment of risk and
   uncertainty is particularly useful for measuring ambiguity, i.e., the
   difference between uncertainty and risk. Compared to existing methods to
   measure weighting functions and attitudes toward uncertainty and
   ambiguity, our method is more efficient and can accommodate violations
   of expected utility under risk. An experiment demonstrates the
   tractability of our method, yielding plausible results such as ambiguity
   aversion for moderate and high likelihoods but ambiguity seeking for low
   likelihoods, as predicted by Ellsberg.

AB We investigate firms' competitive behaviors in industries where
   customers are sensitive to both promised delivery time (PDT) and quality
   of service (QoS) measured by the on-time delivery rate. To study the
   competition in PDT at the marketing level, we construct an oligopoly
   game with an external QoS requirement. We show that there exists a
   unique Nash equilibrium, and the equilibrium QoS exhibits a switching
   surface structure with respect to capacities. To study the competition
   in capacity at the strategic level, we construct a two-stage game in
   which the firms compete in terms of their capacities in stage 1 and in
   terms of PDT in stage 2. We show the existence of two different types of
   pure strategy equilibria and characterize them. This study provides the
   following insights: an index of time-based competitive advantage (ITCA)
   and the first-mover advantage determine the positions of the firms in
   time-based competition; either the well-known prisoner's dilemma or
   off-equilibrium behaviors due to different preferences for equilibria
   (when multiple equilibria exist) may lead the firms to overinvest in
   capacity, but no one may gain a competitive advantage; a uniform
   improvement in internal efficiency (i.e., a uniform capacity cost
   reduction) may harm everyone; quality differentiation (i.e., going
   beyond the QoS benchmark) plays a dual role in time-based competition,
   either helping a firm with a larger ITCA to compete more effectively, or
   helping a firm possibly with a smaller ITCA to preempt competitors and
   protect its market advantage.

AB Exploring the tension between theory and practice regarding complexity
   and performance in contract design is especially relevant. The goal of
   this paper is to understand why simpler contracts may commonly be
   preferred in practice despite being theoretically suboptimal. We study a
   two-tier supply chain with a single supplier and a single buyer to
   characterize the impact of contract complexity and asymmetric
   information on performance and to compare theoretical predictions to
   actual behavior in human subject experiments. In the experiments, the
   computerized buyer faces a newsvendor setting and has better information
   on end-consumer demand than the human supplier. The supplier offers
   either a quantity discount contract (with two or three price blocks) or
   a price-only contract, contracts that are commonplace in practice, yet
   different in complexity. Results show that, contrary to theoretical
   predictions, quantity discounts do not necessarily increase the
   supplier's profits. We also observe a more equitable distribution of
   profits between the supplier and the buyer than what theory predicts.
   These observations can be described with three decision biases (the
   probabilistic choice bias, the reinforcement bias, and the memory bias)
   and can be modeled using the experience-weighted attraction learning
   model. Our results demonstrate that simpler contracts, such as a
   price-only contract or a quantity discount contract with a low number of
   price blocks, are sufficient for a supplier designing contracts under
   asymmetric demand information.

AB Provision of real-time information by a firm to its customers has become
   prevalent in recent years in both the service and retail sectors. In
   this paper, we study a retail operations model where customers are
   strategic in both their actions and in the way they interpret
   information, whereas the retailer is strategic in the way it provides
   information. This paper focuses on the ability (or the lack thereof) to
   communicate unverifiable information and influence customers' actions.
   We develop a game-theoretic framework to study this type of
   communication and discuss the equilibrium language emerging between the
   retailer and its customers. We show that for a single retailer and
   homogeneous customer population setting, the equilibrium language that
   emerges carries no information. In this sense, a single retailer
   providing information on its own cannot create any credibility with the
   customers. We study how the results are impacted due to the
   heterogeneity of the customers. We provide conditions under which the
   firm may be able to influence the customer behavior. In particular, we
   show that the customers' willingness to pay and willingness to wait
   cannot be ranked in an opposite manner. However, even when the firm can
   influence each customer class separately, the effective demand is not

AB We analyze the competitive capacity investment timing decisions of both
   established firms and start-ups entering new markets, which have a high
   degree of demand uncertainty. Firms may invest in capacity early (when
   uncertainty is high) or late (when uncertainty has been resolved),
   possibly at different costs. Established firms choose an investment
   timing and capacity level to maximize expected profits, whereas
   start-ups make those choices to maximize the probability of survival.
   When a start-up competes against an established firm, we find that when
   demand uncertainty is high and costs do not decline too severely over
   time, the start-up takes a leadership role and invests first in
   capacity, whereas the established firm follows; by contrast, when two
   established firms compete in an otherwise identical game, both firms
   invest late. We conclude that the threat of firm failure significantly
   impacts the dynamics of competition involving start-ups.

AB A fast fashion system combines quick response production capabilities
   with enhanced product design capabilities to both design "hot" products
   that capture the latest consumer trends and exploit minimal production
   lead times to match supply with uncertain demand. We develop a model of
   such a system and compare its performance to three alternative systems:
   quick-response-only systems, enhanced-design-only systems, and
   traditional systems (which lack both enhanced design and quick response
   capabilities). In particular, we focus on the impact of each of the four
   systems on "strategic" or forward-looking consumer purchasing behavior,
   i.e., the intentional delay in purchasing an item at the full price to
   obtain it during an end-of-season clearance. We find that enhanced
   design helps to mitigate strategic behavior by offering consumers a
   product they value more, making them less willing to risk waiting for a
   clearance sale and possibly experiencing a stockout. Quick response
   mitigates strategic behavior through a different mechanism: by better
   matching supply to demand, it reduces the chance of a clearance sale.
   Most importantly, we find that although it is possible for quick
   response and enhanced design to be either complements or substitutes,
   the complementarity effect tends to dominate. Hence, when both quick
   response and enhanced design are combined in a fast fashion system, the
   firm typically enjoys a greater incremental increase in profit than the
   sum of the increases resulting from employing either system in
   isolation. Furthermore, complementarity is strongest when customers are
   very strategic. We conclude that fast fashion systems can be of
   significant value, particularly when consumers exhibit strategic
   behavior.

AB We develop a unified model of the interactions among investors, fund
   companies, and fund managers. We show that the interplay between a
   manager's incentives from her compensation structure and career concerns
   leads to a nonmonotonic (approximately U-shaped) relation between her
   risk choices and prior performance relative to her peers. Significantly
   outperforming (underperforming) managers are less (more) likely to be
   fired in the future and are also more likely to increase relative risk.
   Ceteris paribus, relative risk declines with the level of employment
   risk faced by a manager. Using a large sample of mutual fund managers,
   we find strong support for the hypothesized U-shaped relation between
   relative risk and prior performance. Our findings also highlight the
   importance of employment risk as the underlying driver of risk shifting
   by fund managers. Our theoretical model also generates additional
   hypotheses that link determinants of the fund flow-performance relation
   and managers' employment risk to their risk-taking behavior. In support,
   our empirical analysis shows that funds with higher expense ratios have
   less convex fund flow-performance relations and less convex U-shaped
   relations between relative risk and prior performance; funds with
   younger managers, who face greater employment risk, have more convex
   U-shaped relative risk-prior performance relations; and managers in
   larger fund families have lower incentives to engage in risk shifting,
   thereby leading to a less convex U-shaped relation.

AB We consider a complex planning problem in integrated steel production. A
   sequence of coils of sheet metal needs to be color coated in consecutive
   stages. Different coil geometries and changes of colors necessitate
   time-consuming setup work. In most coating stages one can choose between
   two parallel color tanks. This can either reduce the number of setups
   needed or enable setups concurrent with production. A production plan
   comprises the sequencing of coils and the scheduling of color tanks and
   setup work. The aim is to minimize the makespan for a given set of
   coils. We present an optimization model for this integrated sequencing
   and scheduling problem. A core component is a graph theoretical model
   for concurrent setup scheduling. It is instrumental for building a fast
   heuristic that is embedded into a genetic algorithm to solve the
   sequencing problem. The quality of our solutions is evaluated via an
   integer program based on a combinatorial relaxation, showing that our
   solutions are within 10% of the optimum. Our algorithm is implemented at
   Salzgitter Flachstahl GmbH, a major German steel producer. This has led
   to an average reduction in makespan by over 13% and has greatly exceeded
   expectations.

AB Theoretical models of information asymmetry have identified a trade-off
   between the desire to learn and the desire to prevent an opponent from
   learning private information. This paper reports a laboratory experiment
   that investigates if actual bidders account for this trade-off, using a
   sequential procurement auction with private cost information and varying
   information revelation policies. Specifically, the Complete Information
   Revelation Policy, where all submitted bids are revealed between
   auctions, is compared to the Incomplete Information Revelation Policy,
   where only the winning bid is revealed. The experimental results are
   largely consistent with the theoretical predictions. For example,
   bidders pool with other types to prevent an opponent from learning
   significantly more often under a Complete Information Revelation Policy.
   Also as predicted, the procurer pays less when employing an Incomplete
   Information Revelation Policy only when the market is highly
   competitive. Bids are usually more aggressive than the risk-neutral
   quantitative prediction, which is broadly consistent with risk aversion.

AB A service plan is a type of optional warranty beyond manufacturers' base
   warranties that retailers offer to consumers. In this paper, we examine
   how a service plan affects the role played by a manufacturer's base
   warranty. Analysis shows that when consumers can assess product quality
   (i.e., the probability of product failure), the manufacturer's warranty
   is negatively affected by the presence of a service plan. In the
   presence of such a plan, a base warranty is offered only when the
   manufacturer is very cost-efficient in providing a warranty relative to
   the retailer. In this case, although the double-marginalization problem
   is aggravated, offering a (limited) base warranty reduces the total
   warranty cost in the channel and provokes the retailer into enlarging
   the service plan coverage. When consumers cannot assess product quality,
   a high-quality manufacturer is motivated to offer a base warranty to
   signal its quality. In the presence of a service plan, however, a very
   cost-efficient manufacturer is discouraged from doing so.

AB Upward channel decentralization occurs when firms choose to not
   manufacture products by themselves and procure products from upstream
   suppliers. Current voices from marketing scholars and practitioners have
   predominantly focused on the cost benefits when production is outsourced
   to lower-cost upstream suppliers. In this paper, we study the effects of
   upward channel decentralization where competing firms can outsource
   their production to upstream suppliers who do not have any advantages on
   production costs. We show how downstream firms can still benefit from
   upward channel decentralization provided their product positioning is
   endogenous. Thus, we provide a new theory on the strategic benefits of
   upward channel decentralization. We also use this framework to show a
   new benefit to manufacturers selling through downstream retailers rather
   than directly. We examine the implications of our theory for consumer
   and social welfare, and also draw managerial implications.

AB Comarketing alliances often involve multiple partners, and a given
   partner's marketing efforts on behalf of the alliance can indirectly
   affect the demand of the other partners. Individual partners, however,
   can ignore the effects of such an externality and invest suboptimally to
   the detriment of the alliance. This paper examines the relative
   effectiveness of outcome-and action-based contracts in providing the
   alliance partners with the incentives to invest appropriately. We
   develop a mathematical model in which a focal firm (e. g., Sony)
   contracts with two partners (e. g., McDonald's and Old Navy) when each
   of these partners is privately informed about the impact of the alliance
   on its demand. Our analysis evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of
   outcome- (or output-) and action-based (or input-based) contracts in
   settings with varying levels of the demand externality. We find that
   when there is either no externality or a relatively weak positive
   externality, there is a strict preference for output-based contracts;
   that preference, however, is reversed with a sufficiently strong
   positive externality. This paper explains the underlying rationale for
   these findings.

AB Individuals, groups, and teams who are behind their opponents in
   competition tend to be more likely to lose. In contrast, we show that
   through increasing motivation, being slightly behind can actually
   increase success. Analysis of more than 18,000 professional basketball
   games illustrates that being slightly behind at halftime leads to a
   discontinuous increase in winning percentage. Teams behind by a point at
   halftime, for example, actually win more often than teams ahead by one,
   or approximately six percentage points more often than expected. This
   psychological effect is roughly half the size of the proverbial
   home-team advantage. Analysis of more than 45,000 collegiate basketball
   games finds consistent, though smaller, results. Experiments corroborate
   the field data and generalize their findings, providing direct causal
   evidence that being slightly behind increases effort and casting doubt
   on alternative explanations for the results. Taken together, these
   findings illustrate that losing can sometimes lead to winning.

AB Contests are a historically important and increasingly popular mechanism
   for encouraging innovation. A central concern in designing innovation
   contests is how many competitors to admit. Using a unique data set of
   9,661 software contests, we provide evidence of two coexisting and
   opposing forces that operate when the number of competitors increases.
   Greater rivalry reduces the incentives of all competitors in a contest
   to exert effort and make investments. At the same time, adding
   competitors increases the likelihood that at least one competitor will
   find an extreme-value solution. We show that the effort-reducing effect
   of greater rivalry dominates for less uncertain problems, whereas the
   effect on the extreme value prevails for more uncertain problems. Adding
   competitors thus systematically increases overall contest performance
   for high-uncertainty problems. We also find that higher uncertainty
   reduces the negative effect of added competitors on incentives. Thus,
   uncertainty and the nature of the problem should be explicitly
   considered in the design of innovation tournaments. We explore the
   implications of our findings for the theory and practice of innovation
   contests.

AB In recent years, vendor liability for software security vulnerabilities
   has been the center of an important debate in the software community and
   a topic gaining government attention in legislative committees and
   hearings. The importance of this question surrounding vendor security
   liability is amplified when one considers the increasing emergence of
   zero-day attacks where hackers take advantage of vulnerabilities before
   the software vendor has a chance to release protective patches. In this
   paper, we compare the effectiveness of three software liability
   policies: vendor liability for damages, vendor liability for patching
   costs, and government imposed security standards. We find that vendor
   liability for losses is not effective in improving social welfare in the
   short run, while liability for patching costs can be effective if either
   patching costs are large and the likelihood of a zero-day attack is low,
   or patching costs are small and zero-day likelihood is high. In the long
   run, when the vendor can invest in reducing the likelihood of security
   vulnerabilities, loss liability is still ineffective when the zero-day
   attack probability is high but can increase both vendor investment in
   security and social welfare when zero-day attack likelihood is
   sufficiently low. When the zero-day attack probability is high, patch
   liability is ineffective if user patching costs are large, but partial
   patch liability can boost vendor investment and improve welfare when
   patching costs are small. In contrast, in an environment with low
   zero-day attack probability, full vendor patch liability can be optimal.
   Finally, comparing the effectiveness of the three liability policies
   under study, we find that government imposed standards on software
   security investment can be preferable to both patching and loss
   liability on the vendor, if zero-day attack likelihood is sufficiently
   low. However, if zero-day attacks are a common occurrence and patching
   costs are not too high, partial patch liability is the most effective
   policy.

AB Intertemporal decision making under risk involves two dimensions: time
   preferences and risk preferences. This paper focuses on the impact of
   time on risk preferences, independent of the intertemporal trade-off of
   outcomes, i.e., time preferences. It reports the results of an
   experimental study that examines how delayed resolution and payment of
   risky options influence individual choice. We used a simple experimental
   design based on the comparison of two-outcome monetary lotteries with
   the same delay. Raw data clearly reveal that subjects become more risk
   tolerant for delayed lotteries. Assuming a prospect theory-like model
   under risk, we analyze the impact of time on utility and decision
   weights, independent of time preferences. We show that the subjective
   treatment of outcomes (i.e., utility) is not significantly affected by
   time. In fact, the impact of time is completely absorbed by the
   probability weighting function. The effect of time on risk preferences
   was found to generate probabilistic optimism resulting in a higher risk
   tolerance for delayed lotteries.

AB We examine the roots of gender segregation in the screening process by
   using a longitudinal data set of candidates considered for temporary
   projects at a staffing firm and following their progress through the
   hiring pipeline. Theories invoked to explain gender segregation across
   jobs traditionally rely on firm-specific human capital and expectations
   of future commitment to explain this phenomenon. These do not apply in
   this setting. Yet we find that the staffing firm is more likely to
   shortlist women for low-paid projects and less likely to do so for
   high-paid ones. These effects are due to women being considered for
   different projects than men, and associated at least partially to the
   level of competition within vacancies. Although client companies also
   exhibit some gender-sorting behavior in the later steps of the hiring
   process, they are more likely to prefer women and less likely to sort
   them into lower-paid projects. Our findings are consistent with
   "anticipatory gender-sorting" mechanisms, by which first screeners
   generate segregation when narrowing down the pool of candidates for
   later decision makers. We discuss the implications of this case for
   theories of gender stratification and workplace inequality, especially
   in mediated labor markets.

AB Product variety is an important strategic tool that firms can use to
   attract customers and respond to competition. This study focuses on the
   retail industry and investigates how stores manage their product
   variety, contingent on the presence of competition and their actual
   distance from rivals. Using a unique data set that contains all Best Buy
   and Circuit City stores in the United States, the authors find that a
   store's product variety (i.e., number of stock-keeping units) increases
   if a rival store exists in its market but, in the presence of such
   competition, decreases when the rival store is collocated (within one
   mile of the focal store). Moreover, collocated rival stores tend to
   differentiate themselves by overlapping less in product range than do
   noncollocated rivals. This smaller and more differentiated product
   variety may be because of coordinated interactions between collocated
   stores. In summary, this paper presents evidence of both coordination
   and competition in retailers' use of product variety.

   problems involving stock and bond investment, perishable consumption,
   and the rental and ownership of residential real estate. Prices of
   houses, stocks and bonds, and labor income are correlated. Because of a
   positive correlation between house prices and labor income, young
   individuals want little exposure to house price risk and tend to rent
   their home. Later in life the desired housing investment increases and
   will eventually reach and exceed the desired consumption, suggesting
   that the individual should buy his home-and either additional housing
   units (for renting out) or house price-linked financial assets. In the
   final years, preferences shift back to home rental. The derived
   strategies are still useful if housing positions are only reset

   rewards. Although the productivity of agents in our experiment therefore
   decreased if they had to convince a principal of their capability, we

AB In this paper, we investigate the integrated information and pricing
   strategy for a seller who can take customer preorders before the release
   of a product. The preorder option enables the seller to sell a product
   at an early stage when consumers are less certain about their
   valuations. We find that the optimal pricing strategy may be highly
   dependent on the amount of information available at preorder and that a
   small change in the latter may cause a dramatic change in the proportion
   of consumers who preorder under optimal pricing. Furthermore, the
   seller's optimal information strategy depends on a key measure, the
   normalized margin, which is the ratio between the expected profit margin
   and the standard deviation of consumer valuation. Although the seller
   may want to release some information or none, she should never release
   all information. Finally, under the optimal information and pricing
   strategy, the benefit of preorder is most pronounced when the normalized
   margin is in a medium range.

AB In this paper, we study price competition for an oligopoly in a dynamic
   setting, where each of the sellers has a fixed number of units available
   for sale over a fixed number of periods. Demand is stochastic, and
   depending on how it evolves, sellers may change their prices at any
   time. This reflects the fact that firms constantly, and almost
   costlessly, change their prices, reacting to updates in their estimates
   of market demand, competitor prices, or inventory levels. In a setting
   with demand uncertainty, we show that there is a unique subgame-perfect
   equilibrium for a duopoly, in which all states sellers engage in
   Bertrand competition and the seller with the lower equilibrium
   reservation value sells a unit at a price equal to the competitor's
   equilibrium reservation value. This structure therefore extends the
   marginal-value concept of bid-price control, used in many revenue
   management implementations, to a competitive model. We give a
   closed-form solution to the equilibrium price paths for a duopoly and
   extend all the results to an n-firm oligopoly. We then study extensions
   to multiple customer types, uncertain valuations, and differentiated
   products.

   aversion is widespread, we conclude that the reference point generally

   model in which adjustment costs can cause stickiness relative to an

AB This paper investigates the capacity investment decision of a supplier
   who solicits private forecast information from a manufacturer. To ensure
   abundant supply, the manufacturer has an incentive to inflate her
   forecast in a costless, nonbinding, and nonverifiable type of
   communication known as "cheap talk." According to standard game theory,
   parties do not cooperate and the only equilibrium is uninformative-the
   manufacturer's report is independent of her forecast and the supplier
   does not use the report to determine capacity. However, we observe in
   controlled laboratory experiments that parties cooperate even in the
   absence of reputation-building mechanisms and complex contracts. We
   argue that the underlying reason for cooperation is trust and
   trustworthiness. The extant literature on forecast sharing and supply
   chain coordination implicitly assumes that supply chain members either
   absolutely trust each other and cooperate when sharing forecast
   information, or do not trust each other at all. Contrary to this
   all-or-nothing view, we determine that a continuum exists between these
   two extremes. In addition, we determine (i) when trust is important in
   forecast information sharing, (ii) how trust is affected by changes in
   the supply chain environment, and (iii) how trust affects related
   operational decisions. To explain and better understand the observed
   behavioral regularities, we also develop an analytical model of trust to
   incorporate both pecuniary and nonpecuniary incentives in the
   game-theoretic analysis of cheap-talk forecast communication. The model
   identifies and quantifies how trust and trustworthiness induce effective
   cheap-talk forecast sharing under the wholesale price contract. We also
   determine the impact of repeated interactions and information feedback
   on trust and cooperation in forecast sharing. We conclude with a
   discussion on the implications of our results for developing effective
   forecast management policies.

AB We examine the effects of mandating the provision of fair value
   information for long-lived tangible assets on firms' information
   asymmetry. Specifically, we investigate whether European real estate
   firms' compulsory adoption of International Accounting Standard 40 (IAS
   40; Investment Property), which mandated the provision of investment
   property fair values in 2005, resulted in reduced information asymmetry
   across market participants. Using as a control group firms that
   voluntarily provided these fair values prior to the mandatory adoption
   of IAS 40, we find that mandatory adoption firms exhibit a larger
   decline in information asymmetry, as reflected in lower bid-ask spreads.
   However, we also find that mandatory adoption firms continue to have
   higher information asymmetry than voluntary adoption firms, which
   appears partially attributable to the lower reliability of fair values
   reported by the mandatory adoption firms. Together, this evidence adds
   to the debate on fair value accounting by demonstrating that common
   adoption of fair value, even for long-lived tangible assets, under a
   mandatory reporting regime can reduce, but not necessarily eliminate,
   information asymmetry differences across firms.

AB We consider an assemble-to-order system in which multiple products are
   assembled from a common component and a set of product-dedicated
   components. Component capacities are chosen prior to a finite-horizon
   selling season, and the common component is allocated to the products
   based on observed demands. We propose a collection of allocation
   mechanisms involving varying degrees of demand aggregation, ranging from
   a scheme under which all demands are observed prior to making the
   allocation decision to allocations made for each arriving demand. In
   this context, we explore the impact of the allocation scheme on sales,
   profits, and capacity decisions, including the degree of capacity
   imbalance. We find that the benefit from increased demand aggregation is
   closely linked to the degree of capacity imbalance: profit gains from
   delayed allocation tend to be higher in systems in which the optimal
   capacity portfolio is highly unbalanced when the allocation decision is
   made after observing all demands. We develop insights into what detailed
   system parameters lead to the largest gains from demand aggregation and
   also explore the trade-offs associated with the choice of an allocation
   scheme when customers exhibit impatience if the allocation scheme forces
   them to wait to be served.

   performance. We find that the use of risk-adjusted implied distributions
   times the market and makes the investor better off than if she uses

AB T he Capital Assistance Program (CAP) was created by the U. S.
   government in February 2009 to provide backup capital to large financial
   institutions unable to raise sufficient capital from private investors.
   Under the terms of the CAP, a participating bank receives contingent
   capital by issuing preferred shares to the Treasury combined with
   embedded options for both parties: The bank gets the option to redeem
   the shares or convert them to common equity, with conversion mandatory
   after seven years; the Treasury earns dividends on the preferred shares
   and gets warrants on the bank's common equity. We develop a contingent
   claims framework in which to estimate market values of these CAP
   securities. The interaction between the competing options held by the
   buyer and issuer of these securities creates a game between the two
   parties, and our approach captures this strategic element of the joint
   valuation problem and clarifies the incentives it creates. We apply our
   method to the 18 publicly held bank holding companies that participated
   in the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the stress test) launched
   together with the CAP. On average, we estimate that compared to a market
   transaction, the CAP securities carry a net value of approximately 30%
   of the capital invested for a bank participating to the maximum extent
   allowed under the terms of the program. We also find that the net value
   varies widely across banks. We compare our estimates with abnormal stock
   price returns for the stress test banks at the time the terms of the CAP
   were announced; we find correlations between 0.78 and 0.85, depending on
   the precise choice of period and set of banks included. These results
   suggest that our valuation aligns with shareholder perception of the
   value of the program, prompting questions about industry reactions and
   the overall impact of the program.

AB This paper highlights the rationale for exclusive territories in a model
   of repeated interaction between competing supply chains. We show that
   with observable contracts exclusive territories have two countervailing
   effects on manufacturers' incentives to sustain tacit collusion. First,
   granting local monopolies to retailers softens competition in a one-shot
   game. Hence, punishment profits are larger, thereby rendering deviation
   more profitable. Second, exclusive territories stifle deviation profits
   because retailers of competing brands adjust their prices to the
   wholesale contract offered by a deviant manufacturer, whereas intrabrand
   competition prevents such "instantaneous reaction." We show that the
   latter effect tends to dominate, thereby making exclusive territories a
   more suitable organizational mode to cooperate. These insights are
   robust to endogenous communication between manufacturers. We also
   consider retailers' service investments. Here, a novel effect emerges
   that softens the procollusive value of exclusive territories: Retailers
   of a deviant manufacturer increase investments, which renders deviation
   more profitable.

AB In this paper, we focus on modeling and predicting the loss distribution
   for credit risky assets such as bonds and loans. We model the
   probability of default and the recovery rate given default based on
   shared covariates. We develop a new class of default models that
   explicitly accounts for sector specific and regime dependent
   unobservable heterogeneity in firm characteristics. Based on the
   analysis of a large default and recovery data set over the horizon
   1980-2008, we document that the specification of the default model has a
   major impact on the predicted loss distribution, whereas the
   specification of the recovery model is less important. In particular, we
   find evidence that industry factors and regime dynamics affect the
   performance of default models, implying that the appropriate choice of
   default models for loss prediction will depend on the credit cycle and
   on portfolio characteristics. Finally, we show that default
   probabilities and recovery rates predicted out of sample are negatively
   correlated and that the magnitude of the correlation varies with
   seniority class, industry, and credit cycle.

AB The widespread implementation of customer relationship management
   technologies in business has allowed companies to increasingly focus on
   both acquiring and retaining customers. The challenge of designing
   incentive mechanisms that simultaneously focus on customer acquisition
   and customer retention comes from the fact that customer acquisition and
   customer retention are usually separate but intertwined tasks that make
   providing proper incentives more difficult. The present study develops
   incentive mechanisms that simultaneously address acquisition and
   retention of customers with an emphasis on the interactions between
   them. The main focus of this study is to examine the impact of the
   negative effect of acquisition on retention, i.e., the spoiling effect,
   on firm performance under direct selling and delegation of customer
   acquisition. Our main finding is that the negative effect of acquisition
   on retention has a significant impact on acquisition and retention
   efforts and firm profit. In particular, when the customer acquisition
   and retention are independent, the firm's profit is higher under direct
   selling than under delegation; however, when acquisition spoils
   retention, interestingly, the firm's profit may be higher under
   delegation. Our analysis also finds that the spoiling effect not only
   reduces the optimal acquisition effort but may also reduce retention
   effort under both direct selling and delegation. Comparing the optimal
   efforts under direct selling and delegation, the acquisition effort is
   always lower under delegation regardless of the spoiling effect, but the
   retention effort may be higher under delegation with the spoiling
   effect. Furthermore, when the customer antagonism effect from price
   promotions is considered, our main results hold regarding the firm's
   preferences between direct selling and delegation, which demonstrates
   the robustness of our model.

AB One of the most important operational challenges faced by emergency
   departments (EDs) in the United States is patient overcrowding. In
   periods of overcrowding, an ED can request the emergency medical
   services (EMS) agency to divert incoming ambulances to neighboring
   hospitals, a phenomenon known as "ambulance diversion." The EMS agency
   may accept this request provided that at least one of the neighboring
   EDs is not on diversion. From an operations perspective, properly
   executed ambulance diversion should result in resource pooling and
   reduce the overcrowding and delays in a network of EDs. Recent evidence
   indicates, however, that this potential benefit is not always realized.
   In this paper, we provide one potential explanation for this discrepancy
   and suggest potential remedies. Using a queueing game between two EDs
   that aim to minimize their own waiting time, we find that decentralized
   decisions regarding diversion explain the lack of pooling benefits.
   Specifically, we find the existence of a defensive equilibrium, wherein
   each ED does not accept diverted ambulances from the other ED. This
   defensiveness results in a depooling of the network and, subsequently,
   in delays that are significantly higher than when a social planner
   coordinates diversion. The social optimum is itself difficult to
   characterize analytically and has limited practical appeal because it
   depends on problem parameters such as arrival rates and length of stay.
   Instead, we identify an alternative solution that does not require the
   exact knowledge of the parameters and may be used by the EMS agencies to
   coordinate diversion decisions when defensive diversion is present. We
   show that this solution is approximately optimal for the social
   planner's problem. Moreover, it is Pareto improving over the defensive
   equilibrium whereas the social optimum, in general, might not be.

   Further, prudence can be characterized as downside risk aversion and
   plays a key role in preference for skewness. We use a simple
   experimental method to test for prudence and skewness preference in the
   laboratory and compare the two. To this end, we introduce a novel
   graphical representation of compound lotteries that is easily accessible

   Prudence is observed on the aggregate and individual level. We find that
   prudence does not boil down to skewness seeking. We further provide some

AB This paper examines a unique selling strategy, Group Buying, under which
   consumers enjoy a discounted group price if they are willing and able to
   achieve a required group size and coordinate their transaction time. We
   argue that Group Buying allows a seller to gain from facilitating
   consumer social interaction, i.e., using a group discount to motivate
   informed customers to work as "sales agents" to acquire less-informed
   customers through interpersonal information/knowledge sharing. We
   formally model such an information-sharing effect and examine if and
   when Group Buying is more profitable than (1) traditional
   individual-selling strategies, and (2) another popular social
   interaction scheme, Referral Rewards programs. We show that Group Buying
   dominates traditional individual-selling strategies when the
   information/knowledge gap between expert and novice consumers is neither
   too high nor too low (e.g., for products in the midstage of their life
   cycle) and when interpersonal information sharing is very efficient
   (e.g., in cultures that emphasize trust and group conformity, or when
   implemented through existing online social networks). We also show that,
   unlike Referral Rewards programs, Group Buying requires information
   sharing before any transaction takes place, thereby increasing the scale
   of social interaction but also incurring a higher cost. As a result,
   Group Buying is optimal when interpersonal communication is very
   efficient or when the product valuation of the less-informed consumer
   segment is high.

AB Many markets have historically been dominated by a small number of
   best-selling products. The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20
   rule, describes this common pattern of sales concentration. However,
   information technology in general and Internet markets in particular
   have the potential to substantially increase the collective share of
   niche products, thereby creating a longer tail in the distribution of
   sales. This paper investigates the Internet's "long tail" phenomenon. By
   analyzing data collected from a multichannel retailer, it provides
   empirical evidence that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly
   less concentrated sales distribution when compared with traditional
   channels. Previous explanations for this result have focused on
   differences in product availability between channels. However, we
   demonstrate that the result survives even when the Internet and
   traditional channels share exactly the same product availability and
   prices. Instead, we find that consumers' usage of Internet search and
   discovery tools, such as recommendation engines, are associated with an
   increase the share of niche products. We conclude that the Internet's
   long tail is not solely due to the increase in product selection but may
   also partly reflect lower search costs on the Internet. If the
   relationships we uncover persist, the underlying trends in technology
   portend an ongoing shift in the distribution of product sales.

   the cause of systemic distress is the correlated failure of institutions
   to meet obligations to creditors, customers, and trading partners. The
   likelihood estimators of the failure probability are based on a dynamic
   hazard model of correlated failure timing that captures the influence on
   failure timing of time-varying macroeconomic and sector-specific risk
   factors, and of spillover effects. Tests indicate that our measures

AB Are the attitudes and beliefs of chief executive officers (CEOs) linked
   to their firms' innovative performance? This paper uses a measure of
   overconfidence, based on CEO stock-option exercise, to study the
   relationship between a CEO's "revealed beliefs" about future performance
   and standard measures of corporate innovation. We begin by developing a
   career concern model where CEOs innovate to provide evidence of their
   ability. The model predicts that overconfident CEOs, who underestimate
   the probability of failure, are more likely to pursue innovation, and
   that this effect is larger in more competitive industries. We test these
   predictions on a panel of large publicly traded firms for the years from
   1980 to 1994. We find a robust positive association between
   overconfidence and citation-weighted patent counts in both
   cross-sectional and fixed-effect models. This effect is larger in more
   competitive industries. Our results suggest that overconfident CEOs are
   more likely to take their firms in a new technological direction.

AB Increasingly, user-generated product reviews serve as a valuable source
   of information for customers making product choices online. The existing
   literature typically incorporates the impact of product reviews on sales
   based on numeric variables representing the valence and volume of
   reviews. In this paper, we posit that the information embedded in
   product reviews cannot be captured by a single scalar value. Rather, we
   argue that product reviews are multifaceted, and hence the textual
   content of product reviews is an important determinant of consumers'
   choices, over and above the valence and volume of reviews. To
   demonstrate this, we use text mining to incorporate review text in a
   consumer choice model by decomposing textual reviews into segments
   describing different product features. We estimate our model based on a
   unique data set from Amazon containing sales data and consumer review
   data for two different groups of products (digital cameras and
   camcorders) over a 15-month period. We alleviate the problems of data
   sparsity and of omitted variables by providing two experimental
   techniques: clustering rare textual opinions based on pointwise mutual
   information and using externally imposed review semantics. This paper
   demonstrates how textual data can be used to learn consumers' relative
   preferences for different product features and also how text can be used
   for predictive modeling of future changes in sales.

   individual stocks. The empirical results indicate that the generalized
   measure of riskiness is able to rank equity portfolios based on their
   expected returns per unit of risk and hence yields a more efficient
   strategy for maximizing expected return of the portfolio while
   minimizing its risk.

AB This paper considers the desirability of aggregate performance measures
   in light of the fact that many individuals' performance incentives are
   driven by a desire to shape external perceptions (and thus future pay).
   In contrast to the case of explicit incentive contracts, we find that
   when individuals' actions are driven by career incentives, an aggregate
   measure (e.g., group or team output) can sometimes alleviate moral
   hazard concerns and improve efficiency. Aggregation intermingles
   performance measures that may be differentially affected by skill and
   effort of many agents. When such entanglement increases the prospect
   that the external market will attribute an employee's effort-driven
   contribution to transferable skills, the employee exerts higher effort
   as a means of posturing to the market. The incentive benefit of
   aggregation is weighed against the incentive cost because of information
   loss. Information loss from aggregation can reduce the market's reliance
   on the measure and thus diminish agents' desire to undertake effort to
   influence the measure.

   integration are two separate mechanisms for demand and spot price risk
   diversification that both reduce the retail price and increase retail
   market shares. We show that they differ in their impact on prices and
   firms' utility because of the asymmetry between production and retail
   segments. Vertical integration restores the symmetry between producers'
   and retailers' exposure to demand risk, whereas linear forward contracts
   do not. Vertical integration is superior to forward hedging when
   retailers are highly risk averse. We illustrate our analysis with data

AB abels certify that a product meets some standard for quality, but often
   consumers are unsure of the exact standard that the label represents.
   Focusing on the case of ecolabels for environmental quality, we show how
   even small amounts of uncertainty can create consumer confusion that
   reduces or eliminates the value to firms of adopting voluntary labels.
   First, consumers are most suspicious of a label when a product with a
   bad reputation has it, so labels are often unpersuasive at showing that
   a seemingly bad product is actually good. Second, label proliferation
   aggravates the effect of uncertainty, causing the informativeness of
   labels to decrease rather than increase. Third, uncertainty makes
   labeling and nonlabeling equilibria more likely to coexist as the number
   of labels increases, so consumers face greater strategic uncertainty
   over how to interpret the presence or absence of a label. Finally, a
   label can be legitimitized or spoiled for other products when a product
   with a good or bad reputation displays it, so firms may adopt labels
   strategically to manipulate such information spillovers, which further
   exacerbates label confusion. Managers can reduce label confusion by
   supporting mandatory labeling or by undertaking investments to make
   certain labels "focal."

   that together mediate the link between operational transparency and
   increased valuation, and explore boundary conditions and alternative
   explanations.

AB We examine how firms can create word-of-mouth peer influence and social
   contagion by designing viral features into their products and marketing
   campaigns. To econometrically identify the effectiveness of different
   viral features in creating social contagion, we designed and conducted a
   randomized field experiment involving the 1.4 million friends of 9,687
   experimental users on Facebook.com. We find that viral features generate
   econometrically identifiable peer influence and social contagion
   effects. More surprisingly, we find that passive-broadcast viral
   features generate a 246% increase in peer influence and social
   contagion, whereas adding active-personalized viral features generate
   only an additional 98% increase. Although active-personalized viral
   messages are more effective in encouraging adoption per message and are
   correlated with more user engagement and sustained product use,
   passive-broadcast messaging is used more often, generating more total
   peer adoption in the network. Our work provides a model for how
   randomized trials can identify peer influence in social networks.

   who were merely aware of the initiative. Specifically, participant
   consumers demonstrate the desired attitudinal and behavioral changes in
   favor of the challenger, regardless of their affective trust in the

AB This paper studies assortment planning and pricing for a product
   category with heterogeneous product types from two brands. We model
   consumer choice using the nested multinomial logit framework with two
   different hierarchical structures: a brand-primary model in which
   consumers choose a brand first, then a product type in the chosen brand,
   and a type-primary model in which consumers choose a product type first,
   then a brand within that product type. We consider a centralized regime
   that finds the optimal solution for the whole category and a
   decentralized regime that finds a competitive equilibrium between two
   brands. We find that optimal and competitive assortments and prices have
   quite distinctive properties across different models. Specifically, with
   the brand-primary model, both the optimal and the competitive
   assortments for each brand consist of the most popular product types
   from the brand. With the type-primary choice model, the optimal and the
   competitive assortments for each brand may not always consist of the
   most popular product types of the brand. Instead, the overall assortment
   in the category consists of a set of most popular product types. The
   price of a product under the centralized regime can be characterized by
   a sum of a markup that is constant across all products and brands, its
   procurement cost, and its marginal operational cost, implying a lower
   price for more popular products. The markup may be different for each
   brand and product type under the decentralized regime, implying a higher
   price for brands with a larger market share. These properties of the
   assortments and prices can be used as effective guidelines for managers
   to identify and price the best assortments and to rule out nonoptimal
   assortments. Our results suggest that to offer the right set of products
   and prices, category and/or brand managers should create an assortment
   planning process that is aligned with the hierarchical choice process
   consumers commonly follow to make purchasing decisions.

AB It is well known that transaction-specific investments (TSIs) made in
   customers by account managers makes them vulnerable to opportunism by
   customers (i.e., the targets of the investments). The present research
   shows that TSIs made in customers by account managers can also lead them
   to be concerned about internal opportunism by nontargets of the
   investments (e.g., information technology or finance specialists in
   their own teams). Furthermore, it shows that concern about internal
   opportunism leads account managers to engage in internal blocking of
   their own team members (i.e., restricting their access to customers and
   to customer information) 1 which results in lower performance with
   customers. This phenomenon is a conundrum in that account managers
   interested in stronger performance with customers appear to block the
   very functional specialists who can help them attain better performance.
   This research also identifies two types of continuities (account
   manager-customer continuity and specialist-customer continuity) that
   moderate the relationship between TSIs and concern about internal
   opportunism. Building on the literature in economics and organization
   theory, our research suggests that cross-functional teams that are
   designed to bring different functional areas together are more complex
   to manage than previously believed.

AB The budgets for research and development (R&D) and marketing should be
   determined by managers to attain product market advantages. However, in
   response to investor expectations for short-term stock returns, managers
   may modify these budgets myopically to avoid unexpected short-term
   earnings shortfalls, at the cost of long-term profitability. We propose
   that the past behavior of firm stock returns and volatility may create
   investor expectations of short-term financial performance, which drives
   managers to modify either R&D or marketing budgets or both. In the
   context of high-technology firms, a Bayesian vector autoregression
   model, supported by content analysis, shows that few firms exhibit high
   levels of managerial myopia by simultaneously cutting both R&D and
   marketing budgets; instead, firms display moderate myopic reactions, in
   the form of unanticipated decreases in R&D budgets but increased budgets
   for marketing functions. The tendency to manage myopically in response
   to past stock returns and volatility increases as firm size or industry
   concentration decrease.

AB A considerable body of research has extolled the virtues of establishing
   rapport in negotiations. Negotiators who are high in rapport tend to be
   more likely to reach an agreement and more satisfied with the outcome.
   Although rapport generally has been found to have positive effects in
   standard negotiation settings, we investigate the effects of rapport in
   impasse settings, where conflict between negotiators' core needs means
   that a successful deal can only be reached when one or both parties acts
   unethically or "misbehaves," for example, by lying to the negotiation
   partner. In a series of three experiments, we find that negotiators who
   have a high level of rapport are more likely to behave unethically than
   are negotiators who have a low level of rapport. We find this effect
   holds both when high rapport results from the way in which negotiations
   are conducted (face-to-face versus computer mediated) and also when
   rapport is established through a brief rapport-building exercise before
   negotiations begin. Finally, we find that the negative effects
   (unethical behavior)-but not the positive effects (satisfaction with the
   negotiation, trust, and willingness to work in the future with the
   negotiation partner)-of high rapport are reduced when negotiators are
   given a simple reminder before negotiations begin that one's actions can
   have long-term repercussions for one's reputation. Taken together, this
   research supports the idea that, despite its several advantages, in
   certain situations rapport has a dark side, of which negotiators must be
   wary.

AB Many durable products cannot be used without a contingent consumable
   product, e. g., printers require ink, iPods require songs, razors
   require blades, etc. For such products, manufacturers may be able to
   lock in consumers by making their products incompatible with consumables
   that are produced by other firms. We examine the effectiveness of such a
   strategy in the presence of strategic consumers who anticipate the
   future prices of both the durable product and the contingent consumable.
   Under a lock-in strategy, the manufacturer has pricing power over the
   contingent consumable, which she can use to extract additional rents
   from higher valuation consumers, but such pricing power may also reduce
   consumers' willingness to pay for the durable because it subjects them
   to being held up with higher consumables prices in the future.
   Restricting our attention to linear pricing policies, we find that if
   the manufacturer can commit to shutting down production of her durable
   after an initial one-time sale, then competition from another consumable
   of an appropriately degraded level of quality can benefit the
   manufacturer by mitigating consumers' fears of being held up. On the
   other hand, when the manufacturer cannot commit to shutting down
   production of her durable, then her own output of additional durables
   gives her an incentive to keep consumables prices low, and competition
   in the consumables market is less beneficial.

AB We quantify how user mobile Internet usage relates to unique
   characteristics of the mobile Internet. In particular, we focus on
   examining how the mobile-phone-based content generation behavior of
   users relates to content usage behavior. The key objective is to analyze
   whether there is a positive or negative interdependence between the two
   activities. We use a unique panel data set that consists of
   individual-level mobile Internet usage data that encompass individual
   multimedia content generation and usage behavior. We combine this
   knowledge with data on user calling patterns, such as duration,
   frequency, and locations from where calls are placed, to construct their
   social network and to compute their geographical mobility. We build an
   individual-level simultaneous equation panel data model that controls
   for the different sources of endogeneity of the social network. We find
   that there is a negative and statistically significant temporal
   interdependence between content generation and usage. This finding
   implies that an increase in content usage in the previous period has a
   negative impact on content generation in the current period and vice
   versa. The marginal effect of this interdependence is stronger on
   content usage (up to 8.7%) than on content generation (up to 4.3%). The
   extent of geographical mobility of users has a positive effect on their
   mobile Internet activities. Users more frequently engage in content
   usage compared to content generation when they are traveling. In
   addition, the variance of user mobility has a stronger impact on their
   mobile Internet activities than does the mean. We also find that the
   social network has a strong positive effect on user behavior in the
   mobile Internet. These analyses unpack the mechanisms that stimulate
   user behavior on the mobile Internet. Implications for shaping user
   mobile Internet usage behavior are discussed.

AB Keyword advertising, or sponsored search, is one of the most successful
   advertising models on the Internet. One distinctive feature of keyword
   auctions is that they enable advertisers to adjust their bids and
   rankings dynamically, and the payoffs are realized in real time. We
   capture this unique feature with a dynamic model and identify an
   equilibrium bidding strategy. We find that under certain conditions,
   advertisers may engage in cyclical bid adjustments, and equilibrium
   bidding prices may follow a cyclical pattern: price-escalating phases
   interrupted by price-collapsing phases, similar to an "Edgeworth cycle"
   in the context of dynamic price competitions. Such cyclical bidding
   patterns can take place in both first-and second-price auctions. We
   obtain two data sets containing detailed bidding records of all
   advertisers for a sample of keywords in two leading search engines. Our
   empirical framework, based on a Markov switching regression model,
   suggests the existence of such cyclical bidding strategies. The cyclical
   bid-updating behavior we find cannot be easily explained with static
   models. This paper emphasizes the importance of adopting a dynamic
   perspective in studying equilibrium outcomes of keyword auctions.

AB W e address the value of quick response production practices when
   selling to a forward-looking consumer population with uncertain,
   heterogeneous valuations for a product. Consumers have the option of
   purchasing the product early, before its value has been learned, or
   delaying the purchase decision until a time at which valuation
   uncertainty has been resolved. Whereas individual consumer valuations
   are uncertain ex ante, the market size is uncertain to the firm. The
   firm may either commit to a single production run at a low unit cost
   prior to learning demand, or commit to a quick response strategy that
   allows additional production after learning additional demand
   information. We find that the value of quick response is generally lower
   with strategic (forward-looking) customers than with nonstrategic
   (myopic) customers in this setting. Indeed, it is possible for a quick
   response strategy to decrease the profit of the firm, though whether
   this occurs depends on various characteristics of the market;
   specifically, we identify conditions under which quick response
   increases profit (when prices are increasing, when dissatisfied
   consumers can return the product at a cost to the firm) and conditions
   under which quick response may decrease profit (when prices are constant
   or when consumer returns are not allowed).

AB W e consider the problem of dynamic portfolio optimization in a
   discrete-time, finite-horizon setting. Our general model considers risk
   aversion, portfolio constraints (e. g., no short positions), return
   predictability, and transaction costs. This problem is naturally
   formulated as a stochastic dynamic program. Unfortunately, with nonzero
   transaction costs, the dimension of the state space is at least as large
   as the number of assets, and the problem is very difficult to solve with
   more than one or two assets. In this paper, we consider several
   easy-to-compute heuristic trading strategies that are based on
   optimizing simpler models. We complement these heuristics with upper
   bounds on the performance with an optimal trading strategy. These bounds
   are based on the dual approach developed in Brown et al. (Brown, D. B.,
   J. E. Smith, P. Sun. 2009. Information relaxations and duality in
   stochastic dynamic programs. Oper. Res. 58(4) 785-801). In this context,
   these bounds are given by considering an investor who has access to
   perfect information about future returns but is penalized for using this
   advance information. These heuristic strategies and bounds can be
   evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate these heuristics and
   bounds in numerical experiments with a risk-free asset and 3 or 10 risky
   assets. In many cases, the performance of the heuristic strategy is very
   close to the upper bound, indicating that the heuristic strategies are
   very nearly optimal.

AB T his paper analyzes the optimal procurement, processing, and production
   decisions of a meat-processing company (hereafter, a "packer") in a beef
   supply chain. The packer processes fed cattle to produce two beef
   products, program (premium) boxed beef and commodity boxed beef, in
   fixed proportions, but with downward substitution of the premium product
   for the commodity product. The packer can source input (fed cattle) from
   a contract market, where long-term contracts are signed in advance of
   the required delivery time, and from a spot market on the spot day.
   Contract prices are taken to be of a general window form, linear in the
   spot price but capped by upper and lower limits on realized contract
   price. Our analysis provides managerial insights on the interaction of
   window contract terms with processing options. We show that the packer
   benefits from a low correlation between the spot price and product
   market uncertainties, and this is independent of the form of the window
   contract. Although the expected revenues from processing increase in
   spot price variability, the overall impact on profitability depends on
   the parameters of the window contract. Using a calibration based on the

   long-term contracting as a complement to spot sourcing in the beef
   supply chain. Our comparative statics results provide some rules of
   thumb for the packer for the strategic management of the procurement
   portfolio. In particular, we show that higher variability (higher spot

   increases the profits of the packer, but decreases the reliance on the
   contract market relative to the spot market.

AB W hen learning of product characteristics takes some time, a firm
   introducing a new durable faces the trade-off between releasing early to
   an uninformed market and deferring release to a better-informed market.
   In a two-period monopoly, we examine the strategic interaction between
   exogenous learning (EL) and seller-induced learning (SIL) and the firm's
   product release and pricing strategies. The familiar, direct effect of
   strong learning is to facilitate a higher price for informed customers.
   We point out its indirect effect of inducing a higher period 1 price for
   uninformed customers (by lowering their expected utility from learning).
   These two effects underlie three major results. First, a strong learning
   intensity does not always imply deferred release. Surprisingly, for
   medium unit costs, the firm releases late (early) when learning
   intensity is weak (strong). Second, SIL facilitates different product
   release strategies, depending on the unit cost level. Potential SIL
   investment facilitates early release for low or medium unit costs, but
   may facilitate deferred release for high unit costs. Lastly, when
   customers have heterogeneous prior valuation, the high-end customers may
   buy early at a lower price and the low-end customers may buy later at a
   higher price, contrary to the usual skim pricing with informed
   customers.

AB Two recent papers on managing new product diffusion decisions under

   al. (Ho, T.-H., S. Savin, C. Terwiesch. 2002. Managing demand and sales
   dynamics in new product diffusion under supply constraint. Management
   Sci. 48(2) 187-206) show that it is never optimal to refuse to satisfy
   any customers when the firm has inventory of the product. On the other
   hand, in a very similar model, Kumar and Swaminathan (Kumar, S., J. M.
   Swaminathan. 2003. Diffusion of innovations under supply constraints.
   Oper. Res. 51(6) 866-879) show that production constraints may in fact
   lead a firm to reject customers' orders even when the firm has the
   inventory to satisfy them (to slow down new product diffusion). We
   provide a counterexample to the results of Ho et al. (2002) and show
   that in their and Kumar and Swaminathan's (2003) models, it may be
   optimal to deny customers a product in inventory. We provide a
   generalization of both models that includes the ability to dynamically
   price the product (and also allows capacity and production costs to vary
   over time). We show that the unintuitive but optimal behavior of denying
   customers products that are in inventory disappears when the firm can
   dynamically set prices.

AB This paper models the generation, circulation, and completion of new
   ideas, showing how markets and innovative firms complement each other in
   a symbiotic relationship. Novel ideas are initially incomplete and
   require further insight before yielding a valuable innovation. Finding
   the complementary piece requires ideas to circulate, which creates
   appropriation risks. Circulation of ideas in markets ensures efficient
   completion, but because ideas can be appropriated, market entrepreneurs
   underinvest in idea generation. Firms can establish boundaries that
   guarantee safe circulation of internal ideas, but because firms need to
   limit idea circulation, they may fail to achieve completion. Spin-offs
   allow firms to benefit from the market's strength at idea completion,
   whereas markets benefit from firms' strength at generating new ideas.
   The model predicts diverse organizational forms (internal ventures,
   spin-offs, and start-ups) coexisting and mutually reinforcing each
   other. The analysis provides new insights into the structure of
   innovation-driven clusters such as Silicon Valley.

   Departing from the common practice of using survival as a measure of
   entrepreneurial performance, we model both failure and cashout
   (liquidity event) as conditioned by the same underlying process.
   High-opportunity-cost entrepreneurs prefer a shorter time to success,
   even if this also implies failing more quickly, whereas entrepreneurs
   with fewer outside alternatives will choose less aggressive strategies
   and, consequently, linger on longer. We formalize this intuition with a
   simple model. Using a novel data set of information security start-ups,
   we find that entrepreneurs with high opportunity costs are not only more
   likely to cash out more quickly but are also more likely to fail faster.
   Not only is survival a poor indicator of performance, but its use as one
   obscures the relationship between entrepreneurial characteristics,
   entrepreneurial strategies, and outcomes.

AB This paper develops a real options model to understand two distinct
   roles played by intellectual capital in corporate financing decisions.
   Whereas limiting a firm's debt capacity because of its low liquidation
   value, intellectual capital enhances a firm's debt capacity through its
   positive impact on earnings. Our model shows that the former dominates
   or is dominated by the latter, depending on whether the rate of
   dissipation of intellectual capital upon default is larger or smaller
   than a critical level, respectively. Using patent-based and
   research-and-development-based variables as proxies for intellectual
   capital, we find robust evidence that the relation between intellectual
   capital and leverage is positive. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation
   increase in the level of a firm's intellectual capital is associated
   with an increase of 6.6% to 21.1% in its market leverage. We further
   find this positive relation to be stronger for biotechnology firms.

   where alternatives are described as probability distributions and
   situations where the decision maker must experience unknown probability

   are detected across contexts as regards utility and loss aversion.
   Whereas decision weights exhibit similar qualitative properties across
   contexts typically found under prospect theory, our data suggest that,
   for gains at least, the subjective treatment of uncertainty in
   experience-based and description-based decisions is significantly
   different. More specifically, we observe a less pronounced overweighting
   of small probabilities and a more pronounced underweighting of moderate

   for losses, no significant differences were observed in the evaluation

AB Commerce depends on buyers and sellers fulfilling their contractual
   obligations; mechanisms inducing such performance are essential to
   well-functioning markets. Internet-enabled reputation mechanisms that
   collect and disseminate consumer feedback have emerged as prominent
   means for inducing seller performance in online and offline markets.
   This paper compares the ability of reputation and more traditional
   litigation-like mechanisms for dispute resolution to induce efficient
   economic outcomes. We use a game-theoretic formulation and derive
   results for their relative efficiency and effectiveness individually or
   as complements. We find that the popular view of reputation as an
   efficient and relatively costless way to induce seller effort under all
   circumstances is incorrect; reputation is less efficient than litigation
   in inducing any given level of effort. Thus, reputation improves
   efficiency only in settings where the high cost of litigation,
   insufficient damage levels, or low court accuracy induce suboptimal
   effort or cause market failure. When adverse selection is important,
   reputation helps reveal the true types of market participants, which may
   offset its higher cost of inducing effort. Finally, adding reputation to
   existing litigation mechanisms increases seller effort and may require
   adjusting damage awards to avoid inducing excessive effort that reduces
   economic efficiency.

AB How can firms extract value from already-implemented information
   technologies (IT) that support the work processes of employees? One
   approach is to stimulate employees to engage in post-adoptive extended
   use, i.e., to learn and apply more of the available functions of the
   implemented technologies to support their work. Such learning behavior
   of extending functions in use is ingrained in a process by which users
   make sense of the technologies in the context of their work system. This
   study draws on sensemaking theory to develop a model to understand the
   antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of customer service
   employees' extended use of customer relationship management (CRM)
   technologies. The model is tested using multisource longitudinal data
   collected through a field study of one of the world's largest
   telecommunications service providers. Our results suggest that employees
   engage in post-adoptive sensemaking at two levels: technology and work
   system. We found that sensemaking at both of these levels impacts the
   extended use of CRM technologies. Employees' sensemaking at the
   technology level is influenced by employees' assessment of technology
   quality, whereas employees' sensemaking at the work system level is
   influenced by customers' assessment of service quality. Moreover, in the
   case of low technology quality and low service quality, specific
   mechanisms for employee feedback should be conceptualized and aligned at
   two levels: through employee participation at the technology level and
   through work system coordination at the work system level. Such
   alignment can mitigate the undesirable effect of low technology quality
   and low service quality, thereby facilitating extended use. Importantly,
   we found that extended use amplifies employees' service capacity,
   leading to better objective performance. Put together, our findings
   highlight the critical role of employees' sensemaking about the
   implemented technologies in promoting their extended use of IT and
   improving their work performance.

AB We use hospital-level discharge data from cardiac patients in California
   to estimate the effects of focus on operational performance. We examine
   focus at three distinct levels of the organization-at the firm level, at
   the operating unit level, and at the process flow level. We find that
   focus at each of these levels is associated with improved outcomes,
   namely, faster services at higher levels of quality, as indicated by
   lower lengths of stay (LOS) and reduced mortality rates. We then analyze
   the extent to which the superior operational outcome is driven by
   focused hospitals truly excelling in their operations or by focused
   hospitals simply "cherry-picking" easy-to-treat patients. To do this, we
   use an instrumental variables estimation strategy that effectively
   randomizes the assignment of patients to hospitals. After controlling
   for selective patient admissions, the previously observed benefits of
   firm level focus disappear; focused hospitals no longer demonstrate a
   statistically significant reduction in LOS or mortality rate. However,
   at more granular measures of focus within the hospital (e.g., operating
   unit level), we find that more focus leads to a shorter LOS, even after
   controlling for selective admission effects.

   covenanted veto rights even though they are shareholders who have access
   to other powerful governance solutions. Unlike bank loans and bonds,
   venture capital (VC) contracts exhibit considerable variation in their
   contractual designs. I exploit this variation to confirm the argument
   that covenants are in place to overcome a conflict of interest that
   arises from debt-like contractual features of a venture capitalist's
   preferred stock. In particular, I find that contracts with higher fixed
   payoffs include 1.6 more covenants than do contracts with lower fixed
   payoffs. Similarly, VC contracts with no VC board majority requirement
   include 0.6 more covenants than do contracts that require a VC board
   majority. Covenants are also more common with older companies and when
   fewer VCs invest in a round. My findings contribute to both the debt
   covenant literature and the entrepreneurial finance literature.

   about their ability to raise capital from investors. We exploit the
   timing of new fund launches in the hedge fund industry to distinguish
   between agency and capability effects in firm product diversification
   decisions, using a large survivor-bias-free panel data set on the hedge
   fund industry from 1994 to 2006. Empirically we show that diversifying
   firms' excess returns are high relative to those of other firms prior to
   diversification and fall within firm following diversification, but are
   six basis points higher per month per unit of risk ex post compared to a
   matched sample of focused firms. The evidence suggests that managers
   exploit asymmetric information about their own ability to time
   diversification decisions; yet, the discipline of markets ensures that
   better firms diversify, on average. The results provide large-sample
   empirical evidence that agency effects and firm capabilities jointly

AB Motivated by the waiting lines between the U.S.-Canadian border
   crossings, we investigate a security-check system with both security and
   customer service goals. In such a system, every customer has to be
   inspected by the first-stage inspector, but only a proportion of
   customers need to go through the second stage for further inspection.
   This "further inspection proportion," affecting both security screening
   and the system congestion, becomes a key decision variable for the
   security-check system. Using a stylized two-stage queueing model, we
   established the convexity of the expected waiting cost function. With
   such a property, the optimal further inspection proportion can be
   determined to achieve the balance of the two goals and the service
   capacities can be classified into "security-favorable,"
   "security-unfavorable," or "security-infeasible" categories. A specific
   capacity category implies if the security and customer service goals are
   consistent or in conflict. In addition, we have verified that the
   properties discovered in the stylized model also hold approximately in a

AB Science and technology advances drive firms to continually enhance their
   product's performance and launch sequentially improving offerings. Firms
   face challenges in marketing such improving products to well-informed,
   forward-looking consumers who anticipate product improvements and seek
   to delay their purchase timing. Product design, specifically a modular
   upgradable architecture in which improving and stable subsystems of a
   product are separated and selectively upgraded, can be a valuable
   approach for marketers to alleviate consumer concerns about product
   obsolescence. However, such an architecture-based approach can present
   new challenges as well, and dealing with them requires carefully
   coordinated cross-functional decision making by the firm. In this paper,
   we identify and formalize the notion of design inconsistency, which
   refers to the monopolist firm's inability to commit to future product
   design architectures. We find that firms experience design inconsistency
   even when they are able to commit to future prices, and design
   inconsistency lowers firm profits as well as consumer surplus. We then
   derive a joint product architecture and pricing approach to solve this
   problem; this enables an innovating firm to optimally and in a
   time-consistent manner launch modular upgradable products. The modeling
   and analysis in the paper lends insight into types of markets and
   products for which modular upgradability is most appropriate and offers
   guidelines on making pricing and product design decisions jointly for
   managing sequential innovation.

AB Preference reversals have been widely studied using risky or riskless
   gambles. However, little is known about preference reversals under
   ambiguity (unknown probabilities). Subjects were asked to make a binary
   choice between ambiguous P-bets (big likelihood of giving small prize)
   and ambiguous $-bets (small likelihood of giving large prize) and their
   willingness to accept was elicited. Subjects then performed the same two
   tasks with risky bets, where the probability of winning for a given
   risky bet is the center of the probability interval of the corresponding
   ambiguous bet. Preference reversals are not only replicated under
   ambiguity but are even stronger than are those under risk. This is due
   to higher elicited prices for the $-bet and lower elicited prices for
   the P-bet under ambiguity than under risk. This result can be explained
   by the shape of the weighting function for different levels of
   uncertainty and for different elicitation modes.

AB This paper aims to extend the analytical tractability of the
   Black-Scholes model to alternative models with arbitrary jump size
   distributions. More precisely, we propose a jump diffusion model for
   asset prices whose jump sizes have a mixed-exponential distribution,
   which is a weighted average of exponential distributions but with
   possibly negative weights. The new model extends existing models, such
   as hyperexponential and double-exponential jump diffusion models,
   because the mixed-exponential distribution can approximate any
   distribution as closely as possible, including the normal distribution
   and various heavy-tailed distributions. The mixed-exponential jump
   diffusion model can lead to analytical solutions for Laplace transforms
   of prices and sensitivity parameters for path-dependent options such as
   lookback and barrier options. The Laplace transforms can be inverted via
   the Euler inversion algorithm. Numerical experiments indicate that the
   formulae are easy to implement and accurate. The analytical solutions
   are made possible mainly because we solve a high-order
   integro-differential equation explicitly. A calibration example for SPY
   options shows that the model can provide a reasonable fit even for
   options with very short maturity, such as one day.

   characteristics are related to corporate investment, debt usage, and
   firm value. During the 1930-1938 Depression era, when the corporate
   sector was shocked by an unprecedented downturn, we document a relation
   between board characteristics and firm performance that varies in
   economically sensible ways: Complex firms (that would benefit more from
   board advice) exhibit a positive relation between board size and firm
   value, and simple firms exhibit a negative relation between board size
   and firm value. Moreover, simple firms with large boards do not downsize
   adequately in response to the severe economic contraction: they invest
   more (or shrink less) and use more debt during the 1930s. We document
   similar effects for the number of outside directors on the board.
   Finally, we also find that companies with properly aligned governance
   structures are more likely to replace the company president following
   poor performance.

AB The resource-based view argues that acquisitions can build competitive
   advantage partially through retention of valuable human capital of the
   target firm. However, making commitments to retain and motivate
   successful top managers is a challenge when contracts are not
   enforceable. Investigating the conditions under which target chief
   executive officers (CEOs) are retained in a sample of mergers in the
   1990s, we find greater retention of better-performing and higher-paid
   CEOs-both measures of valuable human capital. We also show that the
   performance-retention link is stronger when the acquirer's governance
   provisions support managers and when the acquirer's CEO owns more
   equity. Although it is not common for acquirers to retain target CEOs,
   we argue that they are more likely to do so when their governance
   environment maintains managerial discretion. Based on a joint analysis
   of retention and governance, our findings are largely consistent with a
   managerial human capital explanation of retention.

AB We consider a finite-horizon, multiechelon inventory system in which the
   surplus of stock can be sold (i.e., disposed) in the secondary markets
   at each stage in the system. What are called nested echelon order-up-to
   policies are shown to be optimal for jointly managing inventory
   replenishments and secondary market sales. Under a general restriction
   on model parameters, we establish that it is optimal not to both sell
   off excess stock and replenish inventory. Secondary market sales
   complicate the structure of the system, so that the classical Clark and
   Scarf echelon reformulation no longer allows for the decomposition of
   the objective function under the optimal policy. We introduce a novel
   class of policies, referred to as the disposal saturation policies, and
   show that there exists a disposal saturation policy, determined
   recursively by a single base-stock level at each echelon, that achieves
   the decomposition of this problem. The resulting optimal replenishment
   policy is shown to be the echelon base-stock policy. We demonstrate the
   heuristic performance of this disposal saturation policy through a
   series of numerical studies: except at extreme ranges of model
   parameters, the policy provides a very good approximation to the optimal
   policy while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We also conduct
   numerical studies to determine the value of the secondary markets for
   multistage supply chains and assess its sensitivity to model parameters.
   The results provide potentially useful insights for companies seeking to
   enter or develop secondary markets for supply chains.

AB This paper analyzes the impact of endogenous credit terms under capital
   market imperfections in a capacity investment setting. We model a
   monopolist firm that decides on its technology choice (flexible versus
   dedicated) and capacity level under demand uncertainty. Differing from
   the majority of the stochastic capacity investment literature, we assume
   that the firm is budget constrained and can relax its budget constraint
   by borrowing from a creditor. The creditor offers technology-specific
   loan contracts to the firm, after which the firm makes its technology
   choice and subsequent decisions. Capital market imperfections impose
   financing frictions on the firm. Our analysis contributes to the
   capacity investment literature by extending the theory of stochastic
   capacity investment and flexible versus dedicated technology choice to
   understand the impact of capital market imperfections, and by analyzing
   the impact of demand uncertainty (variability and correlation) on the
   operational decisions and the performance of the firm under different
   capital market conditions. We demonstrate that the endogenous nature of
   credit terms in imperfect capital markets may modify or reverse
   conclusions concerning capacity investment and technology choice
   obtained under the perfect market assumption and we explain why. The
   theory developed in this paper suggests some rules of thumb for the
   strategic management of the capacity and technology choice in imperfect
   capital markets.

   investment opportunities that arise in their business operations and can
   be undertaken at given reservation prices. The cash flows thus generated
   are not spanned by the securities traded in the financial market and
   cannot be valued uniquely. The intermediary purchases claims against
   these cash flows, pools them together, and sells tranches of primary or
   secondary securities to the investors. We derive necessary and
   sufficient conditions under which projects are undertaken due to the
   intermediary's actions, and firms are amenable to the pool proposed by
   the intermediary, compared to the no-investment option or the option of
   forming alternative pools. We also determine the structure of the new

AB This paper investigates how firms manage risk by examining the
   relationship between financial and operational hedging using a sample of
   bank holding companies. Risk management theory holds that capital market
   imperfections make cash flow volatility costly. I investigate whether
   financial firms consider this cost or focus exclusively on managing
   tradable exposures. After documenting that acquisitions provide
   operational hedging by reducing potentially costly volatility, I find
   that postacquisition financial hedging declines even after controlling
   for the specific underlying risks. In addition, the decrease in
   financial hedging is related to the acquisition's level of operational
   hedging. Larger increases in operational hedging are followed by larger
   declines in financial hedging. These results indicate that firms in this
   sample manage aggregate risk, not just tradable exposures, and that
   operational hedging can substitute for financial hedging.

   Cooperation is surprisingly high for amounts that would normally be

   call a "big peanuts" phenomenon. Utilizing the prior interaction among
   contestants, we find evidence that people have reciprocal preferences.
   Surprisingly, there is little support for conditional cooperation in our

   their opponent might be expected to cooperate. Further, we replicate
   earlier findings that males are less cooperative than females, but this

   sources of individual differences in economic and financial decision
   making. Here we contribute to this burgeoning literature by extending it
   to a number of key behavioral anomalies that are thought to be of
   importance for consumption, savings, and portfolio selection decisions.
   Using survey-based evidence from more than 11,000 Swedish twins, we
   demonstrate that a number of anomalies such as, for instance, the
   conjunction fallacy, default bias, and loss aversion are moderately
   heritable, in contrast, our estimates imply that variation in common
   environment explains only a small share of individual differences. We
   also report suggestive evidence in favor of a shared genetic
   architecture between cognitive reflection and a subset of the studied
   anomalies. These results offer some support for the proposition that the
   heritable variation in behavioral anomalies is partly mediated by
   genetic variance in cognitive ability. Taken together with previous
   findings, our results underline the importance of genetic differences as
   a source of heterogeneity in economic and financial decision making.

   includes an unenforceable "handshake" agreement to take the first-best

AB We investigate whether the gender composition of teams affects their
   economic performance. We study a large business game, played in groups
   of three, in which each group takes the role of a general manager. There
   are two parallel competitions, one involving undergraduates and the
   other involving MBA students. Our analysis shows that teams formed by
   three women are significantly outperformed by all other gender
   combinations, both at the undergraduate and MBA levels. Looking across
   the performance distribution, we find that for undergraduates,
   three-women teams are outperformed throughout, but by as much as 0.47 of
   a standard deviation of the mean at the bottom and by only 0.09 at the
   top. For MBA students, at the top, the best performing group is two men
   and one woman. The differences in performance are explained by
   differences in decision making. We observe that three-women teams are
   less aggressive in their pricing strategies, invest less in research and
   development, and invest more in social sustainability initiatives than
   does any other gender combination.

AB We integrate a case-based model of probability judgment with prospect
   theory to explore asset pricing under uncertainty. Research within the
   "heuristics and biases" tradition suggests that probability judgments
   respond primarily to case-specific evidence and disregard aggregate
   characteristics of the class to which the case belongs, resulting in
   predictable biases. The dual-system framework presented here
   distinguishes heuristic assessments of value and evidence strength from
   deliberative assessments that incorporate prior odds and likelihood
   ratios following Bayes' rule. Hypotheses are derived regarding the
   relative sensitivity of judged probabilities, buying prices, and selling
   prices to case- versus class-based evidence. We test these hypotheses
   using a simulated stock market in which participants can learn from
   experience and have incentives for accuracy. Valuation of uncertain
   assets is found to be largely case based even in this economic setting;
   however, consistent with the framework's predictions, distinct patterns
   of miscalibration are found for buying prices, selling prices, and
   probability judgments.

   that the costliness of initial prosocial behavior positively influences
   whether that behavior leads to consistent future behaviors. We suggest
   that costly prosocial behaviors serve as a signal of prosocial identity
   and that people subsequently behave in line with that self-perception.
   In contrast, costless prosocial acts do not signal much about one's
   prosocial identity, so subsequent behavior is less likely to be
   consistent and may even show the reductions in prosocial behavior
   associated with licensing. The results of a laboratory experiment and a

   whistle-blowing on a peer, an incentive clash between serving the client

   identified ex ante. However, we also find measurable differences between
   what leaders expect and the actual norms of advisers. When there is such
   a mismatch we are able to distinguish mis-communication from ethical
   disagreement between leaders and advisers. Finally, we show that when
   advisers' personal ethical opinions do not match group norms, this
   mismatch is correlated with job dissatisfaction and lying for money in a

AB We show that prospect theory offers a rich theory of casino gambling,
   one that captures several features of actual gambling behavior. First,
   we demonstrate that for a wide range of preference parameter values, a
   prospect theory agent would be willing to gamble in a casino even if the
   casino offers only bets with no skewness and with zero or negative
   expected value. Second, we show that the probability weighting embedded
   in prospect theory leads to a plausible time inconsistency: at the
   moment he enters a casino, the agent plans to follow one particular
   gambling strategy; but after he starts playing, he wants to switch to a
   different strategy. The model therefore predicts heterogeneity in
   gambling behavior: how a gambler behaves depends on whether he is aware
   of the time inconsistency; and, if he is aware of it, on whether he can
   commit in advance to his initial plan of action.

   relative to cases when feedback will not be provided. Individuals who
   ranked better than expected decrease output but expect a better rank in
   the future, whereas those who ranked worse than expected increase output
   but lower their future rank expectations. Feedback helps create a

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of competitive
   compensation between a manager and a worker in the laboratory. To this
   end, we impose a simple agency relationship between two groups of
   subjects termed managers and workers. The manager chooses a compensation
   scheme for the worker from either a piece rate or a tournament payment
   scheme and is paid based on the workers performance in the task. The
   results indicate that when given information about worker ability, male
   managers choose the tournament significantly less often for a female
   worker. On the other hand, when no information about worker ability is
   given to the manager, there is no difference in compensation choice for
   the worker, although male and female managers differ significantly in
   their own preferences for compensation scheme. We conjecture that these
   results are tied to the fact that there is a measurable stereotype that
   females are worse at the task relative to males, although further
   research is needed in this regard.

   there will be more delayed trading in complementary markets is
   supported, but we find no support for the prediction that there will be
   more bluffing in complementary markets. However, the theoretical

AB In many circumstances, evaluations are based on empirical data. However,
   some observations may be imprecise, meaning that it is not entirely
   clear what occurred in them. We address the question of how beliefs are
   formed in these situations. The individual in our model is essentially a
   "frequentist." He first makes a subjective judgment about the occurrence
   of the event for each imprecise observation. This may be any number
   between zero and one. He then evaluates the event by its "subjective"
   frequency of occurrence. Our model connects the method of processing
   imprecise observations with the individual's attitude toward ambiguity.
   An individual who in imprecise observations puts low (high) weight on
   the possibility that an event occurred is ambiguity averse (loving). An
   experiment supports the main assertions of the model: with precise data,
   subjects behave as if there were no ambiguity, whereas with imprecise
   data subjects turn out to be ambiguity averse.

   large survey of directors, we show that female and male directors differ
   systematically in their core values and risk attitudes, but in ways that
   differ from gender differences in the general population. These results
   are robust to controlling for differences in observable characteristics.
   Consistent with findings for the population, female directors are more
   benevolent and universally concerned but less power oriented than male
   directors. However, in contrast to findings for the population, they are
   less tradition and security oriented than their male counterparts. They
   are also more risk loving than male directors. Thus, having a woman on
   the board need not lead to more risk-averse decision making.

   number of directors belong to the same social networks, the CEO is less
   likely to be dismissed for poor performance. The results are robust to
   different measures of performance and networks, and consistent after
   controlling for CEO ability and connected boards' superior information.
   Although being ousted is costly for all CEOs-who must then devote time
   to finding new employment and only succeed in 62% of cases-socially
   connected CEOs are more likely to find new and better employment after a
   forced departure. Evidence from this paper suggests that close social

   advocates concentration in a few familiar assets, and Markowitz, who
   advocates diversification. We use the concepts of ambiguity and
   ambiguity aversion to formalize the idea of an investor's "familiarity"
   toward assets. The model shows that for any given level of expected
   returns, the optimal portfolio depends on two quantities: relative
   ambiguity across assets and the standard deviation of the expected
   return estimate for each asset. If both quantities are low, then the
   optimal portfolio consists of a mix of familiar and unfamiliar assets;
   moreover, an increase in correlation between assets causes an investor
   to increase concentration in familiar assets (flight to familiarity).
   Alternatively, if both quantities are high, then the optimal portfolio
   contains only the familiar asset(s), as Keynes would have advocated. In
   the extreme case in which both quantities are very high, no risky asset
   is held (nonparticipation).

   based on familiarity. Using a utility formulation inspired by regret
   theory, we derive closed-form solutions. When the degree of foreign
   aversion is high in a given country, investors place a high valuation on
   domestic equity, which results in a low expected return. Thus, the model
   generates the simple prediction that a country's degree of home bias and
   the expected return of its domestic assets should be inversely related.
   Our predicted relation between the degree of home bias and a country's
   expected return has the opposite sign predicted by models that assume
   some form of market segmentation. Using International Monetary Fund
   portfolio data, we find that expected returns are negatively related to
   home bias.

   forecasts of one-year-ahead earnings and long-term earnings growth are
   relatively more optimistic for "uncertain" or "difficult-to-value"
   firms. Adding these forecast errors to a regression of stock returns on
   sentiment absorbs a sizable fraction of the explanatory power of
   sentiment for the cross section of future returns. This finding provides
   direct support for the notion that investor sentiment affects the
   earnings expectations of hard-to-value firms. Additional tests suggest
   that this bias in expectations is unlikely to be strategic in nature.
   Our results provide new insight into the mechanism through which

AB This paper shows that an important link between investor sentiment and
   firm. overvaluation is optimistic earnings expectations, and that
   management earnings guidance helps resolve sentiment-driven
   overvaluation. Using previously identified firm characteristics, we find
   that most of the negative returns to uncertain firms in months following
   high-sentiment periods fall within the three-day window around the
   issuance of management earnings guidance. Comparisons of guidance months
   to nonguidance months show that guidance issuance affects the magnitude
   and not just the daily distribution of negative returns. There is also
   some evidence of negative returns around earnings announcements for
   firms that previously issued guidance, suggesting that guidance does not
   entirely correct optimistic earnings expectations. To provide additional
   insight into the strength of the guidance effect, we show that the
   market reacts more strongly to surprises, particularly negative
   surprises, following high-sentiment periods. Finally, firms with higher
   transient institutional ownership are less likely to guide, and their
   guidance is less likely to contain bad news following high-sentiment
   periods, indicating that managers with a short-term focus are hesitant
   to correct optimistic market expectations.

AB We show that U.S. stock and Treasury futures prices respond sharply to
   recurring stale information releases: In particular, we identify a
   unique macroeconomic series-the U.S. Leading Economic Index (R)
   (LET)-which is released monthly and constructed as a summary statistic
   of previously released inputs. We show that a front-running strategy
   that trades S&P 500 futures in the direction of the announcement a day
   before its release and then trades in the opposite direction of the
   announcement following its release generates an average annual return of
   close to 8%. These patterns are more pronounced for high beta stocks,
   for stocks that are more difficult to arbitrage, and during times when
   investors' sensitivity to firm-specific stale information is high.
   Treasury futures exhibit similar, albeit less pronounced, price
   patterns. Other measures of information arrival, such as price
   volatility and volume, spike following the release. These empirical
   findings suggest that some investors are inattentive to the stale nature
   of the information included in the LEI releases, instead interpreting it
   as new information, and thereby causing temporary yet significant
   mispricing.

AB We use the popular television show Mad Money, hosted by Jim Cramer, to
   test theories of attention and limits to arbitrage. Stock
   recommendations on Mad Money constitute attention shocks to a large
   audience of individual traders. We find that stock recommendations lead
   to large overnight returns that subsequently reverse over the next few
   months. The spike-reversal pattern is strongest among small, illiquid
   stocks that are hard to arbitrage. Using daily Nielsen ratings as a
   direct measure of attention, we find that the overnight return is
   strongest when high-income viewership is high. We also find weak price
   effects among sell, recommendations. Taken together, the evidence
   supports the retail attention hypothesis of Barber and Odean (Barber,

AB We investigate whether cultural differences between professional

   international syndicated bank loans. We find that more culturally
   distant lead banks offer borrowers smaller loans at a higher interest
   rate and are more likely to require third-party guarantees. These
   effects do not disappear following repeated interaction between borrower
   and lender and are economically sizable: A one-standard-deviation
   increase in cultural distance, approximately the distance between Canada
   and the United States or between Japan and South Korea, is associated
   with a 6.5 basis point higher loan spread; the loan spread increases by
   about 23 basis points if the bank-firm match involves culturally more
   distant parties, for example, from Japan and the United States. We also
   find that cultural differences not only affect the relation between
   borrower and lender, but also hamper risk sharing between participant
   banks and culturally distant lead banks.

   whether information about imminent future dividends can abate bubbles in

   informed traders have significantly smaller bubbles than markets with
   symmetrically informed or uninformed traders. Hence, fundamental values
   are better reflected in market prices-implying higher market
   efficiency-when some traders know more than others about future
   dividends. This suggests that bubbles are abated when traders know that

AB Despite the central role of arbitrage in finance and economic theory,
   there is limited evidence of the factors that create and eliminate
   arbitrage opportunities, how often arbitrage occurs, and how profitable
   it is. We address these gaps via a transaction-level analysis of spatial
   arbitrage in the wholesale automotive market. We investigate why
   arbitrage opportunities are created by analyzing how sellers choose
   where to sell vehicles. We find that the attention sellers pay to the
   distribution of a vehicle is negatively related to the probability that
   it is arbitraged. Arbitrage occurs in approximately 1% of transactions,
   although electronic trading is making arbitrage less prevalent by
   improving buyer/seller matching across locations. Arbitrage yields a
   5.6% return on average, although arbitrageurs take a loss 14% of the
   time. Our results contribute to the literature on arbitrage, the effect
   of attention allocation on market outcomes, and the effect of
   information technology on market efficiency.

   numbers. Further, the size of the buy-sell imbalance is monotonic in the
   roundness of the adjacent round number (i.e., largest adjacent to
   integers, second-largest adjacent to half-dollars, etc.). Conditioning
   on the price path, we find much stronger excess buying (selling) by
   liquidity demanders when the ask falls (bid rises) to reach the integer
   than when it crosses the integer. We discuss and test three explanations
   for these results. Finally, 24-hour returns also vary by price point,
   and buy-sell imbalances are a major determinant of that variation across
   price points. Buying (selling) by liquidity demanders below (above)
   round numbers yield losses approaching $1 billion per year.

AB We find that initial public offerings (IPOs) with high expected skewness
   experience significantly greater first-day returns. The skewness effect
   is stronger during periods of high investor sentiment and is related to
   differences in skewness across industries as well as to time-series
   variation in the level of skewness in the market. IPOs with high
   expected skewness earn more negative abnormal returns in the following
   one to five years. High expected skewness is also associated with a
   higher fraction of small-sized trades on the first day of trading, which
   is consistent with a greater shift in holdings from institutions to
   individuals. The results suggest that first-day IPO returns are related
   to a preference for skewness.

AB There is a well-known intuition linking prospect theory with the
   disposition effect, the tendency of investors to sell assets that have
   risen in value rather than fallen. Recently, several authors have
   studied rigorous models in an attempt to formalize the intuition.
   However, some have found it difficult to predict a disposition effect
   while others produce a more extreme prediction where investors never
   voluntarily sell at a loss. We solve a model of asset liquidation where
   investors realize utility over gains and losses, and utility is concave
   over gains and convex over losses. Under the preferences of Tversky and
   Kahneman (Tversky, A., D. Kahneman. 1992. Advances in prospect theory:
   Cumulative representation of uncertainty. J. Risk Uncertainty 5(4)
   297-323) and lognormal asset prices, investors exhibit a disposition
   effect as gains are realized at a greater rate than losses. Nonetheless,
   in contrast to the extant literature, we find that the investor will
   "give up" and sell at a loss when the asset has a sufficiently low
   Sharpe ratio.

AB Based on the proposition that leasing is environmentally superior to
   selling, some firms have adopted a leasing strategy and others promote
   their existing leasing programs as environmentally superior to "green"
   their image. The argument is that because a leasing firm retains
   ownership of the off-lease units, it has an incentive to remarket them
   or invest in designing a more durable product, resulting in a lower
   volume of new production and disposal. However, leasing might be
   environmentally inferior because of the direct control the firm has over
   the off-lease products, which may prompt the firm to remove them from
   the market to avoid cannibalizing the demand for new products. Motivated
   by these issues, we adopt a life-cycle environmental impact perspective
   and analytically investigate if leasing can be both more profitable and
   have a lower total environmental impact. We find that leasing can be
   environmentally worse despite remarketing all off-lease products and
   greener than selling despite the mid-life removal of off-lease products.
   Our analysis also provides insights for environmental groups and
   entities that use different approaches to improve the environmental
   performance of business practices. We show that imposing disposal fees
   or encouraging remanufacturing, under some conditions, can actually lead
   to higher environmental impact. We also identify when educating
   consumers to be more environmentally conscious can improve the relative
   environmental performance of leasing.

AB A common justification for organizational change is that the
   circumstances in which the organization finds itself have changed,
   thereby eroding the value of utilizing existing knowledge. On the
   surface, the claim that organizations should adapt by generating new
   knowledge seems obvious and compelling. However, this standard wisdom
   overlooks the possibility that the reward to generating new knowledge
   may itself be eroded if change is an ongoing property of the
   environment. This observation in turn suggests that environmental change
   is not a self-evident call for strategies of greater exploration.
   Indeed, under some conditions the appropriate response to environmental
   change is a renewed focus on exploiting existing knowledge and
   opportunities. We develop a computational model based on the canonical
   multiarmed bandit formulation of exploration and exploitation. We
   endeavor to understand the mechanisms by which environmental change acts
   to make purposeful efforts at organizational adaptation less (or more)
   valuable.

AB I derive pricing kernels in which the market volatility is endogenously
   determined. Using the Taylor expansion series of the representative
   investor's marginal utility, I show that the price of market volatility
   risk is restricted by the investor's risk aversion and skewness
   preference. The risk aversion is estimated to be between two and five
   and is significant. The price of the market volatility is negative.
   Consistent with economic theory, I find that the pricing kernel
   decreases in the market index return and increases in market volatility.
   The projection of the estimated pricing kernel onto a polynomial
   function of the market return produces puzzling behaviors, which can be
   observed in the pricing kernel and absolute risk aversion functions. The
   inclusion of additional terms in the Taylor expansion series of the
   investor's marginal utility produces a pricing kernel function of market
   stochastic volatility, stochastic skewness, and stochastic kurtosis. The
   prices of risk of these moments are restricted by the investor's risk
   aversion, skewness preference, and kurtosis preference. The prices of
   risk of these moments should not be confused with the price of risk of
   powers of the market return, such as coskewness and cokurtosis.

   the optimal compensation is increasing but concave in output value if
   the manager is more risk averse than a log-utility manager. Second, when
   the manager has a log utility, a linear contract is optimal when there
   is no explicit lower bound on the compensation, and an option contract
   is optimal when there is an explicit lower bound. Third, optimal effort
   is stochastic (state dependent). Fourth, consistent with empirical

AB In its complexity and its vulnerability to market volatility, the
   constant proportion debt obligation (CPDO) might be viewed as the poster
   child for the excesses of financial engineering in the credit market.
   This paper examines the CPDO as a case study in model risk in the rating
   of complex structured products. We demonstrate that the models used by
   Standard and Poor's (S&P) and Moody's fail in-sample specification tests
   even during the precrisis period and in particular understate the
   kurtosis of spread changes. Because stochastic volatility is the most
   natural explanation for the excess kurtosis, we estimate an extended
   version of the S&P model with stochastic volatility and find that the
   volatility-of-volatility is large and significant. An implication is
   that agency model-implied probabilities of attaining high spread levels
   were biased downward, which in turn biased the rating upward. We
   conclude with larger lessons for the rating of complex products and for
   modeling credit risk in general.

AB A key input to the call center staffing process is a forecast for the
   number of calls arriving. Density forecasts of arrival rates are needed
   for analytical call center models, which assume Poisson arrivals with a
   stochastic arrival rate. Density forecasts of call volumes can be used
   in simulation models and are also important for the analysis of
   outsourcing contracts. A forecasting method, which has previously shown
   strong potential, is Holt-Winters exponential smoothing adapted for
   modeling the intraday and intraweek cycles in intraday data. To enable
   density forecasting of the arrival volume and rate, we develop a Poisson
   count model, with gamma distributed arrival rate, which captures the
   essential features of this exponential smoothing method. The apparent
   stationary level in our data leads us to develop versions of the new
   model for series with stationary levels. We evaluate forecast accuracy
   up to two weeks ahead using data from three organizations. We find that
   the stationary level models improve prediction beyond approximately two
   days ahead, and that these models perform well in comparison with
   sophisticated benchmarks. This is confirmed by the results of a call
   center simulation model, which demonstrates the use of arrival rate
   density forecasting to support staffing decisions.

AB Sequential sampling problems arise in stochastic simulation and many
   other applications. Sampling is used to infer the unknown performance of
   several alternatives before one alternative is selected as best. This
   paper presents new economically motivated fully sequential sampling
   procedures to solve such problems, called economics of selection
   procedures. The optimal procedure is derived for comparing a known
   standard with one alternative whose unknown reward is inferred with
   sampling. That result motivates heuristics when multiple alternatives
   have unknown rewards. The resulting procedures are more effective in
   numerical experiments than any previously proposed procedure of which we
   are aware and are easily implemented. The key driver of the improvement
   is the use of dynamic programming to model sequential sampling as an
   option to learn before selecting an alternative. It accounts for the
   expected benefit of adaptive stopping policies for sampling, rather than
   of one-stage policies, as is common in the literature.

AB Motivated by applications in financial services, we consider a seller
   who offers prices sequentially to a stream of potential customers,
   observing either success or failure in each sales attempt. The
   parameters of the underlying demand model are initially unknown, so each
   price decision involves a trade-off between learning and earning.
   Attention is restricted to the simplest kind of model uncertainty, where
   one of two demand models is known to apply, and we focus initially on
   performance of the myopic Bayesian policy (MBP), variants of which are
   commonly used in practice. Because learning is passive under the MBP
   (that is, learning only takes place as a by-product of actions that have
   a different purpose), it can lead to incomplete learning and poor profit
   performance. However, under one additional assumption, a constrained
   variant of the myopic policy is shown to have the following strong
   theoretical virtue: the expected performance gap relative to a
   clairvoyant who knows the underlying demand model is bounded by a
   constant as the number of sales attempts becomes large.

AB Organizations increasingly seek solutions to their open-ended design
   problems by employing a contest approach in which search over a solution
   space is delegated to outside agents. We study this new class of
   problems, which are costly to specify, pose credibility issues for the
   focal firm, and require finely tuned awards for meeting the firm's
   needs. Through an analytical model, we examine the relationship between
   problem specification, award structure, and breadth of solution space
   searched by outside agents toward characterizing how a firm should
   effectively manage such open-ended design contests. Our results
   independently establish and offer a causal explanation for an
   interesting phenomenon observed in design contests-clustering of
   searchers in specific regions of the solution space. The analysis also
   yields a cautionary finding-although the breadth of search increases
   with number of searchers, the relationship is strongly sublinear
   (logarithmic). Finally, from the practical perspective of managing the
   delegated search process, our results offer rules of thumb on how many
   and what size awards should be offered, as well as the extent to which
   firms should undertake problem specification, contingent on the nature
   (open-endedness and uncertainty) of the design problem solution being
   delegated to outside agents.

AB This paper examines the informational role of product ratings. We build
   a theoretical model in which ratings can help consumers figure out how
   much they would enjoy the product. In our model, a high average rating
   indicates a high product quality, whereas a high variance of ratings is
   associated with a niche product, one that some consumers love and others
   hate. Based on its informational role, a higher variance would
   correspond to a higher subsequent demand if and only if the average
   rating is low. We find empirical evidence that is consistent with the
   theoretical predictions with book data from Amazon.com and BN.com. A
   higher standard deviation of ratings on Amazon improves a book's
   relative sales rank when the average rating is lower than 4.1 stars,
   which is true for 35% of all the books in our sample.

AB In this paper we distinguish between two types of white lies: those that
   help others at the expense of the person telling the lie, which we term
   altruistic white lies, and those that help both others and the liar,
   which we term Pareto white lies. We find that a large fraction of
   participants are reluctant to tell even a Pareto white lie,
   demonstrating a pure lie aversion independent of any social preferences
   for outcomes. In contrast, a non-negligible fraction of participants are
   willing to tell an altruistic white lie that hurts them a bit but
   significantly helps others. Comparing white lies to those where lying
   increases the liar's payoff at the expense of another reveals important
   insights into the interaction of incentives, lying aversion, and
   preferences for payoff distributions. Finally, in line with previous
   findings, women are less likely to lie when it is costly to the other
   side. Interestingly though, we find that women are more likely to tell
   an altruistic lie.

AB We study an order promising problem in a multiclass,
   available-to-promise (ATP) assembly system in the presence of pseudo
   orders. A pseudo order refers to a tentative customer order whose
   attributes, such as the likelihood of an actual order, order quantity,
   and confirmation timing, can change dynamically over time. A unit demand
   from any class is assembled from one manufactured unit and one inventory
   unit, where the manufactured unit takes one unit of capacity and needs a
   single period to produce. An accepted order must be filled before a
   positive delivery lead time. The underlying order acceptance decisions
   involve trade-offs between committing resources (production capacity and
   component inventory) to low-reward firm orders and reserving resources
   for high-reward orders. We develop a Markov chain model that captures
   the key characteristics of pseudo orders, including demand lumpiness,
   nonstationarity, and volatility. We then formulate a stochastic dynamic
   program for the ATP assembly system that embeds the Markov chain model
   as a short-term forecast for pseudo orders. We show that the optimal
   order acceptance policy is characterized by class prioritization,
   resource-imbalance-based rationing, and capacity-inventory-demand
   matching. In particular, the rationing level for each class is
   determined by a critical value that depends on the resource imbalance
   level, defined as the net difference between the production capacity and
   component inventory levels. Extensive numerical tests underscore the
   importance of the key properties of the optimal policy and provide
   operational and managerial insights on the value of the short-term
   demand forecast and the robustness of the optimal policy.

AB Many professions are plagued by disparities in service delivery. Racial
   disparities in policing, mortgage lending, and healthcare are some
   notable examples. Because disparities can result from a myriad of
   mechanisms, crafting effective disparity mitigation policies requires
   knowing which mechanisms are active and which are not. In this study we
   can distinguish whether one mechanism-statistical discrimination-is a
   primary explanation for racial disparities in physicians' treatment of
   patients. In a longitudinal natural experiment using repeated
   quasi-audit studies of medical students, we test for within-cohort
   changes in disparities from medical student behaviors as they interact
   with white and black patient actors. We find significant increases in
   medical students' disparate behaviors by patient race between their
   first and second years of medical school. This finding is inconsistent
   with statistical discrimination predictions and challenges the idea that
   statistical discrimination is primarily responsible for racial
   disparities in patient care.

AB We combine new information technology (IT) offshoring and IT workforce
   microdata to investigate how the use of IT offshore captive centers is
   affecting the skill composition of the U. S. onshore IT workforce. The
   analysis is based on the theory that occupations involving tasks that
   are "tradable," such as tasks that require little personal communication
   or hands-on interaction with U. S.-based objects, are vulnerable to
   being moved offshore. Consistent with this theory, we find that firms
   that have offshore IT captive centers have 8% less of their onshore IT
   workforce involved in tradable occupations; those without offshore
   captive centers have increased the proportion of onshore employment in
   these same occupations by 3%. In addition, we find that hourly IT
   workers (e. g., IT contractors) are disproportionately employed in
   tradable jobs, and their onshore employment is 2%-3% lower in firms with
   offshore captive centers. These findings persist after considering
   different measures of employment composition, including controls for
   human capital, firm performance, domestic outsourcing, and whether firms
   choose to build or buy software. Instrumental variables and
   corroborating regressions suggest that our estimates are
   conservative-the magnitude of the effect generally rises after
   accounting for reverse causality and measurement error.

AB The long-standing argument that focused operations outperform others
   stands in contrast to claims about the benefits of broader operational
   scope. The performance benefits of focus are typically attributed to
   reduced complexity, lower uncertainty, and the development of
   specialized expertise; the benefits of greater breadth are linked to the
   economies of scope achieved by sharing common resources, such as
   advertising or production capacity, across activities. Within the
   literature on corporate strategy, this tension between focus and breadth
   is reconciled by the concept of related diversification (i.e., a firm
   with multiple operating units, each specializing in distinct but related
   activities). We consider whether there are similar benefits to related
   diversification within an operating unit and examine the mechanism that
   generates these benefits. Using the empirical context of cardiovascular
   care within hospitals, we first examine the relationship between a
   hospital's level of specialization in cardiovascular care and the
   quality of its clinical performance on cardiovascular patients. We find
   that, on average, focus has a positive effect on quality performance. We
   then distinguish between positive spillovers and complementarities to
   examine (1) the extent to which a hospital's specialization in areas
   related to cardiovascular care directly impacts performance on
   cardiovascular patients (positive spillovers) and (2) whether the
   marginal benefit of a hospital's focus in cardiovascular care depends on
   the degree to which the hospital "cospecializes" in related areas
   (complementarities). In our setting, we find evidence of such
   complementarities in specialization.

AB This study looks at the role of internal linkages in highly competitive
   clusters. We argue that, in addition to serving as a mechanism for
   sourcing knowledge, strong internal linkages help firms increase
   internalization and create higher levels of technological
   interdependence across firm locations. Firms with strong networks of
   internal linkages are able to maintain tighter control over local
   innovation and reduce the risk that knowledge outflows will advantage
   competitors in clusters. Our empirical analysis of the global
   semiconductor industry shows that industry leaders intensify internal
   linkages across locations when they collocate with direct market
   competitors, but not when they collocate with innovators in the same
   technological field. We also find that internal linkages are associated
   with more knowledge flow within firms and less knowledge expropriation
   by collocated competitors. Our results suggest that future research in
   cluster innovation should consider the critical role of multilocation
   firms, their internal organization across clusters, and their responses
   to technological and market competition in clusters.

AB Geographic variation in consumer use of Internet retailers is partly
   explained by variation in offline shopping costs. Explanations for
   geographic variation in the efficacy of different customer acquisition
   methods including traditional methods of offline word-of-mouth (WOM) and
   magazine advertising and information systems (IS)-enabled methods of
   online WOM and online search remain unexplored. We estimate a
   multivariate negative binomial distribution (NBD) model on zip
   code-level customer counts from a leading Internet retailer and provide
   new insights into factors explaining geographic variation in the success
   of these methods. First, we show that target customer density explains
   geographic variation over and above the impact due to the number of
   potential customers. Moreover, the effect of density is greatest for
   offline and online WOM acquisitions; this suggests that density
   contributes to contagion, connectivity, and a hypothesized "social
   multiplier." Second, when senders and recipients of WOM share
   consumption benefits, WOM is more powerful and compelling. We find that
   location-based convenience benefits have stronger effects on
   location-dependent offline WOM acquisitions than on location-independent
   online WOM acquisitions. Third, acquisition channels contribute
   differently to the total customer pool-offline WOM acquisitions are
   clustered, whereas magazine acquisitions are dispersed. Finally,
   separate click-to-conversion data from Coremetrics.com indicates that
   using the model-based predictions to target specific markets delivers a
   twofold improvement in actual click-to-order rates.

AB This paper uses a formal model to study how evaluation costs affect
   competition for resources in strategic factor markets. It finds that
   relative scarcity may not always benefit resource sellers. Rather, when
   competition among resource investors passes a certain threshold
   intensity, miscoordination among investors increases to the point that
   sellers' expected profits decline. This paper extends the model to
   consider how investors organize to overcome managerial agency in
   resource evaluation. Two organizational designs are considered: (a)
   incentivization, wherein a lower-level manager is motivated by an
   incentive contract to evaluate resources for an investor, and (b)
   supervision, wherein evaluation is either handled directly or closely
   monitored by headquarters. The model suggests that competition among
   investors will be associated with a greater use of supervision and that
   investors using supervision will tend to make lower offers. This paper
   also finds that supervision will be more common when valuable resources
   are rare.

   This study uses a data-driven approach to explore how bidders react to

   treatments. Using cluster analyses of the bids and the clicks generated
   by bidders, we find three stable bidder strategies across the three
   treatments. Further, these strategies are robust for separate

   auctions against an iterative form of combinatorial auction-the
   combinatorial clock auction. The enumeration of the bidding strategies
   across different types of feedback, along with the analysis of their
   economic implications, is offered to help practitioners design better

AB The bullwhip effect is the amplification of demand variability along a
   supply chain: a company bullwhips if it purchases from suppliers more
   variably than it sells to customers. Such bullwhips (amplifications of
   demand variability) can lead to mismatches between demand and production
   and hence to lower supply chain efficiency. We investigate the bullwhip
   effect in a sample of 4,689 public U. S. companies over 1974-2008.
   Overall, about two-thirds of firms bullwhip. The sample's mean and
   median bullwhips, both significantly positive, respectively measure
   15.8% and 6.7% of total demand variability. Put another way, the mean
   quarterly standard deviation of upstream orders exceeds that of demand
   by $20 million. We decompose the bullwhip by information transmission
   lead time. Estimating the bullwhip's information-lead-time components
   with a two-stage estimator, we find that demand signals firms observe
   with more than three-quarters' notice drive 30% of the bullwhip, and
   those firms observe with less than one-quarter's notice drive 51%. From
   1974-1994 to 1995-2008, our sample's mean bullwhip dropped by a third.

AB We consider an M/M/1 queueing system with impatient consumers who
   observe the length of the queue before deciding whether to buy the
   product. The product may have high or low quality, and consumers are
   heterogeneously informed. The firm chooses a slow or (at a cost) a fast
   service rate. In equilibrium, informed consumers join the queue if it is
   below a threshold. The threshold varies with the quality of the good, so
   an uninformed consumer updates her belief about quality on observing the
   length of the queue. The strategy of an uninformed consumer has a
   "hole": she joins the queue at lengths both below and above the hole,
   but not at the hole itself. We show that if the prior probability the
   product has high quality and the proportion of informed consumers are
   both low, a high-quality firm may select a slower service rate than a
   low-quality firm. The queue can therefore be a valuable signaling device
   for a high-quality firm. Strikingly, in some scenarios, the high-quality
   firm may choose the slow service rate even if the technological cost of
   speeding up is zero.

AB Microloan markets allow individual borrowers to raise funding from
   multiple individual lenders. We use a unique panel data set that tracks
   the funding dynamics of borrower listings on Prosper.com, the largest
   microloan market in the United States. We find evidence of rational
   herding among lenders. Well-funded borrower listings tend to attract
   more funding after we control for unobserved listing heterogeneity and
   payoff externalities. Moreover, instead of passively mimicking their
   peers (irrational herding), lenders engage in active observational
   learning (rational herding); they infer the creditworthiness of
   borrowers by observing peer lending decisions and use publicly
   observable borrower characteristics to moderate their inferences.
   Counterintuitively, obvious defects (e.g., poor credit grades) amplify a
   listing's herding momentum, as lenders infer superior creditworthiness
   to justify the herd. Similarly, favorable borrower characteristics
   (e.g., friend endorsements) weaken the herding effect, as lenders
   attribute herding to these observable merits. Follow-up analysis shows
   that rational herding beats irrational herding in predicting loan
   performance.

AB We test for three-way complementarities among information technology
   (IT), performance pay, and human resource (HR) analytics practices. We
   develop a principal-agent model examining how these practices work
   together as an incentive system that produces a larger productivity
   premium when the practices are implemented in concert rather than
   separately. We assess our model by combining fine-grained data on human
   capital management (HCM) software adoption over 11 years with detailed
   survey data on incentive systems and HR analytics practices for 189
   firms. We find that the adoption of HCM software is greatest in firms
   that have also adopted performance pay and HR analytics practices.
   Furthermore, HCM adoption is associated with a large productivity
   premium when it is implemented as a system of organizational incentives,
   but has less benefit when adopted in isolation. The system of three-way
   complements produces disproportionately greater benefits than pairwise
   interactions, highlighting the importance of including all three
   complements. Productivity increases significantly when the HCM systems
   "go live" but not when they are purchased, which can be years earlier.
   This helps rule out reverse causality as an explanation for our
   findings.

AB Firms are often organized into groups. Group membership has been shown
   empirically to have positive effects, in the form of increased prosocial
   behavior toward in-group members. This includes an enhanced willingness
   to engage in altruistic punishment of inefficient defection. Our paper
   provides evidence of a dark side of group membership. In the presence of
   cues of competition between groups, a taste for harming the out-group
   emerges: punishment ceases to serve a norm enforcement function, and
   instead, out-group members are punished harder and regardless of whether
   they cooperate or defect. Our results point to a mechanism that might
   help explain previous mixed results on the social value of punishment,
   and they contribute to understanding the sources of conflict between
   groups. They also point to an important trade-off for firms: introducing
   competition enhances within-group efficiency but also generates costly
   between-group conflict.

AB Using a proprietary data set provided by a major manufacturer of
   aircraft engines, we empirically investigate how product reliability is
   impacted by the use of two different types of after-sales maintenance
   support contracts: time and material contracts (T&MC) and
   performance-based contracts (PBC). We offer a number of competing
   arguments based on the theory of incentives that establish why product
   reliability may increase or decrease under PBC. We build a two-stage
   econometric model that explicitly accounts for the endogeneity of
   contract choices, and find evidence of a positive and significant effect
   of PBC on product reliability. The estimation of our model indicates
   that product reliability is higher by 25%-40% under PBC compared to
   under T&MC, once the endogeneity of contract choice is taken into
   account. Our results are consistent with two mechanisms for reliability
   improvement under PBC: more frequent scheduled maintenance and better
   care performed in each maintenance event.

   Out of six data sets, the G/G/NBD model provides a notable improvement
   in the log-likelihood over the Pareto/NBD model in four data sets. It
   can indicate substantial differences in expected residual lifetimes
   compared to the Pareto/NBD and induce a retention rather than

AB Secondary markets in the information technology industry, where used or
   refurbished equipment is traded, have been growing steadily. For
   original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in this industry, the importance
   of secondary markets has grown in parallel, not only as a source of
   revenue, but also because of their impact on these firms' competitive
   advantage and market strategy. Recent articles in the press have
   severely criticized some OEMs who are perceived to be actively trying to
   eliminate the secondary market for their products. Other OEMs have
   policies that enhance their secondary markets. The goal of this paper is
   to understand how an OEM's incentives and optimal strategies vis-a-vis
   the secondary market are shaped contingent on her relative competitive
   advantage, product characteristics, and consumer preferences. The
   critical trade-off that we examine is whether the indirect benefit from
   maintaining an active secondary market (the resale value effect) can
   outweigh the potentially negative effect of the sales of used products
   at the expense of new product sales (the cannibalization effect). To
   that end, we develop a durable good model where the OEM can directly
   affect the resale value of her product through a relicensing fee charged
   to the buyer of the refurbished equipment. We analyze the OEM's strategy
   in both the monopoly and the duopoly cases, characterize the optimal
   relicensing fee set by the OEM, and draw conclusions on the conditions
   that favor stimulating or deterring the secondary market.

AB We gather detailed data on organizational practices and information
   technology (IT) use at 253 firms to examine the hypothesis that external
   focus-the ability of a firm to detect and therefore respond to changes
   in its external operating environment-increases returns to IT,
   especially when combined with decentralized decision making. First,
   using survey-based measures, we find that external focus is correlated
   with both organizational decentralization, and IT investment. Second, we
   find that a cluster of practices including external focus,
   decentralization, and IT is associated with improved product innovation
   capabilities. Third, we develop and test a three-way complementarities
   model that indicates that the combination of external focus,
   decentralization, and IT is associated with significantly higher
   productivity in our sample. We also introduce a new set of instrumental
   variables representing barriers to IT-related organizational change and
   find that our results are robust when we account for the potential
   endogeneity of organizational investments. Our results may help explain
   why firms that operate in information-rich environments such as
   high-technology clusters or areas with high worker mobility have
   experienced especially high returns to IT investment and suggest a set
   of practices that some managers may be able to use to increase their
   returns from IT investments.

AB The widespread adoption of activity-based costing enables firms to
   allocate common service costs to each customer, allowing for precise
   measurement of both the cost to serve a particular customer and the
   customer's profitability. In this paper, we investigate how pricing
   strategies based on customer cost information affects a firm's customer
   acquisition and retention dynamics, and ultimately its profit, using a
   two-period monopoly model with high-and low-cost customer segments.
   Although past purchase and cost information helps firms to increase
   profits through differential prices for good and bad customers in the
   second period ("price discrimination effect"), it can hurt firms because
   strategic forward-looking consumers may delay purchases to avoid higher
   future prices ("ratchet effect"). We find that when the customer cost
   heterogeneity is sufficiently large, it is optimal for firms to "fire"
   some of its high-cost customers, and customer cost-based pricing is
   profitable. Surprisingly, it is optimal to fire even some profitable
   customers. This result is robust even when the cost to serve is
   endogenous and determined by the consumer's choice of service level. We
   also shed insight on acquisition-retention dynamics, on when firms can
   improve their profitability by selectively firing known old "bad"
   customers, and on replacing the old "bad" customers with a mix of new
   "good" and "bad" customers.

AB Under rate-of-return regulation, a firm's product prices are constrained
   by the requirement that investors not earn more than an allowable return
   on the firm's assets. This paper examines the dynamic properties of the
   rate-of-return regulation process when the regulated firm periodically
   undertakes new capacity investments. Our analysis identifies prices that
   correspond to stationary values of the regulation process. It is shown
   that the underlying depreciation rules for property, plant, and
   equipment determine whether these stationary prices will be above, equal
   to, or below the long-run marginal cost of providing the regulated
   service. We provide conditions under which the rate-of-return regulation
   process is dynamically stable so that prices indeed converge to their
   stationary values. The overall efficiency of this regulation method is
   shown to depend on how well the applicable depreciation schedule matches
   the productivity pattern of the assets in use.

   knowledge-based agency costs from vertical integration in car leasing,
   where manufacturer-owned captive lessors compete with independent
   lessors. Both organizational forms must acquire and integrate diffuse
   knowledge to accurately predict vehicle depreciation-a condition
   critical for profitability. Using a data set of 180,000 leases, I
   compare contracts of independent and captive lessors across car models,
   market conditions, and product life cycles. I find that managers in
   vertically integrated firms have conflicting incentives on whether to
   accurately and completely share proprietary knowledge, and show that
   these incentives appear to generate agency costs inconsistent with
   corporate profitability as managers selectively use and share knowledge
   for personal gain. The findings suggest that most knowledge benefits of
   vertical integration will be nullified when managerial interests are

AB The existing outsourcing literature has generally overlooked the cost
   differential and contract negotiations between manufacturers and
   suppliers (by assuming identical cost structures and adopting the
   Stackelberg framework). One fundamental question yet to be addressed is
   whether upstream suppliers' cost efficiency is always beneficial to
   downstream manufacturers in the presence of competition and
   negotiations. In other words, does low cost outsourcing always lead to a
   win-win outcome? To answer this question, we adopt a multiunit bilateral
   bargaining framework to investigate competing manufacturers' sourcing
   decisions. We analyze two supply chain structures: one-to-one channels,
   in which each manufacturer may outsource to an exclusive supplier; and
   one-to-two channels, in which each manufacturer may outsource to a
   common supplier. We show that, under both structures, low cost
   outsourcing may lead to a win-lose outcome in which the suppliers gain
   and the manufacturers lose. This happens because suppliers' cost
   advantage may backfire on competing manufacturers through two negative
   effects. First, a decrease of upstream cost weakens a manufacturer's
   bargaining position by reducing her disagreement payoff (i.e., her
   insourcing profit) because the competing manufacturer can obtain a low
   cost position through outsourcing. Second, in one-to-two channels, the
   common supplier's bargaining position is strengthened with a lower cost
   because his disagreement payoff increases (i.e., his profit from serving
   only one manufacturer increases). The endogeneity of disagreement
   payoffs in our model highlights the importance of modeling firm
   negotiations under competition. Moreover, we identify an interesting
   bargaining externality between competing manufacturers when they
   outsource to a common supplier. Because the supplier engages in two
   negotiations, his share of profit from the trade with one manufacturer
   affects the total surplus of the trade with the other manufacturer.
   Because of this externality, surprisingly, as a manufacturer's
   bargaining power decreases, her profit under outsourcing may increase
   and it may be more likely for her to outsource.

   self-interested consumers (demand side) on the inefficiency in the
   influenza vaccine supply chain. Previous economic studies, focusing on
   demand side, find that the equilibrium demand is always less than the
   socially optimal demand because self-interested individuals do not
   internalize the social benefit of protecting others via reduced
   infectiousness (positive externality). In contrast, we show that the
   equilibrium demand can be greater than the socially optimal demand after
   accounting for the limited supply due to yield uncertainty and
   manufacturer's incentives. The main driver for this result is a second
   (negative) externality: Self-interested individuals ignore that
   vaccinating people with high infection costs is more beneficial for the
   society when supply is limited. We show that the extent of the negative
   externality can be reduced through more efficient and less uncertain
   allocation mechanisms. To investigate the relative effectiveness of
   government interventions on supply and demand sides under various demand
   and supply characteristics, we construct two partially centralized
   scenarios where the social planner (i.e., government) intervenes either
   on the demand side or the supply side, but not both. We conduct an
   extensive numerical analysis.

AB Recent legislations directed Medicare to revamp its decades-old system
   for reimbursing dialysis treatments, with focus on the risk adjustment
   of payments and on the transition toward a pay-for-compliance system. To
   design an optimal payment system that incorporates these features, we
   develop an empirical method to estimate the structural parameters of the
   principal-agent model underlying Medicare's dialysis payment system. We
   use the model and parameter estimates to answer the following questions:
   Can a pay-for-compliance system based only on the intermediate
   performance measures currently identified by Medicare achieve
   first-best? How should patient outcomes be risk adjusted, and what
   welfare gains can be achieved by doing so? Our main findings are as
   follows: (1) the current set of intermediate measures identified by
   Medicare are not comprehensive enough for use alone in a
   pay-for-compliance system; (2) paying for risk-adjusted downstream
   outcomes instead of raw downstream outcomes can lengthen the
   hospital-free life of admitted patients by two weeks per patient per
   year without increasing Medicare expenditures.

AB It is surprising that the prevailing performance taxonomy for scientists
   (star versus nonstar) focuses only on individual output and ignores
   social behavior, because innovation is often characterized as a communal
   process. To develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which
   scientists influence the productivity of others, I expand the
   traditional taxonomy of scientists that focuses solely on productivity
   and add a second, social dimension: helpfulness to others. Using a
   combination of academic paper publications and citations to capture
   scientist productivity and the receipt of academic paper acknowledgments
   to measure helpfulness, I examine the change in publishing output of the
   coauthors of 149 scientists that die. Coauthors of highly helpful
   scientists that die experience a decrease in output quality but not
   output quantity. Meanwhile, the deaths of high productivity scientists
   that are not highly helpful do not influence their coauthors' output. In
   addition, scientists who are helpful with conceptual feedback (critique
   and advice) have a larger impact on the performance of their coauthors
   than scientists who provide help with material access, scientific tools,
   or technical work. Within the context of evaluating scientific
   productivity, it may be time to update our conceptualization of a
   "star."

AB Sustaining operational productivity in the completion of repetitive
   tasks is critical to many organizations' success. Yet research points to
   two different work-design-related strategies for accomplishing this
   goal: specialization to capture the benefits of repetition and variety
   (i.e., working on different tasks) to keep workers motivated and provide
   them opportunities to learn. In this paper, we investigate how these two
   strategies may bring different productivity benefits over time. For our
   empirical analyses, we use two and a half years of transaction data from
   a Japanese bank's home loan application-processing line. We find that
   over the course of a single day, specialization, as compared to variety,
   is related to improved worker productivity. However, when we examine
   workers' experience across a number of days, we find that variety helps
   improve worker productivity. Additionally, we show that part of this
   benefit results from workers' cumulative experience with changeovers.
   Our results highlight the need for organizations to transform
   specialization and variety into mutually reinforcing strategies rather
   than treating them as mutually exclusive. Overall, our paper identifies
   new ways to improve operational performance through the effective
   allocation of work.

AB We characterize the effect of anticipated regret on consumer decisions
   and on firm profits and policies in an advance selling context where
   buyers have uncertain valuations. Advance purchases trigger action
   regret if valuations turn out to be lower than the price paid, whereas
   delaying purchase may cause inaction regret from missing a discount or
   facing a stockout. Consumers whom we describe as emotionally rational
   act strategically in response to the firm's policies and in anticipation
   of regret. In this context, regret explains two types of behavioral
   patterns: inertia (delayed purchase) and frenzies (buying early at
   negative surplus). We show how firms should optimally respond to
   consumer regret and also characterize a normative regret threshold above
   which they should not advance sell. Action regret reduces profits as
   well as the value of advance selling and booking limit policies for
   price-setting firms; inaction regret has the opposite effects. These
   effects are diminished by capacity constraints and are reversed for
   firms facing price pressure in the advance period (owing, e.g., to
   competition or market heterogeneity). Regret heterogeneity explains
   premium advance selling for the capacity-constrained firm, which may
   benefit from larger shares of regretful buyers. Finally, we show how the
   negative effects of regret on profits can be mitigated by regret-priming
   marketing campaigns and by offering refunds or options or allowing
   resales. Our results highlight the importance of assessing the relative
   strength of regret within and across market segments and of accounting
   for these factors in pricing and marketing policies.

AB An important current trend in advertising is the replacement of
   traditional pay-per-exposure (pay-per-impression) pricing models with
   performance-based mechanisms in which advertisers pay only for
   measurable actions by consumers. Such pay-per-action (PPA) mechanisms
   are becoming the predominant method of selling advertising on the
   Internet. Well-known examples include pay-per-click, pay-per-call, and
   pay-per-sale. This work highlights an important, and hitherto
   unrecognized, side effect of PPA advertising. I find that, if the prices
   of advertised goods are endogenously determined by advertisers to
   maximize profits net of advertising expenses, PPA mechanisms induce
   firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upward) relative to
   prices that would maximize profits in settings where advertising is sold
   under pay-per-exposure methods. Upward price distortions reduce both
   consumer surplus and the joint publisher advertiser profit, leading to a
   net reduction in social welfare. They persist in current auction-based
   PPA mechanisms, such as the ones used by Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft.
   In the latter settings they also reduce publisher revenues relative to
   pay-per-exposure methods. I show that these phenomena constitute a form
   of double marginalization and discuss a number of enhancements to
   today's PPA mechanisms that restore equilibrium pricing of advertised
   goods to efficient levels, improving both consumer surplus as well as
   the publisher's expected profits.

AB We propose a measure of managerial ability, based on managers'

   of firms and outperforms existing ability measures. We find that our
   measure is strongly associated with manager fixed effects and that the
   stock price reactions to chief executive officer (CEO) turnovers are
   positive (negative) when we assess the outgoing CEO as low (high)
   ability. We also find that replacing CEOs with more (less) able CEOs is
   associated with improvements (declines) in subsequent firm performance.
   We conclude with a demonstration of the potential of the measure. We
   find that the negative relation between equity financing and future
   abnormal returns documented in prior research is mitigated by managerial
   ability. Specifically, more able managers appear to utilize equity
   issuance proceeds more effectively, illustrating that our more precise
   measure of managerial ability will allow researchers to pursue studies

   streak, post-earnings-announcement drift is strong and significant. In
   contrast, the drift is negligible following the termination of a streak.
   Indeed, streaks explain about half of the post-earnings-announcement
   drift in our sample. Our results are robust to more general definitions
   of trends than streaks and a battery of control variables including the
   magnitude of earnings surprises and their autocorrelation. Overall,
   post-earnings-announcement drift has a significant time-series component

AB Consumers become satiated with a product when purchasing too much too
   quickly. How much is too much and how quickly is too quickly depends on
   the characteristics of the product relative to the time interval between
   consumption periods. Knowing that, consumers allocate their budget to
   products that generate less satiation effects. Retailers should then
   choose to sell products that induce minimal satiation, but usually this
   is operationally more costly. To study this trade-off, we provide an
   analytical model based on utility theory that relates customer
   consumption to price and satiation, in the context of multiple competing
   retailers. We determine the purchasing pattern over time and provide an
   explicit expression to determine the consumption level in steady state.
   We derive market shares and show that they take the form of an
   attraction model in which the attractiveness depends on price and
   product satiation. We use this to analyze the competition between firms
   that maximize long-term average profit. We characterize the equilibrium
   under three scenarios: (i) price-only competition, (ii) product-only
   competition, and (iii) price and product competition. The results reveal
   the interplay between a key marketing lever (price) and the firm's
   ability to offer products that generate less satiation. In particular,
   we show that when a firm becomes more efficient at reducing satiation,
   its competitor may benefit if competition is on product only, but not if
   it is on price and product. We also find that when satiation effects are
   not managed, a firm's profit may be significantly reduced while a
   strategic competitor can largely benefit.

   of new entrants into the Ontario wine industry shows that prefounding
   friendship ties of the founders of one especially prominent
   entrepreneurial firm led to significantly higher ice wine prices. This
   attests to the promise of a network progeny extension of the
   parent-progeny account of new firm success. Follow-on analysis indicates
   that this effect is not attributable to an entrant's ability to make ice
   wines of superior quality or to it having access to better distribution
   knowledge. We therefore conclude that having a social tie to this
   prominent entrepreneurial firm generated reflected prominence that
   enhanced the valuations and therefore prices of wines made by connected

AB In the pharmaceutical industry, measuring the importance of informative
   and persuasive roles of detailing is crucial for both drug manufacturers
   and policy makers. However, little progress has been made in
   disentangling these two roles of detailing in empirical research. In
   this paper, we provide a new identification strategy to address this
   problem. Our key identification assumptions are that the informative
   component of detailing is chemical specific and the persuasive component
   is brand specific. Our strategy is to focus on markets where some drug
   manufacturers engage in a comarketing agreement, under which two or more
   companies market the same chemical using their own brand names. With our
   identification assumptions, the variation in the relative market shares
   of these two brands, together with their brand specific detailing
   efforts, would allow us to measure the persuasive component of
   detailing. The variation in the market shares of chemicals, and the
   detailing efforts summed across brands made of the same chemical, would
   allow us to measure the informative component of detailing. Using the
   data for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with diuretic in
   Canada, we find evidence that our identification strategy can help
   disentangle these two effects. Although both effects are statistically
   significant, we find that the persuasive function of detailing plays a
   very minor role in determining the demand at the chemical level-the
   informative role of detailing is mainly responsible for the diffusion
   patterns of chemicals. In contrast, the persuasive role of detailing
   plays a crucial role in determining the demand for brands that comarket
   the same chemical.

AB This paper examines renegotiation design in contracts for outsourced
   information technology (IT) services. Whereas prior literature in
   information systems has highlighted the likelihood of ex post rent
   seeking engendered by renegotiation, we build upon literature on
   incomplete contracts to posit that renegotiation can be Pareto improving
   by incorporating contingencies revealed ex post. Research on contract
   renegotiation has been hampered by two sets of challenges: the lack of
   appropriate data and empirical challenges in identification. We
   circumvent this problem both by appropriate data collection and by
   employing an identification strategy to address alternate causal
   explanations. We propose a measure, Pareto improving amendments, to
   assess renegotiation outcomes that enhance the value from outsourcing by
   hazard equilibration and by incorporating learning. Using a unique
   sample of 141 IT outsourcing contracts, we examine the role of decision
   rights delineated ex ante in enabling Pareto improving amendments and in
   resolving the trade-off between adaptation and rent seeking. We find
   that flexibility provisions, termination for convenience rights, and
   contractual rights whereby vendors are granted rights to reuse know-how
   are associated with Pareto improving amendments. The results are robust
   to potential endogeneity of contractual provisions when parties have
   feasible foresight and to the possibility of adverse selection in the
   sample. We also examine alternate explanations from the literature on
   contractual breach. Implications for practitioners and researchers are
   discussed.

AB In this paper we conduct an empirical investigation of a large-scale
   combinatorial auction (CA)-the Chilean auction for school meals in which
   the government procures half a billion dollars worth of meal services
   every year. Our empirical study is motivated by two fundamental aspects
   in the design of CAs: (1) which packages should bidders be allowed to
   bid on and (2) diversifying the supplier base to promote competition. We
   use bidding data to uncover important aspects of the firms' cost
   structure and their strategic behavior, both of which are not directly
   observed by the auctioneer; these estimates inform the auction design.
   Our results indicate that package bidding that allows firms to express
   their cost synergies due to economies of scale and density seems
   appropriate. However, we also found evidence that firms can take
   advantage of this flexibility by discounting package bids for strategic
   reasons and not driven by cost synergies. Because this behavior can lead
   to inefficiencies, it may be worth evaluating whether to prohibit
   certain specific combinations in the bidding process. Our results also
   suggest that market share restrictions and running sequential auctions
   seem to promote competition in the long run, without significantly
   increasing the short-run cost for the government due to unrealized cost
   synergies. Our results highlight that the simultaneous consideration of
   the firms' operational cost structure and their strategic behavior is
   key to the successful design of a CA. More broadly, our paper is the
   first to provide an econometric study of a large-scale CA, providing
   novel and substantive insights regarding bidding behavior in this type
   of auction.

AB We propose a new method for measuring the quality of banks' credit
   portfolios. This method makes use of information embedded in bank share
   prices by exploiting differences in their sensitivity to credit default
   swap spreads of borrowers of varying quality. The method allows us to
   derive a credit risk indicator (CRI). This indicator represents the
   perceived share of high-risk exposures in a bank's portfolio and can be
   used as a risk weight for computing regulatory capital requirements. We
   estimate CRIs for the 150 largest U.S. bank holding companies. We find
   that their CRIs are able to forecast bank failures and share price
   performances during the crisis of 2007-2009, even after controlling for
   a variety of traditional asset quality and general risk proxies.

   reflect test takers' personality traits associated with their level of

   that was administered without incentives to participants in the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). I show that, controlling for
   cognitive ability, the coding speed scores are correlated with future
   earnings of male NLSY participants. I provide evidence that the coding
   speed scores relate to intrinsic motivation. I show that the scores of
   the highly motivated, though less educated, group (potential recruits to
   the U.S. military), are higher than the NLSY participants' scores. I use
   controlled experiments to show directly that intrinsic motivation is an
   important component of the unincentivized coding speed scores and that
   it relates to test takers' personality traits.

AB We investigate the efficiency, foreclosure, and collusion rationales for
   vertical integration in a large sample of vertically related takeovers.
   The efficiency rationale, as discussed under the transaction cost
   economics and property rights theories, posits that vertical integration
   mitigates contractual inefficiencies between suppliers and customers
   (termed as holdup) and provides incentives to undertake
   relationship-specific investments. In contrast, the foreclosure and
   collusion rationales suggest that vertical integration is
   anticompetitive in nature. Specifically, the foreclosure argument
   suggests that vertical integration is used to raise costs of rival
   firms, and the collusion argument suggests that vertical integration
   facilitates coordination between the integrated firm and its rivals. To
   distinguish between the three hypotheses, we examine (1) the
   announcement period wealth effects to the merging firms, rival firms,
   and customer firms; and (2) the operating performance changes to the
   merging firms in vertical takeovers. We find that firms expand their
   vertical boundaries consistent with an efficiency enhancing rationale.

AB Existing literature, based on signaling theory, suggests that money-back
   guarantees (MBGs) will be utilized by high-quality firms, where high
   quality is defined as a low likelihood of product return. However, in
   today's world, MBGs are ubiquitous among major retailers, even when the
   likelihood of product return varies greatly between them. To understand
   this phenomenon, we explore a competitive environment between high- and
   low-quality retailers where consumers are fully informed and risk
   neutral, and retailers realize a salvage value for returned products.
   When MBGs are profitable, under continuous demand it is Nash equilibrium
   for both retailers to offer MBGs, and the low-quality retailer gains
   while the high-quality retailer loses relative to when MBGs are not
   offered. In contrast, if demand is lumpy, retailers can act
   monopolistically over their respective market segments, allowing both
   retailers to gain from MBGs, although the low-quality retailer still
   gains more.

   problem under uncertainty. Subjects are endowed with private information
   about the fundamentals of the problem and make decisions sequentially.
   The key feature of the experiment is that subjects can observe the
   decisions of predecessors by forming links at a cost. The model predicts
   that the average welfare is enhanced in the presence of a small cost.
   Our experimental results support this prediction. When the
   informativeness of signals changes across treatments, behavior changes
   in accordance with the theory. However, within treatments, there are
   important deviations from rationality such as a tendency to conform and
   excessive link formation. Given these biases, our results indicate that
   subjects would, except when faced with a small cost, have been better
   off not forming any links.

   between Internet adoption and within-location collaborative patents, nor
   do we find any evidence of a relationship between basic Internet and

   adoption of basic Internet significantly reduced the coordination costs

   minimize the sum of staffing costs, customer waiting costs, and
   mistreatment costs due to unsuccessful attempts by a gatekeeper to solve
   the customer's problem. The client may outsource all or part of the
   process to a vendor, and first-best contracts exist when the client
   outsources only gatekeepers or experts. When the client outsources the
   entire system as a two-level process, a client-optimal contract may not
   exist unless the exogenous system parameters satisfy a particular (and
   unlikely) coordination condition. In addition, optimal
   incentive-compatible contracts exist when the vendor's structure choice
   (one level or two levels) can deviate from the client's preference.
   Finally, we numerically examine how vendor structure choice and labor

AB In the aftermath of many natural and man-made disasters, people often
   wonder why those affected were underprepared, especially when the
   disaster was the result of known or regularly occurring hazards (e.g.,
   hurricanes). We study one contributing factor: prior near-miss
   experiences. Near misses are events that have some nontrivial
   expectation of ending in disaster but, by chance, do not. We demonstrate
   that when near misses are interpreted as disasters that did not occur,
   people illegitimately underestimate the danger of subsequent hazardous
   situations and make riskier decisions (e.g., choosing not to engage in
   mitigation activities for the potential hazard). On the other hand, if
   near misses can be recognized and interpreted as disasters that almost
   happened, this will counter the basic "near-miss" effect and encourage
   more mitigation. We illustrate the robustness of this pattern across
   populations with varying levels of real expertise with hazards and
   different hazard contexts (household evacuation for a hurricane,
   Caribbean cruises during hurricane season, and deep-water oil drilling).
   We conclude with ideas to help people manage and communicate about risk.

AB We discuss the problem of combining the conflicting objectives of equity
   and utilitarianism, for social policy making, in a single mathematical
   programming model. The definition of equity we use is the Rawlsian one
   of maximizing the minimum utility over individuals or classes of
   individuals. However, when the disparity of utility becomes too great,
   the objective becomes progressively utilitarian. Such a model is
   particularly applicable not only to health provision but to other areas
   as well. Building a mixed-integer/linear programming (MILP) formulation
   of the problem raises technical issues, because the objective function
   is nonconvex and the hypograph is not MILP representable in its initial
   form. We present a succinct formulation and show that it is "sharp" in
   the sense that its linear programming relaxation describes the convex
   hull of the feasible set (before extra resource allocation or policy
   constraints are added). We apply the formulation to a healthcare
   planning problem and show that instances of realistic size are easily
   solved by standard MILP software.

AB In this paper, we formulate a single-period portfolio choice problem
   with parameter uncertainty in the framework of relative regret. Relative
   regret evaluates a portfolio by comparing its return to a family of
   benchmarks, where the benchmarks are the wealths of fictitious investors
   who invest optimally given knowledge of the model parameters, and is a
   natural objective when there is concern about parameter uncertainty or
   model ambiguity. The optimal relative regret portfolio is the one that
   performs well in relation to all the benchmarks over the family of
   possible parameter values. We analyze this problem using convex duality
   and show that it is equivalent to a Bayesian problem, where the Lagrange
   multipliers play the role of the prior distribution, and the learning
   model involves Bayesian updating of these Lagrange multipliers/prior.
   This Bayesian problem is unusual in that the prior distribution is
   endogenously chosen by solving the dual optimization problem for the
   Lagrange multipliers, and the objective function involves the family of
   benchmarks from the relative regret problem. These results show that
   regret is a natural means by which robust decision making and learning
   can be combined.

AB Although product modularity is often advocated as a design strategy in
   the operations management literature, little is known about how
   consumers respond to modular products. In this research we undertake
   several experiments to explore consumer response to modularly
   upgradeable products in settings featuring technological change. We
   consider both the initial product choice (between a modularly
   upgradeable product and an integral one) and the subsequent upgrade
   decision (replacement of a module versus full product replacement).
   First, we show that consumers tend to discount the cost savings
   associated with modular upgrades excessively (insufficiently) when the
   time between the initial purchase and the upgrade is short (long). This
   suggests that modular upgradability as a product feature has higher
   profit potential for slowly rather than rapidly improving products.
   Second, we observe a preference reversal between the initial purchase
   and the point of upgrade: At the point of initial purchase, people
   foresee making a full product replacement in the future, yet, when faced
   with the actual upgrade decision, they are more likely to revert to
   modular upgrades. Finally, we discuss and test several pricing and
   product design strategies that the firm can use to respond to these
   cognitive biases.

AB This paper provides a novel explanation for the use of supply chain
   intermediaries. We find that even in the absence of the well-known
   transactional and informational advantages of mediation, intermediaries
   improve supply chain performance. In particular, intermediaries
   facilitate responsive adaptation of the buyers' supplier base to their
   changing needs while simultaneously ensuring that suppliers behave as if
   they had long-term sourcing commitments from buying firms. In the face
   of changing buyer needs, an intermediary that sources on behalf of
   multiple buyers can responsively change the composition of future
   business committed to a supplier such that a sufficient level of
   business comes from the buyer(s) that most prefer this supplier. On the
   other hand, direct buyers that source only for themselves must provide
   all their committed business to a supplier from their own sourcing
   needs, even if they no longer prefer this supplier. Unlike existing
   theories of intermediation, our theory better explains the observed
   phenomenon that although transactional barriers and information
   asymmetries have steadily decreased, the use of intermediaries has
   soared, even among large companies such as Walmart.

AB Empirically, we find that Web logs (or "blogs") often link to other
   blogs in the same category. We present an analytical model that explains
   why a rational blogger may choose to link to another blog. We allow
   bloggers to differ along two dimensions: (1) the ability to post
   news-breaking content, and (2) the ability to find news in other blogs.
   By linking, a blog signals to the reader that it will be able to direct
   her to news in other blogs in the future. The downside of a link is that
   it is a positive signal on the rival's news-breaking ability. We show
   that linking will be in equilibrium when the heterogeneity on the
   ability to break news is low relative to the heterogeneity on the
   ability to find news in other blogs. One implication of the linking
   mechanism is that blogs that are high on the news-breaking ability are
   more likely to gain readers. Hence, despite the fact that bloggers link
   for purely selfish reasons, the macro effects of this activity is that
   readers' learning is enhanced.

AB In a first survey of its type, we measure development and modification
   of consumer products by product users in a representative sample of
   1,173 UK consumers age 18 and older. We estimate this previously
   unmeasured type of household sector innovation to be quite large: 6.1%
   of UK consumers-nearly 2.9 million individuals-have engaged in consumer
   product innovation during the prior three years. In aggregate,
   consumers' annual product development expenditures are more than 1.4
   times larger than the annual consumer product R&D expenditures of all
   firms in the United Kingdom combined. Consumers engage in many small
   projects that seem complementary to the innovation efforts of incumbent
   producers. Consumer innovators very seldom protect their innovations via
   intellectual property, and 17% diffuse to others. These results imply
   that, at the country level, productivity studies yield inflated effect
   sizes for producer innovation in consumer goods. They also imply that
   existing companies should reconfigure their product development systems
   to find and build on prototypes developed by consumers.

AB The risk of supply disruption increases as firms seek to procure from
   cheaper, but unproven, suppliers. We model a supply chain consisting of
   a single buyer and two suppliers, both of which compete for the buyer's
   order and face risk of supply disruption. One supplier is comparatively
   more reliable but also more expensive, whereas the other one is less
   reliable but cheaper and faces higher risk of disruption. Moreover, the
   risk level of the unreliable supplier may be private information, and
   this lack of visibility increases the buyer's purchasing risk. In such
   settings, the unreliable supplier often provides a price and quantity
   (P&Q) guarantee to the buyer. Our objective is to study the underlying
   motivation for the guarantee offer and its effects on the competitive
   intensity and the performance of the chain partners. Our model also
   includes a spot market that can be utilized by any party to buy or to
   sell. The spot market price is random, partially depends on the
   available capacity of the two suppliers, and has a positive spread
   between buying and selling prices. We analytically characterize the
   equilibrium contracts for the two suppliers and the buyer's optimal
   procurement strategy. First, our analysis shows that P&Q guarantee
   allows the unreliable supplier to better compete against the more
   reliable one by providing supply assurance to the buyer. More
   importantly, when information asymmetry risk is high, use of a guarantee
   may enable the unreliable supplier to credibly signal her true risk,
   thereby improving visibility into the chain. This signal can also be
   used by the buyer to infer the expected spot market price. In spite of
   these benefits, a guarantee offer in an asymmetric setting may not
   always be desirable for the buyer. Rather, it can reduce competition
   between the suppliers, resulting in higher costs for the buyer.

   financial milestone constraints on the revenues and sales that need to
   be achieved at different time points along the sales horizon. We
   characterize the revenue maximizing dynamic pricing policy for the
   seller and highlight the effect of revenue and sales milestones on its
   structure. The optimal policy can be written in feedback form, where the
   price at each point in time is selected so as to track the most
   stringent among all future milestones. Building on that observation, we
   propose a discrete-review policy that aims to dynamically track the
   appropriate milestone constraint and show that this simple and practical
   policy is near optimal in settings with large initial capacity and long
   sales horizons even in settings with no advance demand model
   information. One motivating application comes from the sales of new

AB As much as 12% of the daily volume on the New York Stock Exchange, and
   similar volumes on other major world exchanges, involves sales by
   institutional investors to brokers through blind portfolio auctions.
   Such transactions typically take the form of a first-price sealed-bid
   auction in which the seller engages a few potential brokers and provides
   limited information about the portfolio being sold. Uncertainty about
   the portfolio contents reduces bids, effectively increasing the
   transaction cost paid by the seller. We consider the use of a trusted
   intermediary or equivalent cryptographic protocol to reduce transaction
   costs. In particular, we propose a mechanism through which each party
   provides relevant private information to an intermediary who ultimately
   reveals only the portfolio contents and price paid, and only to the
   seller and winning broker. Through analysis of a game-theoretic model,
   we demonstrate substantial potential benefits to sellers.

AB The relative predictability of returns and dividends is a central issue
   because it forms the paradigm to interpret asset price variation. A
   little studied question is how dividend smoothing, as a choice of
   corporate policy, affects predictability. We show that even if dividends
   are supposed to be predictable without smoothing, dividend smoothing can
   bury this predictability. Because aggregate dividends are dramatically
   more smoothed in the postwar period than before, the lack of dividend
   growth predictability in the postwar period does not necessarily mean
   that there is no cash flow news in stock price variations; rather, a
   more plausible interpretation is that dividends are smoothed. Using two
   alternative measures that are less subject to dividend smoothing-net
   payout and earnings-we reach the consistent conclusion that cash flow
   news plays a more important role than discount rate news in price
   variations in the postwar period.

AB In this paper, we argue that managers confront a paradox in selecting
   strategy. On one hand, capital markets systematically discount
   uniqueness in the strategy choices of firms. Uniqueness in strategy
   heightens the cost of collecting and analyzing information to evaluate a
   firm's future value. These greater costs in strategy evaluation
   discourage the collection and analysis of information regarding the
   firm, and result in a valuation discount. On the other hand, uniqueness
   in strategy is a necessary condition for creating economic ::ents and
   should, except for this information cost, be positively associated with
   firm value. We find empirical support for both propositions using a
   novel measure of strategy uniqueness in a firm panel data set between
   1985 and 2007.

AB Contingent capital in the form of debt that converts to equity when a
   bank faces financial distress has been proposed as a mechanism to
   enhance financial stability and avoid costly government rescues.
   Specific proposals vary in their choice of conversion trigger and
   conversion mechanism. We analyze the case of contingent capital with a
   capital-ratio trigger and partial and ongoing conversion. The capital
   ratio we use is based on accounting or book values to approximate the
   regulatory ratios that determine capital requirements for banks. The
   conversion process is partial and ongoing in the sense that each time a
   bank's capital ratio reaches the minimum threshold, just enough debt is
   converted to equity to meet the capital requirement, so long as the
   contingent capital has not been depleted. We derive closed-form
   expressions for the market value of such securities when the firm's
   asset value is modeled as geometric Brownian motion, and from these we
   get formulas for the fair yield spread on the convertible debt. A key
   step in the analysis is an explicit expression for the fraction of
   equity held by the original shareholders and the fraction held by
   converted investors in the contingent capital.

AB Recently, large-scale, Web-based service marketplaces, where many small
   service providers compete among themselves in catering to customers with
   diverse needs, have emerged. Customers who frequent these marketplaces
   seek quick resolutions and thus are usually willing to trade prices with
   waiting times. The main goal of this paper is to discuss the role of the
   moderating firm in facilitating information gathering, operational
   efficiency, and communication among agents in service marketplaces.
   Surprisingly, we show that operational efficiency may be detrimental to
   the overall efficiency of the marketplace. Furthermore, we establish
   that to reap the "expected" gains of operational efficiency, the
   moderating firm may need to complement the operational efficiency by
   enabling communication among its agents. The study emphasizes the scale
   of such marketplaces and the impact it has on the outcomes.

AB The Norton-Bass (NB) model is often credited as the pioneering
   multigeneration diffusion model in marketing. However, as acknowledged
   by the authors, when counting the number of adopters who substitute an
   old product generation with a new generation, the NB model does not
   differentiate those who have already adopted the old generation from
   those who have not. In this study, we develop a generalized Norton-Bass
   (GNB) model that separates the two different types of substitutions. The
   GNB model provides closed-form expressions for both the number of units
   in use and the adoption rate, and offers greater flexibility in
   parameter estimation, forecasting, and revenue projection. An appealing
   aspect of the GNB model is that it us,uses exactly the same set of
   parameters as the NB model and is mathematically consistent with the
   later. Empirical results show that the GNB model delivers better overall
   performance than previous models both in terms of model fit and
   forecasting performance. The analyses also show that differentiating
   leapfrogging and switching adoptions based on the GNB model can help
   gain additional insights into the process of multigeneration diffusion.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that the GNB model can incorporate the
   effect of marketing mix variables on the speed of diffusion for all
   product generations.

AB s Disruptive events that halt production can have severe business
   consequences if not appropriately managed. Business interruption (BI)
   insurance offers firms a financial mechanism for managing their exposure
   to disruption risk. Firms can also avail of operational measures to
   manage the risk. In this paper, we explore the relationship between BI
   insurance and operational measures. We model a manufacturing firm that
   can purchase BI insurance, invest in inventory, and avail of emergency
   sourcing. Allowing the insurance premium to depend on the firm's
   insurance and operational decisions, we characterize the optimal
   insurance deductible and coverage limit as well as the optimal inventory
   level. We prove that insurance and operational measures Are not always
   substitutes, and we establish conditions under which they can be
   complements; that is, insurance can increase the marginal value of
   inventory and can increase the overall value of emergency sourcing. We
   also find that the value of insurance is higher for those firms less
   able to absorb financially significant disruptions. As disruptions
   become longer but rarer, the value of emergency sourcing increases, and
   the value of inventory and the value of insurance increase before
   eventually decreasing.

   means that a predictable risk premium is not equal to compensation for
   systematic risk as implied by asset pricing theory. We show that
   introducing market frictions relaxes these asset pricing moments from a
   strict equality to a range. Empirically, it is not short sales
   constraints but transaction costs (below 35 basis points) that help to
   reconcile the observed predictability with linear portfolio return-based
   factor models, and partly with the durable consumption model. Across the

   incentive to influence her capital market valuation. We first
   characterize a market equilibrium under a general, single buyback
   contract. We show that the buyer's stocking decision can be distorted in
   equilibrium. Such a downstream stocking distortion hurts the buyer
   firm's own performance, and it also influences the performances of the
   supplier and the supply chain. We further reveal scenarios where full
   supply chain efficiency cannot be reached under any single buyback
   contract. Then, focusing on contract design, we characterize conditions
   under which a menu of buyback contracts can prevent downstream stocking
   distortion and restore full efficiency in the supply chain. Our study

   the supplier's capacity, quantities are allocated proportionally to the
   orders. We experimentally study the capacity allocation game using
   subjects motivated by financial incentives. We find that the Nash
   equilibrium, which assumes that players are perfectly rational,
   substantially exaggerates retailers' tendency to strategically order
   more than they need. We propose a model of bounded rationality based on
   the quantal response equilibrium, in which players are not perfect
   optimizers and they face uncertainty in their opponents' actions. We
   structurally estimate model parameters using the maximum-likelihood
   method. Our results confirm that retailers exhibit bounded rationality,
   become more rational through repeated game play, but may not converge to
   perfect rationality as assumed by the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we
   consider several alternative behavioral theories and show that they do

   commerce landing pages of related products to one another. Our paper
   conjectures that the explicit visibility of such "product networks" can
   alter demand spillovers across their constituent items. We test this
   conjecture empirically using data about the copurchase networks and
   demand levels associated with more than 250,000 interconnected books
   offered on Amazon.com over the period of one year while controlling for
   alternative explanations of demand correlation using a variety of
   approaches. Our findings suggest that on average the explicit visibility
   of a copurchase relationship can lead to up to an average threefold
   amplification of the influence that complementary products have on each
   others' demand levels. We also find that newer and more popular products
   "use" the attention they garner from their network position more
   efficiently and that diversity in the sources of spillover further
   amplifies the demand effects of the recommendation network. Our paper
   presents new evidence quantifying the role of network position in

   position on consumer preferences that are explicitly revealed through

AB Recent results in experimental and personnel economics indicate that
   women do not like competitive environments as much as men. This paper
   presents an experimental design that gives participants the opportunity
   to enter a tournament as part of a team rather than alone. Although a
   large and significant gender gap in entry in the individual tournament
   is found, in line with the literature, no gender gap is found in entry
   in the team tournament. Women do not enter the tournament significantly
   more often when it is team based, but men enter significantly less when
   they are part of a team than when alone. The main reason for men's
   disaffection with team competition appears to be linked to the
   uncertainty of their teammate's performance in a team tournament. More
   precisely, high-performing men fear being the victims of the free-riding
   behavior of their teammate. Women, especially low-performing women, tend
   to enter the team tournament more often than the individual one when
   they know they will be matched to a teammate of the same level as their
   own.

AB Managers of retail chains who seek to add new stores or close existing
   ones need to know the net impact of a store's opening/closure on the
   overall chain performance. This requires inferring the extent to which
   each store generates incremental sales as opposed to competing with
   other stores belonging to the chain for the same set of customers.
   However, when the chain is experiencing a growth or a decline in sales,
   not accounting for these dynamics in goodwill is likely to yield
   misleading estimates of incremental sales versus cannibalization.
   Moreover, firms might have been strategic in opening outlets in
   locations with favorable characteristics. We need to control for this
   location endogeneity while inferring the marginal effect of store
   opening/closure. In this paper, we develop a demand model that accounts
   for dynamics in goodwill, location endogeneity, and spatial competition
   between geographically proximate retail outlets. We calibrate the model
   parameters on both attitudinal and behavioral data for a fast food chain
   in a large U. S. city. The results imply that consumers perceive a
   travel cost of $0.60 per mile. As regards the composition of sales at
   individual stores, on average, 86.7% of sales constitute incremental
   purchases with the rest derived from cannibalized sales from nearby
   stores belonging to the chain. We also find significant decay in
   cannibalization with distance such that when the distance between stores
   increases by one mile, the sales lost due to cannibalization decreases
   by 28.1%; there is virtually no cannibalization at a distance of 10
   miles. In terms of managerial applications, we discuss how managers can
   use the model presented in this paper to make two key decisions: (a)
   isolating locations that can be closed by identifying stores that yield
   the lowest marginal benefit to the chain and (b) dealing with
   franchisees' potential concerns about cannibalization.

AB We model the effect of external financing on a firm's ability to
   maintain a reputation for high-quality production. Producing high
   quality is first best. Defecting to low quality is tempting because it
   lowers current costs while revenue remains unchanged because consumers
   and outside investors cannot immediately observe the defection. However,
   defection to low quality impairs the firm's reputation, which lowers
   cash flows and inhibits production over the long term. Financing via
   short-term claims discourages defection to low quality because the gains
   from defection are mostly captured by outside investors through an
   increase in the value of their claims. Therefore, if the firm relies on
   short-term external financing, it is more likely to produce over the
   long run, produce high-quality goods, and enjoy high profitability. The
   aggregate results from a laboratory experiment generally accord with
   these predictions.

AB Consumers often need to search for product information before making
   purchase decisions. We consider a tractable (continuous-time) model of
   gradual learning, in which consumers incur search costs to learn further
   product information, and update their expected utility of the product at
   each search occasion. We characterize the optimal stopping rules for
   either purchase, or no purchase, as a function of search costs and of
   the importance/informativeness of each attribute. This paper also
   characterizes how the likelihood of purchase changes with the ex ante
   expected utility, search costs, and the importance/informativeness of
   each attribute. We discuss optimal pricing, the impact of consumer
   search on profits and social welfare, and how the seller chooses its
   price to strategically affect the extent of the consumers' search
   behavior. We show that lower search costs can hurt the consumer because
   the seller may then choose to charge higher prices. Discounting creates
   asymmetry in the purchase and no-purchase search thresholds, and may
   lead to lower prices if search occurs in equilibrium, or higher prices
   if there is no search in equilibrium. This paper also considers
   searching for signals of the value of the product, heterogeneous
   importance of attributes, endogenous intensity of search, and social
   learning.

AB We study a procurement setting in which the buyer seeks a low price but
   will not allocate the contract to a supplier who has not passed
   qualification screening. Qualification screening is costly for the
   buyer, involving product tests, site visits, and interviews. In addition
   to a qualified incumbent supplier, the buyer has an entrant of unknown
   qualification. The buyer wishes to run a price-only, open-descending
   reverse auction between the incumbent and the entrant, and faces a
   strategic choice about whether to perform qualification screening on the
   entrant before or after the auction. We analytically study the buyer's
   optimal strategy, accounting for the fact that under postauction
   qualification, the incumbent knows he could lose the auction but still
   win the contract. In our analysis, we derive the incumbent's optimal
   bidding strategy under postauction qualification and find that he
   follows a threshold structure in which high-cost incumbents hold back on
   bidding-or even boycott the auction-to preserve their profit margin, and
   only lower-cost incumbents bid to win. These results are strikingly
   different from the usual open-descending auction analysis where all
   bidders are fully qualified and bidding to win is always a dominant
   strategy. We test our analytical results in the laboratory, with human
   subjects. We find that qualitatively our theoretical predictions hold up
   quite well, although incumbent suppliers bid somewhat more aggressively
   than the theory predicts, making buyers more inclined to use postauction
   qualification.

   study each firm's decision to coordinate price promotions of its
   products. Consumers are divided into loyals, who purchase both products
   from their preferred firm, and heterogeneous switchers, who choose
   between four possible bundles or buy a product in a single category. The
   switchers are willing to pay some price premium in order to purchase two
   complementary products that share the same brand name and are produced
   by the same firm, because they believe that these products are a better
   match than two complementary products with different brand names. I find
   that each firm predominantly promotes its complementary products
   together. This finding is correlationally supported by data in the

   of known models (e.g., expected utility and several variants under a
   concave utility function). We show that such preferences share a
   representation in terms of a family of measures of risk and targets.
   Specifically, the choice function is equivalent to selection of a
   maximum index level such that the risk of beating the target at that
   level is acceptable. This representation may help to uncover new models
   of choice. One that we explore in detail is the special case when the
   targets are bounded. This case corresponds to a type of satisficing and
   has descriptive relevance. Moreover, the model is amenable to

AB Assigning products to and retrieving them from proper storage locations
   are crucial decisions in minimizing the operating cost of a unit-load
   warehouse. The problem becomes intractable when the warehouse faces
   variable supply and uncertain demand in a multiperiod setting. We assume
   a factor-based demand model in which demand for each product in each
   period is affinely dependent on some uncertain factors. The
   distributions of these factors are only partially characterized. We
   introduce a robust optimization model that minimizes the worst-case
   expected total travel in the warehouse with distributional ambiguity of
   demand. Under a linear decision rule, we obtain a storage and retrieval
   policy by solving a moderate-size linear optimization problem.
   Surprisingly, despite imprecise specification of demand distributions,
   our computational studies suggest that the linear policy achieves close
   to the expected value given perfect information and significantly
   outperforms existing heuristics in the literature.

AB Recent discoveries in behavioral economics have led to important new
   insights concerning what can happen in markets. Such gains in knowledge
   have come primarily via laboratory experiments a missing piece of the
   puzzle in many cases is parallel evidence drawn from naturally occurring
   field counterparts. We provide a small movement in this direction by
   taking advantage of a unique opportunity to work with a Chinese
   high-tech manufacturing facility. Our study revolves around using
   insights gained from one of the most influential lines of behavioral
   research framing manipulations in an attempt to increase worker
   productivity in the facility. Using a natural field experiment, we
   report several insights. For example, conditional incentives framed as
   both "losses" and "gains" increase productivity for both individuals and
   teams. In addition, teams more acutely respond to bonuses posed as
   losses than as comparable bonuses posed as gains. The magnitude of this
   framing effect is roughly 1%: that is, total team productivity is
   enhanced by 1% purely due to the framing manipulation. Importantly, we
   find that neither the framing nor the incentive effect lose their
   significance over time; rather, the effects are observed over the entire
   sample period. Moreover, we learn that repeated interaction with workers
   and conditionality of the bonus contract are substitutes for sustenance
   of incentive effects in the long run.

AB Integrated assessment models that combine geophysics and economics
   features are often used to evaluate compare global warming,policies.
   Because there are typically profound uncertainties in these models, a
   simulation approach is often used. This approach requires the
   distribution of the uncertain parameters clearly specified. However,
   this is typically impossible because there is often a significant amount
   of ambiguity (e.g., estimation error) in specifying the distribution. In
   this paper, we adopt the widely used multivariate normal distribution to
   model the uncertain parameters. However, we assume that the mean vector
   and covariance matrix of the distribution are within some ambiguity
   sets. We then show how to find the worst-case performance of a given
   policy for all distributions constrained by the ambiguity sets. This
   worst-case performance provides a robust evaluation of the policy. We
   test our algorithm on a famous integrated model of climate change, known
   as the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy (DICE model).
   We find that the DICE model is sensitive to the means and covariance of
   the parameters. Furthermore, we find that, based on the DICE model,
   moderately tight environmental policies robustly outperform the no
   controls policy and the famous aggressive policies proposed by Stern and
   Gore.

AB Consumers often purchase goods that are "hard to find" to conspicuously
   display their exclusivity and social status. Firms that produce such
   conspicuously consumed goods such as designer apparel, fashion goods,
   jewelry, etc., often face challenges in making optimal pricing and
   production decisions. Such firms are confronted with precipitous
   trade-off between high sales volume and high margins, because of the
   highly uncertain market demand, strategic consumer behavior, and the
   display of conspicuous consumption. In this paper, we propose a model
   that addresses pricing and production decisions for a firm, using the
   rational expectations framework. We show that, in equilibrium, firms may
   offer high availability of goods despite the presence of conspicuous
   consumption. We show that scarcity strategies are harder to adopt as
   demand variability increases, and we provide conditions under which
   scarcity strategies could be successfully adopted to improve profits.
   Finally, to credibly commit to scarcity strategy, we show that firms can
   adopt sourcing strategies, such as sourcing from an expensive production
   location/supplier or using expensive raw materials.

   "reflected knowledge," knowledge that workers gain about the personal
   characteristics, relationships, and behavioral norms of their own site
   through the lens of their distant collaborators. Based on surveys
   gathered from 140 employees in a division of a global chemical company,
   we found that direct knowledge and reflected knowledge enhanced trust in
   distinct ways. Although both enhanced feelings of closeness with others,
   results indicate that direct knowledge increased focal actors'
   understanding of their distant colleagues, whereas reflected knowledge
   promoted feelings of being understood. We discuss implications of
   reflected knowledge to theories of trust and interpersonal dynamics in

AB This paper investigates the impact of royalty revision on incentives and
   profits in a two-stage (research and development (R&D) stage and
   marketing stage) alliance with a marketer and an innovator. The marketer
   offers royalty contracts to the innovator. We find that the potential
   for royalty revision leads to more severe distortions in the optimal
   initial royalty contracts offered by the marketer. We show that if the
   innovator plays a significant role in the marketing stage, the marketer
   should offer a low royalty rate initially and then revise the royalty
   rate up later. Otherwise, she should do the opposite. We identify two
   major effects of royalty revision. First, royalty revision provides the
   marketer with a flexibility to dynamically adjust royalty rates across
   the two stages of the alliance to better align the innovator's
   incentives. This incentive-realigning effect improves the marketer's
   profit. Second, royalty revision makes it harder for the marketer to
   obtain private information from the innovator, because the innovator
   worries that the marketer Will take advantage of the information to
   revise the initial contract to a more favorable one to herself later.
   This information-revealing effect hurts the marketer's profit. We
   characterize in what kind of alliances marketers would benefit the most
   from royalty revision so that managers should clearly establish the
   expectation for royalty revision, and in what kind of alliances
   markerters would not benefit from royalty revision so that managers
   should commit not to revise the initial royalty contract. With royalty
   contracts that are contingent on the R&D outcome of the R&D stage, we
   find that contingent contract structure could be either substitutable
   (by fully capturing the incentive re-aligning effect) or complementary
   (by weakening the information revealing effect) to royalty revision,
   depending on whether the innovator plays a significant role in the
   marketing stage. Managers may need to use a contingent contract (if
   possible) either to replace or with royalty revision accordingly to
   improve profits.

AB This study examines the role of repeat interactions between placement
   agents (investment banks) and investors in the initial pricing of
   convertible bonds. Under the assumption that attracting repeat investors
   can reduce search frictions in primary issue markets, we test the
   hypothesis that banks' relationships with investors actually allow more
   favorable pricing for issuing firms (in contrast to the "favoritism"
   hypothesis, under which banks use underpricing to reward favored
   clients). In the empirical analysis we also allow for a potentially
   important alternative channel through which search frictions might
   impact initial pricing: expected after-market liquidity. Using a sample
   of 601 Rule 144A issues for the years 1997-2007, we document robust
   negative relationships between at-issue discounts and both types of
   frictions. Our findings suggest that search frictions play a meaningful
   role in initial convertible bond pricing and, specifically, that
   intermediaries can add substantial value through repeated interactions
   with investors.

AB We introduce the pathwise optimization (PO) method, a new convex
   optimization procedure to produce upper and lower bounds on the optimal
   value (the "price") of a high-dimensional optimal stopping problem. The
   PO method builds on a dual characterization of optimal stopping problems
   as optimization problems over the space of martingales, which we dub the
   martingale duality approach. We demonstrate via numerical experiments
   that the PO method produces upper bounds of a quality comparable with
   state-of-the-art approaches, but in a fraction of the time required for
   those approaches. As a by-product, it yields lower bounds (and
   suboptimal exercise policies) that are substantially superior to those
   produced by state-of-the-art methods. The PO method thus constitutes a
   practical and desirable approach to high-dimensional pricing problems.
   Furthermore, we develop an approximation theory relevant to martingale
   duality approaches in general and the PO method in particular. Our
   analysis provides a guarantee on the quality of upper bounds resulting
   from these approaches and identifies three key determinants of their
   performance: the quality of an input value function approximation, the
   square root of the effective time horizon of the problem, and a certain
   spectral measure of "predictability" of the underlying Markov chain. As
   a corollary to this analysis we develop approximation guarantees
   specific to the PO method. Finally, we view the PO method and several
   approximate dynamic programming methods for high-dimensional pricing
   problems through a common lens and in doing so show that the PO method
   dominates those alternatives.

AB Affirmative action is often criticized for causing reverse
   discrimination and lowering the qualifications of those hired under the
   policy. However, the magnitude of such adverse effects depends on
   whether the best suited candidate is hired absent the policy. Indeed
   affirmative action may compensate for the distortion discrimination
   imposes on the selection of candidates. This paper asks whether
   affirmative action can have a similar corrective impact when qualified
   individuals fail to apply for a job. We evaluate the effect of
   introducing a gender quota in an environment where high-performing women
   fail to enter competitions they can win. We show that guaranteeing women
   equal representation among winners increases their entry. The response
   exceeds that predicted by the change in probability of winning and is in
   part driven by women being more willing to compete against other women.
   The consequences are substantial as the boost in supply essentially
   eliminates the anticipated costs of the policy.

AB We examine whether ownership of intellectual property rights (IPR) or

   complementary to a proprietary platform by preventing the platform owner
   from expropriating rents from start-ups. We study this question in the
   context of the software industry, an environment where evidence of the
   efficacy of IPR as a mechanism to appropriate the returns from
   innovation has been mixed. Entry, in our context, is measured by an
   independent software vendor's (ISV's) decision to become certified by a
   platform owner and produce applications compatible with the platform. We
   find that ISVs with a greater stock of formal IPR (such as patents and
   copyrights), and those with stronger downstream capabilities (as
   measured by trademarks and consulting services) are more likely to join
   the platform, suggesting that these mechanisms are effective in
   protecting ISVs from the threat of expropriation. We also find that the
   effects of IPR on the likelihood of partnership are greater when an ISV
   has weak downstream capabilities or when the threat of imitation is
   greater, such as when the markets served by the ISV are growing quickly.

AB Several organizations have developed ongoing crowdsourcing communities
   that repeatedly collect ideas for new products and services from a
   large, dispersed "crowd" of nonexperts (consumers) over time. Despite
   its promises, little is known about the nature of an individual's
   ideation efforts in such an online community. Studying Dell's IdeaStorm
   community, serial ideators are found to be more likely than consumers
   with only one idea to generate an idea the organization finds valuable
   enough to implement, but they are unlikely to repeat their early success
   once their ideas are implemented. As ideators with past success attempt
   to again come up with ideas that will excite the organization, they
   instead end up proposing ideas similar to their ideas that were already
   implemented (i.e., they generate less diverse ideas). The negative
   effects of past success are somewhat mitigated for ideators with diverse
   commenting activity on others' ideas. These findings highlight some of
   the challenges in maintaining an ongoing supply of quality ideas from
   the crowd over time.

   appreciated in value by a moderate 3.97% per year, in real U. S. dollar
   terms, between 1957 and 2007. This is a performance similar to that of
   corporate bonds-at much higher risk. A repeat-sales regression on a
   subset of the data demonstrates the robustness of our index. Next,
   quantile regressions document larger average price appreciations (and
   higher volatilities) in more expensive price brackets. We also find
   variation in historical returns across mediums and movements. Finally,
   we show that measures of high-income consumer confidence and art market

AB This paper derives and tests an intertemporal capital asset pricing
   model (ICAPM) based on a conditional version of the Campbell-Vuolteenaho
   two-beta ICAPM (bad beta, good beta (BBGB)). The novel factor is a
   scaled cash-flow factor that results from the interaction between
   cash-flow news and a lagged state variable (market dividend yield or
   consumer price index inflation). The cross-sectional tests over 10
   portfolios sorted on size, 10 portfolios sorted on book-to-market, and
   10 portfolios sorted on momentum show that the scaled ICAPM explains
   relatively well the dispersion in excess returns on the 30 portfolios.
   The results for an alternative set of equity portfolios (25 portfolios
   sorted on size and momentum) show that the scaled ICAPM prices
   particularly well the momentum portfolios. Moreover, the scaled ICAPM
   compares favorably with alternative asset pricing models in pricing both
   sets of equity portfolios. The scaled factor is decisive to account for
   the dispersion in average excess returns between past winner and past
   loser stocks. More specifically, past winners are riskier than past
   losers in times of high price of risk. Therefore, a time-varying
   cash-flow beta/price of risk provides a rational explanation for
   momentum.

AB W e propose a pure 0-1 formulation for the wireless network design
   problem, i.e., the problem of configuring a set of transmitters to
   provide service coverage to a set of receivers. In contrast with
   classical mixed-integer formulations, where power emissions are
   represented by continuous variables, we consider only a finite set of
   power values. This has two major advantages: it better fits the usual
   practice and eliminates the sources of numerical problems that heavily
   affect continuous models. A crucial ingredient of our approach is an
   effective basic formulation for the single knapsack problem representing
   the coverage condition of a receiver. This formulation is based on the
   generalized upper bound (GUB) cover inequalities introduced by Wolsey
   [Wolsey L (1990) Valid inequalities for 0-1 knapsacks and mips with
   generalised upper bound constraints. Discrete Appl. Math.
   29(2-3):251-261]; and its core is an extension of the exact formulation
   of the GUB knapsack polytope with two GUB constraints. This special case
   corresponds to the very common practical situation where only one major
   interferer is present. We assess the effectiveness of our formulation by
   comprehensive computational results over realistic instances of two
   typical technologies, namely, WiMAX and DVB-T.

AB In diagnostic services, agents typically need to weigh the benefit of
   running an additional test and improving the accuracy of diagnosis
   against the cost of delaying the provision of services to others. Our
   paper analyzes how to dynamically manage this accuracy/congestion
   trade-off. To that end, we study an elementary congested system facing
   an arriving stream of customers. The diagnostic process consists of a
   search problem in which the service provider conducts a sequence of
   imperfect tests to determine the customer's type. We find that the agent
   should continue to perform the diagnosis as long as her current belief
   that the customer is of a given type falls into an interval that depends
   on the congestion level as well as the number of performed tests thus
   far. This search interval should shrink as congestion intensifies and as
   the number of performed tests increases if additional conditions hold.
   Our study reveals that, contrary to diagnostic services without
   congestion, the base rate (i.e., the prior probability of the customer
   type) has an effect on the agent's search strategy. In particular, the
   optimal search interval shrinks when customer types are more ambiguous a
   priori, i.e., as the base rate approaches the value at which the agent
   is indifferent between types. Finally, because of congestion effects,
   the agent should sometimes diagnose the customer as being of a given
   type, even if test results indicate otherwise. All these insights
   disappear in the absence of congestion.

AB Portfolio optimization problems involving value at risk (VaR) are often

   portfolio contains derivatives. We develop two tractable conservative
   approximations for the VaR of a derivative portfolio by evaluating the
   worst-case VaR over all return distributions of the derivative
   underliers with given first-and second-order moments. The derivative
   returns are modelled as convex piecewise linear or-by using a
   delta-gamma approximation-as (possibly nonconvex) quadratic functions of
   the returns of the derivative underliers. These models lead to new
   worst-case polyhedral VaR (WPVaR) and worst-case quadratic VaR (WQVaR)
   approximations, respectively. WPVaR serves as a VaR approximation for
   portfolios containing long positions in European options expiring at the
   end of the investment horizon, whereas WQVaR is suitable for portfolios
   containing long and/or short positions in European and/or exotic options
   expiring beyond the investment horizon. We prove that-unlike VaR that
   may discourage diversification-WPVaR and WQVaR are in fact coherent risk
   measures. We also reveal connections to robust portfolio optimization.

   effectively promotes collaboration. The manufacturer prefers EMC if
   collaboration leads to a large reduction in unit cost and/or demand

   We first examine the effect of three dimensions of IT architecture
   flexibility (open communication standards, cross-functional
   transparency, and modularity) on formation of three types of alliances
   (arm's-length, collaborative, and joint-venture alliances,
   respectively). Then, we examine how capabilities in IT flexibility can
   enhance the value derived from alliances. Our sample includes data from
   169 firms that are publicly listed in the United States and that span
   multiple industries. We find that adoption of open communication
   standards is associated with the formation of arm's-length alliances,
   and modularity of IT architecture is associated with the formation of
   joint ventures. We also find that IT architecture flexibility enhances
   the value of arm's-length, collaborative, and joint-venture alliances.
   The contribution of IT flexibility to value is greater in the case of
   collaborative alliances than in arm's-length alliances. Taken together,
   these findings suggest that appropriate investments in IT can help to
   facilitate reconfiguration of resources and modification of processes in
   collaboration-intensive alliances.

AB It is commonly believed that piracy of information goods leads to lower
   profits, which translate to lower incentives to invest in innovation and
   eventually to lower-quality products. Manufacturers, policy makers, and
   researchers all claim that inadequate piracy enforcement efforts
   translate to lower investments in product development. However, we find
   many practical examples that contradict this claim. Therefore, to
   examine this claim more carefully, we develop a rigorous economic model
   of the manufacturer's quality decision problem in the presence of
   piracy. We consider a monopolist who does not have any marginal costs
   but has a product development cost quadratic in the quality level
   produced. The monopolist faces a consumer market heterogeneous in its

AB Choice models today are ubiquitous across a range of applications in
   operations and marketing. Real-world implementations of many of these
   models fire the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the
   "right" model of choice to use. Because models of choice are inherently
   high-dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this
   problem is positing, a priori, a parametric model that one believes
   adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially
   suboptimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model
   learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the
   risks of mis-specification and overfitting/underfitting. Thus motivated,
   we visit the following problem: For a "generic" model of consumer choice
   (namely, distributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of
   data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal
   information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues
   from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our
   investigation is a nonparametric approach in which the data
   automatically select the right choice model for revenue predictions. The
   approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales
   transaction data from a major U.S. automaker, our method demonstrates a
   20% improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art benchmark
   models; this improvement can translate into a 10% increase in revenues
   from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical
   issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models
   implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a
   step toward "automating" the crucial task of choice model selection.

AB In this paper we focus on robust linear optimization problems with
   uncertainty regions defined by phi-divergences (for example,
   chi-squared, Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler). We show how uncertainty
   regions based on phi-divergences arise in a natural way as confidence
   sets if the uncertain parameters contain elements of a probability
   vector. Such problems frequently occur in, for example, optimization
   problems in inventory control or finance that involve terms containing
   moments of random variables, expected utility, etc. We show that the
   robust counterpart of a linear optimization problem with phi-divergence
   uncertainty is tractable for most of the choices of phi typically
   considered in the literature. We extend the results to problems that are
   nonlinear in the optimization variables. Several applications, including
   an asset pricing example and a numerical multi-item newsvendor example,
   illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach.

AB This study outlines a new theory linking industry structure to optimal
   employment contracts and executive short-termism. Firms hire their
   executives using optimal contracts derived within a competitive labour
   market. To motivate effort, firms must use some variable remuneration.
   Such remuneration introduces a myopia problem: an executive would wish
   to inflate early expected earnings at some risk to future profits. To
   manage this short-termism, some bonus pay is deferred. Convergence in
   size among firms makes the cost of managing the myopia problem grow
   faster than the cost of managing the effort problem. Eventually, the
   optimal contract jumps from one deterring myopia to one tolerating
   myopia. Under some conditions, the industry partitions: the largest
   firms hire executives on contracts tolerant of myopia; smaller firms
   ensure myopia is ruled out.

AB Does the payment scheme have an effect on inventory decisions in the
   newsvendor problem? Keeping the net profit structure constant, we
   examine three payment schemes that can be interpreted as the
   newsvendor's order being financed by the newsvendor herself (scheme 0),
   by the supplier through delayed order payment (scheme S), and by the
   customer through advanced revenue (scheme C). In a laboratory study, we
   find that inventory quantities exhibit a consistent decreasing pattern
   in the order of schemes 0, S. and C, with the order quantities of scheme
   S being close to the expected-profit-maximizing solution. These
   observations are inconsistent with the expected-profit-maximizing model,
   contradict what a regular or hyperbolic time-discounting model would
   predict, and cannot be explained by the loss aversion model. Instead,
   they are consistent with a model that underweights the order-time
   payments, which can be explained by the "prospective accounting" theory
   in the mental accounting literature. A second study shows that the
   results hold even. if all physical payments are conducted at the same
   time, suggesting that the framing of the payment scheme is sufficient to
   induce the prospective accounting behavior. We further validate the
   robustness of our model under different profit conditions. Our findings
   contribute to the understanding of the psychological processes involved
   in newsvendor decisions and have implications for supply chain financing
   and contract design.

AB Financial professionals have a great deal of discretion concerning how
   to relay information about the risk of financial products to their
   clients. This paper introduces a new risk tool to communicate the risk
   of investment products, and it examines how different risk-presentation
   modes influence risk-taking behavior and investors' recall ability of
   the risk-return profile of financial products. We analyze four different
   ways of communicating risk: (i) numerical descriptions, (ii) experience
   sampling, (iii) graphical displays, and (iv) a combination of these
   formats in the "risk tool." Participants receive information about a
   risky and a risk-free fund and make an allocation between the two in an
   experimental investment portfolio. We find that risky allocations are
   elevated in both the risk tool and experience sampling conditions.
   Greater risky allocations in the risk tool condition are associated with
   decreased risk perception, increased confidence in the risky fund, and a
   lower estimation of the probability of a loss. In addition to these
   favorable perceptions of the risky fund, participants in the risk tool
   condition are more accurate on recall questions regarding the expected
   return and the probability of a loss. We find no evidence of greater
   dissatisfaction with returns in these conditions, and we observe a
   willingness to take on similar levels of risk in subsequent allocations.

   selection of optimal stimuli for discriminating among models of risky
   choice. The approach, called adaptive design optimization, adapts the
   stimulus in each experimental trial based on the results of the
   preceding trials. We demonstrate the validity of the approach with

AB Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are important numerical tools in the
   pricing and hedging of complex financial instruments. The effectiveness
   of QMC methods crucially depends on the discontinuity and the dimension
   of the problem. This paper shows how the two fundamental limitations can
   be overcome in some cases. We first study how path-generation methods
   (PGMs) affect the structure of the discontinuities and what the effect
   of discontinuities is on the accuracy of QMC methods. The insight is
   that the discontinuities can be QMC friendly (i.e., aligned with the
   coordinate axes) or not, depending on the PGM. The PGMs that offer the
   best performance in QMC methods are those that make the discontinuities
   QMC friendly. The structure of discontinuities can affect the accuracy
   of QMC methods more significantly than the effective dimension. This
   insight motivates us to propose a novel way of handling the
   discontinuities. The basic idea is to align the discontinuities with the
   coordinate axes by a judicious design of a method for simulating the
   underlying processes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
   proposed method leads to dramatic variance reduction in QMC methods for
   pricing options and for estimating Greeks. It also reduces the effective
   dimension of the problem.

AB We analyze price and quality competition in a vertically differentiated
   duopoly in which consumers have a preference for variety. The preference
   for variety is a consequence of diminishing marginal utility for
   repeated experiences with the same product. We find consumer variety
   seeking can either soften or intensify price competition, depending on
   the difference in firm qualities and the strength of consumer preference
   for variety When the qualities are similar (or the consumer preference
   for variety is strong), prices and profits are higher than would be
   obtained in the absence of variety seeking. On the other hand, if
   qualities differ enough (or the preference for variety is weak),
   stronger preferences for variety are associated with more intense price
   competition and lower profits. When firms set their qualities before
   competing on price and the range of feasible qualities is restricted
   such that variety seeking softens competition, competing firms choose to
   minimally differentiate themselves from each other. The preference for
   variety can drive the firms to offer multiunit discounts, and the
   greater price flexibility from these discounts does not necessarily
   reduce profits relative to simple unit pricing.

AB Some product firms increasingly rely on service revenues as part of
   their business models. One possible explanation is that they turn to
   services to generate additional profits when their product industries
   mature and product revenues and profits decline. We explore this
   assumption by examining the role of services in the financial
   performance of firms in the prepackaged software products industry
   (Standard Industrial Classification code 7372) from 1990 to 2006. We
   find a convex, nonlinear relationship between a product firm's fraction
   of total sales coming from services and its overall operating margins.
   As expected, firms with a very high level of product sales are most
   profitable, and rising services are associated with declining
   profitability We find, however, that additional services start to have a
   positive marginal effect on the firm's overall profits when services
   reach a majority of a product firm's sales. We show that traditional
   industry maturity arguments cannot fully explain our data. It is likely
   that changes in both strategy and the business environment lead product
   firms to place more emphasis on services.

AB Backward induction is a widely accepted principle for predicting
   behavior in sequential games. In the classic example of the "centipede
   game," however, players frequently violate this principle. An
   alternative is a "dynamic level-k" model, where players choose a rule
   from a rule hierarchy. The rule hierarchy is iteratively defined such
   that the level-k rule is a best response to the level-(k - 1) rule, and
   the level-infinity rule corresponds to backward induction. Players
   choose rules based on their best guesses of others' rules and use
   historical plays to improve their guesses. The model captures two
   systematic violations of backward induction in centipede games, limited
   induction and repetition unraveling. Because the dynamic level-k model
   always converges to backward induction over repetition, the former can
   be considered to be a tracing procedure for the latter. We also examine
   the generalizability of the dynamic level-k model by applying it to
   explain systematic violations of backward induction in sequential
   bargaining games. We show that the same model is capable of capturing
   these violations in two separate bargaining experiments.

   brought about through aggregation, we assume an economy consisting
   entirely of risk seekers. We show that such individuals can lead to an
   aggregate economy that is risk averse. The converse is also true. An
   aggregate economy that exhibits risk aversion does not imply an economy
   of individual risk averters. An economy demanding a risk premium can be
   formed from individuals who do not demand such compensation.
   Understanding the relationship between the preferences of individuals

   the strategies considered. We illustrate and test our method on the

   and cannot borrow or short sell. The upper loss bound is small, and our
   method performs well in comparison with two existing methods.

   citations as a measure of knowledge flows from public research by
   employing a newly constructed data set that matches patents to survey
   data at the level of the research and development lab. Using
   survey-based measures of the dimensions of knowledge flows, we identify
   sources of systematic measurement error associated with backward
   citations to both patent and nonpatent references. We find that patent
   citations reflect the codified knowledge flows from public research, but
   they appear to miss knowledge flows that are more private and contract
   based in nature, as well as those used in firm basic research. We also
   find that firms' patenting and citing strategies affect patent
   citations, making citations less indicative of knowledge flows. In
   addition, an illustrative analysis examining the magnitude and direction
   of measurement error bias suggests that measuring knowledge flows with
   patent citations can lead to substantial underestimation of the effect
   of public research on firms' innovative performance. Throughout our
   analyses we find that nonpatent references (e.g., journals, conferences,
   etc.), not the more commonly used patent references, are a better
   measure of knowledge originating from public research.

AB We present a method that dynamically designs elicitation questions for
   estimating risk and time preference parameters. Typically these
   parameters are elicited by presenting decision makers with a series of
   static choices between alternatives, gambles, or delayed payments. The
   proposed method dynamically (i.e., adaptively) designs such choices to
   optimize the information provided by each choice, while leveraging the
   distribution of the parameters across decision makers (heterogeneity)
   and capturing response error. We explore the convergence and the
   validity of our approach using simulations. The simulations suggest that
   the proposed method recovers true parameter values well under various
   circumstances. We then use an online experiment to compare our approach
   to a standard one used in the literature that requires comparable task
   completion time. We assess predictive accuracy in an out-of-sample task
   and completion time for both methods. For risk preferences, our results
   indicate that the proposed method predicts subjects' willingness to pay
   for a set of out-of-sample gambles significantly more accurately, while
   taking respondents about the same time to complete. For time
   preferences, both methods predict out-of-sample preferences equally
   well, while the proposed method takes significantly less completion
   time. For risk and time preferences, average completion time for our
   approach is approximately three minutes. Finally, we briefly review
   three applications that used the proposed methodology with various
   populations, and we discuss the potential benefits of the proposed
   methodology for research and practice.

AB The rapid pace of technological innovation necessitates that information
   technology ( IT) services firms continually invest in replenishing the
   skills of their key asset base, the human capital. We examine whether
   human capital investments directed toward employee training are
   effective in improving employee performance. Our rich employee level
   panel data set affords us the opportunity to link formal training with
   performance at the individual employee level. Using a dynamic panel
   model, we identify a significant positive impact of training on employee
   performance. A unit increase in training is linked to a 2.14% increase
   in an employee's performance. Interestingly, we find that in the IT
   sector, skills atrophy and consequently high-experience employees reap
   higher returns from training, which highlights the uniquely dynamic
   nature of IT knowledge and skills. We also find that general training
   that an employee can utilize outside the focal firm improves employee
   performance. However, specific training pertinent to the focal firm is
   not positively linked to performance. On the other hand, although domain
   and technical training both enhance employee performance individually,
   the interaction between the two suggests a substitutive relationship.
   Thus, our findings suggest that the value of training is conditional on
   a focused curricular approach that emphasizes a structured competency
   development program. Our findings have both theoretical and practical
   significance. Most important, they justify increased human capital
   investments to fuel future growth in this important component of the
   global economy.

   holding these firms upon their SSDPB initiation in a calendar portfolio
   earns a four-factor annualized excess return (alpha) of approximately

AB Previous endowment effect experiments have examined circumstances in
   which people encounter a single unit of a good (e.g., one chocolate). We
   contrast single-unit treatments with multiple-unit treatments in which
   participants encounter several units of a good (e.g., five chocolates).
   We observe endowment effects of typical magnitude for singleton holdings
   but attenuated endowment effects for multiple-unit holdings. Moreover,
   endowment effects consistently arise for singletons even as the
   definition of a unit is altered. For instance, participants holding one
   piece of chocolate show an endowment effect of standard size, but so do
   participants holding one box of chocolates. Yet the box contains about
   20 individual pieces of chocolate, and participants given that many
   separate pieces show a substantially attenuated endowment effect. We
   thus propose the property of "unit dependence": the definition of a unit
   can change, but contingent on any given definition, a pronounced
   endowment effect may emerge for singletons but not multiples.

AB This work explores the potential of revenue-sharing contracts to
   facilitate information sharing in a supply chain and mitigate the
   negative effects of information leakage. We consider a supplier who
   offers a revenue-sharing contract to two competing retailers, one of
   whom has private information about uncertain market potential and orders
   first. This order information may be leaked to the uninformed retailer
   by the supplier to realize higher profits. We show that the incentives
   of the supplier and retailers are better aligned under a revenue-sharing
   contract, as opposed to under a wholesale-price contract, reducing the
   supplier's incentive to leak. This is true for a wide range of wholesale
   prices and revenue-share percentages and is more likely when the
   revenue-share percentage is higher and when variation in demand is
   greater. Preventing information leakage may result in higher profits not
   only for the informed retailer and supplier but surprisingly even for
   the uninformed retailer. Our results are robust when the model is
   generalized along various dimensions.

AB Some environments constrain the information that managers and decision

   constraint, the censorship point, systematically distorts the observed
   sample. Random instances beyond the censorship point are observed at the
   censorship point, whereas uncensored instances are observed at their
   true value. Many important managerial decisions occur in censored
   environments, such as inventory, risk taking, and employee evaluation
   decisions. In this research, we demonstrate a censorship
   bias-individuals tend to rely too heavily on the observed censored
   sample, biasing their belief about the underlying population. We further
   show that the censorship bias is exacerbated for higher degrees of
   censorship, higher variance in the population, and higher variability in
   the censorship points. In four studies, we find evidence of the
   censorship bias across the domains of demand estimation and sequential
   risk taking. The bias causes individuals to make costly decisions and
   behave in an overly risk-averse manner.

   the fill rates provided to them in the past. A customer's order quantity
   is positively correlated with past fill rates. Customers differ from one
   another in their contribution margins, their sensitivities to the past,
   and in their demand volatilities. By analyzing and comparing policies
   that ignore goodwill with ones that account for it, we investigate when
   and how customer memory effects impact supplier profits. We develop an
   approximate dynamic programming policy that dynamically rationalizes the
   fill rates the firm provides to each customer. This policy achieves
   higher rewards than margin-greedy and Lagrangian policies and yields
   insights into how a supplier can effectively manage customer memories to
   its advantage.

   of end-product functionalities prepackaged into the subsystem impacts
   the optimal introduction strategy and the relative value appropriation
   power across the industries. Offering a subsystem that performs many
   end-product functions has a dual effect on the provider's profits. On
   the positive side, the provider extracts a higher ease-of-use rent from
   the integrators because of the easier/cheaper integration. On the
   negative side, such subsystems may curtail the adopters' ability for
   competitive differentiation and render adoption less valuable. We
   discuss the role of subsystem functionality in value appropriation in

AB Models of horizontal integration typically describe a trade-off between
   multiunit efficiencies and managerial agency costs. In extreme cases
   where managers cannot be incented contractually, private ownership is
   thought to be the primary organizational substitute. In this paper we
   explore geographic clustering as an alternative strategy for controlling
   managerial agency costs within the chain form of organization.
   Clustering may facilitate scale efficiencies in both monitoring and
   supervision, resulting in reduced agency costs and improved application
   of the chain's business model. We test this hypothesis in the nursing
   home industry, which is characterized by managerial contract costs
   resulting from multitask models of production. We find that clustered
   nursing homes achieve higher quality, conditional on labor inputs and
   patient characteristics. The clustering effect is concentrated on
   reductions in minor/potential harm violations, which are difficult to
   observe without close monitoring. Several proxies for local
   organizational experience ("local learning") cannot account for our
   findings, which are robust to a variety of alternative clustering
   definitions and competing explanations based on gaming behavior. Further
   tests indicate that chains endogenously pursue clustering, presumably to
   realize the benefits of improved quality outcomes.

   discovery, though its volume is low. The relative contribution of a
   trading system to price discovery depends on liquidity, volatility,

   even in the absence of transaction costs. In addition, an increase in

AB Film studios occasionally withhold movies from critics before their
   release. Because the unreviewed movies tend to be below average in
   quality, this practice provides a useful setting in which to test models
   of limited strategic thinking: Do moviegoers seem to realize that no
   review is a sign of low quality? A companion paper showed that in a set
   of all widely released movies in 2000-2009, cold opening produces a
   significant 20%-30% increase in domestic box office revenue, which is
   consistent with moviegoers overestimating quality of unreviewed movies
   (perhaps due to limited strategic thinking). This paper reviews those
   findings and provides two models to analyze this data: an equilibrium
   model and a behavioral cognitive hierarchy model that allows for
   differing levels of strategic thinking between moviegoers and movie
   studios. The behavioral model fits the data better, because moviegoer
   parameters are relatively close to those observed in experimental
   subjects. These results suggests that limited strategic thinking rather
   than equilibrium reasoning may be a better explanation for naive
   moviegoer behavior.

AB One central business activity that companies increasingly outsource is
   the information systems (IS) function. Previous research has shown that
   outsourcing of back-office IS generally has a positive effect on
   shareholder value of the outsourcing firm. Much less is known about the
   performance implications of outsourcing of another important IS
   function, namely, front-office customer relationship management (CRM)
   systems, where the vendor uses its own personnel and software to perform
   several CRM tasks. Previous, largely anecdotal evidence shows that the
   performance implications of outsourcing CRM range from very negative to
   very positive. To address this unsatisfactory state of knowledge, we
   provide and empirically test a contingency perspective on the
   performance implications of outsourcing CRM processes. We do so using
   the event-study methodology. The results are largely consistent with our
   contingency model. CRM outsourcing is more beneficial to firms that are
   high on information technology capabilities and low on marketing
   capabilities, and less beneficial when it concerns presales CRM.
   Similarly, although vendor economic distance has a positive influence on
   the outsourcing firm's shareholder value, vendor cultural distance has a
   negative influence. These effects are in turn significantly moderated by
   the type of CRM process outsourced.

AB Because of the health and economic costs of childhood obesity, coupled
   with studies suggesting the benefits of comprehensive (dietary, physical
   activity, and behavioral counseling) intervention, the U. S. Preventive
   Services Task Force recently recommended childhood screening and
   intervention for obesity beginning at age 6. Using a longitudinal data
   set consisting of the body mass index of 3,164 children up to age 18 and
   another longitudinal data set containing the body mass index at ages 18
   and 40 and the presence or absence of disease (hypertension and
   diabetes) at age 40 for 747 people, we formulate and numerically
   solve-separately for boys and girls-a dynamic programming problem for
   the optimal biennial (i.e., at ages 2, 4, ... , 16) obesity screening
   thresholds. Unlike most screening problem formulations, we take a
   societal viewpoint, where the state of the system at each age is the
   population-wide probability density function of the body mass index.
   Compared to the biennial version of the task force's recommendation, the
   screening thresholds derived from the dynamic program achieve a relative
   reduction in disease prevalence of 3% at the same screening (and
   treatment) cost, or-because of the flatness of the disease versus
   screening trade-off curve-achieves the same disease prevalence at a 28%
   relative reduction in cost. Compared to the task force's policy, which
   uses the 95th percentile of body mass index (from cross-sectional growth
   charts tabulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) as
   the screening threshold for each age, the dynamic programming policy
   treats mostly 16-year-olds (including many who are not obese) and very
   few males under 14 years old. Although our results suggest that adult
   hypertension and diabetes are minimized by focusing childhood obesity
   screening and treatment on older adolescents, the shortcomings in the
   available data and the narrowness of the medical outcomes considered
   prevent us from making a recommendation about childhood obesity
   screening policies.

AB T he extensive use of information technologies by organizations to
   collect and share personal data has raised strong privacy concerns. To
   respond to the public's demand for data privacy, a class of
   clustering-based data masking techniques is increasingly being used for
   privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics. Although they address
   reidentification risks, traditional clustering-based approaches for
   masking numeric attributes typically do not consider the disclosure risk
   of categorical confidential attributes. We propose a new approach to
   deal with this problem. The proposed method clusters data such that the
   data points within a group are similar in the nonconfidential attribute
   values, whereas the confidential attribute values within a group are
   well distributed. To accomplish this, the clustering method, which is
   based on a minimum spanning tree (MST) technique, uses two risk-utility
   trade-off measures in the growing and pruning stages of the MST
   technique, respectively. As part of our approach we also propose a novel
   cluster-level microperturbation method for masking data that overcomes a
   common problem of traditional clustering-based methods for data masking,
   which is their inability to preserve important statistical properties
   such as the variance of attributes and the covariance across attributes.
   We show that the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the masked
   data generated using the microperturbation method are unbiased estimates
   of the original mean vector and covariance matrix. An experimental study
   on several real-world data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.

AB Manufacturer-to-consumer rebates are a staple of modern supply chains.
   Such rebates are typically viewed as a means of price discrimination
   because of partial redemption by consumers. However, the proliferation
   of universally redeemed instant rebates suggests the practice may be
   motivated by additional considerations, an issue we tackle in this
   paper. Our results demonstrate that consumer rebates can be particularly
   useful when a supply chain encounters inefficiencies stemming from
   strategic inventory buildup by retailers. Wary of high wholesale prices,
   a retailer may hold excess inventory to convey a lower willingness to
   pay in future interactions and thereby strategically undercut future
   wholesale prices. As a retaliatory consequence, the manufacturer sets
   high near-term wholesale prices. The "pull" promotion from consumer
   rebates encourages more timely retail sales and in doing so undercuts
   (but does not eliminate) the retailer's strategic inventories. In other
   words, the introduction of consumer rebates can serve as an enticement
   for retailers to sell, not just for consumers to buy. Perhaps
   surprisingly, we find that the manufacturer, retailer, and consumers
   alike all benefit from the use of rebates, this despite the fact that
   the manufacturer uses the rebates in self interest and as a strategic
   weapon.

AB We propose a relational theory of how change agents in organizations use
   the strength of ties in their network to overcome resistance to change.
   We argue that strong ties to potentially influential organization
   members who are ambivalent about a change (fence-sitters) provide the
   change agent with an affective basis to coopt them. This cooptation
   increases the probability that the organization will adopt the change.
   By contrast, strong ties to potentially influential organization members
   who disapprove of a change outright (resistors) are an effective means
   of affective cooptation only when a change diverges little from
   institutionalized practices. With more divergent changes, the advantages
   of strong ties to resistors accruing to the change agent are weaker, and
   may turn into liabilities that reduce the likelihood of change adoption.
   Analyses of longitudinal data from 68 multimethod case studies of
   organizational change initiatives conducted at the National Health
   Service in the United Kingdom support these predictions and advance a
   relational view of organizational change in which social networks

AB Building on the seminal work of Thomas J. Allen, we contribute to the
   emerging microlevel theory of knowledge recombination by examining how
   individual-level characteristics of inventors affect the breadth of
   their technological recombinations. Our data set combines information
   from 30,550 European patents with matched survey data obtained from
   1,880 inventors. The analysis supports the view that inventors with a
   scientific education are more likely to generate patents that span
   technological boundaries (in our case, 30 broad, top-level technological
   domains) than inventors with an engineering degree. A doctoral degree is
   associated with increased recombination breadth for all groups of
   inventors. The breadth of an inventor's technological recombinations
   diminishes with increasing temporal distance to his education, but the
   differences between scientists and engineers persist over time. Our
   findings provide several new insights for research on inventors, the
   literature on organizational learning and innovation, and strategy
   research.

AB This study examines how momentum shapes organizational risk taking. We
   define momentum as a sustained and systematic trajectory in performance
   over time, and we argue that such trends impact interpretations of
   current performance as well as expectations of future performance.
   Drawing on the variable focus of attention model, we posit that momentum
   therefore directs the focus of organizational attention between concerns
   of aspirations, survival, and slack. Our conceptual model accounts for
   momentum that occurs within a performance period as well as that which
   occurs across periods. We propose that within- and across-period
   momentums are unique in terms of when and how each type impacts risk
   taking. We tested and found support for our hypotheses in the context of
   22,603 play-by-play decisions made by the 32 teams of the National
   Football League during the 2000-2005 regular season games. Theoretical
   and practical implications are discussed.

AB Capital budgeting frequently involves multiple stages at which firms can
   continue or abandon ongoing projects. In this paper, we study a project
   requiring two stages of investment. Failure to fund Stage 1 of the
   investment precludes investment in Stage 2, whereas failure to fund
   Stage 2 results in early termination. In contrast to the existing
   literature, we assume that the firm can limit the manager's
   informational rents with the early termination of the project. In this
   setting, we find that the firm optimally commits to a capital allocation
   scheme whereby it forgoes positive net present value (NPV) projects at
   Stage 1 (capital rationing), whereas at Stage 2, depending on the
   manager's previous report, it sometimes implements projects with a
   negative continuation NPV but in other situations forgoes implementing
   projects with positive continuation NPVs.

AB This paper is concerned with systemic risk in an interbank market,
   modelled as a directed graph of interbank obligations. This builds on
   the modelling paradigm of Eisenberg and Noe [Eisenberg L, Noe TH (2001)
   Systemic risk in financial systems. Management Sci. 47(2):236-249] by
   introducing costs of default if loans have to be called in by a failing
   bank. This immediately introduces novel and realistic effects. We find
   that, in general, many different clearing vectors can arise, among which
   there is a greatest clearing vector, arrived at by letting banks fail in
   succession until only solvent banks remain. Such a collapse should be
   prevented if at all possible. We then study situations in which
   consortia of banks may have the means and incentives to rescue failing
   banks. This again departs from the conclusions of the earlier work of
   Eisenberg and Noe, where in the absence of default losses there would be
   no incentive for solvent banks to rescue failing banks. We conclude with
   some remarks about how a rescue consortium might be constructed.

AB This paper uses an analytical model to examine the consequences of
   add-on pricing when firms are both horizontally and vertically
   differentiated and there is a segment of boundedly rational consumers
   who are unaware of the add-on fees at the time of initial purchase. We
   find that consumers who know the add-on fees can be penalized-and
   increasingly so-by the existence of boundedly rational consumers. Our
   consideration of quality asymmetries on base goods and add-ons, plus the
   inclusion of boundedly rational consumers, leads to several novel
   findings regarding firm profits. When quality asymmetry is on base goods
   only and with boundedly rational consumers, add-on pricing can diminish
   profit for a qualitatively superior firm and increase profit for an
   inferior firm (i.e., a lose-win result), compared to when add-on pricing
   is prohibited or infeasible. When quality asymmetries exist on both base
   goods and add-ons and without boundedly rational consumers, the opposite
   win-lose result prevails. When quality asymmetries exist on both base
   goods and add-ons and with boundedly rational consumers, the result can
   be win-win, win-lose, or lose-win, depending on the magnitude of quality
   differentiation on add-ons.

AB In most employment relationships, the employee's performance at the firm
   is privately, not publicly, observed. Firms can reward successful
   employees by publicizing their abilities, for example, via a job title,
   a glowing letter of recommendation, or a resume-worthy award. Firms that
   establish reputations for hiring young workers and promoting those who
   succeed lose good workers to competitors but can pay less to young,
   inexperienced workers in exchange. We find in a general equilibrium
   setting that firms with reputations for publicizing performance are able
   to pay less to employees at every level of tenure and thus earn economic
   profit, but that these firms will never be the most productive in the
   economy. For such equilibria to exist, the worker-firm match must be
   important, suggesting that this practice takes place only in
   human-capital-intensive industries.

AB The strategic use of first-party content by two-sided platforms is
   driven by two key factors: the nature of buyer and seller expectations
   (favorable versus unfavorable) and the nature of the relationship
   between first-party content and third-party content (complements or
   substitutes). Platforms facing unfavorable expectations face an
   additional constraint: their prices and first-party content investment
   need to be such that low (zero) participation equilibria are eliminated.
   This additional constraint typically leads them to invest more (less) in
   first-party content relative to platforms facing favorable expectations
   when first-and third-party content are substitutes (complements). These
   results hold with both simultaneous and sequential entry of the two
   sides. With two competing platforms-incumbent facing favorable
   expectations and entrant facing unfavorable expectations-and
   multi-homing on one side of the market, the incumbent always invests
   (weakly) more in first-party content relative to the case in which it is
   a monopolist.

AB Price-matching guarantees involve a retailer matching the lower price of
   a competitor for an identical product. In reality, retailers often make
   such guarantees contingent on the verification of product availability
   at the competitor's location, and decline a price-match request if the
   product is not available there. This creates certain consternation on
   the part of customers. In this paper, we investigate the availability
   contingency strategy from the perspectives of both the retailers and the
   customers. Our analysis shows that availability contingency clauses
   intensify inventory competition between retailers and reinstitutes price
   competition, which is otherwise eliminated by unconditional
   price-matching guarantees. Consequently, despite what customers may
   think about the availability verification, it actually increases their
   surplus. On the other hand, such a clause reduces profits and, hence, is
   not the equilibrium strategy for retailers. Subsequently, we discuss how
   a likely customer behaviour pattern may be a plausible explanation
   regarding the use of the clause by the retailers in practice.

AB This paper investigates the role of time in forecast information sharing
   and decision making under uncertainty. To do so, we provide a general
   framework to model the evolutions of forecasts generated by multiple
   decision makers who forecast demand for the same product. We also model
   the evolutions of forecasts when decision makers have asymmetric demand
   information and refer to it as the Martingale Model of Asymmetric
   Forecast Evolutions. This model helps us study mechanism design problems
   in a dynamic environment. In particular, we consider a supplier's
   (principal's) problem of eliciting credible forecast information from a
   manufacturer (agent) when both firms obtain asymmetric demand
   information for the end product over multiple periods. The supplier uses
   demand information to better plan for a capacity investment decision.
   When the supplier postpones building capacity and screening the
   manufacturer's private information, the supplier and the manufacturer
   can obtain more information and update their forecasts. This delay,
   however, may increase (respectively, decrease) the degree of information
   asymmetry between the two firms, resulting in a higher (respectively,
   lower) cost of screening. The capacity building cost may also increase
   because of a tighter deadline for building capacity. Considering all
   such trade-offs, the supplier has to determine (i) when to stop
   obtaining new demand information and build capacity, (ii) whether to
   offer a screening contract to credibly elicit private forecast
   information or to determine the capacity level without information
   sharing, (iii) how much capacity to build, and (iv) how to design the
   overall mechanism so that both firms benefit from this mechanism. This
   paper provides an answer to these questions. In doing so, we develop a
   new solution approach for a class of dynamic mechanism design problems.
   In addition, this paper provides a framework to quantify the option
   value of time for a strategic investment decision under the dynamic
   evolutions of asymmetric forecasts.

AB Prior research on equity analysts focuses almost exclusively on those
   employed by sell-side investment banks and brokerage houses. Yet
   investment firms undertake their own buy-side research, and their
   analysts face different stock selection and recommendation incentives
   than their sell-side peers. We examine the selection and performance of
   stocks recommended by analysts at a large investment firm relative to
   those of sell-side analysts from mid-1997 to 2004. We find that the
   buy-side firm's analysts issue less optimistic recommendations for
   stocks with larger market capitalizations and lower return volatility
   than their sell-side peers, consistent with their facing fewer conflicts
   of interest and having a preference for liquid stocks. Tests with no
   controls for these effects indicate that annualized buy-side strong
   buy/buy recommendations underperform those for sell-side peers by 5.9%
   using market-adjusted returns and by 3.8% using four-factor model
   abnormal returns. However, these findings are driven by differences in
   the stocks recommended and their market capitalization. After
   controlling for these selection effects, we find no difference in the
   performance of the buy- and sell-side analysts' strong buy/buy
   recommendations.

AB We propose a two-stage game-theoretic approach to study the operations
   of an airline alliance in which independent carriers, managing different
   reservation and information systems, can collaboratively market and
   operate codeshare and interline itineraries. In the first-stage game,
   airlines negotiate fixed proration rates to share the revenues generated
   by such itineraries. In the second-stage game, airlines operate
   independent inventory control systems to maximize their own expected
   revenues. We derive a revenue-sharing rule that is (i) an admissible
   outcome of the first-stage negotiation, in the sense that no airline
   coalition has enough incentives to secede from the grand alliance, and
   (ii) efficient for the second-stage game, in the sense that the
   decentralized system can achieve the same revenues as a central planner
   managing the global alliance network. Our numerical study shows that the
   proposed proration rates can lead to a significant increase in revenues
   with respect to other rules commonly used in practice. Finally, because
   our proposal requires the disclosure of private demand information, we
   introduce a simple alternative rule that is based on public information.
   This heuristic performs remarkably well, becoming an interesting
   candidate to be pursued in practice.

   the eye movements, a middle layer that identifies information
   acquisition processes, and an upper layer that captures strategy
   switching. The proposed model accounts for the data better than several
   alternative models. The results show that consumers switch frequently
   between acquisition strategies, and they obtain information on only two
   or three attributes or products in a particular acquisition strategy
   before switching. Horizontal and contiguous eye movements play an
   important role in information acquisition. Furthermore, our results shed
   new light on the phenomenon of gaze cascades during choice. We discuss

   policy. The existing policy consists of a daily payment for each patient
   under care with a global cap of revenues accrued during the Medicare
   year, which increases with each newly admitted patient. We investigate
   the hospice's expected profit and provide reasons for a spate of recent
   provider bankruptcies related to the reimbursement policy;
   recommendations to alleviate these problems are given. We also analyze a
   hospice's incentives for patient management, finding several unintended
   consequences of the Medicare reimbursement policy. Specifically, a
   hospice may seek short-lived patients (such as cancer patients) over
   patients with longer expected lengths of stay. The effort with which
   hospices seek out, or recruit, such patients will vary during the year.
   Furthermore, the effort they apply to actively discharge a patient whose
   condition has stabilized may also depend on the time of year. These
   phenomena are unintended and undesirable but are a direct consequence of
   the Medicare reimbursement policy. We propose an alternative
   reimbursement policy to ameliorate these shortcomings.

   understand how licensing activity should be organized within large
   corporations. More specifically, we compare decentralization-where the
   business unit using the technology makes licensing decisions-to
   centralized licensing. The business unit has superior information about
   licensing opportunities but may not have the appropriate incentives
   because its rewards depend on product market performance. If licensing
   is decentralized, the business unit forgoes valuable licensing
   opportunities because the rewards for licensing are (optimally) weaker
   than those for product market profits. This distortion is stronger when
   production-based incentives, especially private benefits, of business
   unit managers are more powerful, making centralization more attractive.
   Surprisingly, we find that interdependency across business units may
   result in more, not less, decentralization. Furthermore, even though
   centralization results in less information, centralized licensing deals
   are larger. Our model conforms to the existing evidence that reports
   heterogeneity across firms in both licensing propensity and organization
   of licensing.

AB Manufacturers manage interrelated flows of material and cash. Material
   needs capital, and sales contribute cash. Therefore, it may be
   beneficial to coordinate operational and financial decisions. We study a
   dynamic model of coordination in an equity-financed firm in which
   inventory and financial decisions interact in the presence of demand
   uncertainty, financial constraints, and a risk of default. The criterion
   is to maximize the expected present value of dividends net of capital
   subscriptions. The optimal target inventory level and financial decision
   variables are nondecreasing functions of the levels of inventory and
   retained earnings. Some important attributes of an optimal policy remain
   the same regardless of whether default precipitates Chapter 7 or Chapter
   11 bankruptcy. The optimal policy is myopic, and if pertinent cost
   functions are piecewise linear, it is characterized with simple
   formulas. We show that the methods of inventory theory are useful in
   analyzing models of operational and financial coordination.

AB We model a system that consists of a stream of customers processed
   through three steps by two resources. The first resource, an
   investigator, handles the first step, in which she collects information
   from the customer and decides what work will be done in the second step
   by the second resource, the back office. In the third step, the
   investigator returns to the customer armed with the additional
   information or analysis done by the back office and provides the
   customer with a conclusion, solution, or diagnosis. The investigator has
   to prioritize either seeing a new customer or completing the work with a
   customer already in the system. While serving one customer, the
   investigator may be interrupted by requests from the other customers in
   the system. Our main objective is to understand the impact of the
   investigator's choices on system throughput. In addition, we are
   interested in the occupancy of the system (and thus the flow time of
   customers). We create a stylized queueing model to examine the
   investigator's decisions and show that, when interruptions are not an
   issue, the investigator should prioritize new customers to maximize
   throughput, keeping the system as full as possible. If customers who
   have been in the system for a long time generate interruptions and thus
   additional work for the investigator, we show that it is asymptotically
   optimal for the investigator to keep the system occupancy low and
   prioritize discharging customers. Our conclusions are based on a model
   of a re-entrant queue with dedicated servers serving multiple stations,
   with two novel features: a buffer that is shared between stations, and
   jobs in the system generating additional work for the servers.

AB Business groups are key sources of innovation in emerging market
   economies, but we understand little about why innovativeness differs
   across groups and over time. Variation in the density of intragroup
   buyer-supplier ties, which are common structural linkages among group
   affiliates, can help explain both cross-sectional and temporal
   heterogeneity of group innovativeness. We argue that greater
   buyer-supplier density within a group initially creates combinatorial
   opportunities that contribute to group innovativeness but ultimately
   generates combinatorial exhaustion that constrains innovation.
   Combinatorial exhaustion will set in at lower levels of density as the
   market environment becomes more developed because the opportunity costs
   of local search increase. The research introduces a dynamic argument to
   studies of business-group innovation.

AB This paper shows that the effect of different distribution channel
   structures on product quality depends on the type of consumer
   heterogeneity and its distribution in a market. When consumer
   heterogeneity is uniformly distributed either vertically on willingness
   to pay or horizontally on transaction costs, a manufacturer may provide
   the same or lower product quality in a decentralized channel than in a
   centralized channel. In contrast, when consumer heterogeneity follows a
   more general distribution on willingness to pay, under certain
   conditions, the manufacturer may provide higher product quality in a
   decentralized channel than in a centralized channel. Decentralization
   also may lead to a higher product quality if consumer heterogeneity is
   uniformly distributed both vertically and horizontally, but not if
   consumer heterogeneity is uniformly distributed vertically on each of
   two product-quality attributes. Additionally, competition at the retail
   level may amplify these findings.

   more likely to facilitate fit revelation in the competitive market than
   it would as a market monopolist, whereas a firm offering a low-quality
   product is less likely to do so. In addition, the firm offering the
   high-quality product implements fit-revealing activities in a greater
   intensity than its rival that offers the low-quality product, if the

   goal congruence and sequential adverse selection frameworks, we show
   that the optimal capital budgeting mechanism entails a capital charge
   rate above the firm's cost of capital in the first stage but below the
   cost of capital in the second stage. Further, the first-stage asset
   cost-sharing rule depends only on the relative divisional growth
   profiles, and equal cost sharing can be optimal even when the divisions
   receive significantly different benefits from the shared investment
   project. In the presence of an adverse selection problem, all agency
   costs are incorporated into the second-stage budgeting mechanism,
   leaving the first-stage capital charge rate and asset-sharing rule
   unaffected even though the agency problem induces capital rationing at
   both stages.

   of the agent who truthfully reports but is also contingent upon the
   continuation value of the agent who misreports, called the temptation
   value. The good agent is retired when the temptation value of the bad
   agent becomes large, because then it is expensive to motivate the good
   agent. The bad agent is retired when the temptation value of the good
   agent becomes small, because then the future payment does not provide
   sufficient incentives. We also compare the efficiency of the shutdown

   can bring more profit to the principal only when the agent's reservation

   decisions in two seminal probability and reasoning tasks, the Monty Hall
   problem and the Wason selection task. Both tasks are hard and involve a
   general rule, thus allowing for knowledge transfers, and can be embedded
   in the context of markets that offer identical incentives to teams and
   individuals. Our results show that teams, trade closer to the rational
   level, learn the solution faster, and achieve this with weaker, less
   specific performance feedback than individuals. Most importantly, we
   observe significant knowledge transfers from team, decision making to
   subsequent individual performances that take place up to five weeks
   later, indicating that exposure to team decision making has strong
   positive spillovers on the quality of individual decisions.

   abnormal returns that do not persist into the reporting period.
   Termination of self-reporting, is followed by both return deterioration
   and outflows from the funds. The propensity to self-report is consistent
   with the trade-offs between the benefits (e.g., access to prospective
   investois) and costs (e.g., partial loss of trading secrecy and
   flexibility in selective marketing). Finally, returns of self-reporting
   funds are higher than that of nonreporting funds using
   characteristic-based benchmarks. However, the difference is not

AB In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to analyze the pricing
   strategies of competing retailers with asymmetric cross-selling
   capabilities when product demand changes. Our results suggest that
   retailers with better opportunities for cross-selling have higher
   incentives to adopt loss-leader pricing on high-demand products than
   retailers with low cross-selling capabilities. As a result, price
   dispersion of a product across retailers rises when its demand
   increases. The predictions of our model are consistent with the
   empirical evidence from the online book retailing industry. Using
   product breadth as a proxy for cross-selling capability, we find that
   retailers with high cross-selling capabilities reduce prices on best
   sellers more aggressively than retailers with low cross-selling
   capabilities. As a result, price dispersion increases when a book makes
   it to the best-seller list, and the increase is mainly driven by the
   difference in pricing behavior between retailers with different
   cross-selling capabilities. Our empirical results are robust against a
   number of alternative explanations.

AB Systemic risk refers to the risk of collapse of an entire complex system
   as a result of the actions taken by the individual component entities or
   agents that comprise the system. Systemic risk is an issue of great
   concern in modern financial markets as well as, more broadly, in the
   management of complex business and engineering systems. We propose an
   axiomatic framework for the measurement and management of systemic risk
   based on the simultaneous analysis of outcomes across agents in the
   system and over scenarios of nature. Our framework defines a broad class
   of systemic risk measures that accomodate a rich set of regulatory
   preferences. This general class of systemic risk measures captures many
   specific measures of systemic risk that have recently been proposed as
   special cases and highlights their implicit assumptions. Moreover, the
   systemic risk measures that satisfy our conditions yield decentralized
   decompositions; i.e., the systemic risk can be decomposed into risk due
   to individual agents. Furthermore, one can associate a shadow price for
   systemic risk to each agent that correctly accounts for the
   externalities of the agent's individual decision making on the entire
   system.

AB We study a buyer's sourcing strategy along two dimensions: the supply
   base design and the pricing mechanism, considering supplier competition
   and cost-reduction effort. The supply base design concerns the number of
   suppliers (one or two) included in the supply base and the capacity to
   be invested in each supplier. The pricing mechanism determines the
   timing of the price decisions, with the buyer making price commitments
   before suppliers exert cost-reduction efforts that may be renegotiated
   afterward. We find that symmetric capacity investment in suppliers and
   low price commitments (more likely to be renegotiated) are effective at
   fostering supplier competition, whereas asymmetric investment and high
   price commitments (less likely to be renegotiated) are better at
   motivating supplier effort. A complementary relationship exists between
   the supply base design and pricing mechanism: A more symmetric supply
   base should be combined with lower price commitments, leading to more
   renegotiation opportunities. This results in three possible sourcing
   structures: sole sourcing (investing capacity in a single supplier and
   forming price with ex ante commitments), symmetric dual sourcing
   (investing equal capacity in both suppliers and forming price with ex
   post negotiations), and asymmetric dual sourcing (investing positive but
   unequal capacities in two (ex ante identical) suppliers and forming
   price using both ex ante commitments and ex post (re)negotiations). We
   characterize the conditions for each structure and identify a strategic
   role of capacity investment..

AB We consider a repeated newsvendor problem in which the decision maker
   (DM) does not have access to the underlying demand distribution. The
   goal of this paper is to characterize the implications of demand
   censoring on performance. To that end, we compare the benchmark setting
   in which the DM has access to demand observations to a setting in which
   the DM may only rely on sales data. We measure performance in terms of
   regret: the difference between the cumulative costs of a policy and the
   optimal cumulative costs with knowledge of the demand distribution.
   Through upper and lower bounds, we characterize the optimal magnitude of
   the worst-case regret for the two settings, enabling one to isolate the
   implications of demand censoring. In particular, the results imply that
   the exploration-exploitation trade-off introduced by demand censoring is
   fundamentally different in the continuous and discrete demand cases, and
   that active exploration plays a much stronger role in the latter case.
   We further establish that in the discrete demand case, the need for
   active exploration almost disappears as soon as a lost sales indicator
   (that records whether demand was censored or not) becomes available, in
   addition to the censored demand samples.

   efficiency. However, social communication crowds out information
   production due to traders' incentives to "free ride" on informed friends
   and on a more informative price system. Overall, social communication
   hurts market efficiency when information is endogenous. The network
   effects on the cost of capital, liquidity, trading volume, and welfare
   are also sensitive to whether information is endogenous. Our analysis
   highlights the importance of information acquisition in examining the

AB The design of a matching market may affect behavior in prematch stages.
   In some settings, forward-looking agents might purchase low-priced
   properties with the intention of trading up. From a design standpoint,
   such behavior is undesirable. We investigate a tiered structure as a
   potential solution. Using a model that endogenizes prematch acquisition
   decisions, we show that tiers promote exchange while protecting the
   primary market. In the laboratory, we find that both firm revenue and
   total social surplus are improved by tiered matching, and the amount of
   improvement depends on the exchange mechanism the firm uses. We focus on
   two popular mechanisms deposit first and request first. We find that
   subjects are less likely to take advantage of the match under tier-free
   deposit first mechanism, possibly because of risk aversion. Thus, a
   tiered approach is more critical under the request first mechanism. We
   confirm that risk aversion partly explains deviations from theory.

   strategies? In a controlled laboratory setting, we provide evidence that
   the combination of tolerance for early failure and reward for long-term
   success is effective in motivating innovation. Subjects under such an
   incentive scheme explore more and are more likely to discover a novel
   business strategy than subjects under fixed-wage and standard

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) have been proposed as a key technology to help
   cut down the massive greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation
   sector. Unfortunately, because of the limited capacity of batteries,
   typical EVs can only travel for about 100 miles on a single charge and
   require hours to be recharged. The industry has proposed a novel
   solution centered around the use of "swapping stations," at which
   depleted batteries can be exchanged for recharged ones in the middle of
   long trips. The possible success of this solution hinges on the ability
   of the charging service provider to deploy a cost-effective
   infrastructure network, given only limited information regarding
   adoption rates. We develop robust optimization models that aid the
   planning process for deploying battery-swapping infrastructure. Using
   these models, we study the potential impacts of battery standardization
   and technology advancements on the optimal infrastructure deployment
   strategy.

AB Analysts deviate from management guidance to correct for perceived

   they improve forecast informativeness, bringing the forecasts closer to
   the unmanaged earnings and reducing accruals mispricing. An implicit
   assumption in the literature is that more accurate analyst forecasts
   (i.e., estimates that are closer to the reported earnings) are better
   for investors, and that analysts' objective is to forecast the reported
   (managed) earnings accurately. Our analysis suggests that this is not
   necessarily the case and that an inaccurate forecast can actually be
   more informative than an accurate one. Prior studies on analysts'
   deviations from management guidance focus on analysts' incentives to
   issue estimates that managers can beat. These studies implicitly assume
   that analysts side with, management against the interests of their

AB Advertising competes for scarce consumer attention, so more profitable
   advertisers send more messages to break through the others' clutter.
   Multiple equilibria can arise: more messages in aggregate induce more
   "shouting to be heard," dissipating profit. Equilibria can involve a
   small range of loud shouters or large range of quiet whisperers. All
   advertisers prefer there to be less shouting. There is the largest
   diversity in message levels for a middling width of advertiser types:
   both very wide and very narrow widths have only one message per
   advertiser. The number of advertisers at each message level decreases
   with the level if the profit distribution is log-convex. Increasing the
   cost of sending messages can make all advertisers better off. A new
   technique is given for describing multiple equilibria, by determining
   how much examination is consistent with a given marginal advertiser.

   two buyers pool their demands and purchase from the supplier as a single
   entity, will they necessarily earn higher profits than purchasing
   separately? We show that when a powerful supplier extracts profits from
   the buyers through optimal contract design, the demand variability
   reduction achieved by pooling can harm the buyers because it makes
   extracting profits easier for the supplier. We characterize cases when
   pooling is disadvantageous and also provide insights into when it is
   still advantageous. Our result is in contrast to the case where the
   price of the component is exogenous (typically assumed in most of the

   have the same mean. The average quantile forecast is always sharper: it
   has lower variance than the average probability forecast. Even when the
   average probability forecast is overconfident, the shape of the average
   quantile forecast still offers the possibility of a better forecast.
   Using probability forecasts for gross domestic product growth and
   inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, we present
   evidence that both when the average probability forecast is
   overconfident and when it is underconfident, it is outperformed by the
   average quantile forecast. Our results show that averaging quantiles is

   the allocation of influenza vaccines that is due to interdependent risk
   of infection across borders and proposes a contractual mechanism to
   reduce such inefficiencies. The proposed contract is based on an
   epidemic model that accounts for intranational transmission and that
   from a source country where the dominant strain emerges. The contract
   reduces the overall financial burden of infection globally and improves
   the total number infected by seasonal influenza outbreaks. This is
   consistent with recent recommendations to improve pandemic preparedness.
   Numerical experiments demonstrate that the benefits of the contract can
   prevent millions of influenza cases and save tens of millions of
   dollars, and that the benefits are even greater when cross-border
   transmission is higher, even if cross-border transmission parameters
   have moderate estimation errors.

AB In this paper, we examine trade promotion decisions in
   manufacturer-retailer channels where retailers face consumer demand
   uncertainty. We first present the theoretical analysis for two types of
   markets where trade promotion discounts are offered either as
   off-invoices or as scan-backs. We derive propositions by comparing
   wholesale and retail prices, retailer order quantities, and profits
   given the same trade promotion discount. Next, we extend the basic model
   so that the amount of trade promotion discount influences market
   expansion and solve for the optimal discount level. To test our theory,
   we then employ market experiments where we manipulate demand uncertainty
   and market expansion. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we
   find that wholesale and retail prices are higher and retailer order
   quantities lower when the same amount of trade promotion discount is
   allocated to scan-backs versus off-invoices. In the market expansion

AB We conduct an empirical study to analyze how waiting in queue in the
   context of a retail store affects customers' purchasing behavior. Our
   methodology combines a novel data set with periodic information about
   the queuing system (collected via video recognition technology) with
   point-of-sales data. We find that waiting in queue has a nonlinear
   impact on purchase incidence and that customers appear to focus mostly
   on the length of the queue, without adjusting enough for the speed at
   which the line moves. An implication of this finding is that pooling
   multiple queues into a single queue may increase the length of the queue
   observed by customers and thereby lead to lower revenues. We also find
   that customers' sensitivity to waiting is heterogeneous and negatively
   correlated with price sensitivity, which has important implications for
   pricing in a multiproduct category subject to congestion effects.

AB We study the drivers of the emergence of opinion leaders in a networked
   community where users establish links to others, indicating their
   "trust" for the link receiver's opinion. This leads to the formation of
   a network, with high in-degree individuals being the opinion leaders. We
   use a dyad-level proportional hazard model with time-varying covariates
   to model the growth of this network. To estimate our model, we use
   Weighted Exogenous Sampling with Bayesian Inference, a methodology that
   we develop for fast estimation of dyadic models on large network data
   sets. We find that, in the Epinions network, both the widely studied
   "preferential attachment" effect based on the existing number of inlinks
   (i.e., a network-based property of a node) and the number and quality of
   reviews written (i.e., an intrinsic property of a node) are significant
   drivers of new incoming trust links to a reviewer (i.e., inlinks to a
   node). Interestingly, we find that time is an important moderator of
   these effects-intrinsic node characteristics are a stronger short-term
   driver of additional inlinks, whereas the preferential attachment effect
   has a smaller impact but it persists for a longer time. Our novel
   insights have important managerial implications for the design of online
   review communities.

AB One of the main assumptions in research on designing supply contracts is
   that decision makers act in a way that maximizes their expected profit.
   A number of laboratory experiments demonstrate that this assumption does
   not hold. Specifically, faced with uncertain demand, decision makers
   place orders that systematically deviate from the expected profit
   maximizing levels. We have added to this body of knowledge by
   demonstrating that ordering decisions also systematically depend on
   individual contract parameters and by developing a behavioral model that
   captures this systematic behavior. We proceed to test our behavioral
   model using laboratory experiments and use the data to derive empirical
   model parameters. We then test our approach in out-of-sample validation
   experiments that confirm that, indeed, contracts designed using the
   behavioral model perform better than contracts designed using the

   competition can lead organizations to provide services that customers
   demand but that violate government regulations, especially when price
   competition is restricted. Using 28 million vehicle emissions tests from
   more than 11,000 facilities, we show that increased competition is
   associated with greater inspection leniency, a service quality attribute
   that customers value but is illegal and socially costly. Firms with more
   competitors pass customer vehicles at higher rates and are more likely
   to lose customers whom they fail, suggesting that competition
   intensifies pressure on facilities to provide illegal leniency. We also
   show that, at least in markets in which pricing is restricted, firms use
   corrupt and unethical practices as an entry strategy.

   to financial distress and bankruptcy, controlling for the endogeneity of
   financial distress and bankruptcy. We find that an airline's quality
   decisions are differentially affected by financial distress and
   bankruptcy. Product quality decreases when airlines are in financial
   distress, consistent with financial distress reducing a firm's incentive
   to invest in quality. In contrast, in bankruptcy product quality
   increases relative to financial distress. In addition, we find that

AB In this paper, we postulate a general class of price competition models
   with mixed multinomial logit demand functions under affine cost
   functions. In these models, the market is partitioned into a finite set
   of market segments. We characterize the equilibrium behavior of this
   class of models in the case where each product in the market is sold by
   a separate, independent firm. We identify a simple and very broadly
   satisfied condition under which a pure Nash equilibrium exists and the
   set of Nash equilibria coincides with the solutions of the system of
   first-order-condition equations, a property of essential importance to
   empirical studies. This condition specifies that in every market
   segment, each firm captures less than 50% of the potential customer
   population when pricing at a specific level that, under the condition,
   is an upper bound for a rational price choice for the firm irrespective
   of the competitors' prices. We show that under a somewhat stronger, but
   still broadly satisfied, version of the above condition, a unique
   equilibrium exists. We complete the picture by establishing the
   existence of a Nash equilibrium, indeed a unique Nash equilibrium, for
   markets with an arbitrary degree of concentration, under sufficiently
   tight price bounds. We discuss how our results extend to a continuum of
   customer types. A discussion of the multiproduct case is included. The
   paper concludes with a discussion of implications for structural
   estimation methods.

AB In the United States, end-stage liver disease patients join a waiting
   list and then make accept/reject decisions for transplantation as
   deceased-donor organs are offered to them over time. These decisions are
   largely influenced by the patient's prospect for future offers, which
   can be ascertained most accurately by knowing the entire composition of
   the waiting list. Under the current transplantation system, however, the
   United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), in an effort to strike a
   balance between privacy and transparency, only publishes an aggregated
   version of the waiting list. However, it is not clear whether the
   published information is good enough (compared with perfect information)
   to help patients make optimal decisions that maximize their individual
   life expectancies. We provide a novel model of this accept/reject
   problem from an individual patient's perspective using a partially
   observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which incorporates
   the imperfect waiting list information as published currently into the
   patient's decision making. We analyze structural properties of this
   model. In particular, we establish conditions that guarantee a monotone
   value function and a threshold-type optimal policy with respect to the
   partially observable rank state that captures the imperfect waiting list
   information. Furthermore, we develop an improved solution methodology to
   solve a generic POMDP model. This solution method guarantees, for any
   fixed grid, the best possible approximation to the optimal value
   function by solving linear programs to compute the optimal weights used
   for the approximation. Finally, we compare, in a clinically driven
   numerical study, the results of this model with those of an existing
   Markov decision process model that differs from our model in assuming
   the availability of perfect waiting list information. This comparison
   allows us to assess the quality of the published imperfect information
   as measured by a patient's so-called price of privacy (i.e., the
   opportunity loss in expected life days due to a lack of perfect waiting
   list information). Previous work estimates a significant loss in a
   patient's life expectancy, on average, when the patient has no waiting
   list information compared with full information. In this paper, we find
   that the currently published partial information is nearly sufficient to
   eliminate this loss, resulting in a negligible price of privacy and
   supporting current UNOS practice.

AB Even though buy-and-hold (B&H) investment strategies can take the risk
   tolerance of an investor into account by specifying a suitable stock
   proportion, the outcome profiles of B&H strategies are restricted to a
   specific class of return distributions. For investors with particular
   risk preferences, further customization should thus provide additional
   value. The objective of this paper is to investigate the strength of
   preference for such customized distributions and to draw conclusions
   about the demand for personalized investment products. In two
   experimental studies, 256 participants could adjust the return
   distribution of an initially chosen B&H investment by using an
   interactive software program. Our main finding is that most investors
   make extensive use of the customization option and many are willing to
   pay a substantial fee for this additional flexibility. We further find
   that the willingness to pay for customization is lower if the fee is
   integrated into the display of the return distribution, making its
   impact on final returns more obvious. We also observe that investors can
   be clustered into distinct subgroups via their adjustment patterns, but
   individually elicited prospect theory parameters are barely able to
   explain and predict these adjustments. As a robustness check, we also
   survey real investors at an investors fair to compare their preferences
   with those of our main pool of student subjects. We find that the
   willingness to pay for customization is slightly lower for these real
   investors and the main effect of fee integration is also less
   pronounced. In summary, we observe a strong willingness to pay for
   additional flexibility even though the actual benefits of customization
   vary markedly according to the individual. In many cases the accepted
   fees are so high that standard B&H strategies stochastically dominate
   the customized distributions after fee integration.

AB We consider a theoretical setting in which firms carry multiple products
   and consumers incur evaluation costs not only across firms but also
   within firms. Consumers judiciously decide the number of firms to
   include in their consideration sets as well as how many products from
   those firms. This decision depends on the relative trade-offs of
   evaluating an additional product and whether it is from a firm already
   included in the consideration set or from an entirely new firm. The
   composition of consumers' consideration set affects how firms compete in
   prices and in the number of products to offer. Contrary to previous
   literature, we find that firm differentiation can reduce firms' product
   lines and within-firm evaluation costs have either a positive or a
   negative effect on firms' prices. Interestingly, we show that
   within-firm evaluation costs and across-firm evaluation costs are
   different constructs. The number of products firms offer in equilibrium
   can exceed the socially optimal level if within-firm evaluation costs
   are significant.

   quasi-hyperbolic discounting model of that behavioral tendency (for a
   queueing system in which service time is short relative to the time
   horizon for its benefits). Planning in advance, people may naively
   overestimate their self-control. This paper shows how customers' lack of
   self-control and naivete affect optimal pricing and scheduling. The
   welfare-maximizing usage fee and the revenue-maximizing usage fee
   decrease with customers' lack of self-control. Charging for
   subscription, in addition to or instead of per use, increases revenue,
   especially when subscribers are naive. If the manager can charge for
   subscription or per use, subscription is optimal for revenue
   maximization, whereas usage-based pricing is optimal for welfare
   maximization. If customers are heterogeneous in their self-control and
   naivete, priority scheduling can dramatically increase welfare and
   revenue.

AB Subjective probabilistic judgments in forecasting are inevitable in many
   real-life domains. A common way to obtain such judgments is to assess
   fractiles or confidence intervals. However, these judgments tend to be
   systematically overconfident. Further, it has proved particularly
   difficult to debias such forecasts and improve the calibration. This
   paper proposes a simple process that systematically leads to wider
   confidence intervals, thus reducing overconfidence. With a series of
   experiments, including with professionals, we show that unpacking the
   distal future into intermediate more proximal futures systematically
   improves calibration. We refer to this phenomenon as the time unpacking
   effect, find it is robust to different elicitation formats, and address
   the possible reasons behind it. We further show that this results in
   better overall forecasting performance when improved calibration is
   traded off against less sharpness, and that substantive benefits can be
   obtained even from just one level of time unpacking.

   has investigated individual- and market-level determinants of

   escalate difficult assignments. I model firms' choice of sales process
   as a biform game and test predictions of the model using a combination

   distance. We disentangle these multiple effects by using a regression
   framework employing choice-based sampling to estimate the likelihood of
   citation between random patents. We find both country and state borders
   to have independent effects on knowledge diffusion beyond what just
   geographic proximity in the form of metropolitan collocation or shorter
   within-region distances can explain. An identification methodology
   comparing inventor-added and examiner-added citation patterns points to
   an even stronger role of political borders. The puzzling state border
   effect remains robust on average across analyses, though it is found to
   have waned with time. The country effect has, in contrast, not only
   remained robust but even strengthened over time.

AB We show that under some conditions, quantity discounts and two-part
   tariffs are equivalent as mechanisms for channel coordination when an
   upstream firm sells its product in a downstream market that is
   characterized by a dominant retailer and a competitive fringe. We
   consider a setting in which discriminatory offers are feasible and a
   setting in which the same menu of options must be offered to all
   retailers. We find that the upstream firm's profit in both settings is
   independent of whether quantity discounts or two-part tariffs are used.
   The implication of this finding is that the firm's choice of contract
   design may turn on which one is easier to implement.

AB We find that firms with insider sales executed under Rule 10b5-1 plans
   exhibit a higher likelihood of meeting or beating analysts' earnings
   expectations (MBE). This relation between MBE and plan sales is more
   pronounced for the plan sales of chief executive officers (CEOs) and
   chief financial officers (CEOs) and is nonexistent for other key
   insiders. The market reactions to firms that successfully meet or beat
   expectations are relatively positive compared with their peers that fail
   to do so. One interpretation of our results is that CEOs and CFOs who
   sell under these plans may be more likely to engage in strategic
   behavior to meet or beat expectations in an effort to maximize their
   proceeds from plan sales. However, readers should exercise caution in
   making inferences, because the potential presence of limit order
   transactions makes it difficult to unambiguously determine the direction
   of causality of the relation we document.

AB We study customers' adoption and subsequent switching decisions with
   regard to a menu of three-part tariff plans offered by a commercial
   bank. Using a rich panel data set covering 70,510 fee-based checking
   accounts over 30 months, before and after the introduction of the plans,
   we find that most customers adopt non-cost-minimizing plans, preferring
   plans with large monthly allowances and high fixed payments.
   Furthermore, after adoption, customers who exceed their allowances and
   consequently pay overage fees are more likely to switch to plans with
   larger allowances than customers who do not experience such fees.
   Notably, after switching, these overage-paying customers pay higher
   monthly payments than before. In contrast, switching customers who did
   not pay overage payments before switching pay less after switching. Our
   findings, unlike those of previous research on experience-based
   learning, suggest that the behavior of experienced customers does not
   converge to the predictions of neoclassical models. We propose that
   "overage aversion,"which is closely related to loss aversion and mental
   accounting, is the most plausible explanation for our findings.

   that prices assets. We theoretically incorporate dividend volatility
   clustering into a model in which narrow-framing investors are loss
   averse over fluctuations in the value of their investments. Our model
   shows that dividend volatility positively predicts future asset returns,
   with the predictive power increasing with the forecasting horizon; our
   model also sheds light on a variety of other asset-pricing phenomena. We
   further provide supporting empirical evidence that dividend volatility
   is indeed priced in the data. More specifically, aggregate dividend
   volatility predicts and is predicted by aggregate price-to-dividend
   ratios; aggregate dividend volatility predicts future aggregate market
   returns; and dividend volatility of portfolios sorted by size,
   book-to-market ratios, and past returns predicts future portfolio-level
   returns, respectively.

AB We consider an assembly system with a single end product and a general
   assembly structure, where one or more of the component suppliers or
   (sub)assembly production processes is subject to random supply
   disruptions. We present a method for reducing the system to an
   equivalent system with some subsystems replaced by a series structure.
   This reduction simplifies the computation of optimal ordering policies
   and can also allow for comparison of disruption impacts across systems
   with different supply chain structures. We identify conditions under
   which a state-dependent echelon base-stock policy is optimal. Based on
   this result, we propose a heuristic policy for solving the assembly
   system with disruptions and test its performance in numerical trials.
   Using additional numerical trials, we explore a variety of strategic
   questions. For example, contrary to what is typically observed in
   systems without disruptions, we find that choosing a supplier with a
   longer lead time can sometimes yield lower system costs. We also find
   that backup supply is more valuable for a supplier with a shorter lead
   time than one with a longer lead time. In addition, because of component
   complementarities, we find that choosing suppliers whose disruptions are
   perfectly correlated yields lower system costs than choosing suppliers
   whose disruptions are independent, in contrast to the strategy that is
   typically preferred when choosing backup suppliers for a single product.

AB This paper studies an upstream supplier who quotes prices for a key
   component to multiple sellers that compete for an end-buyer's
   indivisible contract. At most one of the supplier's quotes may result in
   downstream contracting and hence produce revenue for her. We
   characterize the supplier's optimal price-quoting strategies and show
   that she will use one of two possible types of strategies, with her
   choice depending on the sellers' profit potentials relative to their
   uncertainties: secure, whereby she will always have business; or risky,
   whereby she may not have business. Addressing potential fairness
   concerns, we also study price-quoting strategies in which all sellers
   receive equal quotes. Finally, we show that the supplier's optimal
   mechanism resembles auctioning a single quote among the sellers. This
   paper can assist upstream suppliers in their pricing decisions and
   provides general insights into multitier supply chains' pricing
   dynamics.

AB We analyze a new auction format in which bidders pay a fee each time
   they increase the auction price. Bidding fees are the primary source of
   revenue for the seller but produce the same expected revenue as standard
   auctions (assuming risk-neutral bidders). If risk-loving preferences are
   incorporated in the model, expected revenue increases. Our model
   predicts a particular distribution of ending prices, which we test
   against observed auction data. The degree of fit depends on how
   unobserved parameters are chosen; in particular, a slight preference for
   risk has the biggest impact in explaining auction behavior, suggesting
   that pay-to-bid auctions are a mild form of gambling.

AB We examine how different characteristics of product demand and market
   impact the relative sales volume in the forward and spot markets for a
   commodity whose aggregate demand is uncertain. In a setting where either
   the forward contracts are binding quantity commitments between buyers
   and suppliers or the forward production takes place before the
   uncertainty in demand is resolved, we find that a combination of factors
   that include market concentration, demand risk, and price elasticity of
   demand will determine whether a commodity will be sold mainly through
   forward contracts or in the spot market. Previous findings in the
   literature show that when participants are risk neutral, the ratio of
   forward sales to spot sales is a function of market concentration alone;
   also, the lower the concentration, the higher this ratio. These findings
   hold under the assumption that demand is either deterministic or, if
   demand is uncertain, all production takes place after uncertainty is
   fully resolved and production plans can be altered instantaneously and
   costlessly. In our setting, however, we find that even a low level of
   demand risk can reverse the nature of supply in a highly competitive
   (low concentration) market, by shifting it from predominantly
   forward-driven to predominantly spot-driven supply. In markets with high
   concentration, the price elasticity of demand will determine whether the
   supply will be predominantly spot-driven or forward-driven. Our analysis
   suggests various new hypotheses on the structure of supply in commodity
   markets.

AB The nature of utility is controversial. Whereas decision theory commonly
   assumes that utility is context specific, applied and empirical decision
   analysis typically assumes one unifying concept of utility applicable to
   all decision problems. This controversy has hardly been addressed
   empirically because of the absence of methods to measure utility outside
   the context of risk. We introduce a method to measure utility over time
   and compare utility under risk and utility over time. We distinguish
   between gains and losses and also measure loss aversion. In two
   experiments we found that utility under risk and utility over time
   differed and were uncorrelated. Utility under risk was more curved than
   utility over time. Subjects were loss averse both for risk and for time,
   but loss aversion was more pronounced for risk. Loss aversion over risk
   and time were uncorrelated. This suggests that loss aversion, although
   important in both decision contexts, is volatile and subject to framing.

AB This paper develops analytical results and insights for the mixed
   bundling problem of pricing a product line consisting of two component
   goods (with valuations distributed uniformly and independently in [0,
   a(1)] and [0, a(2)], respectively, with a(1) < a(2)) and a bundle of the
   two goods. This setting has previously been considered analytically
   intractable. By deriving component good prices as exact algebraic
   functions of the optimal bundle price, I reduce the multiproduct pricing
   problem to a univariate nonlinear optimization problem in the bundle
   price. When the two component goods are sufficiently asymmetric in
   valuations, the optimal solution is partial mixed bundling (one
   component good is not sold separately), for which I derive exact
   conditions and optimal prices. An exact analytical solution is also
   given for mixed bundling of two information goods (component goods with
   zero marginal costs). For the general case, I derive a closed-form
   approximation of the optimal bundle price: P-B = 0.5724w(1) + 0.5695w(2)
   + 0.3516a(1) + 0.4889a(2) + 0.0054(a(2)/a(1))w(1)-0.0201(a(2)/a(1))w(2).
   The approximation is highly 'accurate (the resulting profit is within a
   percent of the exact optimal profit), efficient (instant solutions for
   specific problem instances), and useful in other applications where
   mixed bundling is a subproblem. I demonstrate this by applying the
   solution to the mixed bundle problem in a vertical channel where a
   retailer must bundle and price component goods from multiple independent
   manufacturers.

   delegation is the most effective structure when there is diversity of
   expertise, when accurate delegation is possible, and when there is a
   good fit between the firm's knowledge and the knowledge required by the
   environment. Otherwise, depending on the knowledge breadth of the firm,
   voting or averaging may be the most effective structure. Finally, we use

AB Many scholars argue that when incentivized by ad revenue, content
   providers are more likely to tailor their content to attract "eyeballs,"
   and as a result, popular content may be excessively supplied. We
   empirically test this prediction by taking advantage of the launch of an
   ad-revenue-sharing program initiated by a major Chinese portal site in
   September 2007. Participating bloggers allow the site to run ads on
   their blogs and receive 50% of the revenue generated by these ads. After
   analyzing 4.4 million blog posts, we find that, relative to
   nonparticipants, popular content increases by about 13 percentage points
   on participants' blogs after the program takes effect. About 50% of this
   increase can be attributed to topics shifting toward three domains: the
   stock market, salacious content, and celebrities. Meanwhile, relative to
   nonparticipants, participants' content quality increases after the
   program takes effect. We also find that the program effects are more
   pronounced for participants with moderately popular blogs, and seem to
   persist after participants enroll in the program.
