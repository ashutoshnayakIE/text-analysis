   measure it. In Study 1, the concept of the material self and the new
   scale are compared and contrasted with existing measures where tests of
   reliability, construct validity, concurrent validity, and
   generalizability are examined on 1750 respondents from 5 countries (USA,
   Canada, China, Ghana, and Israel). The four dimensions of the material
   self consist of material self-projection, materialistic evaluation of
   others, emotional self-assurance, and self-deservingness. Study 2 uses a
   multitrait, multimethod matrix design to investigate convergent and
   discriminant validity on a new sample of 301 adult consumers in the US.
   Finally in Study 3 we establish validity for two samples in England (n =
   202), where nomological validity and managerial implications are tested.

AB The increasing visibility of homosexuality in society, combined with the
   lesbian and gay community's considerable buying power, has triggered
   marketers and researchers' interest in understanding homosexual
   consumers' consumption patterns. Prior research on whether homosexual
   consumers behave differently from heterosexual consumers has yielded
   mixed results, and researchers and practitioners still do not know
   whether any substantial differences exist, what these differences look
   like, and how they can be explained. The findings from a meta-analysis
   reveal that sexual orientation explains on average <1% of the variation
   in consumption behavior across 45 papers, indicating only slightly
   different consumption behaviors. Findings from a moderator analysis
   contradict conventional wisdom and lay theories, while partly supporting
   assumptions that are rooted in evolutionary and biological theories that
   show consumption differences decrease with age; they increase when
   comparing homosexuals and heterosexuals of the same gender. These
   findings, which question long-held beliefs about homosexual consumers,
   help marketers to successfully adjust their strategies. (C) 2020 The

AB While marketers often design their offers to visually appeal to either
   female or male audiences, the traditional view on gender is changing.
   This research explores (1) the influence of gender on the perception and
   attractiveness evaluation of marketing visuals varying in harmony
   including (2) the underlying mechanisms through which gender differences
   occur, and (3) the differential roles of biological sex and gender
   identity. Drawing from the selectivity hypothesis and self-congruity
   theory, we argue that consumers process visual harmony along three
   distinct stages: (a) an early stage where their biological sex plays a
   role, (b) an intermediate stage where the consumer appraises cognitive
   effort, and (c) a late stage where consumers evaluate the congruity
   between the design and their self, including their gender identity. Four
   studies test these propositions using mixed methods, a variety of
   marketing visuals, and different concepts of gender. We find that
   biological sex plays a moderating role in the early phase of visual
   harmony perception due to men's and women's differential processing
   abilities, whereas gender identity plays a significant role later in the
   more reflective phase of visual harmony evaluation. Managerial
   implications for gendered marketing and avenues for future research are
   delineated. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A dynamic and growing body of marketing literature draws from the
   Stereotype Content Model's (SCM) dimensions, warmth and competence, to
   describe individuals' perception of various market-related stimuli
   (e.g., salespeople, employees, products) and predict their influence on
   subsequent behavior. However, the operationalization of these
   fundamental dimensions in empirical marketing research has been
   inconsistent and problematic, hindering comparability of findings across
   studies and limiting the overall usefulness of warmth-competence in
   relevant research. Using a mixed-method approach, the present paper
   scrutinizes the warmth-competence dimensions in order to validate and
   optimize their measurement. Through seven studies using different
   methodologies and metrics, we identify a set of trait items that (a)
   capture perceptions of warmth and competence consistently across a
   variety of impression formation settings, and (b) display strong
   psychometric properties. Our findings offer a parsimonious approach that
   promotes the consistent operationalization of warmth and competence
   across marketing studies and enables the integration of empirical
   findings, both of which are crucial requirements for meta-analytic
   investigations, replication studies, and integrative reviews. (C) 2020

AB Brand anthropomorphism is recognised as an important construct in
   marketing, yet it lacks clarity in operationalisation and valid
   measurement. The objective of this research, therefore, is to develop
   and validate the brand anthropomorphism scale (BASC). Brand
   anthropomorphism is defined as the perception of brand as an entity that
   has analogical human-like features, mental and emotional states that
   people believe to be distinctively human. It is conceptualised as a
   multidimensional superordinate construct. Across six studies (N = 1666),
   this research develops a valid and reliable measure of brand
   anthropomorphism that has psychometric properties for convergent,
   discriminant and predictive validity. The results indicate that brand
   anthropomorphism is a valid predictor of outcomes such as brand trust
   and brand commitment. Finally, in support of incremental validity, it is
   identified that the BASC explains variance in brand trust and brand
   commitment above and beyond the measure of brand anthropomorphism
   commonly employed in the literature. Theoretical implications for
   research and implications for practice are also discussed. (C) 2020

   study peer effects in the dynamic brand revenue evolution of major
   college sports teams that play in the same National Collegiate Athletic
   Association conferences. To examine the peer effects in each conference,
   we propose a new dynamic model that can identify conference-specific
   peer effects while capturing the dynamic evolution of brand revenue. Our
   model estimation results reveal significant positive peer effects in the
   six conferences - ACC, Big 12, Big East, Big Ten, SEC, and Pac-12 -
   where the brand revenue of teams benefit from other teams in the same
   conference. Our modeling approach also sheds light on the effect of a
   conference switch on a team's brand revenue by showing the difference
   between predicted brand revenue with a switch and the predicted brand
   revenue without a switch. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB How do consumers react when brands take a stand on controversial
   socio-political issues? The results from a series of studies, involving
   both unknown and well-known brands, show that attitudes towards the
   brand decreased substantially among consumers who disagreed with a
   brand's stand, whereas there was no significant effect among consumers
   who were supportive of the brand's stand (Studies 1-4). This asymmetric
   effect of brand activism holds not only for brand attitude but also for
   consumers' behavioral intentions (Study 2) and actual choices (Study
   1B). When consumers perceived the relationship between the brand and the
   source of the stand to be more distant, the negative effect of brand
   activism was weaker because it allowed consumers to morally decouple the
   brand from the stand (Study 3). Only when a brand faced public backlash
   because of its moral stand did we find a marginal increase in brand
   attitude among the proponents of the stand. However, when the brand
   subsequently withdrew its stand and apologized, the attitude towards the
   brand decreased among both the proponents and opponents of the stand
   (Study 4). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the
   findings and call for further research on brand activism. (C) 2020

AB Popularity signs (e.g., "best seller", "top rated") are frequently
   employed by marketers to help consumers in their purchase decisions.
   Whereas extant research focused mostly on the positive aspects of such a
   strategy, we demonstrate that it can also have adverse effects on
   consumer post-choice behavior. Depending on consumer regulatory
   orientation, such popularity signs can make the decision task more
   complex and increase feelings of uncertainty. The results of seven
   studies, including real choice decisions and field data, show that the
   provision of popularity signs can have negative consequences on
   consumers with a prevention (vs. promotion) focus by increasing the
   heterogeneity of their consideration set, which in turn is associated
   with an increase in choice uncertainty and a decrease in choice
   commitment. Beyond their theoretical significance, our findings shed
   novel light on the ways to implement popularity signs for a more
   efficiently targeted marketing effort. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB This research investigates consumers' reactions to luxury versus
   mass-market fashion products that are produced in an unsustainable
   manner. In particular, this research empirically assesses whether and
   why third-party information revealing the unsustainable nature of luxury
   versus mass-market fashion products may increase consumers' intention to
   engage in negative word-of-mouth about the manufacturing company. The
   results of four experiments demonstrate that, when confronted with
   information revealing that a purchased luxury fashion product has been
   produced in an environmentally or socially unsustainable manner,
   consumers experience a higher sense of guilt over that product, compared
   to a purchased mass-market fashion product, due to their lower
   expectations about luxury fashion products' unsustainability. Guilt, in
   turn, drives consumers' intention to generate negative word-of-mouth
   about the producer and such an effect is more pronounced among consumers
   with a higher versus lower individualistic orientation. (C) 2020

AB Our research examines the likelihood of choosing a well-known brand or
   product (e.g., global brands, national chain stores) relative to a new
   one (e.g., niche brands, local stores). Six studies examine the
   asymmetric consequences of engaging in an analytic or holistic thinking
   style that mismatches the dominant thinking style associated with one's
   cultural background. Our studies show that engaging in a culturally
   mismatched (versus matched) thinking style enhances the subsequent
   appeal of familiar consumer options and the likelihood of choosing them
   when making consumer decisions. However, this effect is observed only
   for those with a dominant analytic thinking style, not for those with a
   dominant holistic thinking style. This asymmetry emerges because
   analytic thinking is characterized by a greater intolerance of
   incongruity such that a mismatched experience is likely to be less well
   tolerated by analytic than holistic thinkers. Our studies suggest that
   this asymmetric effect on the preferences for familiar options is driven
   by a motivation to reduce psychological discomfort associated with a
   mismatched experience. The findings highlight the importance of
   understanding the effects of matched/mismatched thinking experiences on
   audiences of different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. (C) 2020

   Consistent with our conceptualization, this effect is moderated by
   factors that influence perceptions of meaning and self-product
   connection. Specifically, the effect is attenuated when consumers
   encounter products that have strong inherent meaning (self-consistent
   product), and when they believe that meaning is not important or that
   life's random events do not need to make sense. This study is the first
   to reveal the hidden factors that lead people to associate products

   for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide
   an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare

   traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process
   large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures
   that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may
   lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient
   AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent
   academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More
   importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a
   multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical
   marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a
   number of research priorities, including extending machine learning
   methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using
   the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking,
   and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive,
   causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer
   purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and
   connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories.

AB A key member benefit for participating in a loyalty program (LP) is the
   rewards earned for points accrued. One popular reward structure is a
   catalog of many diverse items. The rewards among this broad selection
   are likely to differ in their appeal due to their intrinsic differences
   and customer heterogeneity. Prior research has shown that after
   redeeming a reward, LP members are more motivated to increase their
   purchase volume/frequency and share-of-wallet within the program,
   thereby becoming more active. In this study, we fit a hidden Markov
   model to a 4 1/2 year longitudinal data set of points accrual and reward
   redemption activity for about 4500 members of a large coalition LP. Our
   analysis reveals three latent states - active, hyperactive and inactive.
   We then investigate the likelihood of LP members transitioning between
   these states across successive time periods, and examine the reward
   categories and marketing effort associated with these transitions.
   Subsequently, we use our model to optimally promote particular reward
   categories to encourage LP member migration to managerially desirable
   states or prevent them sliding into a less desirable state. Our proposed
   optimal reward strategy potentially increases the estimated proportion

AB Excessive consumption of many vice goods (e.g., alcohol) has both
   possible immediate (e.g., a drunk-driving crash) and delayed (e.g.,
   liver disease) negative consequences. This research models the
   consumption choices of a consumer population with heterogeneous
   impatience and varying degrees of sophistication in conjunction with
   both immediate and delayed consequences of excessive vice good
   consumption. We show that even when a preventative device (e.g., a
   designated driver) that could eliminate the immediate dangers is
   available for (almost) free, some consumers forgo it in order to try to
   use the immediate danger as a soft tool to regulate excessive
   consumption (e.g., "If I know I don't have a designated driver, then I
   won't drink too much."). Surprisingly, this "flying without a net" is a
   successful strategy for some consumers, and we quantify when it is
   likely to be successful versus harmful. This counterintuitive result has
   many consequences; e.g., public policies that make the provision of
   preventative devices compulsory could increase consumer welfare under
   certain conditions but overall are not Pareto-improving. Likewise,
   advertising campaigns that exaggerate the likelihood of immediate
   dangers may be welfare decreasing despite their good intentions. In
   exploring the effect of our model on pricing of preventative device, we
   find that pricing is not monotonic in the probability of danger. We also
   show that consumer pessimism about self-regulation can induce consumers
   to experience a "boomerang effect" of overconsumption in the presence of
   a preventative device. Overall our research shows that the relationship
   between prevention and risk is not as simple as might be assumed in
   standard analyses and that marketers and public policymakers often need
   to consider the short-term and the long-term risks as well how prone the
   consumers are to temptation and how sophisticated they are in judging
   their temptation. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Economic studies of consumer behavior focus almost exclusively on people
   in developed countries with relatively large household budgets as
   compared to others in the world. The very poor, those surviving on less
   than $2.50 per day, make up half the world's population and are not
   represented in academic studies of brand preference and choice. Those
   characterized as extremely poor, living on less than $1.25 per day, are
   estimated to comprise 1.3 billion people, with nearly half living in
   India and China(1). In this paper we investigate demand for the very
   poor using economic models of choice that have been applied to studies
   of the American consumer in two product categories, toothpaste and
   laundry detergent. The data come from a unique panel of respondents in
   India where consumers purchase small and affordable single-use packages.
   Our analysis indicates that standard models of demand used to study
   wealthier consumers also apply to people in extreme poverty.

AB Scarcity cues are ubiquitous in our everyday lives and thus attract
   great attention in consumer research. However, little attention has been
   devoted to examining whether exposure to scarcity cues influences
   consumers' trade-off between feasibility and desirability in product
   choices. The present research argues that the impact of scarcity cues on
   consumers' preference for products that offer more feasible or more
   desirable features depends on consumers' childhood socioeconomic status
   (childhood SES). The findings consistently show that consumers with low
   childhood SES who were reminded of resource scarcity seek more
   feasibility in product choices than consumers in other conditions. We
   trace this effect to the fact that scarcity cues cause consumers with
   low childhood SES to process information at a low construal level. By
   presenting this conceptualization and evidence, the present study
   contributes to research on childhood SES, resource scarcity, and
   construal level theory (CLT). (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Adults view past experiences as making them happier than material goods,

   ages. Using a child developmental framework, we reconcile these two
   perspectives. Across four studies with children and adolescents of ages
   3-17 years, we show that children (ages 3-12) derive more happiness from
   goods than from experiences, but the effect changes over time. As
   children age, the happiness they derive from experiences increases, to
   the point that older adolescents derive more happiness from experiences
   than from material goods, consistent with adult findings. We show that
   these effects are mediated by increases in two cognitive skills: memory
   and theory of mind, which we posit are necessary for a sufficient
   comprehension of experiences and their implications, which in turn
   facilitates their enjoyment. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper builds on a fine-grained longitudinal dataset detailing 22
   years of contemporary visual art sales to corporate collectors. We focus
   on expert buyers who act as agents for the art collecting organizations
   who employ them. Our major findings show that third-party indicators of
   quality - reviews, awards, and gallery affiliations that have been
   received by visual artists over time - are positively related to sales.
   Moreover, this relationship persists far beyond the time when the
   signals were first conveyed. These results are interesting because
   compared to ordinary consumers, these expert buyers are assumed to make
   purchase decisions based on their professional knowledge of contemporary
   visual art that enables them to recognize quality that is only obvious
   to a trained "eye." However, we show that simple indicators of quality
   based on third-party signals strongly influence them. Our findings
   provide a much-needed understanding of the mechanisms guiding
   expert-agent buyers' purchase decisions, particularly in markets with
   high uncertainty about quality and high levels of innovation. We argue
   that third-party signals influence these expert-agent buyers because
   they prefer to make purchase decisions they can readily defend. (c) 2019

   of investigating the communication of the creative process, this
   research proposes that consumers hold associations between insight and

   differential evaluations of new products: consumers evaluate more
   favorably artistic and scientific products presented as the outcome of
   insight or effort, respectively. The strength of the proposed effects,
   however, depends on the level of consumer expertise in the relevant

AB The present work utilizes research on context effects and color
   psychology to investigate how background color can enhance the
   effectiveness of positive and negative charity appeals. Five experiments
   measuring both actual donations and donation intention examine the
   hypothesis that a negative charity appeal against an orange (vs. blue)
   background and a positive charity appeal against a blue (vs. orange)
   background will increase donations. We propose that this is because blue
   and orange colors are incongruous with positive and negative charity
   appeals, respectively, due to the affective valences of the appeals and
   the perceptions of warmth and coldness cued by the background colors.
   This incongruity enhances the attention people pay to the charity
   appeals, thereby strengthening their emotional response to the appeals,
   which increases charitable donations. When attention is manipulated,
   people who pay a high (vs. low) level of attention to the charity appeal
   are more likely to donate regardless of the color and valence of the
   appeal, suggesting attention is an important antecedent to the intensity
   of the emotional response and subsequent donation behavior. We also
   identify affect diagnosticity as a boundary condition for the effect -
   when people are informed that color affects their emotions, the
   contextual effect of color disappears. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Researchers and practitioners have long been aware of the capacity to
   use information on consumers' product adoptions and defections to
   forecast the adoption and defection behavior of others in their social
   networks. Yet, herein, we suggest that such information still holds
   substantial untapped predictive potential. Specifically, this paper is
   the first to define and investigate cross decision social effects, i.e.,
   the effects of customer defections on network neighbors' adoption
   decisions, and the effects of customer adoptions on network neighbors'
   defection decisions. We incorporate these effects into a conceptual
   framework that enables us to explore them concurrently with
   same-decision social effects (the effects of adoptions on adoptions and
   of defections on defections), which have been researched extensively. We
   develop a multi-event hazard model to describe this framework, and
   estimate it using two unique data sets on a communication network and on
   adoption and defection dates for a mobile add-on. We obtain strong
   empirical evidence for negative cross-decision social effects that are
   larger for strong ties than for weak ties. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

AB We present a theory of price and quality decisions by managers who are

   products, but not both. Accounting for this, managers exploit any
   uncertainty about the cause of market outcomes to credit positive
   results to the dominant, "strategic" factor and blame negative results
   on the other-as doing so is psychologically rewarding. The problem with
   biased attributions, however, is that they prompt biased decisions. We
   motivate this argument with evidence from one experiment and then
   develop a model to understand the cost of the bias under different
   market conditions. Counter to intuition, we find that firms in a
   competitive setting can profit from the self-serving nature of their

AB Consumers purchase conspicuous goods, such as luxury cars, to satisfy
   both social and functional needs. Heterogeneity in the emphases that
   consumers place on these two drivers of utility in conspicuous goods
   markets creates two broad groups: functionality-oriented and
   exclusivity-oriented consumer segments. A game-theoretic model reveals
   how this segmentation affects the equilibrium extent of value
   enhancements in functionality and exclusivity, prices and profits. We
   show that firms increase value enhancements in their product when
   functionality-oriented consumers perceive greater product
   differentiation. In contrast, firms reduce value enhancements in their
   product if exclusivity-oriented consumers perceive greater product
   differentiation. We also show that, in the presence of such
   heterogeneous consumers, lower perceived product differentiation is
   consistent with higher profitability. We also find conditions in which
   firm profits could decrease with a higher proportion of
   exclusivity-oriented consumers. The proposed model helps explain why
   conspicuous good manufacturers pursue lower within-category product
   differentiation (as validated empirically with an application to the
   automotive industry). These findings also provide prescriptions for
   firms' product value enhancement decisions-in equilibrium, increase in
   the size of the functionality-oriented consumer segment leads to reduced
   value enhancements in functionality and exclusivity. (C) 2019 Elsevier

AB Service brands are increasingly dominating the economy. However, there
   is limited knowledge about how to grow service brands, and whether
   growing service brands will require strategies different from the
   strategies that are based on goods brand research. To address this
   knowledge gap, this paper conceptualizes a "ServBrand triad" based on
   the service literature, and empirically demonstrates how its three
   drivers are related to service brand growth. Service brand growth is
   defined as positive changes in brand outcomes, such as the brand being
   liked more, used more, or more profitable or valuable to a firm. The
   empirical work utilizes 11 years of longitudinal brand and firm data
   that are analyzed by dynamic multivariate generalized method of moments
   (GMM) panel models. The findings confirm the importance of the three
   drivers of service brand growth: quality, personalization, and
   relationships. Service marketers are advised to emphasize
   relationship-based service personalization (as opposed to quality-based
   personalization), maintain consistent service quality "at" customer
   expectation, neither above nor below, throughout the relationship, and
   improve service quality gradually (or subtly) to avoid quality-cost
   tradeoff and quality inconsistency perceptions. These findings
   contribute to an improved understanding of the factors that drive
   service brand growth, and how those factors differ from the factors that
   drive goods brand growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lack of typical nonverbal cues in digitally mediated marketing
   communication (e.g., text messages, social media etc.) creates special
   challenges for marketers desiring to manage customer relationships. To
   overcome these limitations, marketers have turned to emojis to convey
   subtle meaning regarding the message sender (often a service provider)
   and to elicit positive emotion in the message recipient. Relying on
   theories of emotion as social information and emotional contagion, we
   present three studies that provide initial evidence of a positive
   conscious and unconscious affective response to smiley-face emojis that
   mediates relational outcomes when relationships are communal in nature,
   but not when relationships are based on simple exchange. We also make a
   methodological contribution by employing biometric measurement of
   smiling in order to capture unconscious affect and to demonstrate novel
   emotional contagion effects in a customer service message. We close with
   a discussion of the average emoji effect observed across reported and
   unreported studies, which is modest but reliable, as well as discussion
   of future research opportunities and managerial implications. (C) 2019

   sales. We use a novel dataset of Google search volume to measure the
   influence of the film. Organic food sales are measured using store-level
   data for three categories in 33 major US markets. For two out of the
   three studied categories yogurt and peanut butter - we find that areas
   with more Google searches for the film experienced a greater increase in
   the share of organic sales subsequent to the film's release. The effect
   of the film is more pronounced for the yogurt category, which is doser
   to the farm and more relevant to animal welfare - one of the key issues
   featured in the film. The effects are economically significant: ceteris
   paribus, a one standard deviation increase in our Google search stock
   measure translates into a 0.66% increase in organic market share for the
   yogurt and a 0.15% increase for the peanut butter category. In addition,
   we provide a measure of the decay of the film's effect by deriving the
   90% duration interval of the focal search stock variable. We find that,
   for both categories, the film's effect on organic shares faded within

AB Are potential contributors more likely to support a prosocial cause when
   presented with few contribution options or with many options? Across
   four studies-an analysis of archival contribution data from the
   crowdfunding site Kickstarter, a field experiment conducted in
   cooperation with a grocery store and a snack bar company, and two
   controlled laboratory experiments-we consistently find that when a
   fundraiser offers more options to potential contributors, the likelihood
   of contribution initially decreases and then increases. The result is a
   U-shaped relationship between the number of contribution options and
   contribution likelihood. We do not find such an effect for non-prosocial
   choices. With a fifth study, we offer a preliminary and tentative
   theoretical explanation for the U-shaped relationship, suggesting that
   the type of information processing by the decision maker (intuitive
   rather than deliberate) underlies this effect. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The facial expressions that endorsers convey in a print ad can influence
   consumers reactions to the product being advertised. This effect, which
   is mediated by perceptions of the endorsers social status, depends on
   whether the endorser is male or female. Consumers expect endorsers
   facial expressions to conform to normative expectations for how men and
   women present themselves to others and they attribute high social status
   to those whose expressions deviate from these expectations. Thus, they
   perceive smiling male endorsers to have high status but smiling female
   endorsers to have low status. These perceptions, which are independent
   of warmth and competence, influence consumers willingness to purchase
   products whose social prestige value is unknown a priori. Five
   experiments confirm these conclusions and demonstrate their implications
   for actual purchase behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB It is important for firms to signal the high quality of their products
   to consumers in experience goods markets. Conventional wisdom suggests
   that a high price can be a signal of high quality. However, we argue
   that the role of price in signaling quality could be weakened when firms
   resort to the intensive use of targeting in advertising, which could
   attenuate the informational content of a high price. As a consequence, a
   high quality firm needs to distort its price more to signal its quality.
   However, when different levels of targeting are available, a high
   quality firm may find it optimal to signal its quality with a lower
   level of targeting. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As the modem retail industry evolves from multi-channel to seamless
   omni-channel retailing, retailers are increasingly adopting omni-channel
   strategies, such as the usage of omni-coupons. A consumer may obtain an
   omni-coupon from a digital (catalog) channel and purchase either online
   or via the telephone channel. Past studies have not examined such
   cross-channel effects at the purchase incidence level. Using customer
   transaction data from an omni-channel retailer, we investigate the key
   drivers of cross-effects, and the impact of such cross-effects on two
   consumer purchase outcomes (purchase value and cross-buying). We
   specifically study two types of cross-effects, a) catalog-to-online and
   b) digital-to-telephone, and find that the effect of time variables and
   individual characteristics on them is asymmetric. We also show that the
   impact of such cross-effects on purchase outcomes depends on whether the
   omni-coupon was sourced digitally or from a catalog. Retailers aiming to
   increase cross-buying should prioritize catalog coupons, while those
   aiming to increase purchase value should prioritize digital coupons. (C)

AB Product and brand portfolio extensions are effective marketing
   strategies to meet customer needs and to create a competitive advantage
   in the marketplace. Nevertheless, product and brand portfolios can get
   out of control easily leading to a loss of market focus and market
   share. This study examines how product portfolio and branding decisions
   affect brand performance (unit sales and market share). Prior research
   in marketing has investigated the effects of product portfolio and
   branding strategies on firm performance in isolation. However, these
   decisions are rarely isolated events. Usually, for multi-product and
   multi-brand companies, product portfolio decisions are determined in
   conjunction with branding decisions. Using a dynamic panel generalized
   method of moments estimation on a comprehensive dataset from the U.S.
   automotive industry between 2007 and 2013, this study examines the
   extent to which product and brand portfolio characteristics interact to
   affect brand performance. Findings reveal that while brand portfolio
   scope augments the positive effects of portfolio depth and
   innovativeness on brand performance, it attenuates the positive effects
   of product portfolio breadth on brand performance. Also, brand
   positioning in auto industry enhances brand performance only when
   considered jointly with product portfolio breadth, depth, and
   innovativeness. Finally, the present study discovers critical managerial
   trade-offs between product and brand portfolio decisions, as product and
   brand portfolio decisions are intertwined and a careful examination of
   the existing product and brand portfolio characteristics seem to be
   warranted to maximize brand performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The main thesis of this article is that several long-term trends are
   reshaping marketing and forcing marketing managers to change radically
   to keep up. These long-term trends are technological, socioeconomic and
   geopolitical. Advances in technology, in particular, are having a
   profound impact on marketing, resulting in the deepening of customer
   relationships and the continuous expansion of the service economy.
   Artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet, and the expansion of
   networks are creating a revolution in marketing that makes the
   1960s-style 4 Ps increasingly obsolete. Compounding the problem for
   marketers are the socioeconomic factors of diversity and inclusion, as
   well as major geopolitical threats. I explore the nature of change,
   extrapolate marketing practice into the future, and examine the
   implications for marketing managers, marketing education and academic
   research in marketing. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study draws on the structural perspective of organization theory to
   investigate how firms can organize for cross-selling. Specifically, it
   analyzes how configurations of organizational structures and steering
   instruments are associated with cross-selling performance. Results show
   that mechanistic and organic organizational cross-selling structures
   should be closely aligned with financial and nonfinancial steering
   instruments: while the interactions between mechanistic cross-selling
   structures and non-financial steering instruments are likely to result
   in high levels of cross-selling performance, organic cross-selling
   structures should be combined with financial steering via cross-selling
   incentives. Findings also reveal a U-shaped relationship between
   cross-selling performance and firm EBITDA. These results suggest that to
   enhance profits, firms should either organize for very high levels of

   cross-selling structures or steering instruments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Though the mobile app market is substantial and growing fast, most app
   providers struggle to monetize apps profitably. Monetizing apps is done
   in two ways: a) selling advertising space within a free version of the
   app, and b) selling a paid version, termed freemium or in-app purchase
   strategy. In this paper, we present a framework for monetization of
   mobile apps, using two central empirical regularities concerning the
   relationship between users and their mobile apps: a) Sampling: While
   consumers have some prior knowledge of their fit with the app, they
   remain uncertain regarding their exact utility until they are using it;
   and b) Satiation: The utility of using the app may decrease with time.
   While work on the monetization of digital goods has largely overlooked
   the role of satiation and the consequent retention issues, we show that
   in combination with uncertainty, it elucidates the role of the segments
   of consumers that download the free vs. paid version of the app, and how
   to balance these two segments so as to monetize mobile apps. We
   encounter two distinct scenarios: In the first, advertising drives most
   of the revenues; while in the second, revenues are driven by the paid
   version of the app. We explain how uncertainty and satiation affect the
   prevalence of the respective scenarios and impact the share of revenues
   from the paid vs free version of the app. We also demonstrate that an
   app provider can profit from offering a free version with ads even if
   advertisers are not paying for these ads. In other words, the app
   provider benefits from offering a "damaged good" version of the app that
   includes ads, even if this version is free to consumers, and the
   advertisers are not paying for the ads. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published

AB Package graphic design is a powerful tool for brand communication. Yet,
   an important question is how the designs are understood across cultures.
   A considerable amount of research has focused on cross-cultural
   marketing communications, prompting discussions on the emergence of
   global consumer cultures, which make package standardization possible
   or, conversely, the awareness of cultural differences, which has
   suggested that package localization is necessary. No research, however,
   has considered this question from a design-centered perspective and
   examined whether some package graphic designs are more likely than
   others to remain intelligible across cultures. This research proposes
   that packages using motivated signs in their graphic designs are more
   likely to be intelligible across cultures than packages using arbitrary
   signs. To explore this proposition, eight imported wine labels were
   analyzed through a semiotic study (study 1). Then, two studies
   investigated the interpretations of the wine labels by Chinese
   consumers. The results indicate that the labels that were classified as
   "motivated" succeeded in conveying the desired brand meanings to the
   Chinese respondents (study 2: N = 1391) even when they were not familiar
   with the wine brand culture (study 3: N = 795). The research presents a
   theoretical contribution by introducing the concept of sign motivation
   to the marketing literature and nuancing the classic assumption that
   visual signs convey different meanings across cultures. It also presents
   a managerial contribution by presenting a conceptual framework and
   methodology for the analysis of whether or not a graphic design is
   likely to be intelligible across cultures. It therefore provides
   guidelines for the design of packages for international markets. (C)

AB Customer satisfaction contributes to firm financial performance, but
   does it contribute to top executives' pay? Our empirical evidence shows
   that it may not. Customer-satisfying executives tend to have lower pay
   than their productive peers, even if both satisfaction and productivity
   contribute to firm financial performance. Thus, customer satisfaction is
   underappreciated, which may result in both less societal welfare and
   worse company performance. We propose a board myopia mechanism to
   account for this phenomenon. In facing short-term financial performance
   pressure from investors, and the asymmetric information availability
   between accounting-based and market-based assets for compensation
   decisions, the board of directors may be myopic, underappreciating
   executives who invest in market-based assets such as customer
   satisfaction that drive long-term returns. We examine this satisfaction
   underappreciation phenomenon empirically using 23 years of panel data
   that detail firm productivity, customer satisfaction, firm financial
   performance, and executive compensation. The longitudinal data are
   analyzed using fixed-effect panel models and a simultaneous system of
   panel vector autoregression equations with interactions to assess the
   direct effect of firm financial performance and its carryover effect to
   executive compensation across executives who are productive,
   customer-satisfying, or both. The results confirm that
   customer-satisfying executives are underappreciated: being productive is
   financially rewarding for both firms and executives, while being
   customer-satisfying is financially rewarding for firms but not as much
   for executives. We further demonstrate that using total shareholder
   returns to benchmark firm financial performance and reward executives
   with a higher proportion of stock compensation can encourage a long-term
   focus that alleviates this customer underappreciation. (C) 2019 Elsevier

AB Retailers use many different marketing promotions to increase sales and
   profits. These promotions include price reductions, coupons, cash
   mail-in rebates, free gift cards, and buy-one-get-one (BOGO) discounts.
   The type of promotion used results in different outcomes for demand,
   profit, average price, consumer surplus, and sales taxes collected. We
   perform comparative analysis of these five promotions and their
   outcomes. We show that for the same discount amount, price reductions
   result in the lowest average price. For products with weakly diminishing
   consumer utility and low consumer stockpiling, BOGO promotions result in
   the largest demand, profit, consumer surplus, and taxes collected. Cash
   mail-in rebates may result in large profit and taxes collected, but they
   perform poorly in terms of average price paid and consumer surplus. We
   also find that a retailer offering a delayed incentive (i.e. gift cards
   and mail-in rebates) offers a larger reward but provides lower consumer
   surplus than when offering an immediate incentive (i.e. price reduction
   and BOGO). In a segmented market with a price-insensitive consumer
   segment, immediate incentives have the disadvantage of allowing
   price-insensitive consumers arriving during the promotion to obtain the
   discount, which reduces the discount effectiveness. The addition of more
   retailer objectives to maximizing profit, such as demand maximization or
   consumer surplus, increases the effectiveness of immediate incentives.
   We also provide a framework for estimating the important parameters for
   evaluating promotion effectiveness using readily available transactional
   data and examine its accuracy using a simulation experiment. (C) 2019

   We provide a contingency framework that considers various design,

   on a retailer's sales productivity. We test the framework across a large
   sample of 358 grocery banners from a broad cross-section of 27 western
   and eastern European countries. We find a positive effect of the more
   basic LP variant that offers direct and immediate rewards. This positive
   effect, however, disappears when retailers operate a more complex
   progressive-reward system and when they are part of a multivendor
   program. An LP's impact also differs between retailers and countries: it
   is lower when operated by discounters, and higher in countries that are
   more individualistic and long-term oriented, and where fewer competitors
   also carry a loyalty program. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   analysts. We hypothesize that the direct effect of advertising on firm
   value will be stronger for firms not covered by financial analysts than
   for those that are covered because investors may rely on information
   flow from financial analysts for covered firms and rely on information
   flow from advertising in the absence of analyst coverage. Using
   financial and accounting databases for publicly traded firms for a
   period from 1975 to 2015, we test this hypothesis and find empirical
   evidence for the moderating role of analyst coverage in the relationship
   between advertising spending and firm value. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and market orientation (MO) have
   received substantial conceptual and empirical attention in the marketing
   and management literature and both orientations have consistently been
   linked to stronger financial performance. Yet the way in which
   market-oriented firms seek to achieve superior rents is substantively
   different from that of entrepreneurially oriented firms which could lead
   to differential impacts of EO and MO on firm risk. In this study, the
   authors employ a text mining technique to assess firms' EO and MO and
   examine the impact of these two strategic orientations on shareholder
   risk outcomes. The results show that while EO increases idiosyncratic
   risk, MO decreases it. However, only EO decreases systematic risk.
   Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that a firm's decisions
   regarding strategic orientation should be examined in light of both
   likely risks and returns in order to make appropriate resource
   allocation decisions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB Retailers are experiencing a systematic shift in the buying habits of
   their customers as more customers buy across different channels.
   Marketing managers face the daunting task of embracing online and
   offline channels to engage consumers, influence choice, and create
   habits to sustain a competitive advantage. We develop a dynamic
   segmentation model of channel choice and purchase frequency to assess
   the responsiveness of segments to catalogues and email communications.
   In addition, we perform profitability analysis to offer insights on the
   profitability of using catalogues and emails to reach customers. For
   certain firms, especially those with a history of using catalogue
   mailings, the findings suggest that catalogues remain relevant and are
   an effective tool at influencing purchases across both online and
   offline channels despite the increasing trend toward digital marketing.
   In addition, we found a segment of digital consumers respond favorably
   to both emails and catalogues. We argue catalogues have retained their
   competitive advantage over email marketing communication because the
   catalogue may not compete for attention with consumers' other digital
   distractions. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

AB Product aesthetics is a powerful means for achieving competitive
   advantage. Yet most studies to date have focused on the role of
   aesthetics in shaping pre-purchase preferences and have failed to
   consider how product aesthetics affects post-purchase processes and
   consumers' usage behavior. This research focuses on the relationship
   between aesthetics and usage behavior in the context of durable
   products. Studies 1A to 1C provide evidence of a positive effect of
   product aesthetics on usage intensity using market data from the car and
   the fashion industries. Study 2 corroborates these findings and shows
   that the more intensive use of highly aesthetic products may lead to the
   acquisition of product-specific usage skills that form the basis for a
   cognitive lock-in. Hence, consumers are less likely to switch away from
   products with appealing designs, an effect that is labeled as the
   'aesthetic fidelity' effect. Study 3 addresses an alternative
   explanation for the 'aesthetic fidelity effect' based on mood and
   motivation but finds that the 'aesthetic fidelity' effect is indeed
   determined by usage intensity. Finally, Study 4 identifies a boundary
   condition of the positive effect of product aesthetics on product usage,
   showing that it is limited to durable products. In sum, this research
   demonstrates that the effects of product aesthetics extend beyond the
   pre-consumption stage and have an enduring impact on people's
   consumption experiences. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

AB In any product search process, consumers encounter multiple products. In
   today's online retail environment, such product encounters are
   increasingly serial, such that consumers review products back-to-back
   (e.g., through swiping in mobile apps). The present research shows that
   for the serial evaluation of products, the serial position matters
   through an interaction of a leadership bias, conceptual fluency and
   tedium. During a product search, evaluations follow an S-shaped pattern
   consisting of (1) a primacy phase of declining evaluations (caused by a
   leadership bias towards the first product), (2) a wear-in phase of
   increasing evaluations (caused by increasing conceptual fluency after a
   recognition of the shared attributes of the product category), and (3) a
   wear-out period of declining evaluations (caused by tedium). Ten
   empirical investigations in an e-commerce setting granularly trace these
   three phases, establishing conceptually related overall boundary
   conditions (matching vs. searching products) and moderators (conditional
   vs. unconditional searching, product similarity, conceptual category
   knowledge, product image complexity) of the S-shaped pattern of serial
   product evaluations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In today's fiercely competitive environment, firms are increasingly
   relying on loyalty programs to influence customers' repeat purchase
   behavior. However, little is known about how customers' cultural values
   shape their satisfaction in response to loyalty programs. Such knowledge
   is important because it allows marketers to identify cultural segments
   that may be more or less likely to respond favorably to loyalty
   programs, and hence increase the effectiveness of such programs. In the
   current research, we propose that power distance perception - defined as
   the extent to which people observe power disparities in society -
   positively influences satisfaction of customers who hold loyalty status,
   but negatively influences satisfaction of customers who do not hold
   loyalty status with a firm. In contrast, power distance values defined
   as the extent to which people endorse power disparities in society -
   negatively influences satisfaction of customers who hold loyalty status,
   but positively influences satisfaction of customers who do not hold
   loyalty status with a firm. A quasi-field study and several lab
   experiments support these propositions, shed light on the underlying
   mechanisms, and rule out alternative explanations. Our findings also
   uncover several distinct tools that marketers could use to influence
   non-loyalty status and loyalty status customers' satisfaction with

AB Whether to unify or discriminate prices in offline and online channels
   is a controversial topic that can be central to whether offline
   retailers survive in the marketplace. Field data evidence from a large
   multichannel retailer reveals a sobering picture. On average, only
   offline price premiums of approximately 2% seem feasible, and such
   premiums vary largely by product categories and price levels.
   High-priced products, which consumers perceive as risky, tend to allow
   offline price premiums, as do low-priced, takeaway items. However, in
   between these two extremes, the results show no potential for offline
   price premiums. Drawing on price fairness theory, we further explore
   consumer responses to higher offline prices in three experimental
   studies. In contrast with the assumptions of price fairness theory, the
   provision of purchase advisory services and communication of the price
   motive hardly stimulate consumer acceptance of higher offline prices in
   our context. However, the findings reveal important heterogeneity in
   consumer responses depending on their market segment, because some
   market segments indeed respond less negatively to higher offline prices.
   In addition, consumers accept offline price premiums for unplanned
   purchases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Firms recognizing consumers often use behavior-based pricing (BBP), i.e
   condition prices on purchase history. Prior research studies the
   framework with independent product offerings and shows that BBP leads to
   poaching and decreases each firm's profits. In this paper, we
   investigate the efficacy of BBP in a two-period duopoly where firms
   provide compatible product categories and endogenously determine the
   levels of cross-compatibility. We first revisit the impact of
   behavior-based pricing in the traditional framework with independent
   offerings and verify the competition-increasing effect of BBP. We then
   examine how the impact of BBP differs when firms introduce product
   compatibility. Interestingly, we find that firms can benefit from BBP
   when firms introduce product compatibility. More specifically, when the
   value consumers obtain from perfect compatibility is moderate,
   implementing BBP is more profitable than without consumer recognition.
   The intuition is that when the value of perfect compatibility is medium,
   consumers do not expect good switching deals in the second period and
   firms can charge higher prices in the first period. Our findings not
   only complement the BBP literature but also shed light on the firms'
   strategic decisions on product compatibility. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

AB We introduce political conservatism as possibly associated with brand
   attachment. We propose that conservatism, in particular, might be
   related to stronger attachment bonds to brands due to greater feelings
   of uncertainty, encouraging consumers to seek security via forming brand
   attachment bonds. In five studies, we demonstrate a relationship between
   conservatism and brand attachment. Uncertainty is able to explain the
   relationship, as attachment bonds to brands can appease conservatives'
   uncertainty. We also observe downstream consequences for price
   sensitivity and purchase intentions. Finally, the relationship may arise
   primarily for a brand with a domestic (vs. foreign) country-of-origin.
   Accordingly, consumers' political ideology may play a role in brand
   attachment with implications for how brand managers can segment or
   target the market in order to predict consumer-brand relationships. We
   situate our work more generally on the relevance of consumers' political
   ideology for marketing activities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Brands tweet not only to communicate with followers but also to reach
   large audiences rapidly when the tweets are retweeted by the followers.
   People however will retweet only if they recognize within a few seconds
   that the tweet is on an interesting topic. Brands therefore need
   insights into how to compose tweets to facilitate topic recognition even
   when they are just scanned. This is the issue that we address in this
   research. Specifically, drawing on findings in psycholinguistics, we
   empirically investigate if tweets composed such that they include more
   topic-related words that are located closer to the start get more
   retweets. Results from an investigation of sales-promotional tweets by
   sixty brands in four categories indicate that tweets that are composed
   as above do get more retweets. We repeat the investigation using tweets
   on several other topics from a natural experiment that generated pairs
   of tweets where each pair is on the same topic but each tweet in the
   pair is composed differently. This investigation reconfirms the findings
   from the analysis of retweets of sales-promotional tweets. We conclude
   by presenting an approach for how social media managers can compose
   tweets based on our findings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Most marketing and branding activities are essentially concerned with
   enchantment the rendering of the ordinary into something special. To
   create enchantment, companies are increasingly marketing past-themed
   brands and products. Yet, there is little research about why and how
   such nostalgia marketing creates enchantment for consumers. Building on
   different modalities of nostalgia identified in sociological literature
   (reluctant nostalgia, progressive nostalgia, and playful nostalgia), we
   analyze the creation of enchantment through a longitudinal, qualitative,
   multi-method program of inquiry. We find three routes to enchantment
   grounded in different nostalgia modes: (1) re-instantiation (symbolic
   retrojection into a past). (2) re-enactment (reflexively informing the
   present with past-themed brands and practices), and (3) re-appropriation
   (ludic re-interpretation of the past). By unfolding the different ways
   in which marketers can press rewind to create enchantment, we discern
   important implications for theorizing and managing past-themed brands in
   terms of marketing strategy, targeting and positioning, brand experience
   design, and marketing communications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   value creation and propose how these advance and transform competition
   for this interface. Depending on the importance of the new sources of
   value creation (in different purchase situations), stationary retailing
   may prevail as an important interaction point in a multichannel decision
   journey. However, increasing diffusion of branded-product platforms

AB Marketing academics are keenly aware of the seismic shifts in today's
   marketing environment caused by digital (dis)intermediation. In this
   article, we discuss four types of digital (dis)intermediation, and how
   they affect branding activities of incumbents and new firms. First, we
   discuss digital transaction intermediation, a development that is
   closely tied to the rise of ecommerce retailers. A second type is
   digital transaction disintermediation associated with the rise of
   ecommerce D2C models. These first two types of digital (dis)
   intermediation are primarily top-down processes, where firms are
   developing new ways to sell their brands to consumers. The next two
   types of digital (dis) intermediation are of the bottom-up kind - the
   consumer is in the driver's seat. Digital marketing intermediation and
   the rise of D2C brand-building models is powered by crowdsourcing. A
   final development is digital marketing disintermediation, which is
   closely tied to the rise of C2C models. We present issues in need of
   future research for each type of digital (dis)intermediation. We
   conclude with an appeal that marketing takes the lead in developing
   overarching, indigenous theories of digital (dis)intermediation to make
   sense of the rapid changes in the marketplace. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB High failure rates of digital innovations by start-ups indicate that

   manage consumers' initial trust perceptions of digital innovations. Five
   experiments explore how start-ups can signal trustworthiness in order to
   overcome low initial trust perceptions and boost adoption. We find three
   specific design strategies of start-ups' digital business models -
   customer ratings, benefit communication, and revenue model - to be
   effective to overcome low initial trust perceptions and to increase
   adoption of digital innovations. The findings demonstrate that initial
   trust serves as a critical mediator in the relationship between these
   design strategies and consumers' adoption intentions. Additionally, the
   chosen revenue model has differential effects on privacy concerns, which
   mediate the relationship between revenue model and initial trust. The

AB Broadband Internet has fundamentally changed business models in many
   industries. In the music industry, for instance, old business models
   were challenged by illegal competitors, and broadband Internet has
   enabled value creation through new business models. The changes that
   established business models experienced in the wake of broadband
   Internet, however, differed vastly across national markets, and these
   differences are not well understood. We build a conceptual framework and
   study the extent to which differences in economic and cultural factors
   are associated with different market outcomes in the wake of the
   proliferation of broadband Internet. Thus, we compile two unique data
   sets from the music industry, comprising (1) revenue data for 36
   countries and 22 years and (2) piracy data for 47 countries and >2
   years. We use a Bayesian multilevel model to explore between-country
   heterogeneity in the associations between these variables and broadband
   Internet adoption and business model innovations. Our results show that
   the negative association between broadband Internet penetration and
   music revenue is weaker in high-income countries, where income
   restrictions are less likely to drive demand towards illegitimate piracy
   services. In terms of cultural factors, we find that a market's response
   to the introduction of broadband Internet is less negative in countries
   scoring high on Hofstede's individualism and uncertainty avoidance
   dimensions. Furthermore, we find that overall revenues only recover

AB Mobile apps are becoming a go-to tactic for retailers because they offer
   the promise of highly convenient digital engagement. We hypothesize that
   two types of customers are best served by these apps - "offline-only"
   customers currently purchasing exclusively from the retailer's physical
   store, and "distant" customers who reside far from the physical store.
   For offline-only customers, the app complements the physical engagement
   they currently have. For distant customers, the app offers convenient
   engagement their remoteness currently precludes. We model app access and
   purchase behavior of 629 customers who downloaded a retailer's app. We
   find that apps generate more incremental sales among distant customers
   compared to near customers, and more incremental sales among
   offline-only customers compared to online customers. On an illustrative
   base of 100 K app users, we find accessing the app would generate $2.3 M
   in incremental sales. Consistent with our segmentation results, we find
   that the users with the greatest purchase lift (9.5%) due to app usage
   are those that are distant and offline-only. Our results confirm the
   economic value of retailer apps and their role as a segmentation
   strategy to enhance customer engagement. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Firms allocate increasingly large budgets to mobile banner advertising.
   Yet, existing research paid only scant attention to the sales effects of
   mobile banner ads. In this paper, we fill this gap by determining the
   offline and online sales impact of a large-scale mobile banner
   advertising campaign. As part of a geographical field experiment, over
   3.5 million mobile banner ads were served to a predetermined
   geographical area. We determine the offline and online sales effects of
   the mobile banner ad campaign by analyzing twenty months of sales data
   for regions covering the entire country of the Netherlands. Relying on a
   difference-in-difference approach and two matching methods, we
   demonstrate an offline sales increase of around 2%. The online sales
   effect is not significant. We conclude that firms can use mobile banner
   advertising to boost offline sales. We find no evidence for
   cross-channel sales cannibalization. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The news industry is being massively disrupted by the digital
   distribution of news. Consequently, publishers have revised their
   business models and integrated pay-per-article options. To reduce
   pre-purchase uncertainty, consumers can use information from
   firm-induced (e.g., newsletters), or consumer-induced communication
   (e.g., likes). These communication activities avoid purchases with poor
   fit but also increase customer expectations. Consequently, their effect
   on sales, returns, and profitability is unclear. For digital products,
   these effects are even less clear because product quality is difficult
   to evaluate pre-purchase, and products can be returned at almost no
   cost, even after consumption. In this study, we investigate the effects
   of firm- and consumer-induced communication on digital returns in the
   context of news articles on a major online platform (Blendle). We rely
   on a multi-equation model to quantify the effect of firm- and
   consumer-induced communication activities (i.e., newsletter promotions
   sent out by the platform and consumer likes from readers) on sales and
   returns and calculate their profitability impact. Our results show.that
   newsletters decrease returns but do not significantly affect sales. In
   contrast, consumer likes have a twofold effect by increasing sales and
   decreasing returns. A simulation shows that both newsletters and likes
   increase profitability and that likes have a higher potential. Our
   results offer much needed guidance for online aggregators of digital
   products (e.g., audiobooks, e-books or news articles), as well as for
   online publishers based on pay-per-unit business models. (C) 2019

AB Advance selling is a marketing strategy commonly used by online
   retailers to increase sales by exploiting consumer valuation
   uncertainty. Recently, some online retailers have started to allow
   refunds on products sold in advance. On the one hand this reduces the
   net advance sales, but on the other hand it allows a higher advance
   sales price. This research is the first to explore the overall effect of
   allowing a refund on profits from advance sales, identifying conditions
   where advance selling with or without refunds (or no advance selling at
   all) is best. We analytically compare the profits of three advance
   selling strategies: none, without refund, and with refund. We show that
   selling in advance and allowing a refund is optimal for products with a
   relatively small profit margin and small strategic market size, and that
   the added profit can be considerable. Our results guide managers in
   selecting the right advance selling strategy. To facilitate this, we
   graphically display, based on the two dimensions of regular profit
   margin and strategic market size, under what conditions the different
   strategies are optimal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing volume of firm-related conversations on social media has
   made it considerably more difficult for marketers to track and analyse
   electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) about brands, products or services.
   Firms often use sentiment analysis to identify relevant eWOM that
   requires a response to consequently engage in webcare. In this paper, we
   show that sentiment analysis of any kind might not be ideal for this
   purpose, because it relies on the questionable assumption that only
   negative eWOM is response-worthy and it is not able to infer meaning
   from text. We propose and test an approach based on supervised machine
   learning that first decides whether eWOM is relevant for the brand to
   respond, and then-based on a categorization of seven different types of
   eWOM (e.g., question, complaint)-classifies three customer satisfaction
   dimensions. Using a dataset of approximately 60,000 Facebook comments
   and 11,000 tweets about 16 different brands in eight different
   industries, we test and compare the efficacy of various sentiment
   analysis, dictionary-based and machine learning techniques to detect
   relevant eWOM. In doing so, this study identifies response-worthy eWOM
   based on the content instead of its expressed sentiment. The results
   indicate that these machine learning techniques achieve considerably
   higher accuracy in detecting relevant eWOM on social media compared to
   any kind of sentiment analysis. Moreover, it is shown that
   industry-specific classifiers can further improve this process and that
   algorithms are applicable across different social networks. (C) 2019

AB This paper presents a novel research methodology, screencast videography
   (SCV), as an approach to studying interactions and experiences in the
   digital space. Screencasting is a method of digitally recorded
   computer/mobile screen output, with or without audio narration. Focusing
   on the dynamic, highly visual digital environment in which many modern
   experiences such as e-shopping take place, SCV can be used for
   videographic studies of digital experiences that are rarely captured by
   means of traditional videography owing to the private settings of such
   experiences. SCV is able to capture dynamic experiences in the digital
   space, opening up opportunities for a wealth of screencast-based
   research to enhance our understanding of digitally occurring
   interactions, experiences and phenomena. This paper discusses the
   ontological and epistemological assumptions of SCV and how it is
   situated in relation to other relevant methodological approaches
   (videography and netnography). It then outlines, step-by-step, the
   methodological protocol for SCV and its possible applications. An
   illustrative example of using this method to study digital experience in
   the context of online fashion shopping is presented and discussed. This
   is the first presentation of such a method, offering a promising
   approach to studying similar experiences in the digital world. Crown

AB Many digital service providers have adopted gamification to promote
   customer engagement. Critical questions, however, remain about the most
   effective way to enhance customer engagement and increase sales by
   applying gamification. With a research design that combines qualitative
   and quantitative methods, including the use of objective sales data from
   a large field study and replication of the findings across different
   contexts, this study explores how gamification fosters customer
   engagement. Both field study results and a simulation study reveal
   gamification principles (i.e., social interaction, sense of control,
   goals, progress tracking, rewards, and prompts) that promote hope and
   consequently increase customer engagement and digital sales.
   Furthermore, we find that hope is more strongly associated with customer
   engagement than the psychological condition of compulsion, which even
   exerts a negative impact. This research thus explores how gamification
   creates value for customers and provides actionable insights for
   managers to foster hope through gamification as opposed to get customers
   hooked. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In most industries, brand managers do not advertise continuously.
   Instead, advertising is switched on and off systematically, a phenomenon
   often referred to as pulsing. Moreover, spending levels vary
   considerably across periods when brands do advertise. Surprisingly, this
   variety in advertising spending patterns as observed in practice, as
   well as competitor impact on these patterns and their sales outcomes,
   have received relatively little empirical attention. In this paper we
   focus on two core aspects of observed advertising patterns: incidence
   and magnitude. Insights are based on the analysis of advertising
   spending for 370 CPG brands in 71 product categories over a four-year
   period. We also collected feedback from practitioners dealing with
   advertising across a wide range of firms. We first empirically establish
   that pulsing is the dominant form of advertising scheduling. Observed
   patterns, in turn, are largely driven by television and print
   advertising. Next, we show that, after accounting for a wide range of
   other possible drivers, advertising in-sync with competitors is more
   common than out-of-sync. However, the results suggest that competitive
   reasoning plays only a relatively minor role in advertising decisions.
   Finally, we show that, across a wide range of real-world scenarios,
   investing in top-of-mind awareness through maintenance advertising
   insulates brands from competitors' actions and boosts sales. (C) 2018

   decreases people's motivation to complete the task in the former stage
   but increases their motivation in the latter stage. Alternative

AB The current research investigates a potential disadvantage of building
   brand associations that resonate with consumers' identities and
   facilitate consumer-brand bonding. The authors propose a theory of
   consumer response to changes that either dampen or augment the
   associations central to brand image (e.g., due to brand acquisitions or
   repositioning). The results show that consumers with a high degree of
   self-brand connection respond more negatively than others do to changes
   that dampen brand associations. Counterintuitively, changes augmenting
   brand associations can also lead to unfavorable consumer sentiments in
   certain instances. When brand connection was linked to an ideal
   self-identity (i.e., self-enhancement motives), changes that augmented
   the brand image increased the brand's ability to signal an ideal
   identity. Conversely, when brand connection was linked to the actual
   self-identity (i.e., self-verification motives), augmenting brand image
   reduced the perceived similarity between the self and the brand, thus
   causing brand identification to deteriorate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This research extends previous literature on environmentally motivated
   consumption reduction (EMCR) with a cross-cultural investigation across
   28 European countries. The paper elucidates how European consumers'
   knowledge and perceived seriousness of climate change inhibit the
   activation of counter-arguments, with implications for EMCR. More
   specifically, counter arguing is a critical barrier to reduce EMCR. The
   developed model is based on the novel premise that the contingency
   variables, which qualify the impeding role of this barrier, are anchored
   at different levels. To account for individual and societal aspects
   simultaneously, multi-level analysis combines large-scale data from a
   Eurobarometer (n = 16,095) with secondary data at the societal level (n
   = 28). The results confirm that counter-arguments as barriers for EMCR
   and their attenuation through knowledge and perceived seriousness
   substantially varies across societies. Our results reveal that the
   collectivism/individualism dimension is most relevant in qualifying the
   impact of counter-arguments on EMCR. Building on our findings,
   impact-level-maps of counter-arguments and country clusters aid
   international marketers of environmentally friendly products to flexibly
   tailor their marketing campaigns. For policy-makers, our results further
   highlight that rather than raising knowledge with educative campaigns,
   perceptions of seriousness should be targeted to foster EMCR and inhibit
   counter-arguing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports a surprising reversal in the effect of advertising
   repetition over time. A field study shows higher annoyance with a more
   frequently advertised brand at the time of advertising, but greater
   preference for this same brand several weeks later. A longitudinal
   online experiment replicates the reversal in brand preference across
   four time points and tests an underlying mechanism for this reversal. It
   shows that initial annoyance with frequent ad repetition is highly
   susceptible to decay over time, whereas brand memory remains relatively
   stable. Through these two processes, brands with heavier advertising
   exposure move over time from lower preference to higher preference.
   Finally, a third experiment demonstrates a crucial condition for this
   reversal product relevance at the time of consideration. This study
   shows that the reversal occurs only if at the later time the product
   category is relevant. We discuss the substantial implications of these
   findings for marketing theory and practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

   information is present, and b) inference formation if this attribute
   information is missing for some alternatives. The impact of different
   information presentation formats on consumers' perception bias and
   inference formation is then examined by applying theories from social
   psychology. Our model outperforms standard Random Utility models that
   omit explicit representation of these phenomena. Consistent with
   theories considered, we find significant evidence of perception bias and
   inference in the choice data. Our results also provide insights on how
   consumers may infer the quality of a missing attribute in different
   competitive framing contexts. Finally, our welfare estimates show that
   consumers may benefit simply from the information improvement regarding
   government labeling policies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Research on growth of innovations introduced to the market has gradually
   shifted its focus from aggregate-level diffusion to exploring how growth
   is influenced by a given social network structure's characteristics. In
   this paper, we critically review this branch of literature. We argue
   that the growth of an innovation in a social network is shaped by the
   network's structure. Borrowing from the field of industrial organization
   in economics, which defines itself as the study of the effect of market
   structure on market performance, we describe this new wave of research
   on growth of innovations as the effect of social network structure on
   innovation performance. Hence, social network structural characteristics
   should be incorporated into research on new product growth as well as
   into managerial marketing decisions such as targeting and new product
   seeding.
   We review how social network structure influences innovations' market
   performance. Specifically, we discuss (1) a networks' global
   characteristics, namely average degree, degree distribution, clustering,
   and degree assortativity; (2) dyadic characteristics, or the
   relationships between pairs of network members, namely tie strength and
   embeddedness; (3) intrinsic individual characteristics, namely opinion
   leadership and susceptibility; and (4) location-based individual
   characteristics, namely the degree centrality, closeness centrality, and
   betweenness centrality of an individual network member.
   Overall, we find that growth is particularly effective in networks that
   demonstrate the "3 Cs": cohesion (strong mutual influence among its
   members), connectedness (high number of ties), and conciseness (low
   redundancy). We identify gaps in current knowledge, discuss the
   implications on managerial decision making, and suggest topics for
   future research. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Online social media drive the growth of unstructured text data. Many
   marketing applications require structuring this data at scales
   non-accessible to human coding, e.g., to detect communication shifts in
   sentiment or other researcher-defined content categories. Several
   methods have been proposed to automatically classify unstructured text.
   This paper compares the performance of ten such approaches (five
   lexicon-based, five machine learning algorithms) across 41 social media
   datasets covering major social media platforms, various sample sizes,
   and languages. So far, marketing research relies predominantly on
   support vector machines (SVM) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
   (LIWC). Across all tasks we study, either random forest (RF) or naive
   Bayes (NB) performs best in terms of correctly uncovering human
   intuition. In particular, RF exhibits consistently high performance for
   three-class sentiment, NB for small samples sizes. SVM never outperform
   the remaining methods. All lexicon-based approaches, LIWC in particular,
   perform poorly compared with machine learning. In some applications,
   accuracies only slightly exceed chance. Since additional considerations
   of text classification choice are also in favor of NB and RF, our
   results suggest that marketing research can benefit from considering
   these alternatives. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Why are some new product introductions more viral and successful than
   others? This research integrates theories of interpersonal communication
   and consumer learning to explore this question. Analyzing a unique data
   set of millions of consumer word-of-mouth transmissions (eWOM) on social
   media regarding 345 new automobile products introduced during 2008-2015,
   we find that more innovative products generate more eWOM volume but
   surprisingly less positive sentiment. These effects vary in magnitude
   across eWOM channels. However, the use of rich-content communication,
   pre-announcement, and cobranding strengthens (weakens) the positive
   (negative) effect of product innovativeness on eWOM volume (sentiment).
   The results further indicate that eWOM sentiment is a stronger predictor
   of new product success than eWOM volume. Experimental results reveal
   more insights into how product innovativeness influences eWOM metrics in
   several product categories and shed light on the role of excitement and
   perceived risk as mechanisms underlying these effects. The research
   offers useful implications for firms to design effective viral marketing
   campaigns to enhance new product success. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The practice of upstream firms (suppliers) and downstream firms
   co-creating products (goods or services) together has a long history in
   business markets. We analyze the strategic choices of two competing
   downstream firms who simultaneously decide whether or not to co-create
   with an upstream supplier. Within this framework we incorporate
   endogenous pricing and effort choices by the upstream supplier and the
   downstream firms. Downstream firms contemplating co-creation with a
   supplier are faced with a trade-off. On the one hand they can benefit
   from the supplier's innovation efforts and therefore obtain a better
   product. On the other hand, they are confronted with the adverse effect
   of their own innovation efforts spilling over to their rivals via the
   supplier who would sell the co-created product to all firms. Our model
   captures this tension and offers several insights.
   First, we show that all the channel members (the supplier and the firms)
   are getting higher profits when they all co-create together, as compared
   to the situation where there is no co creation and the Supplier alone
   designs the product. However, we also demonstrate that the
   abovementioned trade-offs provide an incentive for firms to deviate from
   this outcome, sometimes resulting in no-co-creation between the
   downstream firms and upstream supplier in equilibrium.
   Further, we show that in the competitive co-creation environment,
   ex-ante symmetric firms may pursue asymmetric strategies in equilibrium.
   The asymmetric equilibrium, in which only one of the two firms
   co-creates with the supplier, is obtained when the degree of price
   sensitivity to competitor's product in the consumer market is moderate.
   Third, we find two types of asymmetric equilibria. For moderately low
   degrees of price sensitivity, all parties prefer the asymmetric outcome.
   For moderately high price sensitivity, both firms prefer co-creation,
   but the supplier will refuse to co-create with one of them thereby
   enforcing the asymmetric outcome. Thus, a strategic supplier's role is
   critical in that it expands the region where the asymmetric equilibrium
   takes place, beyond the one preferred by the firms themselves.
   We also show that, when firms compete in the end-consumer market, the
   supplier may exert lower innovation effort when it co-creates with two
   firms as compared to one. This is not the case in the absence of
   competition between the downstream firms. Finally, and
   counterintuitively, a higher degree of product fit for the rival can
   actually benefit the co-creating firm in the asymmetric outcome, even
   though it improves its rival's product. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This research investigates how the combination of aesthetically
   appealing and unappealing visual elements in marketing communications
   can motivate prosocial behavior. Prior literature has investigated the
   effectiveness of aesthetically pleasing or displeasing visuals
   separately and has reported mixed results. Based on the notion that
   empathy is a key driver of prosocial behavior, the current work first
   makes a theoretical distinction between two antecedents of empathy
   identification and perceived need and then illustrates how these
   antecedents are evoked by pleasing and displeasing visual elements,
   respectively. The authors show that the combination of a pleasing
   individual (human or object) and a displeasing group is particularly
   effective in evoking identification and perceived need, and therefore
   empathy. The elevated empathy, in turn, motivates prosocial behavior.
   Five main experiments in the field, lab, and online, as well as a
   pre-study and two post studies, provide supportive empirical evidence.
   Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier

AB While research has successfully linked social media to separate customer
   metrics, an in-depth conceptual and empirical understanding of how
   social media affects the stages of the marketing funnel is currently
   lacking. We draw on extant theories of consumer information processing
   and source credibility to conceptually link and contrast the
   relationships between firm generated content (FGC) dimensions of neutral
   valence, positive valence and vividness, user generated content (UGC)
   dimensions of volume and valence and the marketing funnel stages of
   awareness, consideration, purchase intent and satisfaction. Using daily
   aggregate brand-level data for 19 brands across seven industries, our
   analysis shows that UGC dimensions have a stronger relationship with
   awareness and satisfaction while FGC dimensions are more effective for
   consideration and purchase intent. Specifically, we observe that FGC
   vividness has the strongest relationship with consideration and purchase
   intent, while UGC valence dominates UGC volume for these stages. Our
   results also show that brands with higher corporate reputation have
   stronger relationships between dimensions of FGC and the marketing
   funnel stages. Findings by consumption category show that UGC and FGC
   dimensions have larger positive relationships with awareness for
   durables and non-durables, and with consideration, purchase intent, and
   satisfaction for services. Thus, overall, our study offers critical
   managerial insights into social media marketing regarding how to
   leverage both FGC and UGC in managing the marketing funnel and brand
   reputation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the digitization of the retail industry, there is a growing
   abundance of event-based tracking data describing consumer behavior
   (e.g., online clickstreams and offline sensors tracking the movement of
   shoppers). However, stronger data privacy regulations and the growing
   privacy consciousness of consumers suggest that much of the data may
   increasingly only be available to retailers in an anonymized and
   fragmented form that does not identify individual consumers exactly. In
   response to the relative paucity of research on marketing analytics in
   retailing using anonymized and fragmented event-based (AFE) tracking
   data, this paper makes three interrelated contributions. First, we
   describe the relevance of AFE data in the future of retailing,
   contrasting it with other forms of aggregate and individual-level data.
   Second, we propose a methodology for analyzing AFE data, which allows us
   to approximately recover individual level heterogeneity and derive
   meaningful variables from the raw data. Third, we validate the
   methodology using representative data collected by deploying
   sensor-enabled shelves in a field experiment within a store. We find
   that our approach to analyzing AFE data can help uncover interesting
   patterns of consumer behavior and could be applied across other online
   and offline retail settings in practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Asians are more likely than Westerners to have both a relational (vs.
   analytic) thinking style and a prevention (vs. promotion) focus. These
   two chronic dispositions can have opposite effects on their evaluations
   of brand extensions, the relative magnitude of which depends on whether
   the extensions are construed at a concrete or abstract level. Results of
   three experiments demonstrate that when an extension is psychologically
   close and construed at a concrete level, Asians' disposition to engage
   in relational thinking leads them to perceive the extension to be
   relatively more similar to the parent, leading them to evaluate the
   extension more favorably than do Westerners. On the other hand, when the
   extension is psychologically distant and construed at an abstract level
   and thus Asians are unlikely to engage in relational processing, their
   prevention focus leads them to perceive the extension to be riskier and
   evaluate it less favorably than do Westerners. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The structural alignment literature suggests that people place more
   weight on alignable (vs. nonalignable) attributes when evaluating
   competing options. The present research proposes that consumers'
   regulatory orientation moderates this process. Specifically, consumers
   differentially weight alignable versus nonalignable attributes depending
   on whether they are prevention or promotion-oriented. Results of four
   studies indicate that prevention-oriented consumers who tend to construe
   information at a more concrete level rely more on alignable attributes
   when evaluating two options as compared to promotion-oriented consumers
   who tend to construe information at a more abstract level, and are
   influenced more by nonalignable attributes. The authors further show
   that consumers' construal level and differential ease of processing the
   two types of attributes mediate the influence of regulatory orientations
   on their relative weighting of alignable versus nonalignable attributes
   and product evaluations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Images are an essential feature of many social networking services, such
   as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Through brand-related images,
   consumers communicate about brands with each other and link the brand
   with rich contextual and consumption experiences. However, previous
   articles in marketing research have concentrated on deriving brand
   information from textual user-generated content and have largely not
   considered brand-related images. The analysis of brand-related images
   yields at least two challenges. First, the content displayed in images
   is heterogeneous, and second, images rarely show what users think and
   feel in or about the situations displayed. To meet these challenges,
   this article presents a two-step approach that involves collecting,
   labeling, clustering, aggregating, mapping, and analyzing brand-related
   user-generated content. The collected data are brand-related images,
   caption texts, and social tags posted on Instagram. Clustering images
   labeled via Google Cloud Vision API enabled to identify heterogeneous
   contents (e.g. products) and contexts (e.g. situations) that consumers
   create content about. Aggregating and mapping the textual information
   for the resulting image clusters in the form of associative networks
   empowers marketers to derive meaningful insights by inferring what
   consumers think and feel about their brand regarding different contents
   and contexts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Social media firestorms imply the sudden occurrence of many,
   predominantly negative social media expressions against a brand. Do such
   firestorms leave a mark on consumers and their brand judgments-in the
   short term but also over time-to a degree that deserves managerial
   attention? What kind of firestorms have the strongest destructive
   potential? This manuscript treats firestorms as a digital form of brand
   crisis and proposes a conceptual framework to identify which firestorms
   harm short- and long-term brand perceptions and become part of
   consumer's long-term memory. A unique data set combines secondary data
   about 78 real-life firestorms with daily brand perceptions obtained from
   the YouGov panel and survey data from 997 consumers. The results
   indicate that of all affected brands, 58% suffer from a decrease in
   short-term brand perceptions, and 40% suffer long-term negative effects,
   suggesting that social media firestorms can indeed harm businesses but
   also show that strong variations exist. Contingency analyses of the
   conceptual framework with regressions and generalized estimating
   equations indicate that social media firestorms are most impactful in
   terms of negative brand association changes and/or memory effects when
   they are initiated by a vivid trigger (e.g., video in the first
   firestorm tweet), linked to a product/service or social failure,
   characterized by a large volume of social media messages, and when they
   last longer. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research examines the marketplace performance of ingredient brand
   alliances (IBAs). In this type of alliance, a component or feature of a
   primary or focal brand is branded using a secondary brand. Performance
   is affected by both the primary and secondary brands, each of which has
   functional and emotional associations. Drawing on concept combination
   theory, the authors examine congruent and incongruent effects in both
   associations as a means of achieving synergy in the brand. While the
   extant literature largely focuses on consumer perceptions of ingredient
   brand alliance products as an outcome, the authors examine the market
   share and revenues for 126 ingredient brand alliances in 49 product
   categories of consumer packaged goods over 14 years. A generalized
   estimation equation shows that, on average, each brand's associations
   have positive main effects on ingredient brand alliance performance.
   However, congruent associations (such as the perceived functional
   associations of both brands) attenuate these effects, while incongruent
   associations (the perceived functional association of one brand with the
   perceived emotional association of another) were not significant. The
   article concludes with a simulation showing that managers can do better
   by picking a partner brand whose associations are more incongruent,

AB Whether to legally protect original fashion designs against piracy is an
   ongoing debate among legislators, industry groups, and legal academic
   circles, which has gained little exposure in the marketing literature.
   We combine data on the growth of fashion designs, price markups, and
   industry statistics to develop a formal analysis of the essential
   questions at the base of the debate. We distinguish between three
   effects: Acceleration, whereby the presence of a pirated design
   increases the awareness of the design; Substitution, which represents
   the loss of sales due to consumers who would have purchased the original
   design, yet instead buy the knockoff; and loss because of Overexposure
   of the design resulting from the design's ubiquity. Using data-driven
   simulation analysis, we find that for the items analyzed (handbags and
   apparel), overexposure emerged as having a stronger negative effect (on
   average) on the original's profitability than the positive effect of
   acceleration. Both effects are considerably larger than that of
   substitution. This result is of particular interest given that industry
   groups have consistently focused on the damage caused by substitution.
   We also show that the effect of a legally mandated postponement on the
   introduction of a knockoff is non-monotonic for short lag: A short time
   lag may not affect the original design's NPV, and in fact may even
   damage it. For the ranges we analyzed, the positive effect of the
   protection period is observed primarily for time lags of over one year.

   to raise new funds. We show that during periods of low (high) investor
   sentiment, firms decrease (increase) their advertising expenditure, even
   though the effectiveness of advertising is greater (lower) during such
   periods. We also find that these results are stronger for financially
   constrained firms that rely more on external financing. Our findings

AB The collection of blood given by donors has proven to be a substantial
   societal and a managerial challenge. Consequently, blood donation
   services seek for incentive mechanisms to retain donors. However,
   economic or material rewards might entail negative side effects such as
   motivational crowding out or even attracting "bad blood". In an effort
   to increase the retention of established blood donors, we conducted two
   randomized field trials (N-1 = 53,257, N-2 = 31,522) in cooperation with
   the German Red Cross Blood Donation Service and tested the effectiveness
   of an incentive strategy that is directly related to the blood donation
   itself: offering a comprehensive blood health check. Contrary to
   previous related research, we found substantial positive effects of a
   comprehensive blood health check incentive on donation behavior. In
   addition, unlike previous studies, we examine effects of repeated
   exposure to this incentive and do not find any wearout effects.
   Considering the positive effect of this incentive on donor retention and
   the relative low cost for providing this service to donors, our findings
   suggest that offering comprehensive blood health check incentives is a
   viable and cost-efficient marketing strategy to increase the retention
   among previous donors even if offered over the longer run. (C) 2018

AB Many durable product categories have well developed and organized
   secondary markets that make it easy for consumers to purchase used
   versions in lieu of new ones. Manufacturers in these categories
   therefore face a dilemma in deciding on how much durability to build
   into their new products. High durability levels increase the risk that
   future new product sales are lost to used versions (the cannibalization
   effect), but can also help the firm take sales from new and used
   versions produced by its rivals (the competition effect). However, there
   has been no empirical research to determine the relative sizes of these
   two effects.
   Our research seeks to fill this gap in the literature via an empirical
   study of the demand for new and used vehicles in the US automobile
   market. We analyze two datasets; the first from the mid-sized sedan
   segment in the Indianapolis DMA during 2004-2006 and the second from the
   Entry Sports Utility segment in the Los Angeles DMA during the period
   2003-2005. We propose and implement a durability metric that is based on
   the over-time trajectory of used car prices and estimate a structural
   model of differentiated product demand with heterogeneous consumers who
   choose among new and used vehicles and consider durability in their
   choice decisions. Both datasets reveal that durability significantly
   impacts the demand for new and used vehicles with mean durability
   elasticities estimated to be about 1.7. Both datasets also show that the
   competition effect (85%) is significantly greater the cannibalization
   effect (15%). While the prior theoretical literature generally
   recommends that firms avoid cannibalization by reducing product
   durability, our findings imply that manufacturers who increase the
   durability of their products may see net sales gains as a result. (C)

AB With real time bidding, advertisers can decide how often (ad frequency)
   and in what time interval (ad recency) to show an ad to a specific user.
   Ads shown often and in quick succession might increase brand and ad
   recognition on the one hand but might annoy users on the other hand.
   These recognition and annoyance effects, in turn, can have opposing
   consequences for click-through rates (CTRs). Guided by theory and
   previous studies, we examine how the frequency (high vs. low) and the
   recency (small vs. large time intervals) of ad impressions relates to a
   banner's CTR and whether this is moderated by the campaign type (diverse
   or not), the brand's advertising expenditure (high vs. low), and the
   type of industry (selling durable vs. non-durable goods). To do so, we
   use a large data set containing information on 5.8 bn ad impressions and
   1.8 m clicks delivered for 158 different advertisers from 25 industries.
   We show that higher ad frequency and higher ad recency relate to a lower
   CTRs, especially when having a less diverse campaign, for brands which
   are spending more on advertising, and, to some extent, for firms selling
   durables. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Crowdfunding involves financing new ventures by relying on a large
   number of individual project backers who typically receive the venture's
   new product as a reward for their financial support. In three
   experimental studies, it is revealed that crowdfunding participation
   increases the extent to which consumers can personally connect to and
   identify with the focal venture compared to customers who merely buy the
   product in a classic market exchange setting (the baseline in our
   analysis). This identification process, which is rooted in the insight
   that one's financial contribution is perceived to be more meaningful to
   the focal venture, is also shown to trigger behavioral effects on
   important outcome variables such as increased subsequent consumption of
   the venture's products and more positive word-of-mouth behavior. The
   studies thus validate the idea that crowdfunding may be an effective
   tool to build strong(er) relationships with the venture's initial
   customer base. Hence, crowdfunding might not only answer the question
   "Where could I get funding from?" but also another: "Where can I
   effectively connect with my future customers?" The findings further
   point to interesting consequences for participating consumers: because
   the venture is more strongly perceived as theirs, this means that also
   the associations linked to it may rub off more strongly on their sense
   of self compared to customers who merely buy the same venture's product
   in a classic market exchange setting. Crowdfunding participation may
   thus more strongly effect a qualitative change in the consumer's
   self-concept. Senior Editor: Cait Lamberton Keywords: Crowdfunding

AB Several firms preannounce their price increases with the expectation
   that such announcements will be evaluated favorably by investors.
   However, little is known about the actual effect they have on
   shareholder value. Accordingly, the authors present the first systematic
   empirical examination of investors' evaluations of 274 price-increase
   preannouncements (PIPs). Results show that whereas the average increase
   in abnormal returns following a PIP is 0.51%, almost 41% of the PIPs
   result in negative abnormal returns. To explore this heterogeneity, the
   authors propose a conceptual framework that focuses on three key pieces
   of information that investors can use when evaluating a PIP: information
   on the nature (time to implementation and magnitude) of the preannounced
   price increase, the stated attribution for the preannounced price
   increase (demand and/or cost based), and information on prior PIP
   occurrences by the firm and its competitors. Results indicate that PIPs
   with greater time to implementation, higher own precedence and greater
   competitive precedence result in lower abnormal returns, while PIPs with
   higher magnitude and PIPs with an explicit demand attribution result in
   greater abnormal returns. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hidden Markov model (HMM) provides a framework to model the
   time-varying effects of marketing mix variables. When employed in a
   panel data context, it is important to properly account for unobserved
   heterogeneity across individuals. We propose a new random coefficients
   mixture HMM (RCMHMM) that allows for flexible patterns of unobserved
   heterogeneity in both the state-dependent and transition parameters. The
   RCMHMM nests all HMMs found in the marketing literature. Results of two
   simulation studies demonstrate that 1) averaging across a large number
   of different data generating processes, the RCMHMM outperforms all its
   nested versions using both in-sample and out-of-sample performance and
   2) the RCMHMM is more robust than its nested versions when underlying
   model assumptions are violated. In addition, we apply the RCMHMM to an
   empirical application where we examine the effectiveness of in-game
   promotions in increasing the short-term demand for Major League Baseball
   (MLB) attendance. We find that the effectiveness of four promotional
   categories varies over the course of the season and across teams and
   that the RCMHMM performs best. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB While mobile promotions have become increasingly popular in recent
   years, limited research has examined the effects of mobile promotions
   over time. This research investigates the effects of two popular types
   of promotional offers, price discount and non-price free sample coupons,
   on purchase behavior. To this end, we present a dynamic model of
   customer purchase behavior that incorporates time-varying effects of
   mobile coupons, enabling us to investigate both the short-term and
   longer-term effects of mobile promotions. Using transaction and mobile
   promotion data, we find that both price discount and free sample coupons
   increase customers' purchase likelihood and expenditures during the
   coupon redemption period. We also find that free sample coupons have an
   enduring effect that increases the purchase propensity beyond the
   promotion period, thereby contributing to incremental purchases over a
   longer period of time. We demonstrate how our approach can help

AB Consumers in today's world are confronted with the alarming consequences
   of unsustainable behavior such as pollution and resource degradation. In
   addition, they are facing increases in uncertainty due to external
   events such as economic crises and terror attacks. These two problems
   are central to consumers' lives, occur on a global scale, and have
   significant impact on the world's political, economic, environmental,
   and social landscapes. Contributing to research on persuasion and
   pro-social behavior, we show in four studies, conducted online, in the
   lab, and in the field, that these two problems are interconnected.
   Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that uncertainty leads to lower levels of
   sustainable behavior in comparison to certainty. Study 2 reveals in
   addition that this is due to the display of higher levels of temporal
   discounting under uncertainty (i.e., adopting a more immediate
   orientation). Finally, Studies 3 and 4 show that emphasizing the
   immediate benefits of sustainability during uncertainty reverses the
   negative effect and leads consumers to act more sustainably. Overall,
   these findings provide valuable implications for policy makers and

AB Nowadays, brand choice models are standard tools in quantitative
   marketing. In most applications, parameters representing brand
   intercepts and covariate effects are assumed to be constant over time.
   However, marketing theories, as well as the experience of marketing
   practitioners, suggest the existence of trends or short-term variations
   in particular parameters. Hence, having constant parameters over time is
   a highly restrictive assumption, which is not necessarily justified in a
   marketing context and may lead to biased inferences and misleading
   managerial insights.
   In this paper, we develop flexible, heterogeneous multinomial logit
   models based on penalized splines to estimate time-varying parameters.
   The estimation procedure is fully data-driven, determining the flexible
   function estimates and the corresponding degree of smoothness in a
   unified approach. The model flexibly accounts for parameter dynamics
   without any prior knowledge needed by the analyst or decision maker.
   Thus, we position our approach as an exploratory tool that can uncover
   interesting and managerially relevant parameter paths from the data
   without imposing assumptions on their shape and smoothness.
   Our approach further allows for heterogeneity in all parameters by
   additively decomposing parameter variation into time variation (at the
   population level) and cross-sectional heterogeneity (at the individual
   household level). It comprises models without time-varying parameters or
   heterogeneity, as well as random walk parameter evolutions used in
   recent state space models, as special cases. The results of our
   extensive model comparison suggest that models considering parameter
   dynamics and household heterogeneity outperform less complex models
   regarding fit and predictive validity. Although models with random walk
   dynamics for brand intercepts and covariate effects perform well, the
   proposed semiparametric approach still provides a higher predictive
   validity for two of the three data sets analyzed.
   For joint estimation of all regression coefficients and hyperparameters,
   we employ the publicly available software BayesX, making the proposed
   approach directly applicable. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Non-premium brands occasionally emulate their premium counterparts by
   using ads that emphasize premium characteristics such as superior
   performance and exclusivity. We define this practice as "advertising up"
   and develop hypotheses about its short- and long-term impact on
   advertising elasticity and brand equity respectively. We test the
   hypotheses in two large-scale empirical studies using a comprehensive
   dataset from the automotive industry that includes, among others, the
   content of 2317 television ads broadcast over a period of 45 months. The
   results indicate that advertising up increases (decreases) short-term
   advertising elasticity for non-premium products with a low (high) market
   share. The results also show that an intensive use of advertising up
   over time leads to long-term improvements (reductions) in brand equity
   for expensive (cheap) non-premium products. Furthermore, an inconsistent
   use of advertising up leads to reductions in brand equity. The results
   imply that managers of non-premium products with a low market share can
   use advertising up to increase advertising effectiveness in the short
   run. However, advertising up will only generate long-term improvements
   in brand equity for expensive non-premium products. Finally, to avoid
   long-term reductions in brand equity, advertising up should be
   consistently used over time. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   to switch brands or stores in response to features. This study proposes
   a 'Mixed-pattern Random-effects Nested Logit' (MRNL) model to analyse
   the effect of feature promotions in a multi-retailer multi-brand
   setting. Across 16 different CPG categories, our results reveal that in
   all cases a mixture of choice patterns prevails: about half of
   households exhibit a brand focus (i.e. rather substitute between stores
   offering that brand), the remaining half show evidence of a store focus
   (i.e. rather substitute brand offers within a visited store). We find
   that the size of the promotion lift and its underlying sources differ
   substantially between patterns. Brand-focused consumers are generally
   more responsive to feature ads than store-focused consumers - especially
   in low-concentration categories; while they imply much stronger
   cannibalization for the manufacturer, and much weaker cannibalization
   for the retailer. It follows that retailers reap much higher benefits in
   the brand-focused segment, while manufacturers may not prefer that
   segment in terms of net gains and must be wary of subsidizing those
   consumers. We identify household and category characteristics that
   underlie the choice patterns and offer opportunities for targeting. (C)

AB We introduce force in dynamic brand logos as a cue to brand work and
   subsequent brand energy; constructs we develop and distinguish from
   brand engagement. We argue the phenomenon observed is due to a brand
   work-energy effect, whereby the depiction of a drag force (opposite
   direction to motion) in brand logos enhances consumer judgments of brand
   work, which results in greater perceived brand energy. Taking a
   Newtonian physics lens, we argue that the presence of a drag force
   within a dynamic brand logo positively affects an individual's judgment
   of the brand's work (effort and trying hard) and brand's energy
   (momentum, power, and drive) and, subsequently, their brand attitude,
   purchase intention, and actual behavior. Across four experiments we
   manipulate brand logo design through the absence of force without motion
   (static logo), the absence of force with motion (kinematic logo), and
   the presence of force with motion (i.e., gravitational, spring, air
   resistance, and tension force; dynamic logo). Results demonstrate that
   the presence of a drag force in brand logos increases brand attitude and
   behavior. We demonstrate that brand work and brand energy, rather than
   brand engagement, sequentially explain attitudinal and behavioral
   judgments derived from brand logo drag force through a brand work-energy
   effect and a brand energy halo effect. We also determine that a thrust
   force of air propulsion results in attenuation of our brand work-energy
   effect, with high magnitude of a drag force enhancing the effect. (C)

AB Why do firms often advertise their current price together with their
   past price? Although consumers expect high quality products to have high
   prices, such firms may optimally charge lower prices when faced with low
   production costs. Thus in markets in which quality is difficult to
   ascertain and costs often fall over time, for example technology
   products, high quality firms may face a challenge of signaling their
   quality through current price alone. In this paper we develop a price
   signaling model in which uninformed consumers draw inference not only
   from the current price but also the prior period's price (the
   "strikethrough price") if the firm chooses to disclose it. We find that
   a high quality firm benefits from using strikethrough pricing when the
   prior probability of high quality is relatively low while the
   probability of costs falling is relatively high. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the face of declining business and growing pressures from low-cost
   competitors, many business-to-business (B2B) manufacturers have moved
   from their previously successful product centric strategies to more
   service-oriented business models. Yet despite their substantial
   investments in services, firms fail to understand the performance
   ramifications of these offerings. With a longitudinal data set
   (2001-2016) of 227 B2B manufacturers listed in the S&P 1500 index, this
   study disentangles the simultaneous effects of financial-based
   mechanisms that link the service ratio (i.e., share of a firm's revenue
   generated from selling services) to firm value. The findings reveal
   significant trade-offs across these mechanisms. Although the service
   ratio monotonously boosts sales growth, it has U-shaped curvilinear
   relationships with profitability and earnings volatility. These effects
   also depend on industry- and firm-level factors. Industry maturity
   positively moderates the effects of the service ratio on sales growth
   and profitability. However, business scope has an adverse effect on the
   service ratio-profitability relationship. Finally, industry turbulence
   negatively moderates the effect of services on earnings volatility. (C)

AB Instructional Manipulation Checks (IMCs) assess respondent behavior by,
   for example, asking participants not to answer a trick question. We find
   IMCs can be used to detect problematic response behavior in longitudinal
   surveys. This is important because a Latent Class Analysis based on
   IMC-failure in the two reported studies reveals that between 9% and 12%
   of respondents can be labelled Inattentive Stayers at the first
   survey-wave and between 13% and 17% at the third wave. The tendency of
   Inattentive Stayers to remain in the panel is particularly relevant for
   online panel services such as MTurk, with workers participating in many
   surveys over longer time-periods. We find IMC-failure to be mitigated by
   a warning to respondents that their attention will be checked early in
   the survey, but not by repeated exposure to IMCs, or a timer leaving
   questions on the screen longer. Respondent personality also plays a role
   in IMC-failure, which implies persistency of undesirable respondent
   behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growing use of storytelling as an advertising strategy for brands
   online poses the question of their relative effectiveness compared to
   more factual types of ads. In this context, this article focuses on the
   role of character identification and character type in the effects of
   narrative transportation that occur from storytelling ads. Using four
   experimental studies in two different contexts, two brand types, and two
   character types (human versus animal), the findings present a cautionary
   tale for the use of storytelling. By generating higher levels of
   narrative transportation, storytelling video ads can reduce character
   identification, which results in an overall decrease in positive
   attitude toward the brand, when using animal characters. These main
   findings are nuanced in the presence of joyful emotions. Implication for
   research and practice are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Our objective is to decompose the influence of the economic wealth on
   the time to sales take-off into a direct effect and an indirect effect
   through time to introduction. We use a traditional regression based and
   an advanced counterfactual framework for our analysis, based on adoption
   data for four generations of mobile phone from 172 countries. Our study
   extends the sales takeoff literature by better understanding how the
   commercialization stage (time to introduction) affects the confirmation
   stage (time to sales take-off) in innovation diffusion while controlling
   for local market structure, socio-economic, demographic and cultural
   variables suggested in the literature. We show that economic wealth
   exerts: a positive direct effect by shortening sales take-off time; a
   negative indirect effect by shortening time to introduction which tends
   to extend time to sales take-off. The uncovering of this relationship is
   achieved by treating time to introduction as a mediating variable,
   departing from previous studies where it is treated as an exogeneous
   variable. We further show that the negative indirect effect is diluted
   in the case of high income countries but not in the case of upper
   middle-income countries. A sensitivity analysis shows the robustness of
   our findings. Our findings will help firms develop optimal market entry
   strategies considering the resources available. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Endogeneity is a crucial problem in survey-based empirical research on
   marketing strategy (MS) and inter-organizational relationships (IORs);
   if not addressed, it can cause researchers to arrive at flawed
   conclusions and to offer poor advice to practitioners. Although the
   field is increasingly cognizant of endogeneity-related issues, many
   authors fail to properly address it, particularly in survey-based
   research. Emphasizing the role of essential heterogeneity, this article
   develops an overarching framework to help improve the understanding of
   endogeneity problems and how to tackle them when researchers use
   cross-sectional survey-based data The authors provide explanations of
   and advice for how MS and IOR researchers can address six "painful" and
   sometimes hidden decisions: 1) Do you have an endogeneity problem? 2)
   What technique/estimator is appropriate? 3) What instrumental variables
   (IVs) should be chosen? 4) How should Ns be evaluated empirically? 5)
   How should the results be interpreted and evaluated? and 6) What results
   should you report? The authors provide a practical flowchart to guide
   researchers in their efforts to address endogeneity-related concerns.

AB Researchers seeking to study the relationships between consumers'
   communications, attitudes, and behaviors could benefit from monitoring
   consumers over time, across multiple locations and channels, and in a
   way that reflects consumers' subjective perceptions. Diaries on
   smartphones (mobile diaries) can be used as a research tool for such
   purposes. A mobile diary is a self-report instrument whereby people use
   their mobile handset to repeatedly report experiences of interest.
   Mobile diaries are increasingly used in psychology, geography, medicine,
   and commercial marketing. Yet they have rarely been used for
   quantitative marketing research, and were not benchmarked against
   best-practice metrics in marketing.
   In this study, we aim to set the ground for using mobile diaries in
   quantitative marketing research. We first lay out the theoretical
   infrastructure for the usage of mobile diaries, and describe possible
   respondent reporting concerns, including concerns related to
   non-reporting, reporting over time, and concerns stemming from
   individual-level heterogeneity.
   We demonstrate the potential of mobile diaries, as well as the
   importance of the various concerns, using a benchmark test case in the
   context of primetime TV viewing. Our benchmark uses a sample of
   respondents with both mobile diary viewing reports and Nielsen People
   Meter (NPM) records. Our analysis reveals that averaging across all
   conditions, 47.4%-64.7% of the NPM records are reported by the diary.
   The major sources for mismatch are random time periods without alarms,
   short viewings, and periodic reporting inactivity (pulsing). Concerns
   such as a decrease in reporting rates over time (e.g., fatigue),
   smartphone ownership, and demographic variation across individuals have
   relatively small effects on reporting likelihood. Analyzing the cases in
   which diary reports do not have a matching NPM record, we find many of
   them can be attributed to out-of-home viewing and viewing on non-metered
   devices. This finding demonstrates how mobile diaries can complement
   metered measurements. Overall, aggregate diary-based ratings have a 0.90
   correlation with NPM ratings.
   We discuss implications for designing and using mobile diary studies in
   marketing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many categories, consumers purchase discrete quantities of multiple
   varieties. For example, when doing grocery shopping for cereals,
   consumers may purchase in each category three units of brand A, four of
   brand B, and one of brand C. These decisions are often influenced by
   nonlinear pricing strategies such as quantity discounts. Modeling such
   multiple-discrete choices is challenging, as they violate assumptions of
   standard choice models. In this research, the author introduces a
   computationally attractive choice model that simultaneously captures 1)
   variety, 2) discrete quantity, and 3) nonlinear pricing strategies, such
   as quantity discounts. The model assumes that consumers maximize variety
   of the choice outcome, while taking into account constraints on
   utilities of alternatives. Application of the proposed model to two
   datasets demonstrates the superior fit compared to several rival models.
   Counterfactual analyses demonstrate that the model is a valuable tool
   for assortment and pricing decisions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB An increasing number of consumers have come to patronize a hard
   discounter (HD) to save on their grocery budget. Given the HDs'
   rock-bottom prices, a complete switch from the traditional supermarket
   (TS) to the HD format would, indeed, substantially reduce grocery
   spending. However, consumers typically visit the HD on top of a TS,
   leading to a more complex purchase allocation and decision process. In
   addition to limiting the potential savings to part of the basket, these
   multiple store shopping patterns may therefore result in depletion of
   self-control resources and to self-licensing, consumers using realized
   savings to justify additional indulgent purchases. In this study, we
   explain and empirically analyze the effect of HD patronage on consumer
   spending, taking the selected shopping pattern (single versus multiple
   stores, visited on separate versus combined shopping trips) into
   account. To this end, we use scanner panel data on households' actual
   weekly purchase behavior. We also examine household differences in these
   effects, and relate them to household characteristics.
   Our results show that shifting the entire basket to the HD entails
   substantial savings. Yet, for the majority of consumers, adding a HD to
   the store set does not reduce grocery outlay: visiting the HD and TS on
   separate shopping trips leads to a "status quo", and visiting them on
   combined shopping trips even enhances weekly spending. While consumers
   pay less per unit bought at the HD, this is (more than) offset by the
   purchase of larger quantities across a broad range of product
   categories, and of more expensive items at the TS. Especially older
   consumers or larger households, and consumers who shop more frequently
   or are easily enticed by promotions, are bound to overspend. (C) 2018

AB Product harm information spreading in the marketplace may have profound
   consequences for companies, public policy makers and consumer
   well-being. However, limited research is available on what makes
   consumers share such information with others. This paper examines how
   self-relevance and self-construal affect the sharing of product harm
   information and the underlying processes that shape sharing. Five
   experiments demonstrate that under independent self-construal, highly
   self-relevant product harm information is less likely to be shared. The
   reluctance to share highly self-relevant information is attenuated under
   interdependent self-construal. The differential effects of
   self-construal are related to self-serving processes and motivations for
   sharing product harm information with others. The results apply to the
   sharing of negative information, but not positive information. Companies
   may use these findings to manage the diffusion of product harm
   information. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Does the real or imagined presence of friends invariantly drive
   consumers to engage in disinhibited behavior, and give in to the "urge
   to splurge" in the face of consumption temptations? Or might there be
   situations in which being with friends or even merely thinking of
   friends or the friendships we have with them can actually improve
   self-control?
   In five studies, using a unique combination of controlled experiments
   examining overt consumer behavior and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), we propose and show that the extent to which consumers
   identify a goal conflict between giving in to buying temptations on the
   one hand and the perceived consequences for maintaining satisfactory
   relationships with close friends on the other is a critical mediator of
   whether friendship reminders decrease or increase self-control. We
   further show that such a goal conflict is most likely for consumers with
   a chronic, compulsive tendency for uncontrolled, disinhibited
   acquisition and consumption-for consumers classified as compulsive
   buyers. For their non-compulsive counterparts, in contrast, acts of
   acquisition and consumption, even incidental disinhibited ones, are
   perceived to be less problematic in light of their friendships and hence
   do not induce a goal conflict to the same extent. Our findings provide
   insights into social influences on self-control and identify the concept
   of friendship reminders as a way to reduce a common type of
   dysfunctional consumer behavior. In addition to enhancing consumer
   well-being, reducing compulsive buying will substantially reduce
   handling costs for organizations. Hence, the findings are of academic,
   societal and managerial relevance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The population density of a geographical area has a well-known and
   strong positive effect on sales in the area. Yet, for some brands, there
   may be factors that affect the strength of this density-sales
   relationship. The present research shows that for product categories
   that consumers use to signal their identities (e.g., clothing,
   restaurants and cars), the strength of this relationship varies with
   brand commonness. Consumers residing in densely populated areas are
   motivated to express their distinctiveness by reducing their preference
   for identity relevant brands that are common, such as large chains and
   brands owned by many people. Thus, as identity-relevant brands become
   more common, they suffer from a "population penalty" a weakening of the
   positive effect of population density on sales. We show this effect with
   three experiments and two empirical analyses of automobile and alcohol
   sales. Our findings extend literature on distinctiveness theory by
   demonstrating these effects at the community level and provide insights
   for marketers on accounting and adjusting for this effect. (C) 2017

AB This paper aims to examine three purchase patterns which frequently
   occur in multiple-discrete choice situations: joint-purchase,
   quantity-preference, and quantity-concordance. First, "joint-purchase"
   refers to the tendency that two products are either purchased together
   or separately. Second, "quantity-preference" refers to the tendency to
   purchase a product in preferred amounts. Third, "quantity-concordance"
   refers to the tendency that purchase quantities of two products are
   either concordant or discordant. These patterns are mainly attributed to
   unobserved factors such as economic reasons, habits, time pressure,
   mood, and/or physical environment. No study has fully incorporated the
   three purchase patterns simultaneously. In this study, we develop a
   unified copula-based approach which can incorporate all the three
   purchase patterns simultaneously.
   The proposed approach is so flexible that any copula function or
   parametric distribution can be used. We use a simulation study to
   illustrate the trade-off between the Gaussian copula and the FGM copula.
   We show the Gaussian copula which captures the full range of
   correlations quickly becomes infeasible as the number of choice
   alternatives increases. On the contrary, the FGM copula substantially
   reduces the computational complexity and is scalable to larger
   dimensions. Furthermore, we extend the range of correlations of the FGM
   copula at almost no cost by introducing the sine generating function. To
   show the scalability, we apply this approach to IRI scanner panel data
   with 13 alternatives. Throughout two empirical studies, we show that the
   three purchase patterns indeed exist in our data. Moreover, we find that
   ignoring the three purchase patterns distorts key managerial metrics
   such as demand predictions and price elasticities. This results in
   suboptimal managerial decisions regarding peelies promotions, bundling,
   and package size. Furthermore, we illustrate that managers can improve
   the profitability of promotions by implementing a joint promotion
   strategy based on the three purchase patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pressure to manage complex and dynamic brand portfolios has posed a
   serious challenge for firms in protecting their brand identity and
   retaining loyal customers. To help firms overcome this challenge, the
   authors propose the new construct of brand portfolio coherence (BPC) to
   describe consumers' perceptions that (sub-)brands in a brand portfolio
   share a common underlying logic of features reflected in design,
   personality, and status. Through three comprehensive studies, the
   research develops and validates a multi-dimensional measure of BPC and
   differentiates it from relevant constructs, such as brand fit,
   connection, positioning, trust, and loyalty. Nomological examination
   shows that perceived BPC improves (re)purchase decisions with regard to
   brands in the portfolio. Furthermore, the research uncovers the
   mechanisms through which BPC exerts its impact and identifies customer-,
   product-, and brand strategy-related boundaries of the effect. Overall,
   the BPC construct and measure offer useful tools and managerial
   implications for firms to effectively manage brand portfolios to retain
   and grow customer base. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the influence of social power on consumers'
   propensity to defer choice. Based on the notion that elevated power
   reduces regret anticipation the fear of making a wrong choice it is
   proposed that power influences the extent of choice deferral by reducing
   consumers' susceptibility to anticipated regret. Because of the
   regret-based mechanism, power can increase or decrease consumers'
   propensity to defer choice, depending upon the situational factors that
   are associated with anticipated regret, such as salience of regret,
   outcome reversibility (e.g., return policy), and locus-of-regret
   (postponing vs. choosing now). Using different manipulations of power,
   seven studies provide consistent support for the proposed effects and
   show that situational factors and marketing strategies can induce, turn
   off, or even reverse the effect of power on deferral. Theoretical
   contributions and managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2017

AB Sequels have become a profitable strategy in the U.S. motion picture
   industry because of their strong name recognition. However, while the
   established positioning of a sequel may help insulate it from competing
   firms' advertising messages, its familiarity may, cause moviegoers to be
   more easily satiated with advertising from the sequel. Therefore, this
   study examines how sequels differ from original concept movies in terms
   of their ad effectiveness. We focus our analysis on pre-launch periods,
   given these periods' importance in shaping the financial outcomes of
   motion pictures. We consider the weekly online search volume of a movie
   as a measure of consumer interest in it, and thus as an intermediate
   response to pre-launch advertising. We then develop a model that assumes
   ad effectiveness can decline, due to copy and repetition wearout, and
   increase, due to forgetting, over time. We find that copy wearout is
   greater for original movies, while repetition wearout and forgetting are
   greater for sequels. These findings suggest that sequels should allocate
   more in early pre-launch periods and less immediately before release,
   relative to originals, to maximize pre-launch consumer interest. (C)

AB This research documents a novel effect of ambient lighting on consumer
   choice. We propose and find that ambient darkness (vs. brightness) can
   result in consumers feeling disconnected from others. As a result,
   consumers become more authentic in their choices and they choose hedonic
   over utilitarian options because these choices reflect what they truly
   want (Study 1). Past research had suggested darkness increases hedonic
   choice by making choice less observable, but we find this effect emerges
   even when the choice is already anonymous and darkness cannot further
   increase anonymity. Rather, feeling disconnected from others and less
   weight to social norms heightened self-authenticity in darker (vs.
   brighter) surroundings (Study 2). When consumers are reminded of social
   connection, this difference is attenuated (Study 3). Thus, consumers
   making hedonic choices regulate their choices when reminded of their
   social connections. Implications of these findings and possible
   extensions are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Customers' post-service sharing of information (PSSI) occurs with a
   range of social ties typically conceptualized in terms of closeness/tie
   strength. We extend this research by orthogonally crossing the dimension
   of closeness with exchange to define close, exchange, and hybrid ties.
   Study 1, a survey of actual PSSI behavior, supports our
   conceptualization regarding the dimensions of closeness and exchange
   defining audiences for PSSI. Study 2, a survey of PSSI intentions,
   further supports the significance of this extended conceptualization by
   showing that a model with close, exchange, and hybrid ties has a
   significantly better fit than a model with only close ties. We provide
   further evidence of the significance of these three ties by showing that
   service outcome and process have distinct effects on PSSI to each social
   tie. Satisfaction has a non-linear effect on PSSI to close ties, and
   positive and negative linear effects on exchange and hybrid ties
   respectively. Further, satisfaction is the sole predictor of PSSI to
   close ties, whereas satisfaction, provider status and customer power
   interactively drive PSSI to exchange and hybrid ties. Thus, considering
   close, exchange, and hybrid ties enables a more comprehensive
   understanding of PSSI. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB While consumers and marketers perpetuate the lay theory that indulging
   with a reason is more pleasurable and makes everyone happier, this
   research identifies a condition under which indulging without a reason
   "feels right" and produces a more positive emotional reaction. The
   authors show that indulging with or without a reason and consumers'
   trait self-control interact to influence happiness felt following an
   indulgent purchase. While high self-control consumers are happier when
   they have a reason to buy indulgent products (e.g., when they can
   justify the indulgence), low self-control consumers are happier when
   they do not have a reason to indulge. That is, indulging with a reason
   is less pleasurable for consumers with low self-control. This effect on
   happiness has an impact on downstream judgments about the product and
   yields important implications for consumer welfare as well as marketing
   managers. Across four studies we show the effect on consumption
   happiness, examine consequences of the effect, and report evidence for
   the underlying process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The adverse consequences of measurement unreliability on statistical
   issues (e.g., inconsistency, attenuation bias) are well known. Yet there
   exists sparse literature, if any, on how unreliable metrics affect
   strategic marketing decisions: optimal marketing budget, its optimal
   allocation to advertising and promotions, and overspending.
   Consequently, researchers and managers do not know: How to estimate
   dynamic demand models using unreliable data? How to optimally combine
   multiple noisy and biased metrics? How to optimally set the total
   marketing budget and optimally allocate it to advertising and promotions
   activities using unreliable sales metrics? To answer these open
   questions, first, based on Kalman filtering theory, we show how to
   estimate and infer dynamic demand models using unreliable sales metrics.
   Then; we furnish evidence of significant measurement noise in both
   retail audit and company's internal data to track brand sales. We
   replicate these results across six largest political regions in the
   emerging Indian markets for a major hair care brand. Next, we
   analytically derive the optimal weights to combine noisy and biased
   metrics to infer the latent demand. This result uncovers a
   counter-intuitive insight that two independent noisy metrics are better
   than one even when the second metric is noisier. In other words, a
   composite metric serves as noise reduction device as it is more reliable
   than individual noisy metrics. Subsequently, we derive closed-form
   expressions for the optimal budget and its optimal allocation to
   advertising and promotions activities in the presence of unreliable
   sales metrics. Based on these results, we discover that marketing
   overspending increase as metrics unreliability increases. Furthermore,
   overconfidence the presumption that the metrics are reliable leads to
   overspending on advertising and promotions. Managers should reduce
   advertising and promotional spending when sales metrics are noisy.
   Finally, we provide a simple correction factor that managers can use to
   eliminate overspending. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   test based on likelihood ratio principles to complement the RegCoeff
   approach. We compare the new test's performance to conventional methods
   that use PROCESS, MEDIATION, and extensions thereof to categorical
   measures. Our tests address situations in which the assumptions of
   current methods tend not to hold; that is when one or more variables may
   be categorical or relationships among constructs may be nonlinear. In
   such environments, results significantly favor the new test, which we
   call LRT for likelihood ratio test. For example, among 72 tests of
   power, LRT loses just 9 times to PROCESS. It wins outright in 45 cases
   and ties in 18 others. Differences are non-trivial; they are
   statistically significant at the 0.001 level in 21 of the 45 wins. To

AB To promote services and products, marketers often prompt consumers'

   "Imagine yourself here"). Yet, previous research shows that these
   appeals are ineffective among consumers with lower imagery ability who
   find it difficult to imagine the scenes presented in the advertisement.
   In five studies, we show that this difficulty of imagination associated
   with lower imagery ability and the consequent ineffectiveness of imagery
   appeals can be overcome through process priming and, specifically, by
   positioning ads that include imagery appeals after stimuli that trigger
   (i.e., prime) imagery processing. These findings provide a practical
   solution to the downside of imagery appeals and document a new effect of
   process priming. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that, in

AB There is strong empirical evidence that consumers discount at
   significantly higher rates than firms. Yet, most research abstracts from
   the effect of discount rates on marketing decisions such as pricing. We
   study the effects of a consumers' discount rate that is higher than a
   firm's discount rate on prices, profits and consumer surplus of
   complementary products in four competitive settings and an infinite time
   setting: the firm is a monopolist or competes in the durable market and
   either ties the consumable to the durable or sells untied products. Our
   analysis yields five main results: First, a higher time preference of
   consumers than the firm never increases the optimal durable price and
   never decreases the optimal consumable price. Second, the optimal
   consumable price of tied goods is always higher than the optimal
   consumable price of untied goods, whereas the optimal durable price is
   always higher when goods are untied. Third, a higher time preference of
   consumers than the firm never increases profit, always decreases
   consumer surplus and, as a result, always decreases welfare. Fourth, the
   ability of the firm to commit to future prices and of consumers to
   commit to future purchases benefits both consumers and the firm. Fifth,
   if the firm competes in the durable market, then tying increases
   consumer surplus when consumers commit to purchasing the consumable. We
   discuss the implications of our results for firms' pricing strategies.

AB Many firms apply "customer demarketing" strategies and dismiss
   unprofitable customers. However, empirical research on the consequences
   of dismissing customers is scarce. We address this research gap and
   develop and empirically analyze a theoretical framework of consumer
   reactions to customer demarketing based on the theory of dual
   entitlement. We conduct seven experiments in which we identify the main
   effect of observing customer demarketing and analyze several moderating
   and mediating factors. In addition, we use a field study to illustrate
   the consequences of experiencing a contract termination in a real-world
   setting, in which a firm terminated contracts for >10.000 customers. The
   results show that consumers disapprove of customer demarketing,
   regardless of whether they experience it themselves or only observe it,
   regardless of the responsibility for the cause of the contract
   termination, and regardless of the social proximity to the dismissed
   customers. The effect is, however, somewhat weaker if customer
   demarketing is perceived to be a common occurrence, if alternative
   offers are made, and if the financial cause is framed as a loss.
   Furthermore, firms can dampen the negative effect of customer
   demarketing by offering substantial monetary compensation to dismissed
   customers. We identify perceived fairness of the firm's behavior as the
   underlying process that causes the negative effects of customer
   demarketing, and this also holds when we control for potential
   alternative mediators (i.e., warmth and competence perceptions). (C)

AB This research investigates the interplay between brand anthropomorphism
   and self-construal on evaluations of distributive and procedural
   justice. We show that consumers with independent self-construal, who
   value equitable exchanges in their relationships with others, react more
   negatively to instances of distributive injustice when a brand is
   anthropomorphized (vs. non-anthropomorphized). In contrast, we find that
   consumers with interdependent self-construal, who focus on the needs of
   others, react less negatively to situations of distributive injustice
   when a brand is anthropomorphized (vs. non -anthropomorphized). However,
   because fair procedures signal acceptance by others, we show that
   interdependents evaluate procedural injustice particularly negatively in
   the instances of brand anthropomorphism. We offer indepth insights into
   the interplay between brand anthropomorphism and self-construal in

   perceived marketplace injustice when a brand is anthropomorphized (vs.

AB Marketers increasingly seek to build brand advocacy not only via
   traditional word of mouth (in-person WOM) but also by engaging their
   (loyal) customers via online media (eWOM). In a survey and three
   follow-up experiments, however, we show that brand loyalty is less
   positively related to spreading eWOM than in-person WOM (Studies 1-3).
   We find that loyal consumers' willingness to engage in eWOM increases
   when they are motivated to signal their identity through a brand (i.e.,
   high self-brand connection in Studies 1-3) or to help a brand (Study 4).
   Our findings support the notion that online communication spreads faster
   and is less spontaneous and more deliberate than face-to-face
   communication. In turn, loyal consumers need strong motivation tied to
   the brand to engage in eWOM. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is now common for consumers to mourn and commemorate deceased
   celebrities on social networking sites (SNS). In addition to grieving
   messages, however, celebrities' posthumous SNS increasingly include
   promotional content; late celebrities, from Marilyn Monroe to David
   Bowie, regularly tweet or post promotional messages from the afterlife.
   The aim of this paper is to explore consumer attitudes toward marketing
   communication in a posthumous environment. Prior research has
   consistently documented consumers' rejection of marketing activities in
   other sacred environments. By investigating the interaction effect of
   celebrity attachment (fans vs. non-fans) and death salience on
   celebrities' posthumous SNS, this research is the first to identify a
   positive response to marketing communication in a sacred environment.
   Three experimental studies demonstrate that although both fans and
   non-fans react negatively to promotional messages when death is salient,
   over time, celebrity attachment diminishes death salience and fosters a
   positive response of fans toward promotional messages on celebrities'
   posthumous SNS. Celebrity attachment may favor artificial immortality
   and, as such, distance the late celebrity from death-related thoughts.

AB This study investigates the role of elite loyalty program members in
   influencing other customers to adopt a hierarchical loyalty program (or
   HLP) in a business market. Drawing from the social psychology
   literature, the theoretical framework proposes that elite status members
   exert a disproportionate positive influence on neighboring non-members
   to adopt the HLP, and that this social influence has an inverse U-shaped
   effect. A unique dataset from a B2B loyalty program of a firm in the
   agribusiness industry with detailed information on members and marketing
   efforts from 1378 zip codes in Germany from 2008 to 2012 is used for the
   analysis. The study finds that compared to members in lower status,
   elite status members have a stronger social influence on non-members.
   Importantly, as the proportion of elite status members increases, the
   adoption probability of non-members increases. However, as the fraction
   of elite status members increases beyond a certain point, the adoption
   probability of non-members decreases. Overall, the results of this study
   advances our understanding of loyalty programs in B2B markets,
   particularly with regard to the drivers of loyalty program adoption and
   the role played by social influence in driving new member enrollment.

AB Service employees frequently must enforce rules upon their customers to
   mitigate dysfunctional customer behavior and ensure proper service
   delivery (e.g., enforce "fasten seatbelt" signs on flights). However,
   the consequences of enforcing service rules (ESR) are not well
   understood. To elucidate the effect of ESR, the authors present seven
   studies involving >6800 customers and consisting of cross-sectional and
   longitudinal data from customer surveys and company records as well as
   experiments. The results indicate that ESR exerts ambivalent effects:
   customers who experience ESR directed at other customers perceive
   service employees as more competent, which increases customer loyalty.
   However, if ESR is directed at customers themselves, they perceive a
   self-concept threat, leading them to devalue service employees' warmth
   and competence and to become less loyal. The effects of ESR hinge on a
   number of factors, including the harm that dysfunctional behavior
   potentially causes, the way ESR is communicated, and customers'
   experience with the service situation. Furthermore, the authors show
   that service employees can alleviate the negative effects of ESR by
   communicating service rules in advance and justifying ESR appropriately.

AB Data sharing is a strategically important marketing initiative in many
   industries. Increasingly, companies seek to enhance the value of their
   customer data by supplementing this information with customer-level
   information from another company. However, this arrangement requires one
   company to reveal its customer-level data to another and face privacy
   risks which may result in substantial losses in brand value, customer
   trust, and competitive advantage, or legal penalties from not conforming
   to regulations. To overcome this problem, we propose a
   decision-theoretic approach for use by companies to protect their
   customer segmentation data prior to entering into collaborative
   arrangements. Our approach extends the literature because it allows the
   data provider to protect all customer segmentation data at the
   individual customer level instead of only at the aggregate level. We
   show that the optimal data protection strategy depends on a risk-return
   tradeoff based on the probabilities of misclassification of customers
   into segments, the opportunity costs of erroneously assigning segment
   membership, and the anticipated cost of a data breach. (C) 2017 Elsevier

AB Marketing actions frequently create long-term value yet this is often
   not recorded in financial accounts. The same records are typically used
   for internal reporting limiting both recognition of the value created by
   marketing, and accountability for the misuse of market-based assets.
   Creating comprehensive "marketing accounts" can mitigate the problems
   caused by financial accounting's omission of market-based assets. We
   explain current accounting practice, outline the idea of marketing
   accounts, and contrast this with current accounting practice.
   Marketing accounts capture the value of market-based assets, applying
   accounting's matching concept as consistently as possible to treat
   marketing as an investment where appropriate. These accounts are based
   upon expected value, and are feasible within accounting rules given they
   aim only to aid management, not investor, decision making. Marketing
   accounts vary between, but not within, firms, and are comprehensive and
   regular. Finally, they are controlled by marketers with assumptions and
   models recorded and approved by the chief marketing officer.
   We conclude by illustrating how to implement marketing accounts. (C)

AB Media publisher platforms often face an effectiveness-nuisance tradeoff:
   more annoying ads can be more effective for some advertisers because of
   their ability to attract attention, but after attracting viewers'
   attention, their nuisance to viewers can decrease engagement with the
   platform over time. With the rise of mobile technology and ad blockers,
   many platforms are becoming increasingly concerned about how to improve
   monetization through digital ads while improving viewer experience.
   We study an online ad auction mechanism that incorporates a charge for
   ad impact on user experience as a criterion for ad selection and
   pricing. Like a Pigovian tax, the charge causes advertisers to
   internalize the hidden cost of foregone future platform revenue due to
   ad impact on user experience. Over time, the mechanism provides an
   incentive for advertisers to develop ads that are effective while
   offering viewers a more pleasant experience. We show that adopting the
   mechanism can simultaneously benefit the publisher, advertisers, and
   viewers, even in the short term.
   Incorporating a charge for ad impact can increase expected advertiser
   profits if enough advertisers compete. A stronger effectiveness-nuisance
   tradeoff, meaning that ad effectiveness is more strongly associated with
   negative impact on user experience, increases the amount of competition
   required for the mechanism to benefit advertisers. The findings suggest
   that the mechanism can benefit the marketplace for ad slots that
   consistently attract many advertisers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Most event studies rely on cumulative abnormal returns, measured as
   percentage changes in stock prices, as their dependent variable. Stock
   price reflects the value of the operating business plus non-operating
   assets minus debt. Yet, many events, in particular in marketing, only
   influence the value of the operating business, but not non-operating
   assets and debt. For these cases, the authors argue that the cumulative
   abnormal return on the operating business, defined as the ratio between
   the cumulative abnormal return on stock price and the firm specific
   leverage effect, is a more appropriate dependent variable. Ignoring the
   differences in firm-specific leverage effects inflates the impact of
   observations pertaining to firms with large debt and deflates those
   pertaining to firms with large non-operating assets. Observations of
   firms with high debt receive several times the weight attributed to
   firms with low debt. A simulation study and the reanalysis of three
   previously published marketing event studies shows that ignoring the
   firm-specific leverage effects influences an event study's results in
   unpredictable ways. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   differences within immigrant groups. It extends the analysis over the
   first three generations of immigrants and contrasts the results across
   two immigrant groups. The findings indicate a negative relationship
   between religiosity and materialism and underscore the accentuating
   effect of ethnic identification on that relationship. They also expose
   pendulum-like trends across the three generations in both groups.
   Whereas ethnic identification and materialism decline from the first to
   the second generation of immigrants and resurge among the third
   generation (a U-shape trend), religiosity moves in the opposite
   direction (an inverted U-shape trend). These findings comprise an
   initial, exploratory precursor to Inter-Generational Pendula (IGP), a
   new theory of immigrant identity, materialism, and religiosity. They
   attest to the heterogeneity within each immigrant group and are germane

   advertising has a dynamic impact on the goodwill that affects market
   demand, interacts with the price competition in a manufacturer-retailer
   channel. Specifically, we examine the strategic choices made by
   manufacturers, the role of the retailer in exacerbating or mitigating
   competition among manufacturers, the total channel profit and how that
   is split among the different players. Using prices, sales, and
   advertising data in the laundry detergent category we find that
   advertising and pricing are strategic complements as manufacturer
   advertising increases the price elasticity of demand; advertising
   competition intensifies price competition but it also improves the
   profitability of manufacturers; the presence of retailers in the channel
   leads to increased advertising spending while mitigating the extent of
   price competition. Manufacturers can enjoy a higher profit from using
   retailers when they compete in both price and advertising. Finally, we
   show that the emergence of ecommerce, which enables manufacturers
   directly selling to end consumers, has asymmetric profit impacts on
   manufacturers, as brands with lower cost and lower brand goodwill are
   more benefited from ecommerce. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB We examine how corporate social responsibility (CSR) interacts with firm
   strategy, particularly product quality and price. In monopoly markets
   where consumers are willing to pay a premium for CSR and firms choose
   CSR optimally, we find that CSR is a substitute for product quality
   (i.e., lower quality firms invest more in CSR) under common market
   conditions such as when there is a sizable segment of consumers who
   value product quality higher than other consumers. We show that this
   relationship between CSR and product quality further extends to
   competitive markets. Specifically, in a duopoly where the quality
   differentiation is sufficiently large, the high quality product is
   offered with a lower level of CSR than the low quality product.
   Consistent with the theory, we report preliminary empirical evidence
   that suggests high end brands are significantly less likely than
   mainstream brands to acquire a strong CSR reputation. Overall, our
   research shows that the optimal commitment to CSR may vary depending on
   other elements of firm strategy such as pricing and product quality as
   well as market characteristics such as market composition, competition

AB Although choosing from large assortments has often been found to be
   demotivating, a robust finding in the marketing literature is that
   consumers generally prefer larger product assortments. Standard
   explanations for this preference for larger assortments have focused on
   reason-based considerations revolving around large assortments enabling
   potentially "better" choices. This paper offers a different and novel,
   affect-based explanation. We argue that the relative preference for
   larger assortments is driven in part by the greater experience utility
   that consumers derive from reviewing such assortments. Because most
   products are carriers of positive affect, consumers tend to derive
   greater experience utility from reviewing larger assortments compared to
   smaller assortments. Support for this general proposition was found
   across four experimental studies using different strategies to document
   the role of affect-based experience utility in driving the preference
   for larger assortments. Theoretical and substantive implications are
   discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   distributions. A more recent approach to capture heterogeneity is the
   Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model and its predecessor Dirichlet

AB The expansion of the Internet and social media have triggered a
   differentiation of the word-of-mouth (WOM) concept, with consumer
   communication about brands and products now taking place in various
   settings and forms. Two important digital WOM types are microblogs and
   consumer reviews. To clarify their differential roles for product
   success, this study offers a theoretical framework of the influence of
   these two types of WOM, drawing from consumer information search theory
   and diffusion theory. The tests of the proposed framework use a
   longitudinal data set of video game sales and weekly information
   gathered from microblogs (i.e., over 13 million tweets from Twitter) and
   consumer reviews (i.e., more than 17,000 Amazon consumer reviews).
   Analyzing a system of equations provides evidence that the influence of
   microblogs and consumer reviews on new product success changes over
   time. Prior to launch, the volumes of microblogs and consumer reviews,
   together with advertising, represent primary sales drivers. After
   launch, the volume of microblogs is initially influential, then loses
   impact, whereas the impact of the volume of consumer reviews continues
   to grow. The valence of consumer reviews gains significance only near
   the end of the observation period, but the valence of microblogging is
   never influential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the large body of research that has investigated the effect of
   ad appeals of television advertisements on consumers' internal responses
   and behavior, our understanding of how different ad appeals are
   processed remains limited. Complementing existing literature with novel
   insights from neuroimaging techniques can be valuable, providing more
   immediate insights into implicit mental processes. The present study
   explores the neural responses to functional and experiential executional
   elements in television advertisements by using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Comparing a unique set of different
   commercials for the same brand enabled examination of the influence of
   differences in ad appeal on brain responses and subsequent advertisement
   effectiveness. Findings show that functional and experiential
   executional elements engage different brain areas, associated with
   lower- and higher-level cognitive processes, and that the extent to
   which these particular brain areas are activated is associated with
   higher ad effectiveness. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Charities often suggest specific donation amounts in their fundraising
   appeals, and the assimilation-contrast theory has been well-established
   as the explanation behind the impact of such anchors on donors'
   behavior. Yet, researchers who tested it in field studies have reported
   contradictory findings, and despite its proven reliability in the labs,
   this theory has had limited impact on managerial practice. Drawing on
   multiple streams of research, we develop a multi-step strategy to
   operationalize the assimilation-contrast theory in a fundraising
   context, and report the results of a large field experiment in which a
   charity used anchors to influence the behavior of 23,500 of its donors.
   We found that average donation amount increased by 22% and net margins
   increased by 36%. We report as one of the key managerial implications
   that the effects of the assimilation-contrast theory are largely
   asymmetric, implying that it is far easier for a firm to nudge customers
   in the direction of increased losses than in the direction of increased
   profit. We conclude by offering decision heuristics to those managers
   who do not have the resources to build an econometric model, but wish
   nonetheless to benefit from our findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Rewarding existing customers for the recruitment of new ones has become
   an increasingly popular acquisition tool for companies. However, when a
   company rewards the recruitment of a new customer, managers are unaware
   of whether the rewarded referral was actually necessary or whether
   "reward-scrounging" has occurred because the referral receiver would
   have converted anyway. As a consequence, companies risk overestimating
   the effectiveness of their referral programs, which is why gaining
   insights into how and when reward-scrounging occurs is crucial. In this
   study, we employ a large data set from the telecommunications industry
   to analyze the drivers of reward-scrounging. The results indicate that
   reward-scrounging reduces the effectiveness of referral reward programs
   over time and that its likelihood depends on both the referral sender's
   network position and the company's marketing activities. The findings
   are used to develop managerial means to alleviate the negative effects
   of reward-scrounging. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several studies suggest that products with a distinctive exterior design
   outperform products without differentiating aesthetics. So far, a
   product's design newness has been assessed by a comparison to the design
   of competing products. Drawing on categorization theory, we argue that
   two additional perspectives are important: design newness with respect
   to the product's brand portfolio and that with respect to the product's
   predecessor. Results of an empirical study in the domain of cars confirm
   that all three perspectives of design newness have different and
   significant sales effects. Consumers' tolerance for newness is found to
   be most conservative within the predecessor perspective, followed by
   moderate levels of newness in the brand portfolio perspective and high
   levels in the competitor perspective. To maximize performance,
   manufacturers should therefore develop designs that have high novelty
   compared to the competitive set and are moderately novel compared to the
   brand's product portfolio and to the preceding model generation. A
   second empirical application in the context of smart phones confirms
   these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Consumers are increasingly consulting online consumer reviews prior to
   purchase. This research seeks to deepen our understanding of how
   consumers utilize online reviews by examining the interplay between
   review valence (average rating) and variance in the context of intrinsic
   and extrinsic cues. We begin by demonstrating that consumers who
   consider review valence or variance in isolation are prone to making
   incorrect inferences about the other decision cue. Results further show
   that higher levels of review variance lower purchase intentions to a
   greater extent for utilitarian versus hedonic products and that these
   effects are amplified for negatively valenced products. Further, the
   interaction effect between review variance and reviewer ratings on
   purchase intention is found-to be mediated by decision confidence. With
   two additional experiments we explore the influence of extrinsic cues in
   the form of brand equity and reviewer credibility. We find that when
   review variance is high, the influence of reviewer credibility on
   consumers' purchase intentions is moderated by brand equity. When brand
   equity is high, reviewer credibility does not influence consumers'
   purchase intentions; however when brand equity is low, reviewer
   credibility emerges as a significant diagnostic cue. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB Different package designs call for different ways of revealing the

   unveiling the removal of the cover of a concealed, stationary object
   enhances the perceived value of the product compared to other forms of
   product revelation. Drawing on theories of grounded associations, shared
   meaning, and contagion, we theorize that the act of unveiling is
   associated with revealing a protected and thus pristine object, which is
   consequently perceived to be valuable. We begin the empirical
   investigation by exploring consumer associations with product unveiling
   across American and South Korean consumers (pilot study 1). We then
   demonstrate that the unveiling effect arises with both imagined (pilot
   study 2) and real objects and is mediated by beliefs about the pristine

AB Movie industry experts continuously debate whether the industry's
   enormous investments in stars pay off. Although a rich body of research
   has addressed the question of whether stars are critical to the success
   of movies, previous research does not provide a consistent picture of
   the impact of stars on the economic success of the respective product.
   To derive empirical generalizations, the authors (1) provide a
   meta-analysis of the relationship between star power and movie success
   based on 61 primary studies reporting 172 effects of star power on movie
   success and (2) analyze a comprehensive dataset from that industry with
   n = 1545 movies using two different types of star power measures
   (commercial and artistic success), while controlling for selection
   effects of stars: Based on these two studies, four empirical
   generalizations emerge. First, when ignoring selection effects of stars,
   the impact of star power on box office revenues is strongly upwards
   biased. Second, artistic star power is associated with significantly
   lower box office revenues than commercial star power. Third, on average,
   movies with a commercially successful star generate 12.46 million US$
   additional box office revenues. In contrast, artistic star power does
   not result in a statistically significant revenue premium. Fourth,
   commercially (artistically) successful stars have a statistically
   significant "multiplier effect" of 1.127 (1.083) on other
   characteristics that influence a movie's box office revenues. (C) 2016

AB Spanning the boundary between the organization and external market
   participants, the sales force is in an advantaged position to garner
   unique market insights. At the same time the sales force has a pivotal
   role in bringing new products to the market as vendors following their
   own adoption. The present study reunites the literature that has
   previously considered the sales force either in their role as
   facilitators of market insights or as vendors of new products by
   proposing a mediating effects framework that explicitly examines the
   sales force in their dual role. Data collected from 609 firms provide
   evidence that the utilization of the sales force's insights for new
   product development, referred to as sales force integration, engenders
   new product success. The authors focus in particular on the examination
   of the input-output transformation process by studying multiple
   mediation paths through which sales force integration brings about new
   product success via new product advantages and sales force new product
   adoption. The effectiveness of sales force integration is highly
   contingent upon factors including information quality, timing,
   non-monetary sales force incentives, innovation degree, and competitive
   intensity. This study discusses how managers should act to fully benefit
   from the impact of sales force integration on new product success. (C)

AB The use of contextual advertising, defined as the delivery of ads in
   related editorial contents, is expected to grow in the television
   industry due to the development of new technologies. However, the impact
   of this practice on behavioral consumer responses remains elusive. Using
   data from an online price comparison company, we study the short- and
   long-term effects of contextual television advertising on consumers'
   online conversions. We find that contextual ads have a higher immediate
   effect than non-contextual ads on consumers' responses for the product
   that is related to the context. However, both effects are similar in the
   long term. Additionally, our results suggest that the total impact of
   contextual advertising can be smaller than the net impact of neutral
   advertising due to a "spillover inhibition effect": Compared with ads
   placed in neutral contexts, contextual ads generate fewer online
   conversions for products that are unrelated to the context. Our findings
   stress the importance of assessing the long-term impact of contextual
   advertising on the product portfolio, rather than just on the
   context-related product. Failing to do so could lead to advertising
   allocation decisions with lower returns on investment (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB Consumers often give advice by recommending products and services to one
   another. The present research explores the idea that advice giving
   sometimes reflects a self-serving desire to compensate for a loss of
   control. Four experiments provide convergent evidence for a phenomenon
   we term compensatory word of mouth, whereby consumers' communications
   contain advice fueled by their own need to restore control. Experiment 1
   explores the potential practical relevance of this idea by showing that
   advertising messages can threaten consumers' sense of control and
   increase advice giving in word-of-mouth communications. Experiment 2
   uses a different paradigm and further demonstrates that a threat to
   consumers' sense of control increases advice giving. As additional
   evidence of a compensatory account, Experiment 3 finds that threatened
   individuals' propensity to give advice is attenuated when they are first
   given an alternative means to restore a sense of control. Finally,
   Experiment 4 demonstrates that advice giving can serve a compensatory
   function by instilling a greater sense of competence that enhances
   consumers' feelings of control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Many consumer markets are becoming increasingly complex. In particular,
   as variety of products and product features proliferate, choosing is
   becoming a time consuming task for consumers. In response, consumers
   apply simplifying screening heuristics. However, established
   choice-based conjoint methods are challenged when consumers follow such
   decision rules. In particular, individual-level estimates of
   hierarchical Bayesian techniques (CBC-HB) cannot fully account for all
   possible heuristics applied by consumers. This research conducts a
   comprehensive comparison of four different indirect approaches for
   eliciting decision heuristics. We simulate a sample of heterogeneous
   synthetic respondents and measure whether these methods are capable of
   (1) inferring derision heuristics correctly, (2) adequately predicting
   consideration sets, and (3) improving choice predictions compared to
   CBC-HB. Our results show that noncompensatory inference provides
   additional information on decision heuristics as well as consideration
   sets, which can be valuable for advertising purposes as well as
   competitive strategy. Methods for inferring heuristics should be
   selected based on the complexity of products and markets. Across all
   scenarios, there exists at least one method which significantly improves
   predictive accuracy of CBC-HB. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The role of opinion leaders in the diffusion of innovation has recently
   come under scrutiny: On the one hand, their central role in accelerating
   diffusion has been recognized in industry, academia, and the popular
   media. On the other hand, it has been argued that opinion leaders do not
   create contagion processes that differ significantly from those of other
   types of customers. We offer here a synthesis of these opposing theses:
   For many applications, opinion leadership should be studied in small
   groups rather than in an entire network.
   Using data from two mobile operators, we show how our method of
   segmenting the market and defining local opinion leaders applies to
   churn. We show that opinion leaders are highly effective in small,
   strong-tie groups, and their effect considerably declines with larger
   groups and weaker ties. Opinion leaders are at the highest risk for
   churn compared with other group members, they are more likely to be the
   first to initiate churn, and when they churn, the probability of
   additional churners from their social group grows significantly, as
   compared to when non-leaders chum. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Microeconomic theories, including diminishing marginal utility and
   opportunity cost, suggest that low-income consumers should have greater
   utility and lower opportunity costs associated with coupon redemption.
   Therefore, low-income households should redeem coupons more often than
   higher income households. Additionally, household composition should
   impact coupon redemption; the presence of children in the impoverished
   household should heighten coupon redemption rates. Yet, coupon
   redemption studies have thus far failed to support these premises. The
   current study suggests that microeconomic theories of coupon redemption
   are more predictive when a key shopping characteristic of impoverished
   consumers is taken into account: basket size. Our analysis of
   transactions catalogued within a large supermarket scanner database
   suggests that when the basket size characteristic is accounted for,
   impoverished consumers in fact redeem coupons at greater rates than most
   of the higher income categories. Moreover, the analyses show unique
   interaction effects between household composition, degree of
   impoverishment, and selected coupon redemption variables. The finding
   suggests that retailers, manufacturers, and government assistance
   programs seeking to attract or help impoverished consumers can optimize

AB A conceptual framework examines how language influences the way
   consumers interact with brands. Building on a review of two decades of
   research in the field, this framework draws on Schmitt's model of the
   Consumer Psychology of Brands (2012) and integrates the language-related
   disciplines of psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and semiotics to
   convey a novel, interdisciplinary perspective to brand-related
   managerial concerns. Through this framework, the authors define the
   domain of brand linguistics, the study of language effects on consumers
   in brand-related settings. Brand linguistics differs from the
   traditional disciplines associated with linguistics in that it focuses
   on the consumer as a unit of analysis and utilizes an interdisciplinary
   approach to theory. The proposed framework recognizes the implicit

   launch their movies simultaneously. They compete deciding about the
   positioning of their movies, as they can position close to or far from
   the mainstream, and investing in advertising and in quality. We study
   our competitive setting with an analytical model and solve it using a
   standard game-theoretical technique. Next, we use an agent-based model
   (ABM) to relax several assumptions of the analytical model and
   investigate more realistic market situations, such as symmetric as well
   as asymmetric positioning, competitions among big and/or small studios,
   settings with more than two competitors, and studios that use weighted
   and evolving decision rules. Our results explain interesting dynamics

AB Groupon has pioneered a new business model that combines the features of
   daily deals and group buying. Utilizing a large proprietary dataset of
   Groupon users, the authors formulate three hypotheses about the effects
   of the tipping point (i.e., whether enough people have purchased the
   deal before it can be redeemed) on consumer behavior. The results
   indicate that (1) surprisingly, the tipping point does not stimulate
   consumers to refer the deal to others, (2) after controlling for
   detailed deal characteristics, information about the tipping point
   increases deal purchase probability and accelerates deal purchase speed
   by removing consumers' uncertainty about whether the deal will
   eventually tip, and (3) through a comparison of the different effects of
   prior purchases on purchase likelihood before and after a tipping point,
   conformity rather than social learning is identified as playing the
   dominant role in contagious purchases. Taken together, our results
   support the fact that the tipping point can alter consumer behavior and
   affect sales. However, recent changes made by Groupon are inconsistent
   with our empirical results and keeps the company from fully utilizing
   its potential. This study also provides an example of using web
   analytics tools to augment clickstream data and consolidate information
   from other sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For customer-centric firms, churn prediction plays a central role in
   churn management programs. Methodological advances have emphasized the
   use of customer panel data to model the dynamic evolution of a customer
   base to improve churn predictions. However, pressure from policy makers
   and the public geared to reducing the storage of customer data has led
   to firms' self-policing' by limiting data storage, rendering panel data
   methods infeasible. We remedy these problems by developing a method that
   captures the dynamic evolution of a customer base without relying on the
   availability past data. Instead, using a recursively updated model our
   approach requires only knowledge of past model parameters. This
   generalized mixture of Kalman filters model maintains the accuracy of
   churn predictions compared to existing panel data methods when data from
   the past is available. In the absence of past data, applications in the
   insurance and telecommunications industry establish superior predictive
   performance compared to simpler benchmarks. These improvements arise
   because the proposed method captures the same dynamics and unobserved
   heterogeneity present in customer databases as advanced methods, while
   achieving privacy preserving data minimization and data anonymization.
   We therefore conclude that privacy preservation does not have to come at
   the cost of analytical operations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Firms make substantial investments in advertising and personal selling
   to improve their performance, but it is unclear how returns on the
   promotional mix vary across different corporate level organizational
   structures. This article identifies and integrates two structural
   designs that foster customer alignment, namely, structural type (i.e.,
   organizing corporate-level business units around customer instead of
   product groups) and structural granularity (i.e., dividing a firm into
   smaller business units), then investigates how these customer-aligned
   structural designs moderate the effects of the promotional mix on firm
   performance. An analysis of 14 years of longitudinal, multisource,
   secondary data reveals that the performance effect of investments in
   advertising and personal selling are enhanced by customer-aligned
   structural designs. However, the synergistic effects of joint
   investments in advertising and personal selling get suppressed in
   customer-aligned structures because functional fragmentation results
   from internal inefficiencies and complexities. To specify the tensions
   involved across the different structures, the authors conduct a post hoc
   analysis and thereby derive organizational structure-specific
   guidelines. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the impact of an instant reward program (IRP) with
   bonus premiums on consumer purchase behavior. An IRP is a rapidly
   growing form of short-term program that rewards consumers instantly with
   small premiums per fixed spending, where these premiums are part of a
   larger set of collectibles. A supplementary element in many IRPs
   promotes specific brands with an extra premium, labeled bonus premiums.
   Bonus premiums are the extra premiums consumers can earn by buying a
   specific promoted brand, which is a non-price promotion tied to the IRP.
   Therefore, consumers can earn premiums in two ways: based on total
   spending and on purchases of promoted brands. To test the effects of
   these marketing instruments, this study uses Dutch household panel data
   related to purchases of 23 product categories spanning four supermarket
   chains. We decompose consumer purchase behavior by modeling the number
   of shopping trips, category-level purchase incidence, brand choice, and
   purchase quantity. The results show that an IRP results in incremental
   shopping trips. Promoting a brand with a bonus premium and price
   discount compared to just a price discount results in higher choice
   probabilities for the promoted brand. Finally, the IRP and bonus premium
   are especially effective for households that collect the premiums, but
   we also find positive albeit smaller effects for non-collecting
   households. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Outsourcing of production, services, and various economic activities is
   a pervasive phenomenon across industries. One of the key economic
   benefits of this popular practice, as mentioned by its sellers and
   buyers, is that it allows the outsourcing firm to reduce its fixed costs
   such as expenditures on equipment, information technology, fixed
   salaries of employees, etc., and convert those into a variable cost in
   the form of the purchase price that the outsourcing firm then pays the
   outside industry. This paper examines the strategic implications of this
   role of outsourcing in an oligopdlistic setting. We show how these
   strategic considerations imply that, even absent any cost savings from
   outsourcing, competing firms can find it profitable to outsource.
   Furthermore, in such a setting, one firm may outsource while the ex-ante
   similar competing firm may not outsource. We also examine how consumer
   and social welfare are adversely affected when outsourcing plays this
   fixed-cost-to-variable-cost conversion role in an oligopolistic setting.

AB Product reviews are becoming ubiquitous on the Web, representing a rich
   source of consumer information on a wide range of product categories
   (e.g., wines and hotels). Importantly, a product review reflects not
   only the perception and preference for a product, but also the acuity,
   bias, and writing style of the reviewer. This reviewer aspect has been
   overlooked in past studies that have drawn inferences about brands from
   online product reviews. Our framework combines ontology learning-based
   text mining and psychometric techniques to translate online product
   reviews into a product positioning map, while accounting for the
   idiosyncratic responses and writing styles of individual reviewers or a
   manageable number of reviewer groups (i.e., meta-reviewers). Our
   empirical illustrations using wine and hotel reviews demonstrate that a
   product review reveals information about the reviewer (for the wine
   example with a small number of expert reviewers) or the meta-reviewer
   (for the hotel example with an enormous number of reviewers reduced to a
   manageable number of meta-reviewers), as well as about the product under
   review. From a managerial perspective, product managers can use our
   framework focusing on meta-reviewers (e.g., traveler types and hotel
   reservation websites in our hotel example) as a way to obtain insights
   into their consumer segmentation strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

AB We introduce pictorial-based homophones as effective priming cues that
   influence consumer product attribute beliefs (i.e., a picture of a sail
   primes the perception of 'discount': target, perception: 'sale'),
   advertisement attitudinal judgments (i.e., a picture of a grater primes
   more 'favorable' attitudes toward an advertisement; target perception:
   'great'), and purchase intentions (i.e., a picture of wood primes
   'intent' to purchase; target perception: 'would'). Across three studies
   we demonstrate that pictorial-based homophone priming effects manifest
   only when consumers subvocalize (inner voice) the homophone in the
   image. Results provide evidence to suggest that the absence of
   orthography (spelling) in pictorial-based homophones and the inability
   to pre-activate spelling representations results in a failure to
   suppress the priming effect. Results also demonstrate that facilitating
   spelling verification disambiguates the word's meaning, resulting in
   suppression of the irrelevant homophone. This research has implications

AB In colloquial speech, people frequently link emotions to temperature
   (e.g., "warm love" or "cold fear"). Likewise, in the business world, the
   use of emotionally warm and cold appeals reflects an ongoing trend in
   advertising. However, the conditions in which emotionally warm versus
   cold appeals are more effective remain unclear. Drawing on homeostasis
   theory, the authors investigate whether and why feeling physically warm
   versus cold influences the effectiveness of emotional advertising
   appeals. Using both laboratory experiments and field data, they show
   that emotions play a homeostatic role. Specifically, they demonstrate
   that the effects of particular emotional stimuli depend not only on
   physical temperatures per se but on homeostasis/thermoregulation.
   Namely, when consumers are below their homeostatic optimum (i.e.,
   physically cold), they perceive emotionally cold stimuli less favorably
   (than emotionally warm stimuli) as these stimuli bring them further away
   from the optimum. Likewise, when consumers are above their homeostatic
   optimum (i.e., physically hot), they perceive emotionally warm stimuli
   less favorably (than emotionally cold stimuli) as these stimuli bring
   them further away from the optimum. Finally, once consumers are at their
   homeostatic optimum, they perceive both emotionally warm and cold
   stimuli similarly favorably. These results have implications for a wide
   range of marketing activities (in particular advertising) across seasons
   and international markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   and influence on social media rebroadcasting behavior. While previous
   research has studied the role of content or the role of influence in the
   spread of social media content separately, none has simultaneously
   examined both in an effort to assess the relative effects of each. Our
   modeling approach also accounts for a message's "fit" with users, based
   on the content of the message and the content of messages typically
   shared by users.
   As an empirical application, we examine how Twitter posts originating
   from top business schools are subsequently rebroadcasted (or retweeted)
   by other users. We employ an individual-level split hazard model that
   accounts for variation in rebroadcasting decisions related to (1)
   content, (2) the content-user fit and (3) the influence of other users.
   We find that the rebroadcasting a message depends not only on message
   content but also on the message's fit with a user. Our analysis also
   yields measures of influence and susceptibility to influence for each
   user, which can be used to identify influential social media users. We
   demonstrate how our approach can be used to evaluate different types of
   seeding strategies designed to increase the reach of social media

AB Marketing and finance executives follow different objectives and focus
   on different stakeholder groups. Marketers want to create sales impact.
   Finance executives are concerned about the financial health of the firm.
   As a result, both worlds tend to be rather disconnected in their daily
   business. We argue that this does not reflect the dynamics of the firm
   where important marketing and financial metrics in fact interact. As
   long as marketing and finance officers do not fully appreciate the
   interplay of their key metrics, their decisions are likely to be
   suboptimal. This article proposes a simultaneous equation model that
   reflects the interaction of marketing and finance-domain variables in
   the value creation process. We focus on brand-building activities and
   the attraction of capital as major tasks of marketing and finance
   officers. Our model shows how advertising and other investments increase
   customer-based brand equity (CBBE) that in turn impacts financial
   leverage and credit spread and ultimately elevates the level of
   financial resources.
   Based on a broad sample of 155 firms covering various B2C industries, we
   test for the empirical relevance of our model. We also assess the
   practical significance of our results by transforming them into
   elasticities. Our results suggest that marketing and finance executives
   need to consider the dynamic interaction of their decision and
   performance variables to fully evaluate the effects of their decisions

   depending on the velocity of the market environment, company strategy,
   and R&D characteristics. Specifically, R&D-marketing cooperation
   exhibits a stronger association with new-product advantage if firms
   follow a cost leadership strategy, if R&D holds high power levels
   regarding new-product decisions, and if R&D collectivism is strongly
   pronounced. Conversely, R&D-sales cooperation exhibits a stronger effect
   on new-product advantage if technological turbulence is pronounced in
   the market, if the firm follows a differentiation strategy, and if R&D
   is influential in firm-wide budgeting decisions. These results may help
   firms decide which R&D cooperation type might be encouraged to maximize
   innovation success in a given situation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

AB During the last decade, service-dominant (S-D) logic (1) has taken a
   series of significant theoretical turns, (2) has had foundational
   premises modified and added and (3) has been consolidated into a smaller
   set of core axioms. S-D logic can continue to advance over the next
   decade by moving toward further development of a general theory of the
   market and, even more broadly, to a general theory of value cocreation.
   To support this theory of the market requires developing more midrange
   theoretical frameworks and concepts of service exchange, resource
   integration, value cocreation, value determination, and
   institutions/ecosystems. These midrange theories can be partially
   informed by theories outside of marketing, including those under the
   rubrics of practice, evolutionary, complexity, ecological and
   structuration theories. Evidence-based research is also needed;
   opportunities exist in areas such as (1) strategy development and
   implementation (2) application of complexity economics and (3) the study
   of the service of cognitive mediators (assistants) as heuristic tools in
   complex service ecosystems. Additionally, opportunities exist for using
   S-D logic as a broader framework for the study of macromarketing,
   including ethics, economic, environmental and social sustainability, as
   well as public policy. For each of these, the further study of
   institutions and institutional arrangements, which facilitate
   coordination among actors in service ecosystems, is needed. (C) 2016

   conceptualizes how brand familiarity affects online and cross-channel

   models to estimate long-term elasticities for four brands. The authors
   distinguish customer-initiated communication (typically online) from
   firm-initiated communication (typically offline). Their results indicate
   that within-online synergy is higher than online-offline synergy for
   both familiar brands but not for both unfamiliar brands. Managers of
   unfamiliar brands may obtain substantial synergy from offline marketing
   spending, even though its direct elasticity pales in comparison with
   that of online media while managers of familiar brands can generate more
   synergy by investing in different online media. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB This research considers how marketers can encourage or "nudge" consumers
   to transmit word of mouth (WOM), such as referrals or recommendations to
   friends, in a manner that helps reach, inform, or influence large
   numbers of consumers quickly, which is an outcome referred to as faster
   diffusion. Building on studies showing diffusion is faster when
   higher-connectivity people are involved; the authors propose a mechanism
   based on network externalities that encourages regular customers to
   select receivers who have higher levels of social connectivity. Three
   experiments and a simulation demonstrate the mechanism's efficacy by
   showing (i) how regular consumers can be encouraged to select
   higher-connectivity friends as WOM receivers, (ii) why this mechanism
   works, and (iii) how encouraging this receiver selection behavior can
   lead to faster diffusion at the macro level. The findings extend the WOM
   marketing literature by introducing an approach for encouraging
   transmissions to specific types of consumers that is a viable
   alternative to directly targeting higher-connectivity consumers in
   seeded WOM campaigns, which is often practically infeasible. (C) 2016

AB This paper considers upgrade-rebate strategy in a dynamic context. We
   analyze how firms can control the transition process across
   multi-generational innovation diffusion waves through upgrade-rebates.
   By using rebates, firms can recover former customers who can substitute
   an old-generation product with a new generation and, at the same time,
   accelerate the diffusion of new generations. We study optimal rebate
   amounts and prices which maximize firm's discounted profits. We show
   that the implementation of a rebate program decreases the prices of the
   old generation, but increases the prices of the new generation. We also
   find that for certain market conditions it is optimal to provide higher
   rebate amount than the price of the second generation at the start of
   the upgrade-rebate program. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The forces that drive the impact of academic research articles in the
   marketing discipline are of great interests to authors, editors, and the
   discipline's policy makers. A key understudied driver is social network
   utilization by academic researchers. In this paper, we examine how
   activating one's social network can contribute to the impact of academic
   research and what factors lead researchers to utilize their social
   network: We treat social networks as a resource that researchers can
   potentially invoice to supplement other resources available to them. We
   propose a framework of antecedents for the use of professional social
   networks by academics. The framework captures researchers' relevant
   personal and professional experience, as well as conditions associated
   with the project at hand. Specifically, we study an academic
   researcher's (1) personal background (gender and country of origin
   economic advancement), (2) professional development (time since PhD
   completion and editorial review board (ERB) membership), and (3) ad-hoc
   human capital directly involved in the research project (team size). The
   current study draws upon research from scientometrics, social networks,
   and resource availability and use, and involves an empirical analysis of
   a sample of 1329 articles published between 1980 and 2008 in top
   marketing journals. We predict and generally find that women
   researchers, researchers originating from less economically advanced
   countries, or those working with fewer co-authors on a research project
   are more likely to utilize their social network than their peers. We
   find weaker evidence for our prediction that years since PhD completion
   and ERB membership are negatively associated with social network
   utilization. Importantly, we further surmise and find that, in turn,
   social network utilization enhances the impact of a research article.

   marketing (CRM) relative to corporate philanthropy in enhancing brand
   related outcomes and the moderating role of self-construal. We
   demonstrated that, overall, CRM helps less in improving brand image,
   consumer self-brand connection, and purchase intention than corporate
   philanthropy. However, this differential effect between the two types of
   corporate social responsibility approaches is moderated by consumers'
   self-construal. Specifically, consumers with interdependent
   self-construal, but not those with independent self-construal, either
   measured (Studies 1, 3 and 4) or primed (Study 2), responded to CRM as
   favorably as they did to corporate philanthropy. A survey regarding
   multiple real brands further confirmed that the more interdependent the
   consumers, the less likely they were to prefer corporate philanthropy
   over CRM (Study 5). However, when the reciprocity norm was made salient
   through an irrelevant task, independent consumers responded like those
   with interdependent self-construal, treating CRM and corporate
   philanthropy in the same way (Study 4). (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

AB Marketing tools that enable pre-purchase experience (e.g., product
   trials, sampling) are considered efficient means of reducing uncertainty
   and increasing demand for unfamiliar products. It is widely agreed that
   having more information improves the quality of choice, so
   demonstrations, sampling, and other experience-generating marketing
   tools are expected to increase consumers' welfare. The current paper
   challenges this concept by suggesting that experiencing some product
   types for a limited time might provide unrepresentative information, and
   thus might result in suboptimal choices. In three experiments, we
   evaluated the effect of potentially unrepresentative experience on
   consumer product acceptance. The results show that while experiencing
   products affects consumers even when it provides little information, the
   effect might be positive or negative, depending on the product value
   distribution. Specifically, short experience with the product increases
   the appeal of negatively skewed products, which appear appealing after a
   short, yet unrepresentative experience. Yet short experience impairs the
   appeal of positively skewed products, which appear unappealing given
   short or low-intensity experience. This pattern emerges even though the
   most likely result of a given sample is not a good predictor of the
   expected utility of the product. Theoretical and practical implications
   are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Health organizations stimulate the development of low-fat variants to
   fight the obesity epidemic. We examine the effectiveness of this policy
   by studying the short- and long-term consequences of the first low-fat
   purchase on subsequent purchased volume and calories. Using a structural
   break analysis, we show that purchases increase in the short run after
   the first low-fat purchase, thereby confirming the single-occasion
   overconsumption effect of low-fat as shown in the experimental
   literature. Importantly, our results also show a significant positive
   long-term effect, which suggests that overpurchasing persists in the
   long run. In addition, our findings show that the long-term
   overpurchasing after the first low-fat purchase is solely due to the
   overpurchasing of low-fat items and not of regular items. These results
   provide support for the overgeneralization of claim effects and habit
   formation resulting in the enduring effect of healthier variants of

AB While the prices of many products such as automobiles, boats, jewelry
   and musical instruments are commonly negotiated, many firms have been
   offering their consumers the option to purchase at a fixed price. This
   research examines the impact of a firm's choice of a no haggle, fixed
   price policy in a market where its competitors continue to negotiate.
   Using the automobile manufacturer, Toyota Canada's Access Program as a
   context, we find that unilaterally introducing a fixed price policy led
   to higher prices for both the fixed price firm and its closest
   negotiating competitor in the family car market. Despite the price
   increase, sales remained unchanged. For the entry level models, however,
   prices remained the same but sales experienced an increase. As
   competitors could have followed suit and introduced a fixed price
   policy, this suggest's the possibility of an asymmetric price-policy
   equilibrium in the market. After ruling out alternative explanations, we
   conclude that the effects on prices and sales are due to the unilateral
   move to a no-haggle price that allows Toyota to differentiate itself
   from its competitors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates cross-country differences in the importance of
   four brand benefits that are commonly stressed in international
   positioning strategies quality, uniqueness, leading position, and
   growing popularity in determining brand purchase intentions. It also
   investigates how these effects are moderated by country characteristics,
   consumer characteristics, and perceptions about competing brands'
   benefits, as well as whether they are stable across product categories.
   To achieve this, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model that
   recognizes the ordinal nature of the measurement of purchase intentions
   and captures scale usage differences in a parsimonious way. The model is
   estimated using a unique multi-continent, multi-category data set across
   19,682 respondents from 25 countries: In total 337 brands across six
   product categories (fast food, beer, designer brands, athletic shoes and
   apparel, mobile phones, photography) and two service categories
   (airlines, credit cards) were assessed. The results show that on average
   intrinsic benefits (i.e., quality and uniqueness), are most important in
   determining purchase intentions. The strengths of these effects are
   significantly influenced by culture and become weaker if more competing
   brands are perceived to possess these benefits. Companies are therefore
   advised to trade-off between positioning their brand along a brand
   benefit that appeals to a country, while ensuring that this positioning
   is distinct from the positioning of competing brands. If a multinational
   company prefers using one global strategy, then focusing on quality is
   recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The authors propose a procedure, labeled the calibrated sigma method,
   which is designed to correct for between-group differences in
   endorsement likelihood of response categories that are unrelated to the
   content of the items. The method is especially useful in cross-cultural
   research where group differences may reflect variation in scale usage
   rather than substantive differences. However, the procedure is also
   relevant in other situations, for example, when different data
   collection modes or different experimental manipulations affect
   respondents' perception of the meaning of the scale labels. The
   calibrated sigma method uses information derived from heterogeneous
   control items (calibration items) to reweight the responses to
   substantive items in a group-specific way. The advantages of the
   calibrated sigma method are that it avoids the arbitrariness in the
   assignment of particular numerical values to response categories; that
   it is compatible with the linear model, which is used by most marketing
   researchers; and that it does not require the use of complex nonlinear
   models involving the estimation of many additional measurement model
   parameters. The authors validate the calibrated sigma method on a
   simulated cross-linguistic data set pertaining to 12 different
   languages; an empirical data set collected from respondents of the same
   nationality but from two different language groups; and an experimental
   data set consisting of responses to two different response scale
   formats. The findings demonstrate that the proposed procedure controls
   for artefactual scale use differences across groups but does not
   eliminate substantive differences. It is particularly efficient for
   marketing research agencies, panel providers and other marketing
   researchers who analyze surveys involving multiple language groups,
   different scale formats, multiple modes of data collection, or different
   manipulations affecting the meaning of the response category labels. (C)

AB Marketing executives are under pressure to produce revenue and profit
   growth for their brands. In most cases that involve requesting gradually
   higher marketing budgets, which is expensive, especially considering the
   known diminishing return effects of marketing. However, in reality,
   brand sales tend to evolve not gradually, but rather in spurts, i.e.
   short periods of sales evolution alternating with longer periods of
   stability. We use the Wang Zhang (2008) time-series test to identify
   such growth spurt periods, which represent opportunity windows for the
   benefitting brand. We then relate these windows to exogenous events such
   as positive product reviews, which create a temporarily more benevolent
   environment for the brand. We suggest brand managers be vigilant to
   catch and take advantage of such opportunity windows to generate
   sustained growth at low cost, and derive the implications of such
   vigilant spending for marketing budget setting. Our empirical
   illustration is based on several brands in the digital single-lens
   reflex (DSLR) camera market. It demonstrates, among other things, that
   competitors in this market typically do not take advantage of windows of
   growth opportunity offered by positive product reviews. (C) 2016

AB Chief marketing officers (CMOs) are the marketing leaders in their
   respective firms and are responsible for creating shareholder value. To
   incentivize CMOs to focus on shareholders' interests, an increasing
   number of firms are compensating their CMOs with equity. This study
   examines the impact of CMO equity incentive on shareholder value and
   introduces three different forms of managerial discretion given to CMOs
   as contingencies determining when the impact of CMO equity incentive is
   more or less. Results based on CMO compensation data from 1993 to 2009
   confirm the value relevance of CMO equity incentive above and beyond
   equity incentive allocated to other TMT members. Furthermore, the
   results reveal support for the moderating effect of financial,
   strategic, and operational forms of CMO managerial discretion.
   Theoretically, the findings identify hitherto unrecognized boundary
   conditions determining when the impact of CMO equity on shareholder
   value is higher or lower and address several limitations characterizing
   past research on the topic. Managerially, the results can guide firms in
   structuring CMO compensation and discretion in ways that optimize the
   effect of CMOs on shareholder value. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Business practice and the extant literature widely acknowledge that
   market orientation (MO) is a key driver of firm performance, yet some
   studies question its benefits. Research that has tried to clarify these
   inconsistencies by investigating the dimensions of responsive MO (RMO)
   and proactive MO (PMO) has found conflicting results. This study seeks
   to resolve the debate by identifying the total effects of RMO and PMO on
   firm performance, thereby helping to extend the understanding of the
   differing performance consequences of RMO and PMO. The total effects of
   the two kinds of MO are composed of the contemporary nonlinear
   relationships between RMO and PMO and firm performance, along with the
   carry-over effects of the previous levels of RMO and PMO, which may also
   be nonlinear. Based on objective performance measures and panel data of
   fifty-six US companies observed over 9 years, we find support for an
   inverted-U-shaped contemporary effect of RMO that suggests that a medium
   level of RMO is most beneficial for firms. In contrast, the contemporary
   effect of PMO on firm performance is U-shaped, so a high level of PMO
   provides the most promising competitive advantage. Our empirical results
   only partially support our hypotheses regarding carry-over effects.
   While the results confirm the proposed inverted-U-shaped carry-over
   effects of RMO, PMO exerts no carry-over effects, so firms must instead
   continuously implement PMO at high levels in order to benefit profits in
   a sustainable way and avoid losing ground to competitors. (C) 2016

AB Although practitioners and scholars recognize that frontline employees'
   (FLEs') performance may improve rather than suffer from role conflict,
   research has yet to show how firms can manage this complex process. This
   study proposes that employees' ideas for improvement are a crucial
   mediator in role conflict's positive influence on FLEs' service
   performance. A conditional process model was tested in two empirical
   studies with multisource data. Results show that role conflict
   positively influences service performance through the employee's ideas
   for improvement. Role conflict also has a direct negative effect on
   performance. Detailed moderating analyses, using a floodlight approach,
   show that role conflict's total effect on service performance is
   positive only when an employee's learning orientation and the manager's
   level of encouragement for improvement are aligned. In other cases role
   conflict does not affect, or can even seriously impair FLEs' service
   performance. This study is the first to demonstrate empirically how, and
   under what conditions, role conflict can lead to performance enhancement
   of FLEs. Our findings help marketing managers to leverage role conflict
   for service innovation and to serve customers better. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB We introduce limbal rings (dark annulus around the iris of the eye) as a
   biological facial cue that illuminates the sclera (white of eye) and
   subsequently acts as a signal for source purity, a construct we
   distinguish from source trustworthiness. We argue the phenomenon
   observed' is due to an eye purity metaphorical association effect,
   whereby consumers use the illuminated white of an eye as a metaphorical
   representation of purity. We also illustrate a source purity
   overgeneralization hypothesis, where source purity acts as the mechanism
   that consumers use to judge the purity of a source, and overgeneralize
   to other source and endorsement based judgments. Across four experiments
   we manipulate the presence and type (thick versus thin; transparent
   versus opaque) of limbal rings (no limbal ring versus limbal ring),
   while controlling for product attractiveness, perceived
   spokesperson-product fit, and eye characteristics including eye shape,
   pupil, color, and gaze. Results demonstrate that a biological (or
   authentic) facial contrast cue (i.e., thick, opaque limbal rings)
   increases perceptions of source purity, which, in turn, enhances source
   trustworthiness judgments, attitude toward the advertisement, and
   attitude toward the brand. We demonstrate that source purity is a
   stronger predictor of source and endorsement-based judgments than source
   attractiveness. We also determine that the addition of an artificial (or
   inauthentic) facial contrast cue (i.e., cosmetic adornment on the eyes)
   attenuates the limbal ring effect, resulting in the dilution of source
   purity judgments, as well as trustworthiness and attractiveness
   perceptions, and advertisement and brand-based attitudes. (C) 2016

AB Firms make significant marketing investments in online, mobile and
   offline media and channels such as search engines, social media, e-mail,
   display advertising, print, TV, etc., to draw in customers to their
   websites, mobile apps, and stores to effect conversions and spur sales.
   As customers go through a series of touch points across media, channels
   and devices on their paths to purchase, attributing the appropriate
   credit for each touch point has emerged as an important problem. By
   focusing on estimating the incremental value of a touch point and
   spill-over effects across channels, attribution models can provide
   insights for allocating marketing investments across channels and
   targeting customers across channels and devices. In this paper, we
   provide a survey of the state-of-the-art in attribution modeling and
   analytics. As part of the survey, we also introduce the articles in this
   special section and position them in our classification framework.
   Finally, we propose a research agenda to guide future Work in the area.

   influences online search using the AOL search dataset It uses a novel
   keyword mining technique to classify keywords as brand related, category
   related (generic), or unrelated, distinguishing between category search
   and consumers' tendency to search a branded keyword. A three-level
   conditional choice model is estimated to determine whether hourly
   changes in brands' television advertising expenditures are related to
   deviations from baseline trends in search behaviors. The results
   indicate a statistically significant relationship between TV advertising
   and consumers' tendency to search branded keywords (e.g. "Fidelity")
   rather than generic category-related keywords (e.g. "stocks") in the
   dataset. The effect is largest for relatively young brands during
   standard business hours with an elasticity,.07, comparable to extant
   measurements of advertising's impact on sales. However, television
   advertising is not found to influence category search incidence and has
   limited effects on click-through rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Brands spend significant resources on social media to connect with their
   customers, yet there is limited understanding on how consumers engage
   with brands on social media and how it influences their purchase
   process. Drawing on social identity theory which suggests that consumers
   work hard towards increasing the attractiveness of the groups they
   belong, we propose that consumers identifying with brands manifest both
   in-role behaviors that are related to product consumption and extra-role
   behaviors such as word-of-mouth that benefit the whole group.
   Accordingly, in the music industry (our empirical context), we propose
   that consumers engage in three social media activities to enhance the
   attractiveness of their brands: sampling music (SPLAYS), following music
   artists (SFANS), and commenting on the artists' social media websites
   (SWOM). Further, in line with brand attachment theory, we argue that
   these actions influence consumer purchase behavior (and thus music
   sales). Results using data for 36 music artists over 73 weeks and robust
   time-series econometrics provide support for our framework and highlight
   how the consumer buying process is influenced by social media
   activities. Specifically, we find some surprising results the influence
   of SPLAYS decreases at a decreasing rate, SFANS increases at a
   decreasing rate, and SWOM increases at an increasing rate. We discuss
   the implications of our study findings for brand managers and provide
   recommendations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies promotion-induced competition between supermarkets
   and drugstores, resulting from increased channel blurring and category
   overlap. It documents the relative impact of price cuts and feature ads
   at the two channels, and establishes substantive factors underlying
   their differences in promotion effectiveness. Estimates from a
   household-level model of category purchase incidence, store choice, and
   quantity, in five large health and beauty care categories, show that the
   promotion effects are much larger for supermarket than drugstore chains.
   Though this partly follows from asymmetries in the channels' drawing
   power and from differences in in-store response, a key driver is the
   accessibility of promotional price information: because they are visited
   more frequently than drugstores and their store flyers are read more
   often, supermarkets gain relatively more from price cuts and feature ads
   than drug chains. Managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2015

AB The trajectories of social processes (e.g., peer pressure, imitation,
   and assimilation) that take place on social networks depend on the
   structure of those networks. Thus, to understand a social process or to
   predict the associated outcomes accurately, marketers would need good
   knowledge of the social network structure. However,, many social
   networks of relevance to marketers are large, complex, or hidden, making
   it prohibitively expensive to map out an entire social network. Instead,
   marketers often need to work with a sample (i.e., a subgraph) of a
   social network. In this paper we evaluate the efficacy of nine different
   sampling methods for generating subgraphs that recover four structural
   characteristics of importance to marketers, namely, the distributions of
   degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and closeness
   centrality, which are important for understanding how social network
   structure influences outcomes of processes that take place on the
   network.
   Via extensive simulations, we find that sampling methods differ
   substantially in their ability to recover network characteristics.
   Traditional sampling procedures, such as random node sampling, result in
   poor subgraphs. When the focus is on understanding local network effects
   (e.g., peer influence) then forest fire sampling with a medium burn rate
   performs the best, i.e., it is most effective for recovering the
   distributions of degree and clustering coefficient. When the focus is on
   global network effects (e.g., speed of diffusion, identifying
   influential nodes, or the "multiplier" effects of network seeding), then
   random-walk sampling (i.e., forest-fire sampling with a low burn rate)
   performs the best, and it is most effective for recovering the
   distributions of betweenness and closeness centrality. Further, we show
   that accurate recovery of social network structure in a sample is
   important for inferring the properties of a network process, when one
   observes only the process in the sampled network. We validate our
   findings on four different real-world networks, including a Facebook
   network and a co-authorship network, and conclude with recommendations
   for practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the role that product newness plays in activating
   consumer regulatory goals. We propose that these fundamental goals may
   not only be endogenously triggered in the new product evaluation
   context, but also will be determined by the type of product innovation,
   as gauged by the extent to which it is an incremental (INP) or really
   new product (RNP). More specifically, ad exposure to an INP (RNP) may
   spontaneously trigger a promotion (prevention) goal (Study 1). Further,
   we show that consumer perception of the cost to buy the product (whether
   the price was perceived to be high or low) moderates the relation
   between the RNP and activated regulatory goal. When consumers perceive
   the price of the RNP to be high (low), a prevention (promotion) goal is
   activated. However, the moderating effect of price is not found in the
   case of goal activation by the INP. In addition, we show that the
   situational regulatory focus induced mediates the effect of the
   interaction of price and product newness on purchase intention (Study
   2). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   instability differ in the way their online decisions are affected by the
   different aggregate measures of rating environment (volume, valance and
   variance). We empirically examine their dynamic three stage decision
   model in a controlled laboratory setting and find that individuals with
   greater (lower) preference instability depend more (less) on volume
   (valence) as a quality indicator while making their choice decisions.
   This finding offers a potential explanation for some of the apparent
   anomalies in terms of the effect of different online rating
   characteristics on product demand that have been reported in earlier
   literature. We also show that individuals with different level of
   preference instability differ in terms of their susceptibility toward
   disconfirmation. This difference in turn results in differences in
   online post-consumption opinion contribution. The results also indicate
   that choice propensity is strongly related to individual level rating
   incidence and evaluation propensities. Finally they find an evidence of
   strong temporal persistence for both choice and incidence decisions. (C)

AB Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) is often tracked in volume and valence
   metrics, but the topic of conversation may vary from the brand to its
   advertising to purchase statements. How do these different topics affect
   company performance? And which specific marketing communication (online,
   TV, radio, print) obtains most of its performance impact by stimulating
   eWOM topics?
   This paper quantifies the dynamic interactions among marketing, eWOM
   content, search, and online and offline store traffic for an apparel
   retailer. While it yields a similar online store traffic lift,
   advertising-related eWOM yields only half the offline store traffic lift
   of brand-related eWOM and of neutral eWOM about purchasing at the
   retailer. Paid search shows the highest elasticity in stimulating online
   conversations, but drives less business than offline marketing actions.
   While TV is the main paid driver of online store traffic, print is the
   main paid driver of offline store traffic for the studied retailer. Over
   a third of the offline store traffic effects materialize indirectly
   through eWOM and organic search. To avoid undercounting the benefits of
   paid marketing, managers should therefore track how their actions induce
   specific eWOM content metrics and how much these in turn drive
   performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores the adverse effects of customer disappointment after
   adoption accompanied by spreading negative word-of-mouth on firm
   profits. The study examines the effects of heterogeneity and
   assortativity of customer revenue on the profit impact of negative
   word-of-mouth that is initiated by three groups of consumers-revenue
   leaders, social hubs, and experts. The authors explore these effects
   using an agent-based simulation modeling approach and an in-depth
   computational experiment with empirical input data regarding social
   connectivity from 10 consumer social networks. The results indicate that
   negative word-of-mouth is more damaging in markets where there is a
   higher degree of heterogeneity. Moreover, assortativity may
   significantly affect the profit impact of disappointments, but this
   effect depends on the initial percentage of disappointed adopters. The
   study also finds an interaction between heterogeneity and assortativity,
   such that the effect of heterogeneity increases as assortativity
   increases up to a moderate level of assortativity, then the effect of
   heterogeneity on profits remains relatively constant. The implications
   from these results suggest that marketing managers should consider the
   heterogeneity and assortativity characteristics of their customer
   revenue streams to (a) better manage the adverse profit impacts of
   customer disappointments and negative word-of-mouth; (b) design more
   effective customer loyalty programs; and (c) more efficiently manage
   their customer equity portfolios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Previous research has devoted much attention to the direct consequences
   of an assortment's content (e.g., actual number of different options)
   and structural features (e.g., organization of an assortment) on
   perceptions of variety. The present research, however, shows that a
   superficial feature, i.e., font readability of a menu or catalog, can
   influence variety perceptions even when the actual content or structure
   of an assortment remains unchanged. Four studies reveal that perceived
   variety is higher when the menu or catalog of an assortment is more
   difficult to read. This readability effect stems from the subjective
   interpretation of the feeling of difficulty. That is, consumers often
   endorse a lay belief that it is more difficult to make choices when they
   face a greater variety of options. For this reason, the readability
   effect is attenuated when this belief is (chronically or momentarily)
   less accessible. The increase in perceived variety induced by low
   readability can boost satisfaction with a store when consumers have a
   goal of seeking variety. Our research contributes to the understanding
   of determinants of variety perceptions and the consequences of
   metacognitive difficulty. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Advertisers employ various channels to reach customers over the
   Internet, who often get in touch with multiple channels along their
   "customer journey." However, evaluating the degree to which each channel
   contributes to marketing success and the ways in which channels
   influence one another remains challenging. Although advanced attribution
   models have been introduced in academia and practice alike,
   generalizable insights on channel effectiveness in multichannel
   settings, and on the interplay of channels, are still lacking. In
   response, the authors introduce a novel attribution framework reflecting
   the sequential nature of customer paths as first- and higher-order
   Markov walks. Applying this framework to four large customer-level data
   sets from various industries, each entailing at least seven distinct
   online channels, allows for deriving empirical generalizations and
   industry-related insights. The results show substantial differences from
   currently applied heuristics such as last click attribution, confirming
   and refining previous research on singular data sets. Moreover, the
   authors identify idiosyncratic channel preferences (carryover) and
   interaction effects both within and across channel categories
   (spillover). In this way, the study can help advertisers develop
   integrated online marketing strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

AB As firms increasingly rely on online media to acquire consumers,
   marketing managers rely on online metrics such as click-through rate
   (CTR) and cost per acquisition (CPA). However, these standard online
   advertising metrics are plagued with attribution problems and do not
   account for synergy or dynamics. These issues can easily lead firms to
   overspend on some actions and thus waste money and/or underspend in
   others, leaving money on the table.
   We develop a multivariate time series model to investigate the dynamic
   interaction between paid search and display ads and calibrate the model
   using data from a bank that uses online ads to acquire new checking
   account customers. The model suggests that both search and display ads
   exhibit dynamics that improve their effectiveness and ROI over time.
   Moreover, our results suggest that display ads increase search
   conversion. However, display ads may also increase search clicks,
   thereby increasing search advertising costs. After accounting for these
   three effects, we estimate that each $1 invested in display and search
   leads to a return of $1.24 for display and $1.75 for search ads. These
   ROI estimates are respectively 10% and 38% higher than those obtained by
   standard metrics, which may have led the company to under-invest. We use
   these results to show how optimal budget allocation may shift after
   accounting for attribution and dynamics. Although display benefits from
   synergy attribution, the strong dynamic effects of search call for an
   increase in search advertising budget share by up to 36% in our context.

AB The Internet has given rise to many new forms of advertising. Scientific
   studies have focused on individual reactions to specific advertising
   forms in isolation and have offered little guidance for aggregate-level
   budget allocation decisions, which are typically based on simple rules.
   This article compares the long-term effectiveness of nine forms of
   advertising seven online and two offline-by means of a structural vector
   autoregressive model and restricted impulse responses. For five product
   categories, we investigate how these forms of advertising generate
   traffic, affect conversion, and contribute to revenue. We find that
   content-integrated advertising is the most effective form, followed by
   content-separated advertising and firm-initiated advertising. Although
   online advertising forms have similar power to drive traffic, content
   integration dominates content separation in the area of progression
   toward purchase. Last click attribution underestimates
   content-integrated activities and suggests online advertising budget
   allocations that yield 10%-12% less revenue than the status quo, whereas
   the model's proposed online advertising budget allocation yields a 21%
   revenue increase over the status quo. These results highlight the
   payoffs for companies that integrate content into online media. (C) 2015

AB Discretionary spending is an important indicator of economic well-being.
   However, prior research is limited in empirically testing who is more
   likely to make discretionary purchases. To address this research gap,
   this article suggests that those who have less clearly and confidently
   defined, internally consistent, and temporally stable self-knowledge
   (i.e., those who have low self-concept clarity [SCC]) have higher
   discretionary spending tendencies than high-SCC individuals. The results
   indicate that low-SCC individuals have higher discretionary spending
   tendencies because they are more likely to adopt avoidant coping
   strategies than are high-SCC individuals. This research further tests
   the effectiveness of elaboration on potential outcomes in reducing the
   discretionary spending tendencies of individuals with high- or low-SCC
   and demonstrates that it is effective only for high-SCC individuals.

AB Research in indirect network effects has simplistically treated
   complementary product variety as the total number of complementary
   products (e.g., game titles in video game markets). This assumption of
   equi-differentiation ignores differences across genres or product
   categories. Furthermore, since consumers with differential preferences
   for variety enter the market at different stages, consumer heterogeneity
   in preference for variety in complementary products may evolve as the
   market develops. We propose a model that recognizes these previously
   ignored, but important, demand characteristics, and empirically
   investigate the effects of breadth and depth of software variety on
   consumer hardware adoption in the fifth-generation video game market. We
   find that early adopters seek variety across a wide spectrum of game
   genres, and that late adopters are interested only in action-oriented
   games and have no interest in strategy-oriented games unless they are
   so-called "superstars." Our findings imply that effective variety
   planning should be built along both dimensions, instead of simply
   assuming that more is better. Our policy simulations demonstrate that
   variety planning is as critical as entry timing to the success of
   platform companies in system competition, and is one of the reasons for
   PlayStation's winning the battle against Nintendo64. In addition, the
   boosting effect of a new title on hardware sales perishes quickly, so it
   is important to have a cascade strategy to guarantee a continuous supply
   of complementary software. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Platform-based systems have become the dominant way to market consumer
   entertainment products. Video games are, for instance, distributed in
   digital data form, which can only be used on compatible hardware.
   Network effects drive the diffusion of such systems. This article
   provides insights into market heterogeneity and the role that
   expectations of the direct and indirect network effects plays in the
   game console market. The results of two empirical studies suggest that
   the console market is strongly fragmented and that the perceptions of
   network effects differ between the various target segments. The same
   holds for the importance of consumer expectations: For instance,
   hardcore gamers make predictions about the future software availability
   and incorporate these into their current adoption decision, while social
   garners care more about the expected potential to interact with others.
   When introducing novel technologies, platform sponsors can benefit from
   improved targeting by, for example, providing software selectively,
   instead of large varieties early on. This study identifies the limits of
   go-to-market strategies derived from aggregate analyses when dealing
   with network effects and shows that behavioristic insights should
   complement them. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   (superstars). Supporters of long-tail theory believe the same factors
   have led to less convergence and a greater number of songs and artists
   becoming blockbusters and superstars. This work pits these opposing
   predictions against each other empirically. More specifically, we
   examine how the number of songs and artists appearing annually on
   Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart has changed between 1974 and 2013 in
   relation to three major turning points in technology associated with
   digitization. These turning points mark consumers' shift: (1) from
   analog records and cassettes to digital audio with the advent of CDs.,
   (2) from CDs to compressed digital audio MP3s, and (3) from P2P networks
   and illegal file sharing to legitimate online distributors of digital
   downloads. In general, we observe a growing winner-take-all effect for
   songs until the advent of MP3s in 1998, when this trend abated. This
   result appears largely due to greater convergence in the Top 10. The
   trend reverses itself as the number of songs making the chart increases
   steadily after the launch of legitimate online music sellers such as
   iTunes. The exact opposite pattern is observed for artists. Initially,
   an increasing number of artists made the chart, and this trend continued
   unabated until 2003. After the emergence of legitimate online resellers,
   the trend reversed as fewer and fewer artists made it onto the chart.
   The overall pattern is summarized as a transition from fewer
   blockbusters by more superstars to more blockbusters by fewer
   superstars. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB On-demand streaming services that rely on subscription fees or
   advertising as a revenue source (e.g., Spotify) are a topic of ongoing
   controversial debate in the music industry because their addition to the
   distribution mix entails the risk of cannibalization of other
   distribution channels (e.g., purchases of downloads or CDs) and might
   reduce overall revenues. To date, no research has assessed the effect of
   streaming services on revenue, and whether cannibalization indeed takes
   place. Our research fills this void and assesses the impact of free and
   paid streaming services on music expenditures and on total music
   industry revenue. To this end, we constructed a research design in which
   we observed a panel of more than 2500 music consumers repeatedly over
   more than one year. This approach allows us to eliminate
   individual-specific unobserved effects that may otherwise confound the
   identification of a cannibalization effect. Our results show that the
   adoption of a free streaming service as well as the adoption of a paid
   streaming service cannibalizes consumers' music expenditures. The net
   effect of paid streaming services on revenue, however, is clearly net
   positive. In contrast, the net effect of free streaming services on
   revenue is only positive for consumers who were relatively inactive
   before the adoption. On the industry level, our findings suggest that
   the negative effect of free streaming on industry revenue is offset by
   the positive effect of paid streaming in the context that we analyze.
   Hence, in the market that we study and under the assumptions that we
   make, we estimate that the overall effect of streaming on industry
   revenue is positive. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the early stage of film development when producers assemble a
   development team, it is important to understand the means by which
   different team members may contribute to the film's box office. Building
   upon theories from marketing and sociology, we propose that these
   contributions arise from team members' positions, or embeddedness, in a
   social network weaved through past film collaborations. These
   collaborations provide team members with opportunities to draw knowledge
   and skills from the network for new film projects. Our conceptual
   framework accentuates two aspects of network embeddedness: positional
   embeddedness (PE)-how well a person is tied to well-connected others,
   and junctional embeddedness (JE)-the extent to which a person bridges
   sub-communities in the industry. We examine how the importance of PE and
   JE varies by functional role (cast versus crew), and is moderated by the
   film's studio affiliation.
   Analyzing more than 15,000 industry professionals over nearly two
   decades of film collaborations, this research reveals crucial and
   divergent relationships: while high PE is more valuable for the cast,
   high JE is critical for the crew. This role distinction also depends on
   a film's studio affiliation. Managerially, these findings provide
   guidance to film executives and producers in revenue maximization
   through strategic team assembly, and to talents in career management.

AB The rise of the Internet and new online services have led to the
   wide-scale illegal distribution of digital entertainment products, such
   as music, movies, games, and books. We analyze whether firms in the
   entertainment industry should fight unlicensed usage by providing
   specific offers that maximize the utility for segments relying on
   unlicensed usage, i.e., by optimizing timing and pricing strategies, or
   whether they should simply accept a certain level of unlicensed usage.
   We combine Becker's (1968) economic approach to analyzing social issues
   with random utility theory to develop a choice model for media products
   in which we account for unlicensed usage. We then apply the model in two
   large-scale empirical studies on movies and books. The results show that
   consumers who prefer unlicensed usage are sensitive to the marketing mix
   to some extent in both markets. However, optimizing timing and pricing
   only has limited impact on additional revenue generation. Thus, from a
   managerial perspective, it is very difficult to reduce the relative loss
   due to unlicensed usage by providing targeted offers. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   namely exhibitors, are influenced by critical reviews in their
   programming decisions after the launch of a movie. More specifically, it
   tests the effect of critical reviews on the decision of exhibitors to
   keep or withdraw a movie on their screens from week to week. A unique
   data set comprising more than 165,000 weekly theater level decisions
   spanning over a decade is used for the analyses. Exhibitors' decisions
   are modeled through a discrete time survival model with random effects.
   Results show that a movie with excellent reviews has more chances to
   stay longer in a theater when compared to one with poor, fair, or good
   reviews, even after controlling for the previous week's box office. This
   finding suggests that a portion of the overall commercial performance
   usually associated with positive reviews can be attributed to the impact
   of critics' reviews on exhibitors' decisions to keep the movie on screen
   for a longer period. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB How and why audiences consume films is a much-researched yet
   inconclusive area of film marketing. Film is an experiential product and
   qualitative research methods are a suitable way of gaining insight into
   how people choose between different film offerings and how they assess
   their film viewing experience. Before we can understand others' choices
   and experiences, we first must understand ourselves. We therefore begin
   our investigation by taking a snapshot of our experiences facilitated by
   Subjective Personal Introspection (SPI) to gain insight into how the
   lead author makes sense of his film consumption. The key findings
   complement and advance current debates in film and experiential
   consumption. Indeed, the theoretical contribution is two fold; the
   development of a film consumption experience model based on
   three-interrelated classification dimensions (film characteristics,
   viewing environment, situational environment), which collectively
   impacts the lead author's consumption behavior, and our expansion of
   Schmitt's (1999) SEMs model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In nonlinear models, a typical way to determine the interaction effect
   between variables is to linearize the model for estimation purpose, add
   an interaction term, and then use the estimate of the parameter of the
   interaction term to determine the presence (or absence) and the extent
   of the interaction effect. In this paper, we show that in many cases
   such an approach is problematic. By design, non-linear models inherently
   include interactions, and as a result the interaction coefficient does
   not capture the full extent and complexity of the interaction effect.
   After exploring the complexities of interaction effects in non-linear
   models, we outline methods to estimate and understand the interaction
   effects in two widely used marketing models. We use 26 years of weekly
   US movie market data to test the interactions between critics' ratings
   and consumer sentiment about economic conditions on box office
   attendance. In addition to finding that movie attendance is
   counter-cyclical, an expected but not previously documented result, we
   also show, contrary to. popular belief, that critics' ratings have
   larger impact during economic downturns than during periods of economic
   expansion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although firms routinely use celebrity endorsers to influence consumer
   attitudes and firm value, the determinants of celebrity endorsement
   contract formation remain unexplored. This paper conceptualizes such
   contract formation as the outcome of a two-sided matching market, and
   develops an empirical model that jointly estimates firms' and
   celebrities' preferences for each other. This approach better captures
   strategic interaction in the market and alleviates biases arising from
   studying each party separately. Analysis of 79 endorsement contracts in
   the beauty industry reveals that brand personality drives endorsement
   partnerships. Congruent brand personality contracts are found to not
   always be optimal, and the effects of brand personality interaction to
   be highly asymmetric. Celebrities' profession (superstar/supermodel) and
   buzz (popularity on the Internet) moderate the effect of brand
   personality, such that, under certain conditions, celebrity buzz can be
   detrimental to the endorsement's value. The results of this article
   serve as a blueprint for firms to determine their likelihood of landing
   a contract with different types of celebrities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   ability to generate large-scale consumer interest. We develop a
   comprehensive framework for the drivers of celebrities' market
   popularity (in terms of consumer interest generated by celebrities)
   including variables related to actors, movies, and actor-movie fit. To
   test the framework, Internet search histories are examined for 161 film
   stars over the course of more than 6 years (January 2004-June 2010). In
   particular, we test three hypotheses. First, with regard to
   actor-related variables, we do not find support for the postulated
   inverted U-shaped effect from the frequency of movie appearances on the
   market popularity of film stars (H1). Rather, the results indicate a
   monotone and positive relationship between a film star's frequency of
   movie appearances and consumer interest in the film star. Second, with
   respect to movie-related factors, the findings indicate that both
   positive and negative abnormal movie revenues increase the popularity of
   film stars (H2). Third, concerning variables related to actor-movie fit,
   the results support the hypothesized U-shaped effect from actor-movie
   fit on the market popularity of film stars (H3). On a managerial level,
   this study provides insights for film stars on how to enhance their
   market popularity by increasing the frequency of their movie appearances
   and by selecting films that are likely to generate abnormal revenues and
   have a certain fit with their image. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Buying behavior in the video game market can be conceptualized as a
   two-stage process where users first purchase a console and then purchase
   content for that console. As a result, the sales of consoles and content
   in this market are interdependent and together form a platform mediated
   market. Established research on platform-mediated markets has
   highlighted the effects of installed base size (or the number of
   consumer who have adopted the platform) on content sales. In other
   words, how does the number of console users impact sales of content
   designed for that platform? Here, we extend the research on installed
   base effects on content sales by examining two characteristics of
   installed bases: installed base innovativeness and recency. Installed
   base innovativeness is defined by the proportion of the installed base
   that adopted the platform early in the platform product's lifecycle.
   Installed base recency is defined as the proportion of the installed
   base that adopted the platform in recent weeks. We find that installed
   bases with higher innovativeness or higher recency purchase more content
   than less innovative or lower recency installed bases. We also find that
   installed base recency has a larger positive effect on content sales
   when an installed base is less innovative. These results suggest that
   content sales depend on more than just installed base size. In fact,
   there may be opportunities to increase content sales by releasing new
   content not just when the installed base is at its largest, but also
   when the installed base is considered more innovative and recent (C)

   addition, we explore whether a company's brand equity and engagement in
   online chatter potentially mitigate the negative effects of social media
   surrounding the recall. We operationalize four metrics of online
   word-of-mouth (WOM) that may moderate negative product recall effects:
   volume, valence, growth rate, and breadth. The findings suggest that
   product recalls result in significantly negative abnormal returns for
   firms. Furthermore, the volume, valence and growth rate of online WOM
   exacerbate this negative effect of a product recall on firm value. Most
   importantly, we find negative effects of the volume and the valence of
   online WOM on firm value are lower for brands with strong brand equity.
   Surprisingly, we find no effect of company involvement in mitigating the

AB Brands increasingly use digital platforms to co-create social
   responsibility initiatives with consumers. The present research explores
   the branding implications of an emerging form of such co-created social
   responsibility, cause-related marketing (CM) with choice, in which the
   consumer, not the brand, chooses the charitable cause to which the brand
   will donate in response to the consumer's purchase. Study 1 shows that
   CM with choice strengthens brand attachment, an effect that is (1)
   stronger with unrestricted (i.e., choose any cause) than restricted
   (i.e., select from a list) choice and (2) serially mediated by consumer
   empowerment and engagement. Study 2 replicates these effects and extends
   them to brand attitudes while showing that expanding the number of cause
   options to as many as 48 increases decision difficulty but does not
   alter brand attachment or attitudes a case of scope neglect prevailing
   instead of choice overload. Study 3 reveals that positive CM-with-choice
   effects are not universal. While introducing a conventional CM campaign
   improves brand outcomes (attachment, attitudes, and purchase intentions)
   regardless of brand image (negative, neutral, or positive), adding
   consumer cause choice to the campaign benefits brands as much as (or
   more than) introducing the campaign itself does, but only when brand
   image is neutral or positive. When brand image is negative, adding
   consumer cause choice fails to improve brand outcomes and can even
   backfire, as consumers prefer to keep their distance. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Despite conventional wisdom that firm profits decrease with competitive
   entry, the empirical literature finds a number of situations where the
   entry of an equivalent-quality competitor into a market led to higher
   profits for the incumbents. Our paper uses a standard linear Hotelling
   (1929) market to study how location choices affect the possibility that
   profits increase for the incumbents with competitive entry by a new
   rival. We show that profits of all incumbents can increase after
   competitive entry even if the new competitor is located such that it
   competes directly with only one of the incumbents. This asymmetric entry
   demonstrates two separate mechanisms that can lead to profit increases:
   first, profits can increase because a rival's pricing incentives have
   changed, causing the rival firm to increase its price. Second, entry can
   change a firm's own pricing incentives, which in turn cause the
   competitor to increase its price anticipating a higher-priced
   equilibrium. Either of these effects on their own can be sufficient for
   profits to increase. Of course, increased prices do not imply increased
   profits. Rather, profits only increase in scenarios where the higher
   prices offset the lost sales. As such, we note that profits for a
   monopolist are always higher than profits for firms facing any level of
   competition. Further, we show that average industry profits must
   eventually go to zero. Thus, the relationship between profits and the
   number of firms in the market for industries with profit-increasing
   entry follows a down-up-down shape. We discuss the implications this has
   on interpreting results from the empirical entry literature. (C) 2015

   heterogeneity in spending patterns; (ii) interrelationship of
   expenditures across firms and categories, called simultaneity; and (iii)
   data censoring, which occurs when consumers have zero expenditure in a
   category. The model is estimated on credit card data using Bayesian
   estimation. Two segments are revealed. One comprises 76% of consumers
   and is characterized by habitual spending patterns. The other 24% of
   consumers spend based on income allocation. Segments show different
   interrelationship of expenditures across firms and categories. Thus,
   this paper contributes a methodological tool for more accurate
   prediction of size-of-wallet and share-of-wallet and better targeting of
   customers when expenditures at competing firms are unavailable. This is
   accomplished by considering consumer heterogeneity and asymmetric
   complementary and substitute interactions between expenditures.

AB Collinearity is inevitable in moderated regression models. Marketing
   scholars use a variety of collinearity diagnostics including variance
   inflation factors (VIFs) and condition indices in order to diagnose the
   extent of collinearity in moderated models. In this paper, we show that
   VIFs are likely to misdiagnose the extent of collinearity problems by
   conflating lack of variability (small variance) or lack of magnitude
   (small mean) in data for collinearity. Condition indices. accurately
   diagnose collinearity, however, they fail to identify when collinearity
   is actually harmful to statistical inferences. We propose a new measure,
   C-2, based on raw data, which diagnoses the extent of collinearity in
   moderated regression models. More importantly, this C-2 measure, in
   conjunction with the t-statistic of the non-significant coefficient, can
   indicate adverse effects of collinearity in terms "of distorting
   statistical inferences and how much collinearity would have to disappear
   to generate significant results. The efficacy of C-2 over VIFs and
   condition indices is demonstrated using simulated data and its
   usefulness in moderated regressions is illustrated in an empirical study
   of brand extensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research demonstrates that information threatening a consumer's
   self-association with a brand can increase preference for the threatened
   brand, an effect termed brand pursuit. Summing across a field study and
   three experiments, the research shows that experienced anxiety mediates
   the effect of threat on brand pursuit, that a-priori self-brand
   association strength moderates the effect of threat (since those with
   stronger association experience more anxiety in response to threat), and
   that reinforcing the self on other dimensions eliminates the effect of
   threat on brand pursuit. In addition, this research proposes that
   self-concept threats are best understood if conceptualized in terms of
   the specific associations they target. The key implication of these
   findings is that threats to self-brand associations can be an effective
   strategy for increasing brand preference, a tactic contrary to marketing
   convention. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Online customer reviews (OCRs) have become a major source of information
   for customers in the Internet. Understanding the impact of OCRs on
   customers' decisions is an important challenge for academics and
   practitioners. We apply a choice-based conjoint experiment that combines
   all relevant levels of the OCR dimensions (valence, volume, and
   variance) and that estimates the effect of OCRs on choice. The
   experimental setting allows us to estimate the direct effects but also
   the interaction effects of the OCR dimensions, which have been largely
   neglected in previous research. The impact of the OCR dimensions is
   evaluated against the results from a control group that did not face
   OCRs when making their choices. Therefore, our experiment enables us to
   investigate the extent to which the presence of OCRs affects customers'
   consideration of brand, price, and technical product attributes. By
   contrast to previous findings, our results show that volume and variance
   do not affect customers' choices directly but that they moderate the
   impact of valence on customers' choices. Moreover, we find that OCRs
   decrease the importance of brand for customer purchase decisions,
   indicating that managing OCRs have become a challenge for brand
   management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Companies are increasingly allocating more of their marketing spending
   to social media programs. Yet there is little research about how social
   media use is associated with consumer-brand relationships. We conducted
   three studies to explore how individual and national differences
   influence the relationship between social media use and customer brand
   relationships. The first study surveyed customers in France, the U.K.
   and U.S. and compared those who engage with their favorite brands via
   social media with those who do not. The findings indicated that social
   media use was positively related with brand relationship quality and the
   effect was more pronounced with high anthropomorphism perceptions (the
   extent to which consumers' associate human characteristics with brands).
   Two subsequent experiments further validated these findings and
   confirmed that cultural differences, specifically uncertainty avoidance,
   moderated these results. We obtained robust and convergent results from
   survey and experimental data using both student and adult consumer
   samples and testing across three product categories (athletic shoes,
   notebook computers, and automobiles). The results offer cross-national
   support for the proposition that engaging customers via social media is
   associated with higher consumer-brand relationships and word of mouth
   communications when consumers anthropomorphize the brand and they avoid
   uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Marketers aim to increase active participation in their brand
   communities on social networking sites to achieve favorable brand
   outcomes. This paper is the first to analyze the moderating influence of
   community type (i.e., whether members primarily strive for social versus
   functional goals) on the effect of (a) negative word of mouth (nWOM) and
   (b) positive word of mouth (pWOM) on brand community outcomes.
   Specifically, we analyzed the effects on community members' perceived
   goal instrumentality of social network brand communities (i.e., whether
   the community increases the likelihood that personal goals will be
   achieved) and active participation in these brand communities. The
   results of a field study and three laboratory experiments reveal that
   nWOM evokes more negative consumer reactions in social-goal communities
   than in functional-goal communities. However, pWOM evokes more positive
   consumer reactions in social-goal communities than in functional-goal

   entailing both relational activities and offerings, at the intersection

   managing quality to achieve better business performance. Although
   previous research has shown the superiority of a revenue emphasis for

   adopts a cognitive approach to strategy and examines managers' mental

   longitudinal, multi-level study, we surveyed managers at two points in
   time to collect information about their individual ("I believe...") and
   their divisions' collective ("We believe...") revenue and cost mental
   models for managing quality. Our research shows that the collective
   revenue emphasis converges toward the individual revenue emphasis over
   time, while the individual cost emphasis converges toward the collective
   cost emphasis. We show that this revenue emphasis convergence is related
   to improved business performance, but cost emphasis convergence is not.

AB The amount of crime to which individuals are exposed on a daily basis is
   growing, resulting in increased anxiety about being alone in some public
   places. Fear of crime usually results in avoidance of places that are
   perceived to be unsafe, and such avoidance can have negative financial
   consequences. What can be done to reduce fear in relatively safe public
   places that are nevertheless perceived as being unsafe? In this paper,
   we explore the effect of auditory input (type of ambient sound) on
   perceived social presence and one's feeling-of-safety in public spaces
   such as car parks and metro stations. In one field study and four
   laboratory studies, we demonstrate that different ambient sounds convey
   social presence to a different degree. When perceived social presence is
   higher and positive, the feeling-of-safety is also higher. Additionally,
   we show that an increase in perceived safety has a positive effect on
   consumers' satisfaction with the public area and even raises their
   willingness to purchase a monthly membership card for the public area.
   Furthermore, the effect of ambient sound on such consumer responses is
   serially mediated by perceived social presence and feeling-of-safety.

AB This research examines the roles of brand cultural symbolism and
   advertising type (i.e., bilingual vs. host country language) in
   influencing brand liking among biculturals (people who equally identify
   with two distinct cultures). Across four experiments, we show that a
   brand's cultural symbolism (or the degree to which a brand symbolizes a
   cultural group) moderates the impact of bilingual advertising (vs.
   English-language advertising) on brand liking among biculturals. Brands
   low in cultural symbolism can appeal to some types of biculturals by
   engaging in bilingual advertising, whereas there is no significant
   improvement in brand liking when bilingual advertising is paired with
   host-culture symbolic brands. This research also highlights the role of
   bicultural identity integration (BII), or the degree to which
   biculturals perceive their mainstream (host) and ethnic (home)
   identities as compatible (versus incompatible), as a key process
   mechanism that mediates these effects. We demonstrate that at high
   levels of BII, biculturals react more favorably to a bilingual ad than
   an English ad, but only for a less symbolic brand. At low levels of BII,
   advertising type has no significant effect on biculturals' brand
   evaluations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Emphasized by the World Health Organization as one of its key topics,
   patient empowerment (PE)-i.e., the set of self-determined behaviors
   based on patients' individual needs for developing autonomy and
   competence with their disease-is today regarded as a key component of a
   patient-centered approach to healthcare. Unfortunately, research lacks a
   clear understanding of the drivers of PE, its relationship to therapy
   compliance, and its role in different types of diseases. Using a large
   sample of 1622 patients suffering from chronic diseases, this study
   addresses these critical research gaps and provides three major
   contributions. First, by exploring the influence of PE antecedents
   (i.e., patients' health involvement, self-efficacy, and acceptance of
   physician authority), it provides specific recommendations on how to
   effectively manage PE (defined in terms of three dimensions: information
   search, knowledge development, and decision participation). Second, it
   demonstrates the importance of PE and its antecedents for affecting
   patients' therapy compliance and shows that, depending on the PE
   dimension, therapy compliance is either enhanced or reduced. By
   highlighting the ambiguous role of PE in therapy compliance, the study
   offers specific suggestions for healthcare stakeholders on how to
   maximize patients' compliance to recommended therapies. Third, the study
   provides important insights into the role of PE across different types
   of chronic diseases, offering practical recommendations on how to deal
   with patients depending on their particular disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Deal-of-the-day (DoD) promotions are nowadays very popular. As a special
   form of a price promotion, they allow firms to offer products at
   substantial price discounts, usually at or above 50%, for a very limited
   period of time, usually between one and seven days. Conventional wisdom
   suggests that both characteristics, high discount levels and tight time
   constraints, should make DoDs an effective form of a price promotion.
   However, the two characteristics do not necessarily combine to increase
   DoD effectiveness. In particular, the authors propose that depending on
   the type of a promoted product (utilitarian vs. hedonic), the attention
   that consumers pay to the discount level relative to the time constraint
   varies, which leads to differences in promotional effectiveness. Two
   studies, a lab experiment and a field study using data from the DoD
   platform Groupon, mostly confirm these hypotheses: the time constraint
   increases promotional effectiveness more for hedonic than for
   utilitarian products, whereas the discount level increases promotional
   effectiveness for utilitarian more than for hedonic products. In the
   Groupon data, very high discount levels actually decrease promotional
   effectiveness for hedonic products. The results suggest that designers
   of DoD promotions should consider the type of a promoted product when
   choosing appropriate time constraints and discount levels. (C) 2015

AB We examine how impression management can influence the types of products
   consumers suggest for joint consumption in same-gender and mixed-gender
   situations. We show that when motivated to engage in impression
   management, those who care the most about their self-presentations (high
   self-monitors) are more likely to choose products that take into account
   the need to accommodate the co-consumer's preferences as well as the
   desire to remain consistent with gender role expectations and to correct
   negative expectations of sexism. Whereas the co-consumers' preferences
   and chooser's gender role expectations are aligned in same-gender
   situations (i.e., females consuming with females), in cross-gender
   situations (i.e., males consuming with females), male consumers'
   willingness to accommodate the female co-consumer's preferences is
   limited by gender role expectations in certain social contexts (e.g.,
   romantic relationships). Within mixed-gender situations, we also find
   that high self-monitoring male consumers' ability to accommodate a
   feminist female co-consumers' preferences is limited by the desire to
   correct negative expectations and avoid appearing sexist. (C) 2015

AB When companies launch new products, they need to understand the impact
   of publicity and advertising on sales. What is their relative
   effectiveness? Do they strengthen each other (have a positive
   interaction effect) or weaken each other (have a negative interaction
   effect)? Further, does the timing of these activities (before or after
   launch) affect their impact on sales? This paper develops hypotheses
   regarding the elasticities of pre- and post-launch publicity and
   advertising on sales. The hypotheses are tested on a large-scale
   empirical data set that tracks sales, publicity, and advertising for
   3336 video games across 52 weeks covering the pre- and post-launch
   phases. The results demonstrate that pre-launch publicity is more
   effective than pre-launch advertising but that the reverse is true
   post-launch. Surprisingly, the analysis reveals a negative interaction
   effect between pre-launch advertising and publicity, which means that
   publicity becomes less effective when it is accompanied by higher levels
   of advertising for the same product. Simulations indicate that companies
   can gain most sales by focusing on publicity pre-launch, and that there
   is little benefit from increasing publicity and advertising during the
   same phase, which is consistent with negative (pre-launch) and zero
   (post-launch) interaction effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   discounted utility theory because their discount rates are context
   dependent. Recent literature incorporates decision makers' subjective
   perception of time into the classic discounted utility model and finds
   relatively constant discount rates over subjective time. In the current

AB We contrast the philosophy guiding the Replication Corner at IJRM with
   replication efforts in psychology. Psychology has promoted "exact" or
   "direct" replications, reflecting an interest in statistical conclusion
   validity of the original findings. Implicitly, this philosophy treats
   non-replication as evidence that the original finding is not "real" - a
   conclusion that we believe is unwarranted. In contrast, we have
   encouraged "conceptual replications" (replicating at the construct level
   but with different operationalization) and "replications with
   extensions", reflecting our interest in providing evidence on the
   external validity and generalizability of published findings. In
   particular, our belief is that this replication philosophy allows for
   both replication and the creation of new knowledge. We express our views
   about why we believe our approach is more constructive, and describe
   lessons learned in the three years we have been involved in editing the

AB For their online shops, multichannel retailers must decide whether to
   adopt a prototypical design (with channel-specific attributes) or a
   homogenous design (with cues corresponding to their physical stores).
   While most retailers use a prototypical design, we propose that the
   effectiveness of a Web design depends on customers' cognitive shopping
   orientations (i.e., specific schemas of store-based or web-based
   experiences) and their situational processing intensity (i.e., the level
   of cognitive processing). Three experiments reveal that a homogenous
   design increases online shop patronage among store-oriented customers if
   processing intensity is high; a prototypical design does not affect
   patronage among web-oriented customers. To capitalize on a homogenous
   design, multichannel retailers should activate customers' cognitive
   processing, such as with non-competitive pricing or task involvement. If
   store-based orientation or cognitive processing is low across the
   customer base, a prototypical design works as well as a homogenous
   design. Because retailers can induce a store-based orientation through
   highly visible physical cues in stores, multichannel retailing may
   evolve to a competition for customers' mindsets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Through a replication and extension of Hsee and Rottenstreich (2004), we
   examine how scope impacts consumer donation behavior. We find that
   consumers are more insensitive to scope when making donations if
   valuations are based on emotions as opposed to calculation. We then
   demonstrate how a consumer's ability to understand emotional information
   impacts their sensitivity to scope. Specifically, the less able
   consumers are to understand their emotions, the more likely they are to
   rely on scope when donating to charity. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Advance payment systems represent a pricing innovation, in which
   companies predict customers' future consumption for the following year
   and then bill a series of monthly, uniform advance payments. Any
   difference between predicted and actual consumption gets settled at the
   end of the year with a refund or extra payment. Companies thus gain
   earlier access to funds and lower risk of customer defaults; customers
   benefit from predictable monthly payments. However, customers' reactions
   to a refund or extra payment sequence in an advance payment system
   remain unclear. Three theoretical lenses offer predictions about
   customers' advance payment system preferences: prospect theory, with a
   focus on silver lining and hedonic editing principles; mental
   accounting; and the value of sequences. Using three empirical studies
   with survey and billing data of more than 20,000 customers to examine
   their reactions to refunds and extra payments, this paper reveals that
   receiving a refund reduces customers' price awareness, increases their
   recommendation likelihood, and reduces churn and tariff switching, as
   long as the refund is not too high. The findings illustrate both the
   consequences and the boundary conditions of the silver lining principle
   with large-scale field studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Armed with improved targeting technology, firms are increasingly
   interested in optimizing their advertising dollars through consumer
   segment-specific targeting, particularly while introducing new products.
   That task becomes especially important in markets with distinct consumer
   segments the early market and the main market that affect each other's
   adoption behavior. In this study, in contrast to prior normative studies
   that assume a single-segment market structure, we derive dynamic optimal
   advertising and segment-specific targeting strategies for firms facing a
   two-segment market structure. We allow for mutual demand interactions
   between the two segments, and for the diffusion parameters, advertising
   sensitivity, and cost of targeting to differ across the segments. We
   model the effect of advertising as a logarithmic function that accounts
   for diminishing marginal returns. Among our key findings: From profit
   optimization perspective, our two-segment model outperforms the
   single-segment model under multiple diffusion dynamics contexts
   especially for the 'bimodal chasm' and the 'early dip followed by
   bell-shaped' type diffusion patterns even when the cost of targeting the
   early market is relatively high. Our numerical analyses indicate that
   the optimal share of advertisement targeted to the early market segment
   at launch needs to be much higher than the share of the early market
   segment in the population. Advertising sensitivity, relative cost of
   targeting the early market, and the proportion of early market consumers
   in the population have the greatest effects on the optimal time to
   transition the targeted advertising spending from the early to the main
   market segment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present article explores price fairness perceptions in the specific
   setting of new product launch prices. In this context, the process of
   forming price fairness judgments by comparing the price to be judged
   with the price in a reference transaction is thwarted by the fact that
   reference transactions are not readily available. Following the
   conceptual logic on the development of price fairness judgments, results
   from three experimental consumer studies reveal that price fairness is
   the key link between launch price and adoption intention but that this
   relationship is moderated by transaction similarity and social norms.
   More specifically, transaction similarity, captured by the degree of
   product newness and future expected price change, determines the
   comparators consumers will use in their evaluative effort and mitigates
   the negative launch price-perceived price fairness relationship. In
   consequence, consumers use existing products to judge prices of
   incrementally new products. Given the reduced similarity of reference
   transactions for really new products, consumers rather rely on future
   prices in their price fairness judgments providing evidence for
   consumers' forward-looking evaluation. The present study captures social
   norms by the concept of consumer innovativeness and results demonstrate
   that due to the inherent uncertainty of really new products, consumer
   innovativeness influences the extent to which individuals engage in
   price comparisons when judging the fairness of launch prices of these
   products. The authors conclude by deriving implications for the price
   setting of new products. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines three different ways to balance market exploration
   and market exploitation in product innovation. First, following the
   knowledge-based view, we examine whether market exploration and market
   exploitation have differential effects on various new product outcomes
   based on their different learning mechanisms. We find that market
   exploration facilitates new product innovativeness, whereas market
   exploitation is more beneficial for new product development speed. This
   indicates that market exploration and market exploitation influence new
   product financial performance via distinct paths. Second, we examine the
   interaction between market exploration and market exploitation on new
   product outcomes. Our findings indicate that the joint effects of market
   exploration and market exploitation reduce new product development speed
   and have no significant impact on new product innovativeness. Third, we
   examine the contingent role of customer need tacitness in influencing
   the effects of market exploration and market exploitation. Our results
   show that customer need tacitness strengthens the effects of market
   exploration on both new product innovativeness and new product
   development speed. In contrast, it weakens the effect of market
   exploitation on new product innovativeness, and has no significant
   influence on new product development speed. Our results provide specific
   guidelines for managers regarding how to achieve a balance between
   market exploration and market exploitation in product innovation. (C)

   future period sales, we find competition often leads firms to overstate
   quality unless they are constrained by high legal costs imposed by

   competitors are constrained to be truthful in their advertising due to

AB Innovation-driven durable goods markets see substantial changes in
   quality and available choice sets and subsequent changes of the
   reference quality in the market over time. Considering the
   multi-attribute characteristics of these goods, it is important for
   businesses to identify attribute-specific competitive landscapes and
   develop competitive innovation strategies at the product attribute
   level. Therefore, this paper proposes a reference-dependent choice model
   for product quality at the product attribute level that can capture the
   asymmetric effect of innovation shocks on product demand, i.e., the
   innovation elasticity of demand, as well as the competitive market
   structure in product innovation. Moreover, we confirm that there is a
   certain quality span for a product attribute where the values of
   products depreciate most significantly due to innovation shocks, which
   we refer to as the innovation shadow zone. We demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach in developing attribute-specific
   product innovation strategies using U.S. mobile telephone market data.

   competencies are indeed mediators of the positive relationships between
   orientations and market-based innovation. Also, market-based innovation
   mediates the positive relationships between customer and competitor
   knowledge competencies and overall firm performance. A cross-country
   comparison reveals that, in the U.S. as compared to Chinese firms,
   customer (or competitor) orientation leads to both higher customer (or

AB The marketing literature documents inconsistent results on the link
   between Market Orientation (MO) and innovation performance. The agency
   theory suggests that agency problems exist in firms between the
   principal (owner) and the agent (managers). A proper firm ownership
   structure design may solve the principal-agent problem. In this study,
   we investigate an understudied research question: whether and how
   ownership structures may affect the relationship between MO and
   innovation performance? We posit that firms should align three different
   dimensions of ownership structures with MO in order to achieve a
   superior innovation performance. We assembled a unique data set, with
   242 publicly-traded companies, by merging three different data sources
   in an emerging market China to test our framework. The results support
   our proposed model, and confirm the moderating role of ownership
   structures in the relationship between market orientation and firm
   innovation performance in China. First, all things being equal,
   non-state-owned firms may achieve a higher level of innovation
   performance than their state-owned counterparts through their
   implementation of MO. Second, allowing top managers to have a certain
   fraction of the firm's ownership stake (called managerial ownership),
   that can switch risk preference and time preference of top manager's to
   those of shareholders, may foster the effect of MO on innovation
   performance. Third, a high ratio of major owners over minor owners
   (named as ownership concentration), that can empower and motivate
   shareholders to closely monitor a manager's behavior, may also
   strengthen the relationship between MO and innovation performance. The
   Chinese data from a transition economy sheds light on the ownership
   structure reforms in China, and provides novel new insights to the
   marketing theory and practice regarding the role of two new additional
   emerging dimensions of ownership structures - managerial ownership and
   ownership concentration in the relationship between MO and innovation
   performance. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed, and
   several avenues for future research are proposed. Published by Elsevier

AB Demand-enhancing services like automated help desks, toll-free technical
   support hotlines or delivery and installation services are routinely
   offered to consumers by manufacturers or retailers or both. This paper
   examines how the identity of the channel member (manufacturer or
   retailer) providing the demand-enhancing services can have a different
   impact on the manufacturer's product quality decisions and resultant
   channel and consumer welfare. We show that when a manufacturer wishing
   to sell its entire product line through a retailer provides
   demand-enhancing services to consumers, then it chooses higher product
   quality levels and channel member profits and consumer welfare are
   higher. However, when the retailer selling the manufacturer's product
   line is the one who provides the demand-enhancing services, then the
   manufacturer may choose a lower product quality level and retailer
   profit and consumer welfare may be lower. Our results therefore indicate
   that a manufacturer should not simply look at cost savings arising from
   shifting service responsibilities from itself to the retailer.
   Similarly, a retailer should not expect to always benefit from
   situations where it has secured the ability to choose its own desired
   levels of services to be provided to consumers. Published by Elsevier

AB Recognizing the importance of the person who occupies the chief
   marketing officer (CMO) position, we posit that a CMOs managerial
   capital, as signaled by his or her education, origin, and experience,
   indicates what a new CMO can bring to the table. We theorize that the
   value of CMO managerial capital is contingent on organizational
   demographics (firm age and size) and industry environment (dynamism and
   growth). Results from multi-source data collected on 303 CMO successions
   between 1996 and 2009 and an event study approach with corrections for
   unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity reveals a positive influence of
   CMO's education and outsider status on abnormal returns associated with
   CMO succession and a U-shaped relationship between CMO experience and
   firm value. In terms of the moderation effects, we find that the value
   of CMO experience increases as the firm size increases; value of CMO
   external origin decreases whereas that of CMO experience increases with
   firm age; value of CMO education increases whereas that of outsider
   status and experience decreases with industry dynamism; and value of CMO
   education and experience increases as industry growth increases. (C)

AB How does the influence of the marketing department within an
   organization affect marketing managers' dissemination of market
   intelligence (i.e., knowledge about customer needs and competitor
   activities) to managers of other departments? Three studies with 711
   executive managers and integrated survey and experimental data offer
   insights. Rather than the positive relationship indicated by
   conventional wisdom, the study results indicate a curvilinear, inverted
   U-shaped effect of marketing's influence on marketing managers'
   dissemination of market intelligence. Managers in a marketing department
   with moderate influence within the organization are significantly more
   likely to disseminate market intelligence than are those in low and,
   interestingly, those in high influence departments. This finding adds
   nuance to the existing body of knowledge showing countervailing effects
   of a strong marketing department and implies that executives need to
   carefully manage the organization's culture to ensure well-balanced
   influences of the marketing department in relation to other corporate
   functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Studies show that failing to align formal contracts with transaction
   attributes reduces relationship performance. However, few studies
   consider either how the effects of misalignment differ across outcome
   types or the mechanisms through which misalignment affects performance.
   This study examines the effects of misaligned formal contracting on two
   types of outcomes, i.e., end-product enhancements and cost reductions,
   and on one mechanism through which misalignment affects performance,
   i.e., relational contracting. Using survey data from 305 buyer-supplier
   relationships in the Scandinavian wood industry, the findings suggest
   that (1) misalignment has a significantly stronger negative effect on
   end-product enhancements than on cost reductions, and (2) relational
   contracts mediate the effect of misaligned formal contracting on
   performance. Firms in the sample experience significant
   misalignment-related losses of 10.3% and 5.3% in end-product
   enhancements and cost reductions, respectively. The findings suggest
   that misalignment is particularly harmful to performance outcomes that
   rely on relational contracting, such as end-product enhancements. (C)

AB This study systematically compares different customer feedback metrics
   (CFMs) - namely customer satisfaction, the Net Promoter Score, and the
   Customer Effort Score - to test their ability to predict retention
   across a wide range of industries. We classify the CFMs according to a
   time focus (past, present, or future) and whether the full scale of the
   CFM is used or whether the focus is only on the extremes (e.g.,
   top-2-box customer satisfaction). The data for this study represent
   customers of 93 firms across 18 industries. Multi-level probit
   regression models, which control for self-selection bias of respondents,
   investigate firm-, customer-, and industry-level effects simultaneously.
   Overall, we find that the top-2-box customer satisfaction performs best
   for predicting customer retention and that focusing on the extremes is
   preferable to using the full scale. However the best CFM does differ
   depending on industry and the unit of analysis (i.e., comparing
   customers or firms with one another). Furthermore, combining CFMs, along
   with simultaneously investigating multiple dimensions of the customer
   relationship, improves predictions even further. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although many brand managers favor the use of celebrities in
   advertisements, others worry that celebrities overshadow the brand and
   thus impair brand recall. Practitioners refer to this overshadowing as
   the vampire effect, defined as a decrease in brand recall for an
   advertising stimulus that features a celebrity endorser versus the same
   stimulus with an unknown but equally attractive endorser. Because there
   is no agreement about whether this overshadowing really exists, this
   research analyzes the existence of the vampire effect and its moderators
   in a series of experiments with a total of 4,970 respondents. The
   results provide important insights into how to avoid the vampire effect
   by creating appropriate conditions, such as high endorser-brand
   congruence or a strong cognitive link between the celebrity and the
   brand. Surprisingly, brand familiarity does not significantly moderate
   the effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mixed bundling (MB), in which products are sold separately and as a
   bundle, is a form of second degree price discrimination. In this study
   we examine how MB and its variants compare against reserved product
   pricing (RPP), a form of co-promotion. Used by Amazon.com, among others,
   RPP consists of the firm offering individual products and then enticing
   single product buyers with a discount on the second product. Our
   analytical model has a monopolist offering two products to a mix of
   myopic and strategic consumers. We find that as long as the market
   consists of a "modest" fraction of myopic consumers, RPP is more
   profitable than mixed bundling and its special cases. We also present
   pricing results under RPP. An extension shows that RPP can also be more
   profitable than a form of price skimming. Limitations and future

AB Despite sustained interest in product alliance activity, little is known
   regarding the effect of product alliances on shareholder value. Whereas
   proponents of alliances justify their formation by emphasizing access to
   relevant resources and know-how. critics highlight the risks inherent in
   alliance partner opportunism. To reconcile these opposing viewpoints, we
   develop and test a conceptual framework that predicts the impact of
   product alliance activity and the broader network it engenders on
   shareholder value: stock returns, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic
   risk. Our examination of 359 biopharmaceutical firms and their
   associated networks over a 20-year observation window shows that
   unanticipated product alliance activity is associated with not only
   lower idiosyncratic risk, but also with lower stock returns.
   Unanticipated network centrality of the focal firm and the unanticipated
   density of ties in its extended network significantly moderate the
   effects of product alliance activity. Our findings help to reconcile the
   divergent views on product alliance activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All

AB While several studies find a positive impact of brand value on firm
   value, we still know very little on the variables moderating the brand
   value-firm value relation. In this study, we address this gap in the
   literature by developing and testing a new framework on the
   contingencies affecting the impact of brand value changes on stock
   returns. Drawing from branding theory, we hypothesize that stock price
   reactions to brand value changes are more positive for firms with high
   cash flow vulnerability, valuable growth opportunities, and high
   potential for further product or service price increases. We empirically
   examine the importance of these three moderators through an event study
   analysis of 503 brand value announcements derived from Interbrand's Best
   Global Brands lists from 2001 to 2012. We obtain evidence of significant
   abnormal stock returns on brand value announcement dates, with a brand
   to firm value conversion rate of approximately 4%. Cross-sectional
   regression analyses of announcement day abnormal stock returns suggest
   that shareholders mainly value the potential of brands to reduce cash
   flow vulnerability to adverse shocks. We obtain only mixed evidence on
   the importance of brands in generating growth, and no evidence for their
   role in allowing firms to set higher prices. Our results, which hold
   under a range of sensitivity tests, yield clear managerial guidelines
   regarding the types of firms for which strong brands matter most. (C)

AB The number of citations a paper receives is the most commonly used
   measure of scientific impact. In this paper, we study not only the
   number but also the type of citations that 659 marketing articles
   generated. We discern five citation types: application, affirmation,
   negation, review and perfunctory mention (i.e., citing an article only
   indirectly without really using it). Prior literature in scientometrics
   recognizes that the former three types, on average, signal a higher
   level of scientific indebtedness than the latter two types. In our
   sample, these three types of citation represent only 15% of all
   citations. We also find different determinants of citation behavior
   across citation types. Across the 49 determinants we included, only 13
   have the same effect across all citation types, of which only 5 are
   statistically significant across all citation types. For instance, we
   find a significant inverted U-effect of challenging commonly held
   beliefs on citation counts, but only for three of the citation types:
   affirmation, review and perfunctory mention. Our results encourage
   scientific stakeholders to move beyond mere citation counts to assess a
   paper's or a scholar's scientific contribution, as well as to devote
   greater attention to the citation process itself. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB The customer lifetime value combines into one construct the transaction
   timing, spending and dropout processes that characterize the purchase
   behavior of customers. Recently, the potential relationship between
   these processes, either at the individual customer level (i.e.
   intro-customer correlation) or between customers (i.e. intercustomer
   correlation), has received more attention. In this paper, we propose to
   jointly unveil the direction and intensity of these correlations using
   copulas. We investigate the presence of these correlations in four
   distinct product categories, namely online music albums sales,
   securities transactions, and utilitarian and hedonic fastmoving consumer
   good retail sales.
   For all product categories, we find a substantial amount of inter- and
   intra-customer correlation. At the inter-customer level, on average
   frequent buyers tend to spend more per transaction than the other
   customers. In addition, on average, large buyers have a longer lifetime.
   At the intra-customer level, we find that the existence and intensity of
   compensating purchase behaviors vary across product categories and
   across customers. From a managerial viewpoint, our approach improves the
   forecasts of the firm's future cash flows, especially for the product
   categories and customers where the correlations are the strongest.
   Moreover, the correlation parameters also provide additional insights to
   traditional customer valuation analysis on the magnitude, durability and
   volatility of the cash flows that each customer generates. We conclude
   by discussing how these insights can be used to improve customer
   portfolio decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article explores how framing a promotional package (Le., presenting
   the promotion as a bundle versus as a free gift) influences consumers'
   price assignments to the individual items in the package. It examines
   the potential influences of framing on consumers' perceptions of price
   increases and repurchase intentions after the promotion expires. The
   findings show that when a package contains two different products,
   consumers in the free gift (bundle) condition assign a higher price to
   the focal (supplementary) product, perceive a smaller price increase,
   and exhibit higher repurchase intentions toward the focal
   (supplementary) product after the promotion ends. If the promotional
   package contains two identical products, the free gift promotion
   generates higher perceived price increases and lower repurchase
   intentions than a price bundle, through similar price assignment
   mechanisms. An incentive-compatible experimental design finds that a
   free gift promotion lowers consumers' willingness to pay for the target
   product compared with a price bundle promotion. The findings of this
   research have significant implications for both framing research and
   marketing practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we look at the donation behavior of donors who
   periodically contribute a preset amount to a particular charity. The
   charity firm makes extensive use of direct mail to nurture these donors,
   and in fact sends two types of mails, one that seeks to retain the
   donors (retention-seeking mails) and the other requesting them to
   upgrade their donation amount (upgrade-seeking mails). We study the
   different effects of the two types of direct mail on the donation
   behavior.To these mails, a donor has to respond by making two decisions:
   "should I continue donating or not?" and "should I upgrade or not?" We
   propose a multi-response model that accommodates not only the
   differential effects of the two types of mail on the donors, but also
   the possible correlation across the two response functions for each
   donor. We fit our model to a very large data set to explore whether our
   model can extract the unique impact of demographics and those of the two
   types of mail on the two aspects of donation behavior. What makes it
   more interesting is that the charity firm deliberately uses the observed
   donation behavior of people to design the two types of mail. in our
   model and estimation, we explicitly account for this endogenous effect
   to ensure that we measure the unbiased impact of the two types of mail
   on the two responses of the donors. Our results show that once we
   account for the endogenous effect and separately model the effect of
   different types of mail on each type of donor response, we get a much
   clearer picture of the "true" effects of these mails, as opposed to a
   simpler model that does not incorporate these effects. Firms are advised
   to not only carefully analyze the donation behavior of the donors but
   also carry out simulation exercises to understand the effects of mails
   in totality before taking action. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights

AB Tracking studies are prevalent in marketing research and virtually all
   the other social sciences. These studies are predominantly implemented
   via repeated independent, non-overlapping samples, which are much less
   costly than recruiting and maintaining a longitudinal panel that track
   the same sample over time. In the existing literature, data front
   repeated cross-sectional samples are analyzed either independently for
   each time period, or longitudinally by focusing on the dynamics of the
   aggregate measures (e.g., sample averages). In this study, we propose a
   multivariate state-space model that can be applied directly to the
   individual-level data from each of the independent samples.
   simultaneously taking advantage of three patterns embedded in the data:
   a) inter-temporal dependence within the population means of each
   variable, b) temporal co-movements across the population means of
   different variables and c) cross-sectional co-variation across
   individual responses within each sample. We illustrate our proposed
   model with two applications, demonstrating the benefits of making full
   use of all the available data. In the first illustration, we have access
   to all the individual-level purchase data from one large population of
   grocery shoppers over a span of 36 months. This provides us a testing
   ground for benchmarking our proposed model against existing approaches
   in a Monte Carlo experiment, where we show that our model outperforms
   all the alternatives in inferring population dynamics using data sampled
   through repeated cross-sections. We find that, as compared with using
   simple sample averages, our proposed model can improve the accuracy of
   repeated cross-sectional tracking studies by double digits. without
   incurring any additional data-gathering costs (or equivalently, reducing
   the data-gathering costs by double digits while maintaining the desired
   accuracy level). In the second illustration, we apply the proposed model
   to repeated crosssectional surveys that track customer perceptions and
   satisfaction for an automotive dealer, a situation often encountered by
   marketing researchers. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB The redemption of loyalty program (LP) rewards has an important impact
   on LP members' behavior, particularly on purchase behavior before and
   after redeeming a reward. However, little is known about the interplay
   between members' purchase and redemption behavior when members are not
   pressured with point expiration and they choose for themselves when and
   how much to redeem. In this context, the effects of redemption are not
   straightforward, as little additional effort is required from an LP
   member to obtain the reward. Analyzing the behavior of 3094 members in
   such an LP, we find that the mere decision to redeem a reward
   significantly enhances purchase behavior before and after the redemption
   event, even when members redeem just a fraction of their accumulated
   points. Conceptually, we refer to this enhancement as the redemption
   momentum, which is an alternative and novel explanation of the existence
   of pre-reward effects that do not depend on points-pressure. In addition
   to the overall impact of redemption on purchases, prior purchase
   behavior also enhances redemption decisions. Finally, we find a number
   of moderating effects on purchase and redemption behavior that derive
   from the length of LP membership, age, income and direct mailings. Our
   study's most important managerial implication is that firms should avoid
   imposing point expiry and/or binding thresholds in order to enhance
   members' purchase behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prior research comes to different conclusions as to what country
   characteristics drive diffusion patterns. One prime difficulty that may
   partially explain this divergence between studies is the sparseness of
   the data, in terms of the periodicity as well as the number of products
   and countries, in combination with the large number of potentially
   influential country characteristics. In face of such sparse data,
   scholars have used nested models, bivariate models and factor models to
   explore the role of country covariates. This paper uses Bayesian Lasso
   and Bayesian Elastic Net variable selection procedures as powerful
   approaches to identify the most important drivers of differences in Bass
   diffusion parameters across countries. We find that socio-economic and
   demographic country covariates (most pronouncedly so, economic wealth
   and education) have the strongest effect on all diffusion metrics we
   study. Our findings are a call for marketing scientists to devote
   greater attention to country covariate selection in international
   diffusion models, as well as to variable selection in marketing models
   at large. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Pay-per-bid auctions are a popular new type of Internet auction that is
   unique because a fee is charged for each bid that is placed. This paper
   uses a theoretical model and three large empirical data sets with 44,614
   ascending and 1,460 descending pay-per-bid auctions to compare the
   economic effects of different pay-per-bid auction formats, such as
   different price increments and ascending versus descending auctions. The
   theoretical model suggests revenue equivalence between different price
   increments and descending and ascending auctions. The empirical results,
   however, refute the theoretical predictions: ascending auctions with
   smaller price increments yield, on average, higher revenues per auction
   than ascending auctions with higher price increments, but their revenues
   vary much more strongly. On average, ascending auctions yield higher
   revenues per auction than descending auctions, but results differ
   strongly across product categories. Additionally, revenues per ascending
   auction also vary much more strongly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Decades of emotion research have demonstrated the unique influences of
   many specific emotions on consumer behaviors. These countless numbers of
   emotion effects can make it difficult to understand the role of emotions
   in consumer behavior. The current research introduces a parsimonious
   framework that can predict the effects of emotions on the consumer
   behavior of gift giving with just two appraisal dimensions: valence and
   agency. A series of studies examining gift giving reveals that positive
   emotions exert positive effects on gift giving, independent of their
   agency. In contrast, agency does predict the effects of negative
   emotions on gift giving. Negative self-caused emotions increase gift
   giving, whereas negative other-caused emotions decrease gift giving.
   These findings seem to hold for inactive and active emotions, and for
   uncertain and certain emotions. Together, these findings make a unique
   theoretical and empirical contribution to the understanding of emotions
   in gift giving. Moreover, it provides a pragmatic framework for both
   academics and practitioners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Advertising remains one of the most popular marketing instruments, and
   many studies have studied its sales effectiveness. However, prior
   research has either looked at the total spending of a brand/firm, or has
   focused on the most popular media, especially TV advertising. Even
   though huge amounts are also spent on "smaller" media such as billboards
   and cinema, little is known on their effectiveness.
   While many brands never use them (which could be a missed opportunity),
   others allocate a substantial part of their advertising budget to these
   media (which could represent spoiled arms in case of insufficient
   effectiveness). In this study, we conduct a large-scale empirical
   investigation, using close to 7 years of monthly data on over 250 brands
   of consumer packaged goods, to quantify the sales elasticity of these
   often-neglected media.
   Even though a significant long-run elasticity is found for a number of
   brands, we obtain a substantially lower proportion of significant
   effects for billboard and cinema advertising than for the more popular
   TV medium. Also meta-analytically, and after correcting for the brands'
   self-selection of media on which to spend their advertising budget, no
   evidence of a significant short- or long-run sales elasticity is found
   for these two media, while significant effects are obtained for both TV
   and magazine advertising. In addition, little evidence of systematic
   synergy effects with the more traditional media is found. Hence, from a
   sales-response point of view, investments in billboard and cinema
   advertising appear to act as spoiled arms for most mature CPG brands.

AB As sellers increasingly turn to multi-channel retailing, the opportunity
   to implement different pricing policies has grown. With the advent of
   the internet, many traditionally bargained products such as automobiles,
   jewelry, watches, appliances and furniture are now being offered online
   at a fixed pre-determined price. We explore the strategy of
   simultaneously offering two pricing formats (fixed and bargained) via
   two different channels (online and brick and mortar) and find that in a
   market where there are two types of consumers-those with a high cost of
   haggling and others with a lower cost-a dual-pricing strategy is optimal
   only when there are enough high haggling-cost consumers, but not too
   many, and when the haggling costs between the two types of consumers are
   sufficiently different We also find that it is optimal for the seller to
   specify a higher-than-cost minimum acceptable price as the price floor
   of bargaining. By doing so, the seller increases the bargained price by
   complementing the salesperson's bargaining ability, and also softens the
   internal competition between the two channels. Finally, we find that,
   surprisingly, the dual-pricing strategy may serve fewer customers while
   still being more profitable than a single price structure. The
   implications for consumer surplus are also explored. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB In an influential paper, Goldenberg, Libai, and Muller (2010) use an
   agent-based model to demonstrate that network externalities have a
   "chilling" effect on new product diffusion, i.e. they slow down new
   product adoption since many consumers wait before enough people have
   adopted. They perform their simulations using theoretical Moore lattices
   as the underlying social network of consumers. However, it has been
   demonstrated in other contexts that network structures can significantly
   affect the dynamics of new product diffusion, and hence it is worth
   investigating the same considerations for network externalities as well.
   I use the diffusion model of Goldenberg et al. (2010) to perform
   simulations on actual social networks to demonstrate that the chilling
   effect of network externalities is somewhat offset by increasing network
   size and average degree of the nodes, but accentuated by increased
   clustering in the network. My simulations also reveal that the diffusion
   model used by Goldenberg et al. (2010) does not have the chilling effect
   tautologically "baked" into it; rather network externalities do tend to
   slow down new product adoption most of the time, but not always. (C)

   reveal that consumer participation in the realization stage (physical

   physical production without opportunity to express choice or creativity
   during the production process does not change the symbolic meaning of
   the product (how self-expressive it is) and, therefore, does not result
   in identification with the product. Participation during the design
   stage (input-specification) enhances identification, leading to
   affective commitment, which in turn enhances evaluation of the self-made
   product. Finally, engaging consumers in both the realization and design

AB In recent years, many business-to-business (B2B) component supplier (CS)
   firms have added branding to their marketing toolbox. By extending the
   logic of ingredient branding to B2B components, they aim to create
   "pull" from B2B end customers by building a strong CS brand image among
   their customers' customers. In contrast with the established "push"
   approach of building strong relationships with original equipment
   manufacturers (OEMs), it is unclear whether and under which conditions
   CS branding is a worthy strategy. On the one hand, anecdotal evidence
   suggests that suppliers can leverage strong CS brand image in
   negotiations with increasingly powerful OEMs to enhance their financial
   performance. On the other hand, many B2B managers believe that branding
   does not work in their industry context and erodes profitability. We
   build a data set consisting of survey measures and archival data across
   a broad set of industries. Our results indicate that the financial
   outcomes of CS branding largely depend on the characteristics of the CS
   and OEM industries. Unlike dyadic OEM-CS relationships, which enhance
   profitability invariably across industry contexts, CS branding is
   effective only in well-defined situations. CS branding initiatives can
   enhance return in CS industries with substantial levels of product
   differentiation and technology intensity. However, unfavorable results

AB In a controlled domain replication of the well-established prize decoy
   experiment, we provide new evidence for the recently disputed robustness
   of asymmetric dominance effects (ADEs). Specifically, using real choices
   between - according to pretests - meaningful options that trigger
   tradeoff considerations, we find an ADE sized 16% which remains robust
   across demographic groups. Therefore, our findings indicate that the
   failures to replicate the ADE in previous studies might be due to
   variations in the experimental choice setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In a game-theoretic framework, I analyze how a brand manufacturer can
   thwart new entrants into its market. Three strategic options are
   considered, a price adjustment of the premium product, a quality
   adjustment of the premium product and a portfolio adjustment of adding a
   fighter brand. In a basic setup, I show that the incumbent's best
   response to entry is to choose a portfolio adjustment. If, however, the
   incumbent is uncertain about whether the rival firm will enter the
   market, a price adjustment of the premium product might be the better
   alternative if launching the fighter brand is associated with costs.
   Moreover, if technological progress improves the efficiency of product
   development, a combined quality and portfolio adjustment might be the

AB Customers often receive expert advice related to their health, finances,
   taxes or legal procedures, to name just a few. A noble stance taken by
   some is that experts should empower customers to make their own
   decisions. In this article, we distinguish informational from decisional
   empowerment and study whether empowerment leads customers to adhere more
   or less to expert advice. We empirically test our model by using a
   unique dataset involving 11,735 respondents in 17 countries on four
   continents. In the context of consumer adherence to doctors' therapy
   advice (patient non-adherence to doctor advice may cost about $564
   billion globally to the pharmaceutical industry every year), we find
   that decisional empowerment lowers adherence to expert advice. The
   effect of informational empowerment varies predictably across cultures
   and is only universally beneficial when initiated by the customer. These
   findings have important implications for professional service providers.

AB Formatively-measured constructs (FMCs) are increasingly used in
   marketing research as well as in other disciplines. Although constructs
   operationalized by means of formative indicators have mostly been placed
   in exogenous positions in structural equation models, they also
   frequently occupy structurally endogenous positions. The vast majority
   of studies specifying endogenously-positioned FMCs have followed the
   common practice of modeling the impact of antecedent (predictor)
   constructs directly on the focal FMC without specifying indirect effects
   via the formative indicators. However, while widespread even in top
   journals, this practice is highly problematic as it can lead to biased
   parameter estimates, erroneous total effects, and questionable
   conclusions. As a result both theory development and empirically-based
   managerial recommendations are likely to suffer. Against this
   background, the authors offer appropriate modeling guidelines to ensure
   that a conceptually sound and statistically correct model specification
   is obtained when a FMC occupies an endogenous position. The proposed
   guidelines are illustrated using both covariance structure analysis
   (CSA) and partial least squares (PLS) methods and are applied to a
   real-life empirical example. Implications for researchers are considered
   and 'good practice' recommendations offered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The tendency of meta-analytic authors to select particular studies is
   called selection bias. Selection bias can affect the strength of the
   meta-analytic estimate and the attention that scholars devote to the
   results. This research is, in effect, a meta-analysis of the effect
   sizes reported or calculated from 94 meta-analysis studies of various
   topics in marketing research. The analysis reveals that estimates depend
   on the publication status of the included studies. The greater the
   percentage of studies that were published in academic journals vs.
   non-published studies, the greater is the size of the meta-effects, and
   the more published studies from leading journals the meta-analysis
   includes, the stronger the effect size. The meta-analytic effect size is
   a mediator for the influence of both the ratio of unpublished studies
   and the ratio of studies from leading journals on the probability of a
   meta-analysis to be published in a leading journal, which increases the
   number of citations to a meta-analysis. The findings of this study have
   several implications for meta-analysts, editors, reviewers and the
   marketing community on how to conduct and read current and future

AB Conventional wisdom dictates that convenience goods should be
   distributed as intensively as possible. Still, exclusivity arrangements
   are rapidly gaining way in grocery retailing. We discuss the possible
   performance outcomes of exclusivity deals, and propose a unified
   framework (i) to quantify the gains and losses of such arrangements in
   consumer-packaged-goods markets, and (ii) to decompose the total
   monetary gains and losses into a variety of sources. Our framework
   considers both the manufacturer and the retailer granted the exclusivity
   right, and accounts for the fact that both dyad parties may be active in
   multiple, inter-related, categories. We illustrate the proposed approach
   in the context of Unilever s decision to limit the distribution of five
   of its (sub-)brands to a single retailer in the Dutch market, and derive
   the sales and profit implications for the parties involved. In all
   instances, we find that intensive distribution generates higher sales
   for the manufacturer than the exclusive arrangement, while such an
   arrangement is typically appealing for the retailer granted exclusivity.
   To come to a win-win situation, a variety of compensatory arrangements
   are considered. While manufacturers should not try to have leading
   incumbent products de-listed, we show how extra feature support for the
   exclusive brand may make an otherwise harmful arrangement beneficial for
   the manufacturer. In addition, we show how, in a number of instances,
   the total dyad profitability increases under exclusive arrangements,
   which offers rooms for margin re-negotiations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Customer base analysis is an essential tool to measure and develop
   relationships with customers. While various models have been proposed in
   a noncontractual setting, they focus primarily on analyzing
   transactional patterns associated with a single product category or a
   firm-level activity, such as the times at which purchases are made at a
   particular retailer. This research proposes a modeling framework for
   customer base analysis in a multi-category context. Specifically, we
   model the time between a customer's purchases at the firm and the
   product categories that comprise her shopping basket arising from
   multi-category choice decisions. The proposed model uses a latent space
   approach that parsimoniously captures the dynamics of multi-category
   shopping behavior due to the interplay between purchase timing and
   shopping basket composition. We also account for interdependence among
   multiple categories, temporal dependence across category choices, and
   latent customer attrition. Using category-level transaction data, we
   show that the proposed model offers excellent fit and performance in
   predicting customer purchase patterns across multiple categories. The
   forecasts and inferences afforded by our model can assist managers in
   tailoring marketing efforts across categories. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent discussions in the business press query the contribution of
   customer-support outsourcing to firm performance. Despite the
   controversy surrounding its performance implications, customer-support
   outsourcing is still on the rise, especially to emerging markets.
   Against this backdrop, we study under which conditions customer-support
   outsourcing to providers from emerging versus established economies is
   more versus less successful. Our performance measure is the stock-market
   reaction around the outsourcing announcement date. While the stock
   market reacts, on average, more favorably when customer-support is
   outsourced to providers located in emerging markets as opposed to
   established economies, approximately 50% of the outsourcing firms in our
   sample experience negative abnormal returns. We find that the
   shareholder-value implications of customer-support outsourcing to
   emerging versus established economies are contingent on the nature of
   the customer support that is being outsourced and on the nature of the
   outsourcing firm. Customer-support outsourcing to emerging markets is
   less beneficial for services that are characterized by personal customer
   contact and high knowledge embeddedness than for customer-support
   services that involve impersonal customer contact and are low on
   knowledge embeddedness. Firms higher in marketing resource intensity and
   larger firms benefit more from outsourcing customer-support services to
   emerging markets than firms lower in marketing resource intensity and
   smaller firms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   on the practice of marketing. This impact may be direct (e.g., an
   academic article may be adapted to solve a practical problem) or
   indirect (e.g., its contents may be incorporated into practitioners'
   tools, which then influence marketing decision making). We use the term
   "marketing science value chain" to describe these diffusion steps, and
   survey marketing managers, marketing science intermediaries (practicing
   marketing analysts), and marketing academics to calibrate the value
   chain. In our sample, we find that (1) the impact of marketing science
   is perceived to be largest on decisions such as the management of
   brands, pricing, new products, product portfolios, and customer/market
   selection, and (2) tools such as segmentation, survey-based choice
   models, marketing mix models, and pre-test market models have the
   largest impact on marketing decisions. Exemplary papers from 1982 to
   2003 that achieved dual - academic and practice - impact are Guadagni
   and Little (1983) and Green and Srinivasan (1990). Overall, our results
   are encouraging. First, we find that the impact of marketing science has
   been largest on marketing decision areas that are important to practice.
   Second, we find moderate alignment between academic impact and practice
   impact. Third, we identify antecedents of practice impact among dual
   impact marketing science papers. Fourth, we discover more recent trends
   and initiatives in the period 2004-2012, such as the increased

AB Markdown selling (i.e., price reductions over the course of the selling
   season) is a strategy to implement price discrimination and to manage
   market uncertainty that has been widely adopted by retailers. This paper
   explores the potential advantage of introducing an additional tool to
   the arsenal of retailers, probabilistic selling (i.e., offering
   consumers a choice to buy a product that can turn out to be any item
   from a predetermined set of distinct items). We show that both
   probabilistic and markdown selling strategies serve as price
   discrimination tools by offering buyers an option to purchase a
   "damaged" good (an uncertain product under the former and delayed
   consumption of a product under the latter). However, the two strategies
   segment markets based on different types of buyer heterogeneity: buyer
   preference strength under probabilistic selling and buyer patience under
   markdown selling. Our analytical model reveals that, compared with
   markdown selling, probabilistic selling can (1) improve margin
   management by increasing revenue from full-price sales and reducing the
   magnitude of discounts; and (2) improve inventory utilization by
   reducing stockouts and the amount of excess inventory. We identify the
   conditions required for probabilistic selling to be more profitable than
   markdown selling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study the effects of consumer perceptions of four types of corporate
   social responsibility (CSR) activities on their behavioral loyalty
   toward retailers. The four activities are environmental friendliness,
   community support, selling locally produced products, and treating
   employees fairly. Behavioral loyalty is measured by share-of-wallet
   (SOW). We control for other retailer attributes that drive attitudes and
   SOW, and examine how the market is segmented in terms of consumer
   response. We partition the total effect of CSR on SOW into a direct
   effect and an indirect effect mediated through attitude towards the
   store. These effects differ by CSR activity and customer segment. The
   effects on attitude are positive and positive attitude enhances SOW, so
   the indirect effects on SOW are positive. While we generally find
   positive total effects, the total effect of one of the CSR activities,
   environmental friendliness, is significantly negative for one group of
   consumers. The magnitude of CSR's total impact on SOW is not only
   statistically significant but also managerially meaningful in an
   industry where every share point carries a substantial dollar amount We
   characterize the customer segments and conclude with implications for
   how best a retailer can manage its CSR initiatives. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB Personalization of the marketing mix is a topic of much interest to
   marketing academics and practitioners. Using discrete choice demand
   theory, we investigate the aggregate market value for product attribute
   improvements when firms are engaged in personalized pricing. Our results
   provide a theoretically grounded rule for how to aggregate consumer
   valuations to assess the overall profitability of attribute improvements
   under price personalization. Under common pricing, each consumer
   contributes the same margin. Profitability of an attribute improvement
   is thus driven by inducing more consumers to buy. Consumers with high
   choice probabilities are given less weight in the market valuation under
   common pricing as they are less responsive to attribute improvements.
   Under personalized pricing, profitability of an attribute improvement is
   driven by extraction of consumer surplus from high valuation consumers.
   Consumers with higher valuations, and consequently higher choice
   probabilities, are given more weight in the market valuation under
   personalized pricing. Since individual consumers play a more central
   role in the market valuation under personalized pricing, estimation of
   consumer-level valuations is of increased importance. Under common
   pricing, the market valuation for an attribute improvement is robust to
   extreme estimates of the consumer-level valuations. Through our
   theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that this robustness
   does not hold under personalized pricing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB In cause-related marketing (CM), companies promise a donation to a cause
   every time a consumer makes a purchase. We analyze the impact of the
   size of this donation on brand choice (tactical success) and brand image
   (strategic success). Our results reveal different effects of donation
   size on these success measures. For brand choice, the effect of donation
   size is moderated by a financial trade-off for consumers, whereas the
   effect on brand image is moderated by donation framing. Specifically, we
   show that donation size has a positive effect on brand choice if
   consumers face no financial trade-off; i.e., if they do not have to
   choose between triggering a donation or saving money. The effect is
   negative if a trade-off exists such that higher donations come at higher
   costs. Brand image is enhanced by larger donations if the framing is
   nonmonetary (e.g., the campaign promises the provision of vaccinations),
   whereas donation size has a negative effect if donation framing is
   monetary (e.g., the campaign states the Euro amount). If campaigns use a
   combination of both frames, the effect of donation size on brand image
   has an inverted U shape. Our results suggest that CM enhances tactical
   and strategic success only if firms select the right donation size,
   taking into account donation framing and financial trade-offs. (C) 2013

AB Advertising supported content sampling is ubiquitous in online markets
   for digital information goods. Yet, little is known about the profit
   impact of sampling when it serves the dual purpose of disclosing content
   quality and generating advertising revenue. This paper proposes an
   analytical framework to study the optimal content strategy for online
   publishers and shows how it is determined by characteristics of both the
   content market and the advertising market. The strategy choice is among
   a paid content strategy, a sampling strategy, and a free content
   strategy, which follow from the publisher's decisions concerning the
   size of the sample and the price of the paid content. We show that a key
   driver of the strategy choice is how sampling affects the prior
   expectations of consumers, who learn about content quality from the
   inspection of the free samples. Surprisingly, we find that it can be
   optimal for the publisher to generate advertising revenue by offering
   free samples even when sampling reduces both prior quality expectations
   and content demand. In addition, we show that it can be optimal for the
   publisher to refrain from revealing quality through free samples when
   advertising effectiveness is low and content quality is high. To
   illustrate, we relate our framework to the newspaper industry, where the
   sampling strategy is known as the "metered model." (C) 2013 Elsevier

   supply and demand of motion pictures. Prior empirical research either
   ignored the endogeneity of box office and screen allocation or was based
   on selective samples, ignoring the large amount of smaller movies
   released to the market. Using two large and unique samples of all movies
   released in two major movie markets, the US (2000-2010; n 2098) and

AB Recent marketing studies suggest that non-financial metrics, such as
   customer satisfaction and brand value, help explain the variation in the
   cost of equity and the cost of debt. These studies typically focus on
   only one non-financial metric and one component of capital cost. In this
   study, we broaden the understanding of the relevance of non-financial
   metrics to the cost of capital. We investigate the joint role of
   customer satisfaction, brand value, and corporate reputation for stock
   market beta and credit ratings, which reflect variation in equity and
   debt risk premiums across firms. In addition to the joint direct
   influence of these metrics on capital cost, we also study their
   interaction effects. We develop a conceptual model to explain the
   effects on capital costs and test the resulting hypotheses in a broad
   sample of 344 firms from diverse industries using data from the
   1991-2006 period. Our results suggest that higher satisfaction ratings
   reduce both the cost of equity and cost of debt, whereas brand value and
   corporate reputation only show a negative direct association with the
   cost of debt. In addition, both measures moderate the effect of
   satisfaction on the cost of debt. Brand value attenuates the influence
   of satisfaction, whereas corporate reputation amplifies this effect. (C)

AB Using a latent growth modeling (LGM) approach, this study examines the
   controversial role of perceived sponsor-event fit in inducing changes in
   brand affect. On the basis of two longitudinal studies related to the
   2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2012 London Olympics, the authors determine
   that fit and brand affect increase linearly overtime. Resolving an
   apparent conflict in the marketing literature, the results show that the
   initial level of fit relates positively to the initial level of brand
   affect, but relates negatively to the subsequent increase in brand
   affect. Moreover, a significant and positive association emerges between
   the change trajectories, such that a steeper increase in perceived fit
   results in a faster rate of brand affect improvement. Furthermore, the
   initial level of brand affect is associated with subsequent increases in
   neither brand affect nor fit. Therefore, incongruence resolution is key
   to ensuring that sponsorship improves brand affect. Finally, both
   attitude toward the sponsorship and event involvement have positive
   impacts on subsequent increases in both brand affect and perceived fit.

AB This paper demonstrates a method for estimating logit choice models for
   small sample data, including single individuals, that is computationally
   simpler and relies on weaker prior distributional assumptions compared
   to hierarchical Bayes estimation. Using Monte Carlo simulations and
   online discrete choice experiments, we show how this method is
   particularly well suited to estimating values of choice model parameters
   from small sample choice data, thus opening this area to the application
   of choice modeling. For larger sample sizes of approximately 100-200
   respondents, preference distribution recovery is similar to hierarchical
   Bayes estimation of mixed logit models for the examples we demonstrate.
   We discuss three approaches for specifying the conjugate priors required
   for the method: specifying priors based on existing or projected market
   shares of products, specifying a flat prior on the choice alternatives
   in a discrete choice experiment, or adopting an empirical Bayes approach
   where the prior choice probabilities are taken to be the average choice
   probabilities observed in a discrete choice experiment. We show that for
   small sample data, the relative weighting of the prior during estimation
   is an important consideration, and we present an automated method for
   selecting the weight based on a predictive scoring rule. (C) 2013

   and profits. We analyze customer panel data from a large retailer over a
   five-year period. The retailer conducted a randomized field test in
   which the firm eliminated its catalog for half of the panel. We find
   that channel elimination decreases purchase incidence, especially for
   customers who, before the test, were heavy users of the telephone
   purchase channel that aligns with the catalog search channel. As
   expected, channel choice for purchases is shifted toward the internet
   and away from the telephone channel. Interestingly, order size per
   purchase increases. We investigate the impact of channel elimination on
   profits across different customer segments. We calculate a net positive
   impact because the savings from eliminating the catalog compensate for
   lower sales revenues. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   uncertain. The model incorporates consumers' risk aversion and their
   subjective assessment of the probability that they will get the reward.
   It is used to assess the effectiveness of a "conditional rebate", where
   the uncertainty arises because the reward is contingent on an external
   event, versus a traditional rebate, which is similar in all respects
   except that it is certain. We estimate the model using a conjoint choice
   experiment. Response to conditional rebates is highly segmented and
   related to perceived thinking costs and savings and entertainment
   benefits of conditional rebates as well as to event involvement and
   gambling proneness. In our application, conditional rebates are more
   cost effective than certain rebates, mostly because consumers'
   subjective probability of the event occurring is higher than what market
   wisdom suggests. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Major sports events draw unsurpassed media attention. Companies are
   motivated to increase their advertising investments around these events
   to reach large audiences in a short period. Is such an advertising surge

   these periods because of negative effects of competitive interference?
   This study investigates when consumer packaged goods companies should
   invest in advertising to increase sales: before, during, or after the
   event or outside these event periods. The author estimates short- and
   long-term own- and cross-advertising elasticities for 206 brands using
   four years of weekly data. Although considerable heterogeneity exists
   across brands, own-advertising effectiveness diminishes especially
   before and during major sports events, in both the short and the long
   run. In addition, brands benefit less from category-demand effects
   through competitors' advertising. Conversely, greater increases in
   advertising spending resulting in significant growth in share of voice
   around focused, single-sport events are a successful strategy to
   overcome this overall general negative trend. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Pharmaceutical drugs are rigorously evaluated through clinical studies.
   The commercial consequences of such clinical studies, both to the
   promotion for and sales of drugs, are largely under-researched. The
   present study answers the following research questions: 1) How does the
   evolution of clinical study outcomes affect product sales? 2) How does
   the evolution of clinical study outcomes affect a firm's promotion
   expenditures to physicians and consumers? 3) Is the assessment of the
   responsiveness of sales to promotion expenditures biased when the
   analyst omits the role of clinical studies? We summarize a comprehensive
   body of clinical studies in three metrics: valence, dispersion, and
   volume. We extend the literature with the following findings. A higher
   valence and volume of clinical studies (i.e., more positive and larger
   number of studies) increase sales. A higher valence of clinical studies
   increases spending on both direct-to-consumer advertising and
   direct-to-physician promotion. A higher dispersion among clinical
   studies decreases spending on direct-to-consumer advertising. A higher
   volume of clinical studies has no effect on direct-to-physician
   promotion, but decreases direct-to-consumer advertising. Furthermore,
   the results show that omitting these metrics from a market response
   model leads to an overestimation of the responsiveness of sales to
   promotion expenditures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores whether family firms exhibit unique marketing
   behavior and whether their unique behavior in turn helps them outperform
   non-family firms during periods of economic contraction. Findings based
   on a sample of 275 large publicly listed U.S. firms reveal that family
   firms outperform non-family firms during recessions. This superior
   performance is partially driven by family firms' proactive marketing
   behavior and their relatively strong emphasis on corporate social
   responsibility (CSR). During recessions, while non-family firms tend to
   decrease their advertising intensities and rates of new product
   introduction (NPI), family firms are likely to maintain relatively high
   levels of advertising intensity and rates of NPI. Unlike non-family
   firms, family firms are also likely to maintain high levels of corporate
   social performance (CSP) during recessions. These results underscore the
   benefits of proactive marketing behavior and a continued emphasis on CSR
   during economic downturns. The authors also add to the scant family-firm
   literature, demonstrating the family firm to be an effective

   effects of monetary versus in-kind rewards, on referral success. We find
   that although consumers prefer monetary rewards to in-kind rewards
   because of the greater economic value of monetary rewards, the higher
   social costs associated with money offset this benefit and even render
   money an inferior incentive when the recommendation is not well
   justified. Through four experiments, we demonstrate that monetary
   rewards (vs. in-kind rewards) lead to less referral generation and
   acceptance, especially when the recommended brands are weak (Studies 1
   and 4), and that perceived social costs mediate the interactive effect
   of reward type and brand strength (Studies 1 and 3). Moreover, by
   increasing the economic benefit or decreasing the social costs
   associated with monetary rewards, we restore the effectiveness of
   monetary rewards as incentives. Compared with in-kind rewards, monetary
   rewards perform equally well when the reward is sufficiently large
   (Study 2), and they perform even better when both the recommender and
   the receiver are rewarded (Study 3). This research extends the
   literature on the psychological consequences of money and provides novel
   insights into the customer referral process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Consumer research suffers from a lack of respect for data. Researchers
   routinely fail to report full experiments that do not produce expected
   results and often eliminate alleged "outliers" on the basis of
   inappropriate rules, leading to biased test reports. Scholars appear to
   be relying less on non-experimental data, even as the serious
   limitations of experimental data may create structural discrepancies
   with the other, non-experimental cases of a phenomenon or process, such
   that it becomes impossible to study some major consumer phenomena. The
   lessons from empirical data get accepted only when they can be described
   as confirming preexisting conceptual frameworks. This article presents
   an extensive analysis of multiple forms of a lack of respect for the
   data and proposes some remedies. Overall, data should never play a

AB This article examines the moderating effect of evaluation mode on
   consumer responses to variety in product bundles. Study 1 finds that
   consumer preference for the variety bundle (relative to the non-variety
   bundle) is higher in the joint evaluation mode than in the separate
   evaluation mode. Study 2 provides evidence that the increased preference
   for the variety bundle in joint evaluation is driven by the activation
   of concerns about satiation. Specifically, we find that both the
   quantity of items in and the category of the non-variety bundle
   influence consumer concern for satiation and the evaluation of the
   variety bundle. Study 3 further examines the proposed mechanism by
   manipulating the information associated with repetition and finds that
   associating repetition with loyalty (vs. satiation) eliminates the
   moderating effect of evaluation mode on the preference for variety. We
   discuss the findings and their implications for marketers. (C) 2013

AB Discount stores have a private-label dominated assortment where national
   brands have only limited shelf access. These limited spots are in high
   demand by national-brand manufacturers. We examine whether private-label
   production by leading national-brand manufacturers for two important
   discounters (one hard and one soft) creates discounter goodwill. We
   estimate a selection model that is based on a sample of 450
   manufacturer-category combinations from two leading discounters (Aldi in
   Germany and Mercadona in Spain), and we show that private-label
   production is indeed rewarded: national-brand manufacturers that are
   involved in such practices have a higher likelihood of procuring shelf
   presence for their brands. Moreover, while powerful manufacturers are
   intrinsically more likely to obtain shelf presence with soft
   discounters, manufacturers with less power can compensate for this by
   producing private labels. No such dependence on power exists for hard
   discounters. However, not all national-brand manufacturers are equally
   likely to produce private labels for discounters. We find that
   national-brand manufacturers are less likely to do so when: (a) they
   experience more sales growth, (b) it is more difficult to produce
   high-quality products in a specific category, (c) they invest more
   advertising support into their brands, and (d) they introduce more
   innovations. Moreover, a higher price differential relative to the
   discounter's private labels makes national-brand manufacturers less
   likely to engage in private-label production for hard discounters. (C)

AB Many firms assume that customers like to feel special and to receive
   discretionary preferential treatments (DPT). This research argues that
   the reality is more complicated: the same preferential treatment may
   delight one customer but enrage or embarrass another. To help companies
   align their DPT with their customers' preferences, this article
   identifies four dimensions along which consumers positively or
   negatively evaluate DPT: justification, imposition, visibility, and
   surprise. This article then introduces customer heterogeneity in the
   form of two individual traits that moderate DPT evaluations. Through two
   studies, the article shows that distinction seekers prefer visible
   rewards that impose on other customers, but negotiators prefer
   unjustified, non-surprising privileges. Finally, by tying consumer
   preferences to two readily available variables (age and gender), this
   article concludes with a set of practical guidelines for the companies
   that hope to align their DPT strategy with customer profiles. (C) 2013

AB Hard-discounters (HDs) such as Aldi and Lidl are increasingly
   introducing national brands (NBs) into their private label (PL)
   dominated assortments. While there is evidence that this enhances sales
   in the categories where such NBs are added, little is known about how it
   affects consumers' overall perceptions of the HD and consequently its
   share of the customers' wallet. Using a unique data set that combines
   longitudinal information on a HD's perceptions, with that chain's
   assortment composition, we investigate the impact of NB introductions on
   the chain's overall value and assortment image, and spending share. We
   show that introductions of NBs, in particular category leaders, may
   significantly contribute to a more favorable perception of the HD store.
   For positive value-image effects to materialize, HDs must offer these
   NBs at low-enough prices to maintain a reasonable price gap with the
   current private label offer. For the NB entry to enhance the HD's
   assortment perception, it must come with a sufficiently deep product
   line. However, there are limits to this approach. Introductions
   gradually lose effect as the share of NBs at the HD goes up. More
   importantly, ill-selected NB additions may backfire on the HD. Listing
   NBs that are not category-leaders, at prices too far above its private
   labels, deteriorates the HD's favorable value positioning cutting into
   its core competitive advantage, and leading to notable reductions in
   share-of-wallet. We discuss the academic and managerial implications of
   these findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

   on brand attitudes. To investigate the empirical generalizability of
   this phenomenon, we analyzed the responses of 1576 consumers to 1070 TV
   commercials from more than 150 different product categories. The
   findings suggest five empirical generalizations. First, ad-evoked
   feelings indeed have a substantial impact on brand evaluations, even
   under conditions that better approximate real marketplace settings than
   past studies did. Second, these effects are both direct and indirect,
   with the indirect effects largely linked to changes in attitude toward
   the ad. Third, these effects do not depend on the level of involvement
   associated with the product category. However, fourth, the effects are
   more pronounced for hedonic products than utilitarian products. Finally,
   these effects do not depend on whether the products are durables,
   nondurables, or services, or whether the products are search goods or
   experience goods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   accounting for the endogeneity of enforcement, we use these contractual
   components and variables related to enforcement to predict the
   occurrence of enforcement. We use such predictions to show that aligned
   enforcement results in higher performance. We also show that the

AB Peck and Shu (2009) found that touching a product causes greater
   endowment effect We seek to replicate and extend this finding to the
   case that whether touching a product consumers have just bought may
   increase the willingness to pay (WTP) for warranty. Loss aversion, the
   tendency to prefer avoiding losses over obtaining equivalent monetary
   gains, often explains product warranty purchases. This tendency will be
   stronger when the buyers consider the product as part of their endowment
   Touching the product promotes stronger ownership perception and thus
   shifts consumer's reference point. The new reference point causes
   consumers to anticipate greater pain from the loss of the product and
   thus leads to higher WTP for product warranty protection. We find
   support for this hypothesis in two field studies with a total of 104

   minorities have emerged in recent years: messaging consumers when their
   ethnic identity is most salient, and doing so with spokespeople or
   models with the same heritage as the targeted minority. In this paper,
   we conduct conceptual replications of two influential articles
   representative of these research streams: Forehand and Deshpande (2001)
   and Deshpande and Stayman (1994). Our studies show that the effects of
   such practices on minority consumers are not homogeneous. The findings
   identify generational status (first vs. second generation) as an
   important boundary condition for these ethnic targeting strategies. This
   has important conceptual and practical implications for choosing an
   effective ethnic targeting strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Social influence on consumer behavior has long been a subject of
   academic research in various scientific fields. According to research by
   Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (2006), music demand is a function of social
   influence between consumers. Market concentration tends to increase when
   information on demand becomes publicly available. In addition,
   stochastic agglomeration caused by social influence decreases the
   predictability of market success. These heavily cited findings challenge
   traditional market research and provide important insights on the impact
   of social media and sales charts. We test the stability of their results
   by replicating the study on music demand in a slightly different
   setting. We further investigate the generalizability of findings by
   probing other product categories and different phases of purchase
   decisions, i.e., interest, consideration, and actual demand. Across all
   categories and across all dependent variables, we are able to replicate
   the direction of the effects. We do, however, consistently obtain
   smaller effect sizes than reported in the original paper. (C) 2013

AB How are the designs of corporate buildings used to create meaning and
   project a corporate image and personality? We distinguish functionalist
   architecture ("form follows function"), which focuses on the primary,
   utilitarian function of a building, from experiential architecture
   ("from function to form"), which uses the form of a building to
   communicate symbolically about the organization. A large-scale
   quantitative study including 150 buildings shows that four architectural
   design types ("solid," "balanced," "expressive," and "disruptive"
   designs, emerging from a mix of functionalist and experiential
   architectures, lead to distinct corporate brand personalities (e.g.,
   competence for functionalist architecture and excitement for
   experiential architecture). We validate these findings in a qualitative
   study and discuss how this research contributes toward the development
   of a consumer-oriented design theory. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

AB In this paper, we explore the patterns of consumption-based learning
   about brand quality in mature consumer packaged goods (CPG) categories
   as well as category and household characteristics that drive such
   learning. We estimate brand-choice models with Bayesian learning on
   household purchases in over thirty CPG categories. This approach yields
   category- and household-specific estimates of the extent to which
   consumers update their knowledge on the quality of specific brands, with
   new consumption-based information from these brands. We then link this
   degree of learning to the underlying household and category drivers. We
   find that learning is present and significant in almost all categories
   yet varies in strength across categories and households. Learning about
   brand quality is negatively associated with variety seeking. Conversely,
   learning is stronger in categories where consumers have higher monetary
   (expensive items) and especially non-monetary stakes (categories with
   higher performance risk and involvement). In line with the 'enrichment'
   hypothesis, familiarity with the category resulting from frequent
   category purchases increases the information extracted from new
   consumption experiences - but only up to a certain point. Interestingly,
   however, market mavens learn less, potentially reflecting their
   overconfidence. Whereas some households learn more than others across
   the board, category factors are the strongest drivers of learning.
   Managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   price and price volatility) on the international takeoff of new
   products. The study examines these drivers of takeoff using a novel data
   set of bimonthly observations of 7 new consumer electronic products in 8
   countries. The empirical analysis reveals that both relative price and
   price volatility significantly impact the hazard of takeoff. However,
   although the effect of relative price is stable across contexts, the
   effects of price volatility are moderated by wealth, culture, and
   contagion. The use of temporally disaggregate data at the bimonthly
   level allows for the identification of the effect of price volatility
   and enables a more precise identification of takeoff than that
   achievable with annual data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   participants in a hierarchical structure (Experiment 1) or priming them
   by asking them to recall an event in which they either had power over
   someone or someone had power over them (Experiments 2 and 3). The
   results reveal that, in a neutral setting, those with high power perform
   worse on attention and recall and are less persuaded by a message than
   those with low power; confidence that is induced by power mediates the
   effect of power. In contrast, when a specific goal is established, those
   with high power are better at processing goal-relevant messages than
   those with low power; confidence does not play a mediating role in this

AB Our objective is to understand how a firm's product development
   capability (PDC) affects the launch strategy for a durable product that
   is sequentially improved over time in a market where consumers have
   heterogeneous valuations for quality. We show that firms' launch
   strategies are affected by the degree to which consumers think ahead.
   However, only those firms' strategies that have a high PDC are affected
   by the observability of quality. When consumers are myopic and quality
   is observable, both high and low PDC firms use price skimming and
   restrict first-generation sales to consumers with a high willingness to
   pay (WTP). A high PDC firm, however, sells the second generation
   broadly, while a low PDC firm only sells the second generation to
   consumers with a low WTP. When consumers are myopic and quality is
   unobservable, a firm with a high PDC signals its quality by offering a
   low price for the first generation, which results in broad selling. The
   price of the second generation is set such that only high WTP consumers
   will buy. A firm with a low PDC will not mimic this strategy. If a low
   PDC firm sells the first-generation broadly, it cannot discriminate
   between high and low WTP consumers. When consumers are forward-looking,
   a firm with a high PDC sells the first generation broadly. This
   phenomenon mitigates the "Coase problem" that is created by consumers
   thinking ahead. The high PDC firm then only sells the second-generation
   product to the high WTP consumers. In contrast, a firm with a low PDC
   does the opposite; it only sells the first generation to high WTP
   consumers and the second generation broadly. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Benjamin Bushong, King, Camerer, and Range! (2010) introduced the
   real-exposure effect (REE), which stipulates that compared with mere
   pictorial presentations, the physical presence of an appetitive item
   increases subjects' willingness to pay. In contrast to the original
   study, we extend the behavioral setting and incorporate the tactile
   sense of the subjects in the decision making context. Specifically, we
   examine the robustness of the REE for appetitive and non-appetitive
   items when subjects are explicitly invited to make direct contact with
   the real items as well as with the images of items. By means of
   observing binding choices of potential consumers inclusive of payments
   in controlled lab environments that resemble real shopping situations,
   our results (1) confirm a robust REE in terms of a significant increase
   in subjects' purchases under the real condition, (2) indicate that the
   REE holds even for the non-appetitive items, and (3) show that the
   subjects' familiarity with an item has a mitigating influence on the
   size of the REE. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   interactional justice but not for distributive justice. While
   distributive justice is equally important in both contexts, procedural
   justice is more important in B2B markets whereas interactional justice
   drives SATCOM only in B2C markets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Previous work has demonstrated that the use of white space in
   advertising communicates specific meanings to consumers and that this
   meaning derives from particular historical moments in the art and visual
   rhetoric of 20th-century North America. The use of "empty space" in ads,
   however, can also be conceptualized as a signal of burning money, which
   could influence consumer perceptions about the size and power of a
   company through completely different mechanisms. Somewhat surprisingly,
   nearly all empirical demonstrations of burning money in a consumer
   advertising context also manipulated white space, leaving the mechanism
   of action unclear. The results of the three studies discussed here
   indicate that white space is different from other ways of burning money,
   and its meanings are sufficiently different across cultures, thus
   providing stronger support for the rhetorical explanation than the
   economic signaling one. The findings are discussed in terms of their
   implications for previous research that found that consumers infer
   quality from the economic signals of burning money. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB The impact of social factors on individual-level decision making has
   been a subject of general interest within the marketing field. However,
   studies analyzing social interactions and social contagion have, to a
   great extent, focused on the importance of social interactions in the
   customer acquisition process and have relied on the use of undirected
   networks. Our study contributes to the literature stream by focusing on
   two elements that have been analyzed less frequently. Specifically, we
   focus on the importance of social interactions in the customer retention
   process within a directed social network. Using the customer base of a
   mobile phone provider, we rely on call detail records to investigate the
   churn behavior of 3431 focal actors. We provide evidence for social
   interactions in customer churn decisions and show that, at any given
   point in time, a focal actor is significantly and substantially more
   likely to defect from a provider if other individuals to whom that actor
   is socially connected have previously defected from the provider.
   However, this effect is limited to social contacts with whom the focal
   actor has outgoing calling relationships and who have churned relatively
   recently (in our sample, less than 5 weeks prior to the point in time
   that is under examination). We therefore provide empirical evidence
   demonstrating that social effects do play a role in customer retention
   but only when tie directionality and churn recency are taken into
   account. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, more and more consumer goods firms have started to tap
   into the creative potential of their user communities to fuel their new
   product development pipelines. Although many have hailed this paradigm
   shift as a highly promising development for firms, hardly any research
   has systematically compared the actual market performance of
   user-generated products with designer-generated ones. We fill this void
   by presenting a unique data set gathered from the Japanese consumer
   goods brand Muji, which has drawn on both sources of ideas in parallel
   in recent years. We demonstrate that user-generated products, which are
   found to generally contain higher novelty, outperformed their
   designer-generated counterparts on key market performance metrics.
   Specifically, in the first year after introduction, sales revenues from
   user-generated products were three times higher and gross margins were
   four times greater than those of designer-generated products. These
   effects also increased over time: after three years, the aggregate sales
   revenues of user-generated products were, on average, 1.25 billion yen
   (approximately 16 million dollars) higher, or five times greater, than
   the sales of designer-generated products. The corresponding average
   margin was an impressive 619 million yen (approximately 8 million
   dollars) higher, or six times greater, than the margin for
   designer-generated products. Finally, user-generated products were more
   likely to survive the three-year observation period than
   designer-generated products (i.e., were still on the market three years
   after introduction). These findings clearly favor the paradigm shift
   identified in marketing research and appeal to managers considering the
   integration of user ideas into the process of new product development.
   We discuss our study's limitations and identify important avenues for
   future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research examines customer biases relating to employee accents in
   call service encounters. Extant research and practitioners generally
   assume that customers automatically evaluate call service employees with
   a nonstandard accent lower than employees with a standard accent.
   However, using the justification-suppression model as a framework, we
   argue that customers frequently suppress accent biases toward call
   service employees. We conduct three empirical studies, and our findings
   indicate that customers rate employees with an accent receiving a
   negative bias lower only when a service outcome is unfavorable for
   customers. In contrast, accents receiving a positive bias only impact
   customer evaluations when service outcomes are favorable for customers.
   Additionally, we demonstrate that the suppression and justification of
   accent biases rely on both cognitive and affective mechanisms. Finally,
   we show that customers who are informed of the frequency of a favorable
   vs. unfavorable outcome are more likely to suppress biases. Published by

AB Two field experiments examine whether providing information to consumers
   regarding competitive products builds trust. Established theory suggests
   that (1) competitive information leads to trust because it demonstrates
   the firm is altruistic, and (2) trust leads to brand consideration and
   sales. In year 1, an American automaker provided experiential,
   product-feature, word-of-mouth, and advisor information to consumers in
   a 2x2x2x2 random-assignment field experiment that lasted six months.
   Main-effect analyses, conditional-logit models, and continuous-time
   Markov models suggest that competitive information enhances brand
   consideration and possibly sales and that the effects are mediated
   through trust. However, in a modification to extant theory, effects are
   significant only for positively valenced information. The year-2
   experiment tested whether a signal that the firm was willing to share
   competitive information would engender trust, brand consideration, and
   sales. Contrary to many theories, the signal did not achieve these
   predicted outcomes because, in the year-2 experiment, consumers who
   already trusted the automaker were more likely to opt in to competitive
   information. In addition to interpreting the field experiments in light
   of extant theory, we examine cost effectiveness and describe the
   automaker's successful implementation of revised,
   competitive-information strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB A few well-documented cases describe how the deployment of marketing
   analytics produces positive organizational outcomes. However, the
   deployment of marketing analytics varies widely across firms, and many
   C-level executives remain skeptical regarding the benefits that they
   could gain from their marketing analytics efforts. We draw on upper
   echelons theory and the resource-based view of the firm to develop a
   conceptual framework that relates the organizational deployment of
   marketing analytics to firm performance and that also identifies the key
   antecedents of that deployment. The analysis of a survey of 212 senior
   executives of Fortune 1000 firms demonstrates that firms attain
   favorable and apparently sustainable performance outcomes through
   greater use of marketing analytics. The analysis also reveals important
   moderators: more intense industry competition and more rapidly changing
   customer preferences increase the positive impact of the deployment of
   marketing analytics on firm performance. The results are robust to the
   choice of performance measures, and, on average, a one-unit increase in
   the degree of deployment (moving a firm at the median or the 50th
   percentile of deployment to the 65th percentile) on a 1-7 scale is
   associated with an 8% increase in return on assets. The analysis also
   demonstrates that support from the top management team, a supportive
   analytics culture, appropriate data, information technology support, and
   analytics skills are all necessary for the effective deployment of
   marketing analytics. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To better plan their programs, producers of performing arts events
   require forecasting models that relate ticket sales to the multiple
   features of a program. The framework we develop, test and implement
   uncovers audience preferences for the features of an event program from
   single-ticket sales while accounting for interactions among program
   features and for preference heterogeneity across markets. We develop a
   factor-analytic random-coefficients model that overcomes four major
   methodological challenges. First, the historical data available from
   each market is limited, preventing the estimation of models at the
   market level and requiring some form of shrinkage estimator that also
   takes into account the diversity in preferences across markets as well
   as the fact that preferences for the many (26 in our application)
   program features are correlated across markets, requiring the estimation
   of a large covariance matrix for these preferences across markets. Our
   proposed factor-analytic regression formulation parsimoniously captures
   the principal components of the correlated preferences and provides
   shrinkage estimates at the individual market level. The second challenge
   we face is the fact that orchestras differ on how they sell season
   subscriptions, leading to substantial unobserved effects on ticket sales
   across orchestras; an added benefit of our random-coefficients approach
   is that it incorporates a random effect that captures any shift in the
   dependent variable caused by unobservable factors across all events in
   each individual market, such as the unobservable effect of season
   subscriptions on single-ticket sales.
   The third methodological challenge is that program features are likely
   to interact requiring the estimation of a large set of pair-wise
   interactions. We solve this problem by mapping the interactions on a
   reduced space, arriving at a more parsimonious model formulation. The
   fourth methodological challenge relates to implementation of the model
   results beyond the relatively small sample of markets for which
   historical data were available. To overcome this limitation, we
   demonstrate how our model can be applied to markets not included in our
   sample, first using only managerial insight regarding the similarity
   between the focal market and the ones in our sample and by updating this
   subjective prior as ticket sales data become available. (C) 2012

AB Designing effective direct mail pieces is considered a key success
   factor in direct marketing. However, related published empirical
   research is scarce while design recommendations are manifold and often
   conflicting. Compared with prior work, our study aims to provide more
   elaborate and empirically validated findings for the effects of direct
   mail design characteristics by analyzing 677 direct mail campaigns from
   non-profit organizations and financial service providers. We investigate
   the effects of (1) various envelope characteristics and observable cues
   on opening rates, and (2) characteristics of the envelope content on the
   keeping rates of direct mail campaigns. We show that visual design
   elements on the outer envelope - rather than sender-related details -
   are the predominant drivers of opening rates. Factors such as letter
   length, provision of sender information in the letter, and
   personalization positively influence the keeping rate. We also observe
   that opening and keeping rates are uncorrelated at the campaign level,
   implying that opening direct mail pieces is only a necessary condition
   for responding to offers, but not per se a driver of direct mail
   response. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is a rich literature that examines the impact of customer
   satisfaction on market value. Surprisingly, the short-run market impact
   of customer satisfaction has been found to be either insignificant or
   limited in scope. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the notion
   that investors form expectations about customer satisfaction and respond
   only to deviations from these expectations (i.e., "surprises"). We
   consider two "expectations" models: a naive model that utilizes last
   year's scores and a model that includes firm characteristics and
   marketing investments to proxy for the prior allocation of resources
   devoted to improving customer satisfaction. In our empirical work, we
   find that the market does indeed respond in the short-run to surprises
   in customer satisfaction, with more pronounced effects for our second
   expectations model. Overall, our research offers two distinct
   contributions. First, it refines the current conceptualization of
   customer satisfaction by explicitly introducing the notion of investor
   expectations. Second, we employ this refined conceptualization to
   unequivocally demonstrate the short-run impact of investments in
   customer satisfaction. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   anchors that subsequently bias (either upward or downward) consumers'
   assessment of a product's price, weight, volume, etc. We qualify this
   proposition, however, by showing that such anchoring effects occur

AB Despite the central role of social class or socioeconomic status on
   consumer behavior and the fact that this construct has been utilized in
   marketing research for more than seven decades, the marketing literature
   is surprisingly lacking in the conceptualization and measurement of this
   important construct. In this study, we address these issues and propose
   a flexible and robust theory-based framework for socioeconomic
   stratification, which we apply to identify socio-economic strata during
   a period (2003 and 2009) of substantial. economic and social development
   in one emerging economy (Brazil). We then use this stratification to
   examine the relationship between socioeconomic status and consumption.
   Our socioeconomic stratification framework shows how the recent economic
   development observed in Brazil benefited the lower strata, leading to
   the emergence of the country's "new middle class." We also find that
   despite the high income concentration still prevalent in Brazil,
   consumption in many product categories is more evenly distributed;
   therefore, firms would be ill-advised to follow a premium market
   positioning strategy targeted mostly to the upper classes because this
   would leave a substantial portion of the market to the competition. (C)

AB Nation equity refers to a product's equity that is associated with its
   country of origin (COO). Generalized COO effects have previously been
   studied through experiments and surveys and measured by quality
   perception, product attitude, and purchase intention. We propose a
   structural equilibrium approach to assessing the additional market power
   COO offers, monetizing nation equity with product sales data, and
   computing the price premiums and discounts associated with nation
   equity. We apply this approach to China's personal computer market
   between 1995 and 2008 and find that COO does generate additional market
   power and affects firm markups. We find nation equity to be pervasive,
   significant, and multidimensional, and it evolves over time, but there
   is no simple correspondence between market share and nation equity.
   Large market shares do not necessarily mean positive nation equity and
   price premiums, negative nation equity and price discounts can evolve
   into positive nation equity and price premiums, and vice versa. We
   discuss the implications of our modeling approach and our findings for
   emerging markets in general, and for China in particular. (C) 2012

   Whereas in developed markets the experiential route mostly drives
   persuasion, the functional route is a relatively more important driver

   local/global and traditional/modern. This finding does not hold for

AB Consumers differ in the way their minds and hearts respond to marketing
   communication. Recent research has quantified effectiveness criteria of
   mindset metrics, such as brand consideration and liking, in the purchase
   process for a mature market. This paper develops and illustrates our
   conceptual framework of how mindset effectiveness differs between an
   emerging market and a mature market. We propose that the responsiveness,
   stickiness and sales conversion of mindset metrics depend on the
   regulative, cultural and economic systems that provide structure to
   society. In particular, we focus on regulative protection, collectivism
   and income. First, we propose that a lack of regulative protection leads
   consumers to be more attentive to, and thus more aware of, marketing
   communication. Second, we propose that consumers living in a
   collectivist culture are less responsive to advertising in their
   consideration and liking of the advertised brand. Finally, we propose
   that lower income among consumers reduces the sales conversion of brand
   liking.
   We examine our predictions empirically with data for the same brands
   during the same time period in Brazil and the United Kingdom. First, we
   find that brand liking has a higher responsiveness to advertising, a
   higher stickiness and a higher sales conversion in the U.K. than it does
   in Brazil. Thus, the advice to focus on the emotional brand connection
   is more appropriate in the analyzed mature market versus the emerging
   market. In contrast, knowing the brand is more important to purchase in
   Brazil and is more responsive to advertising. These first findings
   establish an intriguing research agenda on winning hearts and sales in
   emerging and mature markets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Drawing on cultural identity theory, global consumer culture theory, and
   sustainability research, we examine the "green" side of materialism in
   emerging BRIC markets and developed (U.S. and Australian) markets. We
   assess the moderating effect of global cultural identity on the
   relationship between materialism and environmentally friendly tendencies
   using three different conceptualizations and measures of global cultural
   identity the lifestyle and brand dimensions of global consumption
   orientation and global connectedness. In emerging markets, we observe
   strong positive effects of materialism on the concern for
   environmentally friendly products, the willingness to pay extra for
   environmentally friendly products, perceptions of global companies as
   environmentally friendly, and the likelihood to engage in
   environmentally friendly tendencies for the global segment across all
   three conceptualizations of global cultural identity; in addition, for
   individuals with a glocal cultural identity, we observe a significant
   positive relationship between materialism and these measures of
   environmentally friendly tendencies. In developed markets, significant
   effects are observed only for the global segment, but specific effects
   depend on the conceptualization of a global cultural identity.
   Therefore, our results indicate that multinational companies focused on
   combining materialistic appeals with their green positioning in the
   emerging markets must carefully target consumers with a strong global
   cultural identity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As an increasing portion of the world's population identifies itself as
   cosmopolitan, we examine whether cosmopolitan identity involves openness
   and adaptability to new environments or instead favors maintaining a
   global lifestyle that persists across environments. Based on a field
   study of expatriates, we find that the expected duration of sojourn is a
   crucial moderator of cosmopolitan behavior. In short-duration sojourns,
   cosmopolitans adjust more to new environments than non-cosmopolitans. In
   long-duration sojourns, non-cosmopolitans adjust more to the host
   country while cosmopolitans tend to retreat into a global lifestyle. We
   find that these adjustment choices are correlated with well-being,
   contrary to the claims in existing literature on expatriates that
   adjustment should be the preferred behavior regardless of consumer
   identity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   people's motivation to diet. This research study applies a goal
   perspective to explain the effect of exposure to thin models on dieters'
   motivation to lose weight. Two (one-week) weight loss program studies
   that included treatment conditions in which participants were repeatedly
   exposed to either a thin model or to control conditions with either a
   neutral dieting-related cue (Study 1) or a normal-sized model (Study 2)
   were conducted. Female participants who were exposed to the thin model
   perceived their dieting goals as less attainable, engaged in more
   goal-inconsistent behavior (i.e., consuming unhealthy snacks), and had
   less success losing weight. The effect of exposure to thin models on
   weight loss success is mediated specifically by the perceived
   attainability of the thin ideal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   utility that they derive from such activities. We propose that creating

   with self-created products lead to their increased valuation. We
   demonstrate that the feelings of competence that arise from assembling
   products mediate their increased value (Experiment 1), that affirming
   consumers' sense of self decreases the value they derive from their

AB The present paper shows that when a person has the experience of giving
   advice but that advice is not acted upon, there is a reduced openness to
   external information. We call this the "referral backfire effect". We
   argue that this referral backfire effect is due to the identity
   threatening nature of referral failure: the referral back-fire effect is
   attenuated (1) when the sender perceives oneself as having low expertise
   in the particular domain of referral and (2) upon self-affirmation.
   Accordingly, implicit egotism is increased after referral failure,
   reflecting the need to bolster the self against threat. Because referral
   behavior is considered to be an important predictor of business success,
   we discuss the implications of our findings for both theory and practice
   and sketch future research opportunities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Research into the influence of model ethnicity on advertising
   effectiveness usually compares a dominant or mainstream group with a
   single, ethnically distinctive minority group. Such two-group studies
   implicitly assume that all minorities react similarly to distinctive and
   non-distinctive models portrayed in ads. However, minorities differ in
   their level of integration into the dominant societal group, which
   likely influences their responses. This research studies
   target/non-target market effects for minorities whose levels of
   integration into the host society vary. In contrast with relatively less
   integrated minorities, minority groups better integrated into the
   dominant society exhibit target/non-target market effects unlike those
   previously reported. This study also contrasts two mediation routes for
   the observed effects of ethnic models: ad model-self-perceived
   similarity and perceived ad model credibility. The results show that the
   two routes are confounded for less integrated minorities but dissociated
   for better integrated minorities. The findings offer clear applications
   for the advertising industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Although the influence of identity on consumer behavior has been
   documented in many streams of literature, the absence of a consistent
   definition of identity and of generally accepted principles regarding
   the drivers of identity-based behavior complicates comparisons across
   these literatures. To resolve that problem, we propose a simple but
   inclusive definition of identity. Identity can be defined as any
   category label with which a consumer self-associates that is amenable to
   a clear picture of what a person in that category looks like, thinks,
   feels and does. Building from this definition, we propose the following
   five basic principles that can help researchers model the process of
   identity formation and expression: (1) Identity Salience: identity
   processing increases when the identity is an active component of the
   self; (2) Identity Association: the non-conscious association of stimuli
   with a positive and salient identity improves a person's response to the
   stimuli; (3) Identity Relevance: the deliberative evaluation of
   identity-linked stimuli depends on how diagnostic the identity is in the
   relevant-domain; (4) Identity Verification: individuals monitor their
   own behaviors to manage and reinforce their identities; and (5) Identity
   Conflict: identity-linked behaviors help consumers manage the relative
   prominence of multiple identities. To illustrate the potential
   usefulness of these principles for guiding identity research, we discuss
   new avenues for identity research and explain how these principles could
   help guide investigations into these areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Marketers can strategically target potential donors based on their
   political identity. Drawing upon the moral foundations underlying
   political identity, we examine conditions in which a charity's
   positioning increases donations based on its alignment with a political
   identity. In doing so, we demonstrate the moderating role of moral
   identity internalization, which is a robust predictor of donation
   behavior. In three studies, our results reveal that when the moral
   foundations of a charity, as evidenced by the charity's management
   processes (Study 1) or mission (Studies 2 and 3), are aligned with the
   donor's political identity, donations increase. This effect is enhanced
   among those with higher moral identity internalization. These results
   offer theoretical contributions, as well as practical implications, for
   organizations soliciting donations, providing insight into the extent to
   which charity positioning based on moral foundations can differentially
   influence donations based on political identity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   from a large sample of German household consumers. The results confirm
   the influence of five of the six drivers, namely, brand-self similarity,
   brand distinctiveness, brand social benefits, brand warmth, and
   memorable brand experiences. Further, we find that all five of these
   antecedents have stronger causal relationships with CBI when consumers

AB The recent growth of consumer-generated media (CGM), also known as "new"
   media, has changed the interaction between consumers and firms from
   being unidirectional to being bidirectional. However, CGM are almost
   always accompanied by traditional media (such as TV advertising). This
   research addresses the critical question of whether new and traditional
   media reinforce or damage one another's effectiveness. This question is
   important because traditional media, in which a manufacturer creates and
   delivers content to consumers, consume a firm's resources. In contrast
   to these paid media, new media (in which consumers create content and
   this content is exchanged between other consumers and potentially
   between manufacturers) are primarily available for free. This question
   becomes even more salient when new product launches are involved, as
   firms typically allocate approximately half of their marketing budgets
   to support new products.
   One of the most prevalent forms of new media is blogging. Therefore, we
   assemble a unique data set from Japan that contains market outcomes
   (sales) for new products, new media (blogs) and traditional media (TV
   advertising) in the movie category. We specify a simultaneous equation
   log-linear system for market outcomes and the volume of blogs. Our
   results suggest that new and traditional media act synergistically, that
   pre-launch TV advertising spurs blogging activity but becomes less
   effective during the post-launch period and that market outcomes have an
   effect on blogging quantity. We find detailed support for some of these
   results via a unique and novel text-mining analysis and replicate our
   findings for a second product category, cellular phone service. We also
   discuss the managerial implications of our findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier

AB Previous literature has argued that high brand equity helps stabilize
   financial returns and reduce share price volatility. This research
   investigates how some of the strongest brands in the U.S. market fared
   in terms of financial performance during the Fall 2008 stock market
   downturn. Initial results using a financially based measure of brand
   value (Interbrand) show that, counter to expectations, these top brands
   did not outperform the market as a whole. However, the findings are in
   the hypothesized direction when an alternative, consumer-based brand
   equity measure (EquiTrend) is used to replicate the analysis. After
   first employing the three Fama-French factors to evaluate stock
   performance, we assess the added brand equity effect using both
   aforementioned measures. The consumer-based measure shows a significant
   incremental effect on stock performance after controlling for risk and
   financial fundamentals. Furthermore, this positive effect also applies
   to share volatility and firm betas. None of these effects hold for the

AB Prior research on brand equity suggests that consumers use brands as
   signals to reduce uncertainty and perceived risk. Erdem and Swait (1998)
   developed a conceptual framework based on information economics and
   signaling theory to explain how equity is created, maintained and
   transferred over time that involves seven theoretical constructs. This
   paper reviews the impact of brand-equity-associated brand utility on the
   scale of the indirect utility function (i.e., the inverse of the error
   variance); we argue that higher brand-equity-associated brand utility
   reduces the need for consumers to review previously formed preferences.
   We combine a brand utility experiment with a brand feature experiment to
   estimate the effects of brand-equity-associated brand utility scores on
   choice. We find that higher brand-equity-associated brand utility leads
   to higher choice consistency, which can drive increases in market share.

AB Selecting good brand names for products is a critical step for
   marketers, and many aspects of a brand name influence brand perceptions.
   Three experiments investigated the effects of phonetic symbolism (the
   impact of sound on meaning) on brand name preference, the extent to
   which these effects generalize to other languages, and the processes
   that underlie these effects. When choosing brand names, French-,
   Spanish-, and Chinese-speaking participants who were bilingual in
   English preferred words in which there was a match between the phonetic
   symbolism of the words and the product attributes. These results were
   unaffected by whether participants completed the study in their first or
   second language, by second-language proficiency, or by whether the
   Chinese language representations were in logographic or alphabetic form.
   These findings replicate those of Lowrey and Shrum (2007) and indicate
   that phonetic symbolism effects for brand name perceptions can
   generalize across languages, and thus suggest that marketers may be able
   to embed universal meaning in their brand names. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The authors empirically investigate how the choice of agenda strategies
   may enhance economic gain and promote customer relationships when a
   single salesperson must bargain with a buying team. The authors develop
   a framework of multi-issue negotiations for examining two key agenda
   decisions: selecting simultaneous or sequential negotiations; and,
   within sequential negotiations, determining in which order of importance
   multiple issues should be bargained. Using face-to-face bargaining
   settings, the authors demonstrate that, compared to the benchmark of
   single-buyer vs. single-seller negotiations, simultaneous bargaining of
   issues with a buying team raises buyers' perceptions of their power and
   influences a seller's bargaining style. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
   however, these effects do not disadvantage the single salesperson when
   tasked with bargaining with a buying team, as the salesperson is no
   worse off economically than when he or she engages in single-buyer vs.
   single-seller negotiations. Directly comparing simultaneous to
   sequential agenda strategies, the authors show that simultaneous
   negotiations result in more integrative agreements; increased profit to
   the seller; while at the same time lead to increased satisfaction to the
   buyers. In sequential negotiations, the ordering of the relative
   importance of the issues to the parties affects the seller's
   pre-negotiation disposition, bargaining styles, and-of critical
   importance to the seller-the likelihood of reaching an agreement. The
   authors provide managerial implications and contrast them with general
   beliefs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interpersonal Communication (IPC), which includes word of mouth, plays
   an important role in the adoption of new products. Despite the extensive
   study of the role of IPC at the category level, its role at the brand
   level has not received its due attention. Using quarterly data on
   brand-level sales and marketing variables in the SUV category over 10
   years, we show that IPC among previous adopters of a brand directly
   influences the sales of not only the brand itself but also the product
   category as a whole, which, in turn, indirectly influences brand sales.
   Additionally, we show that category-level IPC is distinct and separate
   from brand-level effects. Based on a detailed model-based accounting of
   IPC effects, we separate the direct effect of brand-level IPC on the

AB Copycat brands imitate the trade dress of a leader brand to free ride on
   the latter's equity. Copycats can imitate the distinctive perceptual
   features of the leader brand, such as the lilac color of the Milka
   chocolate brand, or they can imitate the underlying meaning or theme of
   the leader brand, such as the "freshness of Alpine milk" theme in Milka.
   Marketing research and trademark law has focused primarily on the
   effects of feature imitation. In three studies, the authors demonstrate
   the success of theme imitation: Consumers consider feature imitation to
   be unacceptable and unfair, which causes reactance toward the copycat
   brand. Yet, even though consumers are aware of the use of theme
   imitation, it is perceived to be more acceptable and less unfair, which
   helps copycat evaluation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB John, Loken, Kim, and Monga (2006) have introduced brand concept maps
   (BCM) as a powerful approach to measuring brand image according to the
   structure of the underlying brand association networks and reveal the
   strength and uniqueness of brand associations. Interestingly, BCM, as
   well as other consumer mapping techniques, do not incorporate explicit
   measures for the favorability of brand associations. This study extends
   the original BCM approach with explicit information on the favorability
   of single brand associations and, further, develops a new metric, brand
   association network value (BANV), which quantifies overall network
   favorability. Our advanced BCM approach and the new BANV metric are
   managerially relevant in that they allow for comparison of the
   favorability of networks at both individual brand association and
   aggregate network levels. We illustrate the relevance of our BANV metric
   within an empirical application and demonstrate its validity. (C) 2012

AB The methodological discussion on the calibration of aggregate marketing
   response models has shifted away from how to obtain usable input for
   optimization toward how to avoid biases in statistical estimation. The
   purpose of this article is to remind researchers that such calibration
   is performed either to support managers in their marketing-mix decisions
   or to create general knowledge that leads to a better understanding of
   marketing relationships and thus indirectly supports decisions. Both
   goals require response models that are optimizable. The models must also
   be implementable if actual decision support is the objective. Herein. I
   identify several aspects for which these requirements are not always
   fulfilled: First, the appropriateness of the chosen functional form of
   the marketing response models is rarely discussed, although different
   forms imply quite different optimal solutions. Second, endogeneity is
   taken into account by structural equations, even though we lack
   sufficient information on how managers reach their decisions. Third,
   estimation methods for response models are often evaluated based on
   goodness-of-fit, while an assessment of their usefulness for subsequent
   optimization is neglected. Therefore, I provide recommendations for
   improving the current practice by better specifying the response
   function and undertaking more simulation-based evaluations of the best
   estimation method for use in subsequent optimization: With respect to
   implementation, usability can be facilitated using spreadsheets and
   heuristics. Moreover, gaining generalizable and replicable knowledge
   requires better documentation of results, which can be achieved through
   providing elasticities and as many details as are necessary to replicate
   a study, thereby enabling faster learning. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Virtue products (such as sunscreen lotion and dental floss) promise
   future benefits and, at the same time, carry immediate and ongoing usage
   costs. Although consumers acknowledge the benefits of virtue products,
   they find it difficult to consume them on a daily basis. This research
   focuses on a key problem in the consumption of virtue products-ongoing
   use-and identifies ways to help consumers maintain ongoing consumption.
   We propose and show that products' attributes (in terms of future versus
   present benefits) and consumers' dispositional self-control interact to
   shape the consumption of virtue products. In two field experiments that
   use different product categories-dental floss and sunscreen lotion-we
   show that low self-control participants consume a virtue product whose
   product description highlights a present benefit more than they consume
   a virtue product whose description highlights a future benefit. Among
   high self-control participants the reverse effect was observed. In a
   third study we show the same pattern of results when willingness to pay
   is measured. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB At a given point in time, individual consumers may be in different
   stages of the product adoption or consumption cycle. As a result,
   different types of behavioral patterns may coexist within a single
   product market. Existing segmentation approaches typically do not
   address long-term dynamics in customer response and do not adequately
   capture this phenomenon. We develop an approach for modeling the
   coexistence of multiple dynamic behavioral patterns (business scenarios)
   within a single product market. We apply this approach to physician
   panel data on drug prescriptions and direct-to-physician promotions. We
   find markedly different responses across physician segments. For firms
   that track customer-level marketing activity and sales over time, market
   segmentation based on dynamic scenarios can provide a new tool for
   efficient targeting. The proposed approach is straightforward to
   implement and is scalable to very large samples and continuous testing.

AB Recent research has conceptualized consumers' willingness to pay (WTP)
   as a range rather than as a single point. However, there are important
   gaps in this research stream: The existing method to measure WTP as a
   range, ICERANGE, features restrictive assumptions and is rather complex,
   such that it hampers real-world applications. Furthermore, it is unclear
   what has been measured in the past with point-based methods, compared
   with WTP ranges; thus, researchers cannot evaluate "traditional" WTP
   measurements. Most importantly, why should anyone even care about WTP
   ranges? In making pricing decisions, aggregate-level information is
   common, and the add-on information contained in individual WTP ranges
   would seemingly become obsolete when averaging it across consumers. This
   article addresses all three issues: We show empirically that traditional
   point-based methods reveal the midpoint of WTP ranges. Our proposed
   range-based method, which is simpler and less restricted than ICERANGE,
   achieves comparable performance. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to show
   that, except for in rather artificial conditions, point-based methods
   fail to reproduce the revenue-maximizing prices identified by
   range-based methods. Together, these results deliver a compelling
   argument for the use of range-based methods to elicit WTP in real-world
   applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A bucket pricing plan charges a periodic (usually monthly) fixed price
   that allows consumers to use the service up to a set allowance. The
   determination of optimal plans requires knowledge about each consumer's
   simultaneous decision about service subscription, plan choice, and
   consumption, which are interrelated and difficult to predict. In
   addition to prices, service attributes also influence these three
   decisions, but how they do so depends on the particular service
   attribute. This article describes a novel method to predict consumers'
   reactions to bucket pricing plans with varying service attributes and
   develops an algorithm to optimize these plans. Methodologically, we show
   that the failure to model the influence of service attributes correctly
   leads to non-optimal prices and profits, which differ by up to 22.75%
   from the optimal solution. Substantially, we show that bucket pricing
   plans are approximately as profitable as other nonlinear pricing plans
   if at least three bucket pricing plans serve to segment the market.
   Bucket pricing plans therefore present an attractive alternative for
   service providers to differentiate consumers according to their WTP and
   consumption. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research paper investigates the combinatory effects of three
   well-established formal sales control styles: outcome, capability, and
   activity control. Drawing on Expectancy Theory and Cognitive Evaluation
   Theory, the authors theorize that sales control combinations have
   differential impacts on three key intermediary variables (salesperson
   knowledge, role ambiguity, and intrinsic motivation), which subsequently
   affect salesperson performance. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis
   using data from industrial salespeople and their managers indicates that
   (1) the capability and outcome control styles have positive combinatory
   effects that enhance salesperson knowledge and intrinsic motivation
   while mitigating role ambiguity, (2) combining outcome control and
   activity control can increase role ambiguity, and (3) a combination of
   activity control and capability control can enhance role clarity but
   dampen intrinsic motivation. Finally, our results indicate that the
   effects on manager-rated salesperson performance of capability control
   and activity control are fully mediated while the effects of outcome
   control are partially mediated by salesperson knowledge and role
   ambiguity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   empirical study of retail banking customers reveals that online use
   improves customer profitability by increasing customer revenue and
   decreasing cost to serve. Moreover, the revenue effects of online use
   are substantially larger than the cost-to-serve effects, although the
   effects of online use on customer revenue and cost to serve vary by

   greater than online use effects. Ignoring self-selection effects thus
   can lead to poor managerial decision-making. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Past research presents contrasting views regarding the effect of
   assortment size on consumer decision making. Research has suggested that
   large assortments provide a diverse range of choices to consumers and
   thus increase their choice confidence levels and likelihood of making
   choices. Other research, however, has suggested that large assortments
   may have a negative impact on consumers' choice confidence and choice
   likelihoods because of cognitive load and anticipatory post-purchase
   regret. The current research aims to address these contrasting
   conclusions by examining the issue from the motivational goal
   perspective. Specifically, it is demonstrated that when consumers'
   regulatory orientations are promotion-focused, an increase in size of an
   alignable (non-alignable) assortment has a positive (negative) impact on
   their choice confidence levels and choice likelihood. In contrast, when
   consumers' regulatory orientations are prevention-focused, an increase
   in assortment size can have positive impacts on choice confidence levels
   and choice likelihood irrespective of whether the assortment is
   alignable or non-alignable. The findings are demonstrated in an
   experimental setting using a 2 (Consumer's self-regulatory focus:
   Promotion vs. Prevention) x 2 (Assortment type: Alignable vs.
   Non-alignable) x 4 (Size of assortment: 2 vs. 3 vs. 4 vs. 5)

AB This article investigates the optimal spending allocation between
   offensive and defensive marketing in a dynamic, mature market when two
   firms are competing for market share. A modified Lanchester model is
   used to determine Nash stationary feedback strategies that allow the
   competitors to adjust their marketing expenditures as their market
   shares evolve over time. The interaction between offensive and defensive
   marketing activities is an important component of the model. Previous
   studies have not considered this variable. Our findings suggest that a
   cost differential between offensive and defensive marketing cannot fully
   explain resource allocation in a competitive market. Instead, optimal
   allocation largely depends on the firms' relative positions in the
   market, their competitive advantages in offensive and defensive
   marketing, and the costs and effectiveness of these two classes of
   marketing activities. This article discusses the theoretical and

   case method was employed, comprising three rounds of semi-structured
   interviews with senior regional and global marketing managers on six
   continents. Global brand strategy development at KC entails sharing
   information and best practices, implementing common brand planning
   processes, assigning responsibilities for global branding, and creating
   and implementing effective brand-building strategies. Indeed, KC's
   approach, predicated on accountable empowerment and capacity-building,
   is transforming the organization by increasing marketing capability
   locally while instilling better processes and disciplines centrally. An

AB Multinational firms perceive the young adult cohort in emerging markets
   as a relatively homogeneous segment that welcomes global brands and
   facilitates the entrance of these brands into emerging markets. Research
   suggests, however, that young adults are a more heterogeneous cohort in
   which individuals develop a glocal cultural identity that reflects their
   beliefs about both global phenomena and local culture. Our goal is to
   evaluate the glocal cultural identity of the young adult cohort based on
   three global-local identity beliefs (belief in global citizenship
   through global brands, nationalism, and consumer ethnocentrism) in the
   emerging markets of Russia (Studies 1 and 2) and Brazil (Study 2). We
   further assess the consumption practices of the glocal cultural identity
   segments in relation to global and local brands. Results across the two
   studies indicate three distinct segments, two of which, the
   Glocally-engaged and the Nationally-engaged, are consistent across
   countries. A third idiosyncratic segment emerged in each country, the
   Unengaged in Russia and the Globally-engaged in Brazil. The most viable
   segments for multinational firms are the Globally-engaged and the
   Glocally-engaged; these segments have an identity that is grounded in
   both global and local cultures and respond favorably to both global and
   local brands. Nationally-engaged consumers have a more localized
   identity; they are a more challenging target for firms offering only
   global brands. The Unengaged segment has weak global-local identity
   beliefs and low involvement with both global and local consumption
   practices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many advertisers hire agencies to run their search engine marketing
   campaigns: increasingly, they use innovative performance-based
   compensation plans. In these plans, the advertiser pays the agency a fee
   for each conversion (i.e., acquired customer) but requires the agency to
   pay all of the search engine marketing costs. In this article, the
   authors address compensation decision problems for search engine
   marketing for the first time and conclude that such fee-based plans
   lower the advertiser's profit by as much as 26-30%. This article uses a
   simulation study and four empirical data sets to better understand what
   drives this profit loss. Two causes account for the loss: first, the
   agency spends less on advertising than is optimal for the advertiser.
   Second, the agency often earns more to manage the advertiser's campaign
   than its minimum requirement. This higher profit for the agency occurs
   because the advertiser pays the agency more in order to limit the
   agency's potential underspending on advertising. The authors show that
   this latter reason accounts for more than one-third of the advertiser's
   profit loss. This article also offers insights into how the advertiser's
   profit changes if the advertiser is uncertain about its profit per
   conversion or if the advertiser does not truthfully reveal its profit
   per conversion to the agency. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Prior international segmentation studies have been static in that they
   have identified segments that remain stable over time. This paper shows
   that country segments in new product growth are intrinsically dynamic.
   We propose a semiparametric hidden Markov model to dynamically segment
   countries based on the observed penetration pattern of new product
   categories. This methodology allows countries to switch between segments
   over the life cycle of the new product, with time-varying transition
   probabilities. Our approach is based on penalized splines and can thus
   be flexibly applied to any nonstationary phenomenon, beyond the new
   product growth context.
   For the penetration of six new product categories in 79 countries, we
   recover the dynamic membership of each country to segments over the life
   cycle. Our findings reveal substantial dynamics in international market
   segmentation, especially at the beginning of the product life. Finally,
   we exploit the dynamic segments to predict the national penetration
   patterns of a new product before its launch and show that our forecasts
   outperform forecasts derived from alternate parametric and/or static
   methods. Our results should encourage multinational corporations to
   adopt dynamic segmentation methods rather than static methods. (C) 2011

AB This paper examines the effect of regulatory focus on consumer
   satisfaction. In contrast to the disconfirmation of expectations model
   of satisfaction, we find that, although regulatory focus does affect
   consumers' expectations, the effect on satisfaction cannot be explained
   by differences in those expectations. Instead, our results reveal a
   direct effect of consumers' regulatory focus on satisfaction that is
   based on the conservative bias of prevention-focused consumers. Compared
   to promotion-focused consumers, prevention-focused consumers protect
   against making errors and demonstrate a conservative bias in their
   evaluations of satisfaction. The results of two experiments demonstrate
   this conservative bias, showing that, compared to promotion-focused
   consumers, prevention-focused consumers are less satisfied with positive
   outcomes and more satisfied with negative outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB In this paper, we argue that corporate social responsibility (CSR) to
   various stakeholders (customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and
   community) has a positive effect on global brand equity (BE). In
   addition, policies aimed at satisfying community interests help
   reinforce the credibility of social responsibility policies with other
   stakeholders. We test these theoretical contentions by using panel data
   comprised of 57 global brands originating from 10 countries (USA, Japan,
   South Korea, France, UK, Italy, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, and The
   Netherlands) for the period from 2002 to 2008. Our findings show that
   CSR toward each of the stakeholder groups has a positive impact on
   global BE. In addition, global brands that follow local social
   responsibility policies in communities obtain strong positive benefits
   through the generation of BE, enhancing the positive effects of CSR
   toward other stakeholders, particularly customers. Therefore, for
   managers of global brands, when generating brand value, it is
   particularly effective to combine global strategies with the need to
   satisfy the interests of local communities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB More and more companies have customer databases that enable them to
   analyze customer profitability over time. These companies often seek to
   determine the most important customers as indicated by their current or
   historical profitability and focus attention on them. Focusing on
   profitable customers can result in more efficient use of marketing
   resources, but this approach neglects the fact that customers can evolve
   over time. Some customers begin as low-profit customers but eventually
   develop into high-profit customers. Others may start out as high-profit
   customers but become unprofitable over time. Previous efforts to predict
   future profitability have been relatively unsuccessful, with relatively
   simple, naive models often performing just as well as or better than
   more sophisticated ones. Our paper presents a new approach to predicting
   customer profitability in future periods that performs significantly
   better than naive models. We estimate the models on data from a
   high-tech company in a business-to-business context and validate the
   models' predictive ability on a holdout sample.
   We show that a model based on simulation of customer futures provides
   large improvements over naive extrapolation of average profits. By using
   the simulation model to select customers, ROI from marketing efforts is
   projected to increase by 58%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Research on the launch of new products in the international realm is
   scarce. The present paper is the first to document how launch window
   (the difference, in months, between the first worldwide launch and the
   subsequent launch in a specific country) and launch price are
   interrelated and how regulation influences both the launch window and
   launch price. The research context is the global (50 countries
   worldwide) launch of 58 new ethical drugs across 29 therapeutic areas.
   We show that the fastest launch occurs when the launch price is
   moderately high and the highest launch price occurs at a launch window
   of 85 months. We find that the health regulator acts strategically in
   that the extent to which it delays the launch of a new drug increases
   with the price of the new drug. We also find that overall, regulation
   increases the launch window, except for patent protection. Surprisingly,
   regulation does not directly impact launch price. The descriptive
   information on average launch window and launch price and the
   interconnection between launch window and launch price allow managers in
   ethical drug companies to make more informed decisions about
   international market entry. This study also provides public policy
   analysts with more quantitative evidence on launch window and launch
   price across a broad sample of countries and drug therapeutic
   categories. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   immediate effects of crowding in a single firm. Study 2 extends the
   findings of Study 1 and investigates the long-term effects of emotional
   labor and crowding on FSEs across multiple firms. The results show that
   crowding has a negative impact on coping strategies and job-related
   outcomes. In addition, emotional labor can lead to long-term negative
   outcomes, such as emotional exhaustion and decreased job retention, for
   some FSEs. Consequently, service organizations should consider
   strategies or tactics that prevent high levels of customer crowding and

   their intention to switch, and adjusting their attitudes toward the
   target brand upward. We suggest that psychological reactance is a
   mediator of the negative effects of merger information on customers'
   attitudes and switching intentions. We also demonstrate that brand

   the relationships between GCGB and the importance attributed to branded
   products (Study 1: U.S. and Russia) as well as purchases of global
   brands (Study 2: U.S., U.K, and Russia). Our research establishes that
   consumer involvement with branded products and purchases of global
   brands revolves around consumers' use of brands as signals of quality
   and self-identity. In the developing country, results document mediation
   effects for the use of both quality and self-identity signals on the
   importance of branded products and global brand purchases. In developed
   countries, we find that the importance of branded products is explained
   by a greater use of brands as self-identity signals, whereas purchases
   of global brands are explained by a greater use of quality signals.
   Overall, consumers with a stronger belief in GCGB are more likely to use

AB This article describes an empirical study of the rise and fall of star
   athletes, using data from the National Basketball Association (NBA) from
   1987 to 2008. We measure star status by the number and share of all-star
   votes, and we apply both Tobit regression and hazard models to
   investigate the determining factors for star status. We find that the
   attainment of star status begins with the athlete's exceptional
   individual performance. We also find that having won a championship in
   the past can have a long-lasting effect on a player's popularity. The
   popularity of an athlete depends on his team in two ways: the attainment
   of star status is associated with strong team performance, and star
   teammates can reinforce each other's popularity. Interestingly, whereas
   stars can move from a losing team to a winning team to extend their star
   life, a team change can be very risky for new stars. Our results also
   suggest that teams with a large fan base, winning records, and star
   players should leverage these assets in attracting and retaining star

AB This article analyzes one key characteristic shared by a growing number
   of industries. Specifically, their products and services are
   continuously monitored and evaluated by local third-party ratings
   systems. In this study, we focus on understanding the local drivers of
   restrictive age-based ratings in the motion picture industry and the
   effect of local ratings on a movie's performance at the box office. The
   results show that there is a significant negative relationship between
   restrictive ratings and opening weekend box-office performance. However,
   we find no significant effect with respect to cumulative box-office
   performance. In the second part of the study, we focus on the local
   regulatory system's role as a key driver of restrictive age-based
   ratings in the motion picture industry. Interestingly, the results
   suggest that the composition of the board that rates the movie plays a
   key role. Including pediatrics, psychology, or sociology experts in the
   evaluation board instead of only parents or laypeople has a strong
   effect and tends to lead to more lenient rating behavior. In addition,
   we find that larger ratings boards tend to be more restrictive than
   smaller ones and that industry representation is not necessarily
   associated with less restrictive ratings. Countries with cultures
   characterized as uncertainty avoidant, collective, and feminine also
   seem to be most lenient in their ratings. The implications of the
   results are discussed from both international marketing and public
   policy perspectives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose an efficient individually adapted sequential Bayesian
   approach for constructing conjoint-choice experiments, which uses
   Bayesian updating, a Bayesian analysis, and a Bayesian design criterion
   to generate a conjoint-choice design for each individual respondent
   based on the previous answers of that particular respondent. The
   proposed design approach is compared with three non-adaptive design
   approaches, two aggregate-customization approaches (based on the
   conditional logit model and on a mixed logit model), and the (nearly)
   orthogonal design approach, under various degrees of response accuracy
   and consumer heterogeneity. A simulation study shows that the
   individually adapted sequential Bayesian conjoint-choice designs perform
   better than the benchmark approaches in all scenarios we investigated in
   terms of the efficient estimation of individual-level part-worths and
   the prediction of individual choices. In the presence of high consumer
   heterogeneity, the improvements are impressive. The new method also
   performs well when the response accuracy is low, in contrast with the
   recently proposed adaptive polyhedral approach. Furthermore, the new
   methodology yields precise population-level parameter estimates, even
   though the design criterion focuses on the individual-level parameters.

AB The dominant perspective on organizational buying behavior suggests that
   buyers tend to rely on objective criteria when making product choice
   decisions and that the potential influence of subjective cues, such as
   brands, on buyer decision making decreases with increasing risk. An
   alternative perspective, confirmed in this study by in-depth interviews
   with various managers, suggests that brands serve as a risk-reduction
   heuristic, whereby the influence of brands on decision making increases
   as a function of risk. Building on risk and information processing
   theories, this research builds on these complementary perspectives to
   propose that risk and brand sensitivity relate in a U-shaped manner,
   where brand sensitivity is highest in relatively low- or high-risk

   involving 206 and 180 members of buying centers, respectively suggest
   that both perspectives have merit and support the proposed nonlinear

   sensitivity relationship is moderated by competitive intensity, such
   that the linear (negative) and quadratic (positive) effects are stronger
   when competitive intensity is low. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   anti-hyperlipidemia drugs on patient behaviors. The key findings are:
   (a) DTCA expenditures have a positive and long-term effect on the number
   of visits to physicians by newly diagnosed hyperlipidemia patients. (b)
   The effectiveness of DTCA in generating new patient visits varies
   substantially across patient sub-groups. (c) The effect of DTCA is
   larger on drug visits than on non-drug-only visits. (d) Own-brand DTCA
   expenditures increase the number of patient requests for Lipitor and
   Zocor, but have no effect on patient requests for Pravachol. Competing
   drugs' DTCA expenditures have a positive effect only on patient requests
   for the leading brand, Lipitor. (e) A cost-effectiveness analysis
   suggests that the economic benefits of DTCA in terms of life years saved
   by preventing cardiovascular disease are considerably larger than the
   costs of advertising. (f) DTCA on TV has strong effects on underserved
   segments of the population, such as those on Medicaid. We believe this
   finding should be carefully considered by proponents of a complete ban
   or stricter regulations on DTCA. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB We show that the optimal advertising strategy under the Generalized Bass
   Model (GBM) involves beginning at an extremely low level (the lower the
   better) and then increasing spending throughout the planning period.
   This strategy remains optimal in the presence of decreasing prices that
   affect both margins and diffusion speed. We provide a simple explanation
   for why this happens. We further show that the intuitively appealing
   patterns of continuous decrease or increase-then-decrease (both with an
   uptick towards the end) identified in earlier research are also possible
   as optimal dynamic advertising paths under the GBM structure, but only
   if the advertising at launch is constrained to be higher than a
   particular threshold, which we identify. The constraint necessary to
   generate intuitively appealing strategies lowers overall profits.
   Therefore, the GBM generates advertising policy recommendations that
   most marketers would deem odd. This casts doubt on the value of the GBM
   for normative purposes. Other existing diffusion models are preferred
   when seeking normative guidance on optimal dynamic advertising policies
   for new products subject to word of mouth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

AB In any academic discipline, published articles in their respective
   journals represent "production units" of scientific knowledge, and
   bibliometric distributions reflect the patterns in this productivity
   across authors or "producers". We use a comprehensive data set from 11
   leading marketing journals to examine whether there is any empirical
   regularity in the patterns of research productivity in the marketing
   literature. Our results present strong evidence that there is indeed a
   distinct empirical regularity. It is the so-called generalized Lotka's
   Law of patterns in scientific productivity: the number of authors
   publishing n papers is approximately 1/n(c) of those publishing one
   paper. We find the empirically estimated value of the exponent c to be
   2.05 for the overall bibliometric data across the leading marketing
   journals. For individual journals, the estimated values of c range from
   2.15 to 2.83, with lower values indicating higher authorship
   concentration levels. We also find that variations in authorship
   concentration levels across journals and over time are driven by a
   journal's maturity, its topical focus, its attractiveness as a
   publication outlet, the characteristics of its review process, and the
   extent of author collaboration present in the journal. We discuss the
   general implications of our findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The application of structural equation models (SEMs) is common in
   marketing and the behavioral sciences. Accordingly, the exploration of
   more effective methods to estimate SEMs is also a popular area of
   research. Croon (2002) and Skrondal and Laake (2001) have each proposed
   a new method for estimating SEMs, but since these proposals nearly a
   decade ago, these methods have been mostly overlooked by applied
   researchers. We suggest that reasons for this oversight may include not
   only a lack of guidance in implementing these new methods but also the
   absence of a formal comparison to review these new methods relative to
   the more familiar maximum likelihood structural equation modeling
   (MLSEM) and partial least squares (PLS). In this paper, our goal was to
   make the Croon and Skrondal-Laake (SL) methods more accessible to
   applied researchers. We first provide a step-by-step illustration of how
   to implement the Croon and SL methods. We also present the first
   comprehensive evaluation of the new methods relative to MLSEM and PLS.
   From this evaluation, we can better appreciate the circumstances under
   which these new methods are preferable to MLSEM and PLS. Thus, we intend
   to help readers understand how and when to apply these new methods. (C)

AB Faced with growing environmental problems, food safety issues, and
   increasing obesity rates, many consumers desire healthier, less
   processed natural foods that are less harmful to the environment. Yet
   organic foods only partially benefit from this market environment, and
   their market share remains quite low despite high growth rates. The
   usual explanation for this discrepancy is that consumers are not willing
   to pay the price premium prompted by an organic claim. In this paper, we
   explore the reasons behind consumers' (un) willingness to pay for
   organic food and investigate whether it differs between virtue and vice
   food categories. The results indicate that in vice food categories,
   organic claims are associated with lower quality, which seems to be only
   partly compensated by higher prosocial benefits. The lower-quality
   perceptions translate into a decreased consumer willingness to pay
   (WTP). We supplement the empirical results with data on organic
   purchases ill the Dutch food market. These data show that market shares
   of organic food are indeed lower for vice categories of organic food.

AB Agent-based modeling can illuminate how complex marketing phenomena
   emerge from simple decision rules. Marketing phenomena that are too
   complex for conventional analytical or empirical approaches can often be
   modeled using this approach. Agent-based modeling investigates aggregate
   phenomena by simulating the behavior of individual "agents," such as
   consumers or organizations. Some useful examples of agent-based modeling
   have been published in marketing journals, but widespread acceptance of
   the agent-based modeling method and publication of this method in the
   highest-level marketing journals have been slowed by the lack of widely
   accepted standards of how to do agent-based modeling rigorously. We
   address this need by proposing guidelines for rigorous agent-based
   modeling. We demonstrate these guidelines, and the value of agent-based
   modeling for marketing research, through the use of an example. We use
   an agent-based modeling approach to replicate the Bass model of the
   diffusion of innovations, illustrating the use of the proposed
   guidelines to ensure the rigor of the analysis. We also show how
   extensions of the Bass model that would be difficult to carry out using
   traditional marketing research techniques are possible to implement
   using a rigorous agent-based approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   stronger (weaker) preference for the focal option when each option has

AB This paper explores how the dimensions of new products, specifically,
   the originality and usefulness of the products, influence word-of-mouth
   (WOM). In four studies, using lab and field setups, we find that
   originality and usefulness have different effects on WOM. We show that
   consumers spread more WOM about original products, but the valence of
   what they say depends on the usefulness of the product. Therefore,
   originality enhances the effect of usefulness such that consumers spread
   relatively more and more positively valenced WOM about original and
   useful products compared to less original but equally useful products.
   Conversely, consumers spread more and more negatively valenced WOM about
   original products that are not useful compared to less original products
   with the same level of low usefulness. The results indicate that product
   originality should be managed carefully when developing and positioning
   new products. Although originality increases buzz, it might lead to
   negatively valenced WOM when the usefulness of the product is perceived
   to be low. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Similarity between a core product and an extension product is regarded
   as a key success factor for brand extensions. However, a review of the
   literature reveals that the conditions under which high similarity is
   beneficial are unclear. In the first experiment, the authors test three
   models (the brand-attitude-transfer model, the
   incongruity-induced-affect model, and the "you cannot be good or bad at
   everything" principle) to predict the role of similarity. They find
   support only for the brand-attitude-transfer model. This suggests that
   high similarity is only beneficial when consumers evaluate brands
   favorably. Furthermore, little is known about how additional information
   provided by the supplier affects consumers' similarity perceptions
   without changing the extension product itself more than on a superficial
   level and without emphasizing common benefits. The authors compare the
   conditions of high and low core product/extension category similarity.
   Under the former condition, common peripheral advertising cues,
   similarity primes, portrayals of core products, and common peripheral
   design cues increase evaluations of extension products when the brand is
   evaluated favorably. Under the latter condition, these cues differ with
   respect to their effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research has shown that consumer intentions to adopt
   innovations are often poor predictors of adoption behavior. An important
   reason for this may be that the evaluative criteria consumers use in
   both stages of the adoption process weigh differently. Using construal
   level theory, we develop expectations on the influence of innovation
   characteristics across the intention and behavior stages of the adoption
   process. Using meta-analysis, we derive generalizations on drivers of
   intentions and actual innovation adoption behavior. The results show
   important differences across both stages. Consumers show higher levels
   of adoption intention for innovations that are more complex, better
   match their needs, and involve lower uncertainty. However, consumers are
   found to actually adopt innovations with less complexity and higher
   relative advantages. Adopter demographics are found to explain little
   variance in adoption intention and behavior, whereas adopter
   psychographics are found to be influential in both stages. These
   findings have implications for innovation adoption theory, for managers
   involved in new product and service marketing, and for future research

AB The role of market orientation as an antecedent of new product

   less clear, however, is how firms should make use of their market
   orientation under different market conditions. This study addresses this
   question by investigating how market orientation leads to superior new
   product performance for products that enter the market at different
   times. In particular, the study examines the moderating effect of order
   of market entry on the mediated relationship between market orientation
   and new product performance via product quality and innovation speed.
   Data from a sample of 244 new product development projects show that a
   firm's market orientation can improve the performance of first-to-market
   products and late entrants by facilitating the development of quality

AB Do customers increase or decrease their spending in response to the
   introduction of an informational website? To answer this question, this
   study considers the effects of the introduction and use of an
   informational website by a large national retailer on offline customer
   buying behavior. More specifically, we study a website's effects on the
   number of shopping trips and the amount spent per category per shopping
   trip. The model is calibrated through the estimation of a Poisson model
   (shopping trips) and a type-II tobit model (the amount spent per
   category per shopping trip), with effect parameters that vary across
   customers. For the focal retailer, an informational website creates more
   bad than good news; most website visitors engage in fewer shopping trips
   and spend less in all product categories. The authors also compare the
   characteristics of shoppers who exhibit negative website effects with
   those few shoppers who show positive effects and thus derive key
   implications for research and practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Successful product line design and development often require a balance
   of technical and market tradeoffs. Quantitative methods for optimizing
   product attribute levels using preference elicitation (e.g., conjoint)
   data are useful for many product types. However, products with
   substantial engineering content involve critical tradeoffs in the
   ability to achieve those desired attribute levels. Technical tradeoffs
   in product design must be made with an eye toward market consequences,
   particularly when heterogeneous market preferences make differentiation
   and strategic positioning critical to capturing a range of market
   segments and avoiding cannibalization.
   We present a unified methodology for product line optimization that
   coordinates positioning and design models to achieve realizable
   firm-level optima. The approach overcomes several shortcomings of prior
   product line optimization models by incorporating a general Bayesian
   account of consumer preference heterogeneity, managing attributes over a
   continuous domain to alleviate issues of combinatorial complexity, and
   avoiding solutions that are impossible to realize. The method is
   demonstrated for a line of dial-readout scales, using physical models
   and conjoint-based consumer choice data. The results show that the
   optimal number of products in the line is not necessarily equal to the
   number of market segments, that an optimal single product for a
   heterogeneous market differs from that for a homogeneous one, and that
   the representational form for consumer heterogeneity has a substantial
   impact on the design and profitability of the resulting optimal product
   line even for the design of a single product. The method is managerially
   valuable because it yields product line solutions efficiently,
   accounting for marketing-based preference heterogeneity as well as
   engineering-based constraints with which product attributes can be
   realized. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Designing optimal products is one of the most critical activities for a
   firm to stay competitive. Except for genetic algorithms, previous
   approaches that solve the optimal product line design problem provide
   the decision maker with a single best solution. Furthermore, they assume
   a static market, in which the incumbent firms will not respond to the
   entrance of a new player. In this paper we apply a new population-based
   algorithm called particle swarm optimization to the problem and employ a
   Monte Carlo simulation to compare its performance to that of genetic
   algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed particle swarm
   optimization algorithm constitutes an attractive alternative for solving
   the optimal product line design problem because its performance is
   comparable to that of genetic algorithms concerning the best solution
   found while it outperforms genetic algorithms regarding the diversity of
   the final set of provided solutions. Furthermore, we use concepts from
   game theory to illustrate how the algorithm can be extended to
   incorporate retaliatory actions from competitors. The dynamic approach
   is illustrated through a real-world case in which a firm intends to
   enter the Greek retail milk market. While employing highly simplifying
   assumptions, the incorporation of the Nash equilibrium concept provides
   useful insights, such as the attribute levels that may be resistant to
   competitive reactions and the incumbent firms that will benefit most in
   the long term. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   On reviewing these two papers, one could concentrate on the algorithms
   and heuristics that make the complex problem of product line
   optimization tractable. Such an analysis would be valuable. Instead I
   concentrate on the strategic environment in which the optimization
   decision takes place to allow a consideration of applications and
   extensions within a managerial context. I do that by suggesting a
   framework for product line decisions after a brief overview of both
   articles. That enables me to examine managerial issues that arise in
   implementing such an approach in practice, many of which are addressed
   in the two papers. For those issues not addressed in the papers, I
   propose a set of research questions which would be valuable to managers.

AB Extant customer-base models like the beta geometric/negative binomial
   distribution (BG/NBD) predict future purchasing based on customers'
   observed purchase history. We extend the BG/NBD by adding an important
   non-transactional element that also drives future purchases: complaint
   history. Our model retains several desirable properties of the BG/NBD:
   it can be implemented in readily available software, and estimation
   requires only customer-specific statistics, rather than detailed
   transaction-sequence data. The likelihood function is closed-form, and
   managerially relevant metrics are obtained by drawing from beta and
   gamma densities and transforming these draws to a sample average. Based
   on more than two years of individual-level data from a major U.S.
   internet and catalog retailer, our model with complaints outperforms
   both the original BG/NBD and a modified version. Even though complaints
   are rare and non-transactional events, they lead to different
   substantive insights about customer purchasing and drop-out: customers
   purchase faster but also drop out much faster. Furthermore, there is
   more heterogeneity in drop-out rates following a purchase than a
   complaint. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The linear functional form of the effect of customer satisfaction on
   repurchase intentions may not be adequate under all circumstances;
   however, we lack a clear understanding of the factors that may drive
   variation in the functional forms of the satisfaction-loyalty
   relationship. Building on existing research, the authors consider how
   the functional form of the effect of satisfaction on repurchase
   intentions varies across segments formed at the intersection of product
   categories and customer economic and demographic variables. A
   comprehensive data set obtained from the sponsors of the Chinese
   Customer Satisfaction Index provides the input for a flexible cubic
   regression configuration to model the functional forms. The linear
   functional form emerges as the most prominent across 972
   product-customer segments (51%), followed in frequency by the S-shaped
   and convex forms and, finally, the inverse S-shape and concave forms.
   Different product category characteristics, customer economic and
   demographic variables, and market characteristics moderate the effect of
   satisfaction on repurchase intentions differently for the linear,
   quadratic, and cubic terms. This research reveals key resource
   allocation implications based on the functional forms of the effect of
   satisfaction on repurchase intentions, as well as strategic segmentation
   implications related to the varying influence of product category
   characteristics, customer economic and demographic variables, and market

AB In this paper, we identify and quantify peer-to-peer effects using
   physician prescription data and patient movement data between
   physicians. We categorize the movements into three types: 1) primary
   care physician (PCP) to specialist and back, 2) specialist to
   specialist, and 3) PCP to PCP. In-depth physician interviews and surveys
   reveal different reasons for these movements: PCP to PCP is purely
   patient-generated; PCP to specialist is mostly physician-generated; and
   specialist to specialist is a mix of patient- and physician-generated
   movements. We estimate a simultaneous equations model on these three
   types of movements and find that in the purely patient-generated
   movement sample (PCP to PCP), the physicians have a significantly
   negative effect on each other's prescription behavior due to
   observational learning and congestion effects. In contrast, in the PCP
   to specialist sample and the specialist to PCP sample, we find that the
   specialist has a significantly positive effect on the PCP but not vice
   versa. This result suggests an opinion leader effect. Specialist to
   specialist movement is a mixed case, and the effect is insignificant in
   most cases. Based on model estimates, we calculate the social multiplier
   to quantify the effect of opinion leaders on other physicians in the
   sample. We find focal specialists who are high prescribers are more
   likely to be opinion leaders. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study contributes to research on the impact that consumer buzz has
   on movie distribution and box office success by examining the impact of
   buzz generated about the individual stars and about the movie itself.
   The results indicate that movie buzz is instrumental in boosting box
   office revenue throughout the theatrical release, not just in the later
   run, as has been suggested in previous studies. Star buzz can enhance
   box office receipts during the opening week and can contribute to the
   public's anticipation of the movie pre-release. However, early buzz can
   have a negative impact on revenue during subsequent weeks if the movie
   fails to resonate with the audiences. Model simulations reveal that,
   even for poorly received films, the overall impact of star buzz is
   positive because the initial revenue boost normally outweighs the later
   decline. Thus, this study empirically demonstrates the positive impact
   of star buzz on revenue, which helps shed light on the long-standing
   debate regarding the importance of star participation in the success of
   a movie. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Existing consumer innovativeness scales ignore the multitude of
   motivation sources of buying innovations. The objective of this paper is
   to incorporate different motivations into a multi-dimensional
   innovativeness scale to better account for the consumer-product
   relationship. An extensive literature review and five studies (with
   about 2600 respondents in total) indicate that four types of motivation
   underlie consumer innovativeness: functional, hedonic, social, and
   cognitive. The proposed 20-item four-dimensional Motivated Consumer
   Innovativeness (MCI) scale proves to be reliable and internally valid
   and does not seem to suffer from social desirability bias. Moreover, the
   results of the studies indicate the predictive validity of every MCI
   dimension. This new scale proves to measure more than existing consumer
   innovativeness scales; the different MCI dimensions predict innovative
   purchase intentions better than both traditional and recently developed
   innovativeness scales, and they disprove the general consensus that
   older people are always significantly less innovative than younger
   people. This MCI scale can serve as a tool for future research on
   efficiently and effectively segmenting and targeting (motivated
   innovative) consumers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Survey research is fraught with serious response biases. This study
   examines the extent and impact of three important response biases in
   cross-national research: socially desirable responding, yea-saying, and
   nay-saying. From a survey of 5569 respondents across 15 countries, the
   study finds evidence of substantial differences in response biases
   across countries. Socially desirable responding is highest in Singapore
   and Italy, yea-saying is highest in Brazil and India, and nay-saying is
   highest in the Netherlands and Japan. These response biases lead to
   erroneous conclusions about innovativeness based on surveys as compared
   to that based on the market penetration of new products. In particular,
   the biases lead to the over-reporting or under-reporting of innovative
   traits and the over-reporting of the adoption of new products. Overall,
   negatively valenced items that show the least susceptibility to these
   response biases can help predict both actual penetration at the
   aggregate level as well as individual probabilities of adoption and
   should be included in cross-national surveys. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This paper integrates findings from marketing and finance literature to
   increase our understanding of consumers' decisions to purchase
   innovative investment products. Two different surveys administered to
   individual investors examine the psychological and sociological drivers
   of dispositional innovativeness and its effects on adoption timing and
   range of adoption for five new investment products. Study 1 shows that
   consumer psychographics (e.g.. market mavenism, product-category
   involvement, and ambiguity intolerance) rather than socio-demographics
   (e.g., age, education, and risk profile) explain dispositional
   innovativeness and that dispositional innovativeness strongly impacts
   time of adoption and ownership of new investment products. Study 2
   cross-validates the results of Study 1 and investigates the indirect
   effects of dispositional innovativeness on adoption timing through
   consumers' perceptions of new investment products' complexity,
   riskiness, and visibility (exposure to and engagement in word-of-mouth).
   Individuals who score high on dispositional innovativeness adopt new
   investment products quickly because they perceive lower complexity and
   greater visibility, not because they perceive lower risk. The combined
   results of Studies 1 and 2 show that individual investors' psychological
   and sociological roots systematically explain their innovative adoption
   behavior and indicate that - counter to standard finance predictions
   they incorporate more than just risk-return trade-offs in their
   investment choices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Today, consumer reviews are available on the Internet for a large number
   of product categories. The pros and cons expressed in this way uncover
   individually perceived strengths and weaknesses of the respective
   products, whereas the usually assigned product ratings represent their
   overall valuation. The key question at this point is how to turn the
   available plentitude of individual consumer opinions into aggregate
   consumer preferences, which can be used, for example, in product
   development or improvement processes. To solve this problem, an
   econometric framework is presented that can be applied to the mentioned
   type of data after having prepared it using natural language processing
   techniques. The suggested methodology enables the estimation of
   parameters, which allow inferences on the relative effect of product
   attributes and brand names on the overall evaluation of the products.
   Specifically, we discuss options for taking opinion heterogeneity into
   account. Both the practicability and the benefits of the suggested
   approach are demonstrated using product review data from the mobile
   phone market. This paper demonstrates that the review-based results
   compare very favorably with consumer preferences obtained through

   extension evaluations without considering an important financial
   implication: the ability of the extension product to charge a price
   premium. This study analyzes (1) the extent to which consumers are
   willing to pay a price premium for the extension product and (2) the
   impact of potential success drivers on consumers' attitudes toward the
   extension and the extension price premium. The results show, for
   example, that perceived advertising support positively influences
   consumers' attitudes toward the extension, but it does not directly
   affect the magnitude of the brand extension price premium. Furthermore,
   this study reveals monetary effects associated with these success
   drivers (i.e., parent brand quality, perceived fit, marketing support
   for the brand extension, and consumer experience with the extension
   category), which offer important information regarding how to allocate
   resources to various success drivers. For example, brand investments
   that increase perceptions of parent brand quality by one unit
   (seven-point scale) tend to enhance the brand extension price premium of
   typical fast moving consumer goods (average price of (sic)2.04 in the
   study sample) by (sic).208, all else being equal. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB In Business-to-Business (B2B) environments, many firms focus their
   branding activities on the dissemination of their brand name and logo
   without developing a more comprehensive brand identity. Thus, the
   creation of brand awareness is an important goal in many B2B branding
   strategies. However, it is still unclear if the great investment
   necessary to build a high level of brand awareness really pays off in
   business markets. Therefore, drawing on information economics theory,
   this paper investigates under which conditions brand awareness is
   associated with market performance in a B2B context. Results from a
   cross-industry study of more than 300 B2B firms show that brand
   awareness significantly drives market performance. This link is
   moderated by market characteristics (product homogeneity and
   technological turbulence) and typical characteristics of organizational
   buyers (buying center heterogeneity and time pressure in the buying
   process). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   supply (e.g., "limited edition") and scarcity due to demand (e.g., "only
   a few units remain"). The data obtained from two surveys show that the
   appearance of a positive scarcity effect depends on the product's
   suitability for conspicuous consumption. If a product is used for
   conspicuous consumption, signals of scarcity due to limited supply are
   advantageous compared to signals of scarcity due to high demand. On the
   contrary, if a product is not used for conspicuous consumption, signals
   of scarcity due to high demand result in more favorable product

AB Questionnaires using Likert-type rating scales are an important source

   formats with varying numbers of response categories and varying label
   formats (e.g., 7-point rating scales labeled at the endpoints, fully
   labeled 5-point scales, etc.) but have few guidelines when selecting a
   specific format. Drawing from the literature on response styles, we
   formulate hypotheses on the effect of the labeling of response
   categories and the number of response categories on the net acquiescence
   response style, extreme response style and misresponse to reversed
   items. We test the hypotheses in an online survey (N=1207) with eight
   experimental conditions and a follow-up study with two experimental
   conditions (N=226). We find evidence of strong effects of scale format
   on response distributions and misresponse to reversed items, and we

AB Prior research suggests that while business-to-business (B2B) brands
   influence organizational buying decisions, their relative importance is
   modest at best. Unfortunately, extant studies are largely silent about
   the determinants of brand importance in business markets. This research
   effort begins to address this important knowledge gap by investigating
   the moderated relationships between brand consciousness, brand
   preference, brand sensitivity, and brand importance. We propose that
   these four constructs represent a belief-attitude-intention-behavior
   hierarchy of effects (HOE) capable of explaining why the relative
   importance of brands differs across purchase situations. Data provided
   by 273 organizational buying center members provide strong support for
   the proposed HOE model and suggest that: (1) under conditions of low
   competitive intensity or when marketing maintenance repair and
   operations (MRO) supplies, brand consciousness is the primary
   determinant of brand importance, and (2) under conditions of high
   competitive intensity or when marketing high-tech products, brand
   preference is the primary determinant of brand importance. Moreover, the
   results indicate that distinctions between the four HOE brand constructs
   evaluated within this study are important and have substantive
   implications for branding research and practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Family firms play a significant role in the U.S. economy. Not all family
   firms, however, use their family name as part of their firm name. For
   example, while Dell Inc. and Gap Inc. are both family firms, Dell Inc.'s
   name includes the name of the founding Dell family, but Gap Inc.'s name
   does not include the name of the founding Fisher family. This research
   explores differences in strategic behavior between family firms that use
   their family name as part of their firm name (termed family-named firms,
   or FN firms) and those that do not (termed non-family-named firms, or
   NFN firms). The authors also investigate whether FN firms perform better
   than NFN firms, and whether or not their superior performance is
   mediated by differences in their strategic behavior. Findings based on a
   multi-industry sample of 130 publicly listed U.S. family firms over a
   five-year period (2002-2006) show that, compared to NFN firms, FN firms
   have significantly higher levels of corporate citizenship and
   representation of their customers' voice (i.e., presence of a chief
   marketing officer) in the top management team. FN firms also have a
   higher strategic emphasis (i.e., a greater emphasis on value
   appropriation relative to value creation) compared to NFN firms.
   Furthermore, FN firms perform better (i.e., have a higher ROA) than NFN
   firms, and their superior performance is partially mediated by their
   higher corporate citizenship levels and higher strategic emphasis. The
   authors highlight the significance of these findings for both theory and
   practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Brand-nonspecific retailer coupons that entitle customers to
   assortment-wide discounts appeal in similar ways to national brand (NB)
   and private label (PL) users. The latter may be considered an attractive
   target group because they express high levels of deal proneness.
   However, it is unclear how assortment-wide retailer coupons affect
   customers' purchase behavior. In particular, nothing is known about how
   PL users behave during coupon promotions. The authors deal with these
   issues by conducting a large-scale field experiment (N = 28,000). They
   find that assortment-wide coupons increase both segments' (PL vs. NB
   users) profitability but that the route to increased profitability is
   different for the two groups. In the group of PL users, segment-level
   profitability is mainly driven by additional customers who would not
   have made a purchase in the absence of the promotion. On the contrary,
   in the segment of NB users, individual profitability increases because
   customers trade up to more expensive brands and/or products. Based on
   the differences in response behavior, the authors derive
   segment-specific managerial recommendations and emphasize that different
   promotional aims should be associated with PL and NB users. (C) 2010

AB Diffusion processes of new products and services have become
   increasingly complex and multifaceted in recent years. Consumers today
   are exposed to a wide range of influences that include word-of-mouth
   communications, network externalities, and social signals. Diffusion
   modeling, the research field in marketing that seeks to understand the
   spread of innovations throughout their life cycle, has adapted to
   describe and model these influences.
   We discuss efforts to model these influences between and across markets
   and brands. In the context of a single market, we focus on social
   networks, network externalities, takeoffs and saddles, and technology
   generations. In the context of cross-markets and brands, we discuss
   cross-country influences, differences in growth across countries, and
   effects of competition on growth.
   On the basis of our review, we suggest that the diffusion framework, if
   it is to remain a state-of-the-art paradigm for market evolution, must
   broaden in scope from focusing on interpersonal communications to
   encompass the following definition: Innovation diffusion is the process
   of the market penetration of new products and services that is driven by
   social influences, which include all interdependencies among consumers
   that affect various market players with or without their explicit
   knowledge.
   Although diffusion modeling has been researched extensively for the past
   40 years, we believe that this field of study has much more to offer in
   terms of describing and incorporating current market trends, which
   include the opening up of markets in emerging economies, web-based
   services, online social networks, and complex product-service
   structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To operate effectively in global markets, marketing managers need to
   understand that consumer response to globalization may be more complex
   than is commonly assumed. We examine a proposed conceptual framework to
   describe consumers' responses to globalization through a cross-national
   survey on consumer support for a pan-European government policy aimed at
   countering global convergence by preserving local cultural divergence.
   We find that consumer support for the policy increases with beliefs
   about the policy's efficacy in preserving the authenticity of cultural
   products and protecting their local economic production structures,
   while it decreases with beliefs about policy-induced price increases.
   The national cultural values of individualism and masculinity influence
   this tradeoff between cultural and economic considerations. These
   findings are further corroborated by secondary data on 22 EU countries.

   approach can recover the true configuration with reasonable accuracy, is
   scalable in terms of the number of estimated parameters, and can produce

AB The present paper shows that the frequency of people's compliance with a
   request can be substantially increased if the requester first gets them
   to agree with a series of statements unrelated to the request but
   selected to induce agreement. We label this effect the 'mere-agreement
   effect' and present a two-step similarity-based mechanism to explain it.
   Across five studies, we show that induced mere agreement subtly causes
   respondents to view the presenter of the statements as similar to
   themselves, which in turn increases the frequency compliance with a
   request from that same person. We support the similarity explanation by
   showing that the effect of agreement on compliance is suppressed when
   agreement is induced to indicate dissimilarity with the interviewer,
   when the request is made by some other person, and when the artificially
   high level of agreement is made salient. We also validate the practical
   relevance of the mere-agreement persuasion technique in a field study.
   We discuss how the mere-agreement effect can be broadly used as a tool
   to increase cooperation and be readily implemented in marketing
   interactions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Price differentiation has long been recognized as a strategy that
   companies can use to increase profits when consumers' tastes and
   valuations of a good differ. Operating multiple distribution channels
   (e.g., offline and online stores) that have varying degrees of
   functionality and are differently valued by consumers gives companies an
   opportunity to apply differential prices in these different contexts.
   Nevertheless, existing empirical studies suggest that multi-channel
   retailers charge uniform prices through their different distribution
   channels to preserve channel consistency and avoid consumer irritation.
   In this paper, we study channel-based price differentiation and
   empirically determine the extent of its occurrence among multi-channel
   retailers. Additionally, we analyze factors that influence a company's
   decision to engage in channel-based price differentiation. The results
   show that multi-channel retailers recognize the opportunity to increase
   their profits and increasingly engage in channel-based price
   differentiation; this finding contradicts existing empirical studies on
   price dispersion. Consistent with microeconomic theory, it seems that
   price differentiation mostly occurs among big companies with market
   power that can separate markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights
