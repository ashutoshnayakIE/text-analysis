TI CONSUMER PURCHASES IN INFORMAL MARKETS - ESTIMATES FOR THE 1980S,
   PROSPECTS FOR THE 1990S
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This research was designed to reveal the magnitude of consumer use of informal suppliers, in order to assess the extent of unmeasured or "underground" economic activity in the United States economy.  The results of this study are based on three national probability samples of households that reported their purchases across 14 broad categories of goods and services.  Data were collected using both annual and monthly recall periods.  The authors conclude that consumers' use of suppliers in the underground economy accounts for a very minor portion of consumer expenditures.  However informal retailing was found to be a robust and growing segment.

For each segment, it examines the effect on adoption of the characteristics of two different types of innovations, and reports consistencies within and differences between segments.  Together with existing research on innovators, this research provides a framework for identifying innovator segments and reaching them with communication designed to pique their interest.  Other research and managerial implications are also explored.

TI A MODELING FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING RETAIL STORE DURATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A rich data set on 4,600 franchised retail stores belonging to a single chain is analyzed.  Some of these stores are still in operation, so that basic statistics such as the mean and/or median duration of the sample cannot be computed directly.  A stochastic mixture model is developed that allows these important characteristics to be estimated.  Moreover, our formal modeling approach allows us to make comparisons and draw managerial implications that could not have been done using conventional methods.  Finally, we make a case for using percentiles (e.g., medians) of the formal distribution since the "fat-tailed" behavior of the typical duration distributions renders the usual moments, e.g.  means and variances, either misleading or possessing the preposterous value of infinity.

TI A PILOT TEST OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE JAPANESE DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Japanese trade practices continue to receive a great deal of discussion in both academic and trade circles.  Foreign manufacturers of consumer goods believe that Japanese channel members do not provide foreign goods with the same level of support that domestic goods receive.  Unfortunately, this has been difficult to validate since the level of analysis usually neglects merchandising support at the store level-where the success or failure of a product is often determined.  A pilot study was conducted to develop a methodology that compared the relative levels of distribution and merchandising support for foreign and domestic brands.  An intensive analysis of one product category in 131 Japanese retail stores was used to determine whether, after controlling for market share, foreign brands within the product category receive comparable treatment on a variety of merchandising indices.  Results indicate that foreign products receive fair treatment.

TI CONSUMER RESPONSES TO RETAIL STOCK-OUTS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Responses to an in-store interview of consumers who experienced an out-of-stock on items removed from the grocery shelves by researchers indicated that 32 percent of consumers purchased a different brand, 41 percent purchased a different size or variety of the same brand, 13 percent delayed purchase, and 14 percent went to another store.  Perceived product risk, urgency of need, and product usage were found to be factors in the decision to substitute.  Repeat brand purchase patterns were not found to influence the decision to substitute but were found to influence the specific substitution made, if an item was substituted for the out-of-stock.  In those cases where no substitution was made, store loyalty was found to influence the decision to delay the purchase or to go to another store.

TI JAPAN DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM - INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE, INTERNAL
   POLITICAL-ECONOMY, AND MODERNIZATION
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The author develops the argument that the Japanese distibution system does not fit on a traditional-modern continuum.  The traditional nature of Japan's distribution system is more closely related to the internal political economy rather than to institutional structure.  Although many modern retail formats already exist in Japan and the modern sector accounts for a considerable share of retail sales, the internal political economy of this sector has remained traditional, reducing its ability to generate economic efficiencies and constraining its impact on the traditional sector.
   Modernization of Japan's distribution system will, therefore, be achieved only through a change in the internal political economy of the modern sector.  A number of recent developments affecting the internal political economy are discussed and their likely impact on Japan's distribution system is evaluated.

TI VALUES, UTILITY, AND OWNERSHIP - MODELING THE RELATIONSHIPS FOR CONSUMER
   DURABLES
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A conceptual model is developed that describes the relationships among consumer values, utility, and ownership of durables.  These relationships are tested empirically using data on a variety of discretionary durables collected from a sample of 735 adults.  Results support the model structure and suggest that augmenting the List of Values (Kahle 1983) with a measure of materialism improves prediction of value-related consumer behavior.

TI A MODEL OF CHANNEL MEMBER PERFORMANCE, DEPENDENCE, AND SATISFACTION
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Unlike channel member satisfaction, performance and dependence have not been subjected to much empirical scrutiny even though they are variables of critical concern to channel managers.  This paper presents a model of the interrelationship of these three constructs and reports the findings of a test of the model in a franchise system.  The study showed that financial dependence influences the degree to which franchisees meet performance goals prescribed by the franchisor.  In addition, it showed that performance leads to satisfaction with the franchisor's performance and yields positive consequences for the relationship.  Satisfaction, however, is moderated by the amount of credit or blame franchisees assign to the franchisor for the franchisees' performance.

TI THE DEPERSONALIZATION OF RETAILING - ITS IMPACT ON THE LONELY CONSUMER
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The study examines whether the emergence of automated retailing systems is associated with a perceived depersonalization of the retail transaction and the consumer's evaluation of the shopping experience.  It specifically addresses the role that retailing establishments play as a source of social contact, especially for those individuals categorized as lonely.  The issue of loneliness is discussed and the role of store personnel as a preventive or mitigator resource is assessed.  Results show that lonely and nonlonely subjects have different perceptions and are differentially affected by automated new technologies.  In view of the importance of retail contact to some consumers, retailers need to be sensitive to the possible adverse effects of automation on their clientele.  Implications of the impact of emerging technologies on retailers are discussed.

TI MODELING CHOICE AMONG ASSORTMENTS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In this paper we propose a model for describing consumer decision making among assortments or menus of options from which a single option will be chosen at a later time.  Central to the derivation of the model is an assumption that consumers are uncertain about their future preferences.  The model captures both the utility of the items within the assortments as well as the flexibility the items offer as a group.  We support our model empirically with two laboratory experiments.  In the first experiment we test the underlying assumptions.  In the second, we compare the predictive validity of our model to that provided by other models suggested in the literature.

TI SEGMENTING RETAIL MARKETS ON STORE IMAGE USING A CONSUMER-BASED
   METHODOLOGY
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Various approaches to segmenting retail markets based on store image are reviewed, including methods that have not yet been applied to retailing problems.  It is argued that a recently developed segmentation technique, fuzzy clusterwise regression analysis (FCR), holds high potential for store-image segmentation research.  FCR clusters consumers into segments and simultaneously provides statistically derived store image attribute importances for each segment.  Due to the simultaneous segmentation and estimation procedures, FCR can be used even in situations where the number of store image attributes exceeds the number of stores that are evaluated by a subject.  FCR accommodates nonoverlapping, overlapping, and fuzzy clustering in an integrated consumer-based framework.  The usefulness of FCR is empirically investigated in the context of store image for retailers selling meat in the Netherlands.  FCR is also compared to a more traditional segmentation approach.  The incremental insights into consumer behavior over the unsegmented solution and over segments provided by the more traditional segmentation approach are discussed.

TI AN EMPIRICAL-ASSESSMENT OF MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY IN RETAILING
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Merger and Acquisition (M & A) activity in retailing is widespread. Nevertheless, little scholarly research has addressed this subject from the perspective of antecedent conditions present in retail M & A activity. The present study examines a variety of finance-, marketing-, and corporate-related variables that have been proposed as likely antecedent conditions for M & A activity. The results indicate that preconditions for M & A activity can be identified and the probability of becoming a bidder and target retailer can be determined on the basis of these variables. Implications for becoming a target firm are highlighted, as are characteristics of bidder and nonmerging firms.

TI AN INVESTIGATION OF PATH-GOAL LEADERSHIP THEORY IN MARKETING CHANNELS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The purpose of this study is to report empirical results of an exploratory investigation of path-goal leadership theory in a marketing channels environment.  Research hypotheses focus on the relative effectiveness of various leadership behaviors used by the channel leader's boundary personnel.  Specifically, the author investigates the effects of leader consideration and initiating structure on channel conflict, satisfaction, and role clarity as moderated by type of marketing channel.  The study findings indicate that the type of marketing channel (i.e., administered versus contractual) moderates the effects of leadership behavior on channel conflict and satisfaction.  These findings suggest that boundary personnel in the channel-leader firm should be cognizant of differences among channel types and engage in adaptive leadership behavior.

We attempt to update and build on Kizilbash and Garman's research on grocery retailing in Hispanic neighborhoods conducted over fifteen years ago.  A matched sample of Anglo grocery retailers was surveyed as well, supplemental by responses from Hispanic and Anglo consumers.  Along with providing a nearby location for convenient purchases, the bodega was found to serve the important role of maintaining Latin culture.

TI MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, ROLE STRESS, AND RETAIL STORE MANAGER PERFORMANCE
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Although it is commonly assumed that informal and formal management controls are linked to retail manager performance, virtually no empirical work has examined this fundamental control relationship. To investigate this linkage, we rely upon a survey of retail store managers and superior ratings of store manager performance. Interestingly, none of the three control mechanisms investigated in this research have a direct effect on manager performance, however, the findings indicate that the two informal controls (i.e., self and social) have an indirect effect on manager performance through their effects on role stress. In contrast, the formal control mechanism (i.e., output control) has no indirect effect. Finally, role stress is directly linked to store manager performance. Managerial implications and directions for future research in retailing are discussed.

TI THE APPEAL OF RETAILING AS A CAREER - A DECADE LATER
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Ten years ago business students were reported to believe that "retailing is not a particularly attractive career alternative" (Swinyard 1981, p. 87), and that among better students, interest in retailing was lower. This article examines whether student perception has improved during the past decade. It also discusses the importance of career characteristics that influence the attractiveness of retailing as a career, to the end that recommendations could be made of whether, and how, the appeal of retailing can be increased.
   Over 1200 business students from 12 universities were interviewed in two courses: an introductory-level and a senior-level marketing course. The results show that students' perceptions of retailing as a career are even more negative now than they were ten years ago. Students are still likely to see retailing as dull, offering low pay, and requiring long hours. The appeal of retailing declines as student grade-point-averages increase. And, while the study shows a positive relationship between taking a retailing course and the appeal of a retailing career, even students who took a retail course found retailing less appealing in this study than ten years ago.
   The study shows that the appeal of retailing is influenced more by associated characteristics of the length of the work week, and the financial benefits, than by functional aspects of the job. It indicates that the career position itself-whether it is a position in retailing, sales, or brand management-is substantially less important in job selection than the salary and only slightly more important than freedom to make decisions and the length of the typical work week.
   The study underscores the need for retailing recruiters to be aware of students' increasingly negative perceptions of retailing and their needs for a career. These negative perceptions should probably be addressed directly. And, to the end of improving the perception of retailing on campus, the article offers several recommendations. Retailers must make a commitment to college recruiting and be selective in the schools they visit. They must establish a presence at those schools, including contacts with not only the placement office, but with faculty, and through classroom visits, summer internships, executive lectures, scholarship and award sponsorship, and field trips. And they must work to dispel the "retailing myth" by clarifying for all stakeholders the nature of the job, why a college degree is important, advancement potential, training programs, salary schedules, and location benefits.

TI FRANSYS - A FRANCHISE DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM LOCATION MODEL
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Firms seeking to expand franchise distribution systems have to balance two apparently incompatible goals, maximizing system revenues and minimizing the cannibalization of sales of existing outlets.  To address this problem, a network optimization model is developed which evaluates potential sites for their impact on system revenue and on existing outlets.  The model considers the impact of a new outlet on form and brand demand, and on competition.  The model can be used to examine the implications of a variety of locational decisions from both the franchisees' and the franchisor's perspective and determine optimal locations that trade-off both goals.

TI EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE JAPANESE DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The Japanese distribution system is believed to be highly inefficient. Is this really the case? It depends on the assumptions made and the criteria used. The performance of Japan's distribution system is mixed. Its Productivity is relatively low, but it displays high levels on the Effectiveness and Equity dimensions of the Performance construct. The system employs a high proportion of the labor force, labor productivity in distribution is low, and prices to consumers are high. These weaknesses are offset by high levels of service to consumers, flexibility and responsiveness, widespread adoption of new technologies, and experimentation with new retailing formats. The system is highly equitable and the existence of many traditional retailers and wholesalers have not blocked mass marketing, economic development, and the delivery of standard of living to consumers. An analysis of the determinants of low productivity shows many of the causes to be deeply-rooted and to reflect basic value tradeoffs and environmental forces. It is therefore concluded that it is naive to expect that distribution costs in Japan can be significantly reduced through the same methods that proved their effectiveness in the West.

TI THE DISPOSITION OF THE GIFT AND MANY UNHAPPY RETURNS

In this paper, the topic of gift disposition, which arose from a comparative ethnographic study of two midwestern American gift stores, is refined and elaborated through projective analysis. Attitudes and behaviors related to the disposition of the gift are difficult to elicit directly through observation or structured interview. Through the use of a modified thematic apperception test and other projective techniques a more balanced and comprehensive account of the gift disposition and gift return emerges.

TI EFFECTS OF INTER-STORE AND IN-STORE PRICE COMPARISONS ON PRICE RECALL
   ACCURACY AND CONFIDENCE
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This paper reports a study that investigated the effects of inter-store price comparisons and in-store price checking during a choice task on consumers' price recall accuracy and confidence as well as accuracy-confidence relationship. In an experimental setting, both price recall accuracy and confidence improved when consumers acquired price information that allowed them to compare prices of another store, and when price (rather than non-price) information was used to make choice decisions. However, the confidence differential was larger than the accuracy differential for the inter-store price comparison shoppers. In contrast, in-store price comparisons during choice had a stronger effect on price recall accuracy than on confidence. Also, the relationship between accuracy and confidence varied in strength across different degrees of price comparison behaviors. When subjects had little opportunity to process price information, the relationship was weak; however, it increased in strength with greater attention and processing of price information. The implications of these findings are discussed and future research directions are suggested.

AB To fully implement a program to combat counterfeiting of its products, a manufacturer must enlist the cooperation of its dealers with the policies and procedures of the program. This article presents a model that portrays dealers' assistance to a manufacturer as a form of helping. The model proposes the influence of five of a dealer's perceptions and beliefs on the dealer's willingness to help combat counterfeiting. The empirical test of the model features a structural investigation using data furnished by auto parts manufacturers. The findings show that perceived salience of the problem and the retailer's internalization of responsibility play a major part in the network of influences leading to a dealer's willingness to help.

AB Cooperation between members of a channel of distribution has received little attention in the literature. This study uses structural equation modeling techniques to consider the relationship between the level of cooperation in a supplier-dealer network and dependence, coercive, and noncoercive bases of power, conflict, and satisfaction. Results indicate that dependence and noncoercive bases of power have a positive impact on cooperation, while coercive bases of power have a negative impact on cooperation. Coercive bases of power are positively related to conflict and noncoercive bases of power are inversely related to conflict. In addition, conflict has a negative impact on cooperation. Finally, cooperation was found to lead to more satisfying supplier-dealer relationships, while conflict reduces satisfaction. Several strategies for increasing cooperation within distribution channels are inferred from the results.

The paper focuses on exploring the relative influence of the external physical environment and the internal physical environment of retail stores on the store's overall perceived prototypicality, and the prototypicality-attitude relationship. The results show that customer's perceptions of the prototypicality of fast food restaurants, and their attitude toward such restaurants, are strongly influenced by environmental cues and that external environmental attributes are more important than internal environmental attributes for fast food restaurants. The utility of data produced by the environmental measures for managerial action is illustrated.

First, 20 grocery shoppers determined indifference points between discounts and ''free extra product'' promotions. The ''nominal values'' of promotions, rather than their effects on unit price, predicted shopper preferences. In a second study, 40 shoppers developed value functions for three types of promotions. As promotions became larger, shoppers preferred promotions of the form ''free extra ounces'' less than other types, and increasingly favored discounts.

TI A MODEL OF PRODUCT CATEGORY COMPETITION AMONG GROCERY RETAILERS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The authors develop a disaggregate model to investigate the nature and structure of category-specific store competition among grocery retailers. The model decomposes store competition into direct effects (the influence of category marketing activity on store choice) and indirect effects (the influence of category marketing activity on within-store sales). The model is developed at the household level using the multi-nomial logit and nested logit approaches to brand choice, store choice, and category purchase incidence. The approach yields elasticity estimates from which retailers may assess the direct and indirect effects of category pricing and promotion on their own and rival stores' sales. Based on this output, the structure of within-category store competition may be examined. The authors illustrate their approach with Nielsen scanner panel data from the liquid laundry detergent category for 13 competing stores in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

AB Shopping trip data is used in conjunction with panel purchase data to examine whether relationships exist between purchases made on promotion and shopping behavior at the retail level in supermarkets. The likelihood of making a purchase on feature or with a store coupon was found to be significantly related to whether the shopping trip was a major or fill-in one. Specifically, purchases made in the presence of features are more associated with fill-in trips than major trips. Conversely, the propensity to purchase when coupons are available is more associated with major trips than fill-in trips.
   For features, the pattern above was less prominent in a household's favorite store than in nonfavorite stores. For coupons, the reverse was found: the pattern was more pronounced in the household's favorite store.

TI BUILDING A NEW ACADEMIC FIELD - THE CASE OF SERVICES MARKETING
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The growth of services marketing as an academic field offers insight into how a new field of study develops. This article examines specific forces that contributed to and accelerated or inhibited knowledge creation, dissemination, and utilization in services marketing. Multiple methods were used to explore this question. The analysis reveals that services marketing developed academically because it filled a need in marketing practice. Industry assumed an influential role in the development of the academic field of services marketing.

TI TRACKING THE EVOLUTION OF THE SERVICES MARKETING LITERATURE
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The authors offer their personal interpretations as participant-observers together with a data-based analysis of the evolution of the services marketing literature. Bibliographic analysis of more than 1000 English-language, general services marketing publications spanning four decades provides the empirical base for the paper. Using an evolutionary metaphor as the framework, the authors trace the literature through three stages: Crawling Out (1953-79); Scurrying About (1980-85); and Walking Erect (1986-present). The discussion of the three stages shows how the literature has evolved from the early services-marketing-is-different debate to the maturation of specific topics (e.g., service quality, service encounters) and the legitimization of the services marketing literature by major marketing journals. A classification and summary of the publishing outlets where the literature has appeared is presented. The article closes with discussion and speculation on the future of the services marketing literature.

TI DISCRETION AND THE SERVICE EMPLOYEE
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Services marketing managers have begun to recognize that services can be enhanced hy allowing employees to exercise discretion during service delivery. A conceptual framework is presented which considers the discretion of employees and its antecedents. Two groups of antecedents are included: organizational factors and employee-related factors. The framework introduces a set of variables to the services marketing literature which take into account some of the unique aspects of service delivery.

TI IMPROVING THE MEASUREMENT OF SERVICE QUALITY
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB SERVQUAL, which involves the calculation of the differences between expectations and perceptions on a number of prespecified criteria, is currently the most popular measure of service quality. However, there are some serious problems in conceptualizing service quality as a difference score; these are reviewed and empirically investigated in this paper. An alternative method for measuring service quality is found to have favorable psychometric properties and to be more efficient than SERVQUAL.

TI CONSUMER SEARCH AND RETAIL ANALYSIS

AB Search behavior is a method by which individuals develop a set of alternatives for consideration and make a choice among these alternatives. Thus it is a key component of the consumer decision process. However, consumer search behavior is not well integrated into broader retail analysis. This paper reviews the substantial literature on consumer search behavior and suggests its relevance for retail analysis. A comparison and synthesis of predictions from this literature provides insights for retail policy and management. This paper also identifies worthwhile directions for further research.

The framework enables managers to determine which customer satisfaction elements have the greatest impact, and how much money should be spent to improve particular customer satisfaction elements. This makes it possible to hold customer satisfaction programs accountable, in the way that other business programs are held accountable, by forcing them to demonstrate their benefits with respect to bottom-line profitability. We use an individual-level model of loyalty and retention, and then build up to market share by aggregation. We demonstrate the application of our approach in a pilot study of a city's retail banking market.

TI WHO ARE THE PRICE VIGILANTES - AN INVESTIGATION OF DIFFERENTIATING
   CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCING PRICE INFORMATION-PROCESSING
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Research suggests that many consumers exhibit poor price recall, even at the point-of-purchase and that some consumers are more price vigilant than others. We incorporate Stigler's economics of information concept into a multinomial logit model to explore differentiating factors that influence the price recall information at the point-of-purchase. Intercepting subjects at the point-of-purchase in an actual retail setting, data were collected from 289 subjects across four product categories and three stores. We find that price recall is influenced by correctly perceived promotion status of the brand, use of the price in making the purchase decision, and income. Two other demographic variables, gender and age, had no impact on price recall. We discuss implications for researchers, retail managers, and consumer advocacy groups.

TI SOCIAL INFLUENCES ON ADOLESCENT SHOPLIFTING THEORY, EVIDENCE, AND
   IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RETAIL INDUSTRY
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Shoplifting is a growing and extremely destructive behavior that is particularly common among adolescents. In order to design more effective programs to prevent this behavior, retailers need a better understanding of its causes. The present paper seeks to address this need by developing and testing a structural model of the social influences on adolescent shoplifting. Our results suggest that adolescents' involvement in shoplifting is strongly influenced by their friends' shoplifting behavior, their attachment to their parents, and their own beliefs regarding the morality of this behavior. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for future approaches to discouraging youthful shoplifting.

Following a review of the emerging literature on competitive advantage, results of a field study are described in which the interplay between competitive marketing strategy patterns, distinctive marketing competencies, and organizational performance is examined. Findings indicate those generic retailing types with the most clearly defined strategy patterns (named ''Merchants'' and ''Specialists'') both possess source-of-advantage-skill superiority along a variety of marketing competencies and perform better than do those types (named ''Drifters,'' ''Resisters,'' and ''Stripers'') whose marketing strategies are characterized by a lack of emphasis and clarity.

   EXITING, VOICE, LOYALTY, OPPORTUNISM, AND NEGLECT
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The article reports the results of a study of the associations between the response intentions of hardware retailers when there are problems with their supplier, and their antecedents. The objective was to fill a gap in our knowledge of retailer-supplier relationships by testing hypothesized associations between response intentions, such as relationship neglect, and antecedents that include investment in the relationship. The response intention variables were those proposed by Hirschman (1970), and others: exiting, voice (constructive attempts to change conditions), loyalty, opportunism (self interest seeking with guile), and relationship neglect (reduced contact). Their antecedents were overall satisfaction with the relationship, and the relationship ''structural constraints'' (Johnson 1982) of alternative attractiveness, relationship investment, and switching cost. The results add to our understanding of problem resolution and relationship maintenance in the channel, and shed light into the ''dark side'' of channel relationships.

Although the evidence does suggest that EAS decreases shoplifting, no research has been conducted to assess the unintended effects from errant EAS alarms. Based on a survey administered to 250 individuals selected from a systematic random sample, the results of this study reveal that nearly half of all consumers have experienced an accidental EAS alarm. Most importantly, 16 percent of consumers may never shop again at a store that subjects them to an errant EAS alarm.

TI RETAIL POWER - MONSTER OR MOUSE
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Many industry observers contend that retailers have increased their power relative to manufacturers over the past twenty years. The alleged growth in trade power has been attributed to higher concentration of retail buying power, buyers who have access to scanner information, and more frequent sales promotions. Increased sales promotions are said to achieve short-term gains in sales, but at the expense of long-term increased consumer price sensitivity and decreases in funds for pull programs. If this power shift has really occurred, a shift in the relative profitability of manufacturers and retailers would have been expected to also occur. We use data on the food industry to examine this hypothesis and find that manufacturer profits have been increasing at a fairly steady rate over the past ten years while retailer profits have been quite stable. This evidence casts doubt on whether a shift in power has really occurred and we offer some speculations on why the evidence does not support the conventional marketing wisdom.

Hypotheses based on the means-end perspective, related research on shopping behavior, and the extant price-quality-value literature are supported in a field test using causal modeling. Most notably, the findings suggest that perceived store shopping experience is relatively more important than merchandise price or quality perceptions in explaining consumers' value perceptions of a retail store. Theoretical and managerial implications for assessing price-quality-value perceptions in a retailing context are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Services account for over half of all personal consumption expenditures in the United States, but critical differences between services and products could alter advertising strategy and tactics. The information content of service, product, and product/service combination advertising is examined using the Resnik and Stern (1977) methodology. Although service advertising has fewer total information cues, some information cues are much more prevalent for services than products. These information differences are then explained using key concepts from the services literature. Suggestions for improving advertising effectiveness for service marketers and directions for future research in services advertising are also given.

TI STORELOC - A RETAIL STORE LOCATION MODEL-BASED ON MANAGERIAL JUDGMENTS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The selection of an attractive location plays a crucial role in the performance of most retail firms. In modeling the site selection process, existing research has relied primarily upon consumer data. However, evidence suggests that a model's predictive accuracy can be increased by incorporating managerial input. Further, managers are more likely to employ a location model if it involves their active participation. In this study, a retail location model (STORELOC) is proposed based on managerial judgments. Data from decision makers at a financial institution are used for illustrating the model's application. Convergent validity of the model is assessed by comparing the results with those obtained by employing an alternative location model. The proposed STORELOC location model is viewed as having greater applicability since it requires managerial participation.

TI AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH TO MAKING RETAIL STORE ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailers spend millions of dollars each year designing, building, and refurbishing stores. Millions more are spent hiring, training, and compensating employees that interact with retail customers. Yet retailers do not generally engage in systematic research that enables them to determine the appropriate mix of environmental factors that may influence the patronage decision. This paper extends the extant literature on retail store atmospherics with the express purpose of providing an experimental method that can be utilized by retailers to examine various aspects of store atmospherics and their impact on the retail patronage decision. As an application of this methodology, the Mehrabian and Russell (1974) affect model is examined. Specifically, the effects of two retail atmospheric factors: (1) ambient cues (lighting and music), and (2) social cues (number/friendliness of employees) on respondents' pleasure, arousal, and willingness to buy were examined. The results indicate that the ambient cues interact with the social cues to influence respondents' pleasure and the social cues influence arousal in the store environment. These affective states (pleasure and arousal) are in turn found to have a positive relationship with respondents' willingness to buy. Finally, the results provide initial support that arousal and pleasure may mediate the effects of store environment on respondents' willingness to buy.

TI APPLYING CASE-BASED REASONING TO FORECASTING RETAIL SALES
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This article describes the development and testing of a forecasting system for retailers who plan periodic promotions. When the number of variables describing the promotion is large relative to the historical database of past promotions, traditional forecasting approaches cannot be applied. In such cases, retailers must rely on the expertise of their buyers to subjectively estimate promotional unit sales. This research develops a Case-Based Reasoning system that allows all buyers to forecast promotional sales as accurately as the organization's expert buyer and, by making the subjective process explicit, also provides an avenue to improve forecast performance over time. The system (1) selects the historical analogs that are most similar to the planned promotion, (2) adjusts the sales of each analog to account for any differences between the analog and the planned promotion, and (3) combines the forecasts derived from the multiple analogs to arrive at a single sales projection. The performance of the system was tested and found to compare favorably to the performance of an expert buyer in a large national retail organization.

TI THE EFFECTS OF PERCEIVED JUSTICE ON COMPLAINANTS NEGATIVE WORD-OF-MOUTH
   BEHAVIOR AND REPATRONAGE INTENTIONS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Previous research has found that dissatisfied consumers choose to seek redress, engage in negative word-of-mouth behavior, and exit (i.e., vow never to repatronize the retailer) based upon the perceived likelihood of successful redress, their attitude toward complaining, the level of importance they attach to the defective product, and whether they perceive the problem to be stable or to have been controllable. The authors extend previous research by modeling consumer complaining behavior as a complex, dynamic process, hypothesizing that once a consumer seeks redress, negative word-of-mouth behavior and repatronage intentions are dependent (primarily) upon the consumer's post-complaint perception of justice. As hypothesized, perceived justice was found to be the main determinant of complainants' negative word-of-mouth behavior and their repatronage intentions, and was found to mediate the effects of likelihood of success, attitude toward complaining, product importance, and stability and controllability on complaining behavior. The model fit the data very well, explaining 49.1 percent of the variance of negative word-of-mouth and 68.5 percent of the variance of repatronage intentions. These findings point to the importance of customer service/customer satisfaction, especially since the cost of keeping a current customer satisfied is much less than the cost of attracting a new customer.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING

Results suggest that the effect of a free premium on consumer attitudes depends on the level of the advertised reference price. Counter to expectations, at low levels of advertised reference price, consumers' brand image and perceived quality are more favorable when the value of the free premium is low than when the value of the free premium is high. At a high level of advertised reference price, consumers' brand image and perceived quality are less favorable when the value of the free premium is low, than when the value of the free premium is high. At a medium level of advertised reference price, consumers' product attitudes are similar across free premium values. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

TI RETAILER REACTIONS TO COMPETITIVE PRICE CHANGES
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Despite the importance of understanding and predicting competitive reactions in oligopoly theory, empirical research on the topic is sparse. We examine whether retail decision-makers' pricing reactions conform to the asymmetric conjecture specified in the classic kinked demand curve theory: that firms will tend to follow competitors' price cuts but not follow price increases. Factors which likely moderate this reaction pattern are discussed and examined via a survey which presents managers with a case study in which they must determine whether or not to respond to a competitor's pricing initiative. The results do generally support the theory's assumption about pricing reactions, but also indicate that reactions are moderated by item price sensitivity and influenced by the behavior of other competitors in the market. Response to price cuts is immediate in some cases, but response to price increases can only be motivated if other competitors follow the initiator first. We consider why these effects vary across products and how market learning may be inhibited by certain reaction tendencies.

TI OPTIMAL CONTINUOUS LOCATION OF A RETAIL FACILITY, FACILITY
   ATTRACTIVENESS, AND MARKET SHARE - AN INTERACTIVE MODEL
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In this paper a model for the location of a retail facility anywhere in the plane is presented. Existing location papers suggest that marketers can evaluate a set of potential sites for the location of a new facility. The site that maximizes the market share captured is selected. However, the best site for the new facility may not be included in the user provided set of potential sites. Finding the best location anywhere in the plane requires the analysis of the market share function which is addressed in this paper. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of both the best location and the market share captured is provided. Computational experiments illustrate the properties of this function and its sensitivity to the data parameters. The analysis shows that the market share captured by the facility (existing or new) is sensitive to both facility location and attractiveness.

TI THE CURRENT STATUS OF WOMEN IN DEPARTMENT STORE RETAILING - 1993
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study replicates the work of Gable, Gillespie and Topol (1984) that examined women's status in the managerial ranks of department store retailing.  During the past decade, women have made significant gains at all levels of management.  They constitute 67 percent of all lower-level management positions, 41 percent of all middle-levels positions, and 21 percent of all upper-level positions.  While progress has been made, women are not close to parity with men at the highest level positions in department store retailing.

TI INFORMATION-SOURCES AND RETAIL BUYER DECISION-MAKING - THE EFFECT OF
   PRODUCT-SPECIFIC BUYING EXPERIENCE
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The effect of product-specific buying experience on the mix of information sources in retail buyer decision-making was studied.  Sixty retail buyers completed a decision-making task, based on a fractional factorial design, composed of eight information sources varied at two levels each.  The results of an individual-subject ANOVA showed the dominant information source to be the buyer's own knowledge, followed by customer requests, consumer magazines, selling history, buyers from similar stores, sales representatives, and reviews and ads in the trade news.  A post hoc analysis showed that the number and relative importance of information sources differed by level of product-specific buying experience.

TI THE EVOLUTION OF OWNERSHIP PATTERNS IN FRANCHISE SYSTEMS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Two sets of competing theories have been proposed to explain the existence of franchising; one set based on resource constraints and another on incentives issues.  As individual franchise systems mature, these theories predict different patterns in the evolution of the mix of franchised and company-owned outlets.  In this paper, we report the results of an empirical study of franchise system evolution.  The findings generally support the incentives-based rationale for franchising, but they also support a modified resource constraint theory, one which recognizes the synergistic effects of dual distribution.

TI DECEPTION IN RETAILER HIGH-LOW PRICING - A RULE OF REASON APPROACH
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Marking up to mark down and referring to a fictitious ''regular'' price in retail advertising can deceive consumers and cause consumer injury.  The practice, known as high-low pricing, has become widespread in the intensely competitive retail environment.  Consumers respond to this practice by drawing one of several inferences about the value of the product and the prevailing competitive price.  Whether the consumer is deceived depends on the inference drawn.  This paper integrates legal, public policy, consumer behavior, and retailing perspectives to examine the issue and propose retailer and regulatory solutions.  To date, regulators have attempted to impose a ''per se'' approach.  Through analysis of retailer motivations, consumer behavior and the May D&F case, a ''Rule of Reason'' approach is suggested as an alternative solution to this issue of significant concern to retailers and public policymakers alike.

   We test a specific renewal process underlying mall visits, and find that a Poisson-gamma model, commonly used to explain grocery shopping trips, fits our mall shopping data well.  We account for measurement error due to forgetting by survey respondents.  Using our renewal and recall model we obtain adjusted or true correlations between customer variables and shopping frequency.  We are able to test hypotheses about the relationships between mall shopping frequency and characteristics of shoppers such as functional shopping motivation, deal proneness, recreational shopping motivation, age, income and family size.

TI AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SERVICE QUALITY AND CUSTOMER
   SATISFACTION IN THE FORMATION OF CONSUMERS PURCHASE INTENTIONS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Service quality and customer satisfaction are widely recognized as key influences in the formation of consumers' purchase intentions in service environments.  However, a review of the existing literature suggests that the specific nature of the relationship between these important constructs in the determination of consumers' purchase intentions continues to elude marketing scholars (c.f. Bitner and Hubbert 1994; Bolton and Drew 1994; Gronroos 1993; Rust and Oliver 1994).  The study reported here was designed to aid in the understanding of these relationships by empirically assessing the nature of the relationship between service quality and consumer satisfaction in the formation of consumers' purchase intentions across four unique service industries.  The results of the current research, coupled with the weight of the evidence in the emerging services literature, suggest that consumer satisfaction is best described as moderating the service quality/purchase intention relationship.  The managerial and research implications of the reported study are also discussed.

TI A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF FRANCHISED OIL DISTRIBUTION IN NORWAY
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study utilizes agency theory to investigate contractual decisions among Norwegian oil retailers.  Scandinavian oil refiners coordinate retail operations through three contractual forms:  corporately-owned and operated facilities, corporately owned/franchisee-operated outlets, and franchisee-owned and operated service stations.  The authors outline distinguishing factors of these contracts and develop an agency-based model of contractual choice.  Reports from 181 station managers indicate that retail ownership varies with population density, location, and revenues.  Franchisor-managed outlets exhibit the highest revenues while franchisee-owned outlets are employed in areas with the lowest population density.  Franchisor-operated outlets are more likely to be utilized near freeways than corporately-owned/franchisee-operated service stations.  The authors discuss the implications of the findings for franchise management and research.

AB Service quality measurement is an area of growing interest to researchers and managers.  It is also an area characterized by debate concerning the need for measuring customer expectations and how they should be measured.  Building on a synthesis of the extant literature on customer expectations and service quality measurement, this article identifies unresolved issues and develops three alternative questionnaire formats to address them.  It then discusses an empirical study that evaluated the three formats in four different sectors.  The article concludes with practical implications and directions for further research stemming from the study's findings.

TI A COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS OF SHOPPING BEHAVIOR IN HISPANIC AND NON-HISPANIC
   MARKET AREAS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Many retailers target shoppers belonging to ethnic minorities, particularly Hispanics.  Most often, ethnic oriented retailing involves specialized marketing efforts in retail stores located in market areas with high concentrations of ethnic consumers.  Previous research, through respondent self-reports, has attempted to determine how Hispanic shopping behavior differs from that of other customer groups.  However, past studies have not investigated actual purchase behavior in stores located in ethnically concentrated market areas.  Drawing on past research, we develop and test several hypothesis about shopping behavior in Hispanic market areas.  Results show that shoppers in Hispanic trading areas are comparable to shoppers in non-Hispanic areas with respect to direct price responsiveness and brand substitution.  However, we find that store brand purchasing is more prevalent in market areas with high concentrations of Hispanics.

We examine three types of variables related to brand switching for a high involvement, experience-oriented retail service:  (1) changes in usage context or situation; (2) marketing mix variables which are directly controllable by the firm; and (3) customer background variables.  Using data from an extensive survey of lodging customers, we build a model of the probability of brand switching as a function of these variables and implement three measures of relative variable influence.  The strategic marketing implications of the findings are discussed.

TI STORE ATMOSPHERE AND PURCHASING BEHAVIOR
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study extends the Donovan and Rossiter (1982) study which introduced the Mehrabian-Russell (M-R) environmental psychology model into the store atmosphere literature.  Donovan and Rossiter's study was exploratory in that student subjects were used and intentions rather than shopping behavior were measured.  The present study uses a broader sample of shoppers, measures emotions during the shopping experience rather than before or after, and records the effects on actual shopping behavior.  The 1982 study found that experienced pleasantness of the in-store environment was a significant predictor of willingness to spend time in the store and intentions to spend more money than originally planned.  This finding was extended behaviorally in the new study:  pleasure, as rated five minutes into the shopping duration was a significant predictor of extra time spent in the store and actual incremental spending.  Arousal was found to vary in its effects across the two studies and bears further investigation.  The effects of the emotional factors of pleasure and arousal were shown to be additional to cognitive factors such as variety and quality of merchandise, price specialing and value for money.  The practical significance for retailers is that emotional responses induced by the store environment can affect the time and money that consumers spend in the store.

TI SHELF MANAGEMENT AND SPACE ELASTICITY
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Shelf management is a difficult task in which rules of thumb rather than good theory and hard evidence tend to guide practice. Through a series of field experiments, we measured the effectiveness of two shelf management techniques: ''space-to-movement,'' where we customized shelf sets based on store-specific movement patterns; and ''product reorganization'' where we manipulated product placement to facilitate cross-category merchandising or ease of shopping. We found modest gains (4%) in sales and profits from increased customization of shelf sets and 5-6% changes due to shelf reorganization. Using the field experiment data, we modeled the impact of shelf positioning and facing allocations on sales of individual items. We found that location had a large impart on sales, whereas changes in the number of facings allocated to a brand had much less impact as long as a minimum threshold (to avoid out-of-stocks) was maintained.

AB Marketing success for firms using an indirect channel often depends on the performance of downstream resellers but the literature examining the link between channel management strategy and reseller performance is fragmented and ambiguous, dire in part to the inadequate measurement of performance. This study suggests a framework for defining a more complete domain for the channel member performance construct and for developing valid measures of the construct. An application of the framework suggests that channel member performance is multi-faceted, and requires a multiple measure approach to adequately capture its full domain.

The emphasis is on understanding relationships between the psychological quality of time perceptions (the extent to which individuals view structure and purpose in their daily lives), social and demographic variables, and shopping rime, including how those ages 45 and older form into segments based on those perceptions. The findings show that the addition of time perceptions to regression equations containing social and demographic variables increases the explained variance and that a time perception segmentation typology provides insights into ways retailers can benefit from a target market strategy based on how consumers view time.

TI IMPACT OF STRENGTH OF ETHNIC IDENTIFICATION ON HISPANIC SHOPPING
   BEHAVIOR
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The effort to target and differentiate retail offerings to ethnic and racial minorities has exploded during recent pears. This paper looks at the particular case of Hispanic retail shopping behavior. The authors argue that one key variable tying ethnicity of a consumer to retail shopping behavior is the strength of ethnic identification. Consequently, all hypotheses that relate ethnicity to retail shopping behavior must be moderated by how strongly the consumer feels affiliated to the ethnic group. Using a multi-item scale for measuring strength of ethnic identification, this study explores the differences in retail shopping behavior of strongly and weakly identified Hispanics. The results show that: (1) for services, Strongly Identified Hispanics are more likely than Weakly Identified Hispanics to seek Hispanic vendors, specially for low involvement services; and (2) for products, Strongly Identified Hispanics are more likely than Weakly Identified Hispanics to be loyal to brands used by family and friends; to be influenced by targeted media; and to be less concerned about economic value.

TI CONCENTRATED VS BALANCED SOURCING - AN EXAMINATION OF RETAILER
   PURCHASING DECISIONS IN CLOSED MARKETS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Should a retailer concentrate most of its stock purchases in one wholesale supplier (effectively single sourcing) or balance its purchases between two suppliers (balanced sourcing)? A concentrated purchasing strategy makes the retailer an important customer to its, wholesaler, meriting preferential treatment, by creating a larger order volume. However, concentrated sourcing can also increase the retailer's dependence on the wholesaler. Reducing dependence, in turn, entails diversifying purchases, splitting them between at least two wholesalers, which, unfortunately, increases transaction costs and reduces the retailer's importance to either of its suppliers. The tradeoff is further complicated when retailers operate in a closed marker (small, with few suppliers and high barriers to entry) because genuine options are limited. We examine this tradeoff by modeling the purchasing intentions of food retailers in a closed marker which supports essentially two wholesalers, protected by high barriers to entry. We find that even given their limited options, retailers intend to split their purchases more evenly between the two wholesalers (balanced sourcing) as opposed to concentrating most of their purchases in a single wholesaler. This suggests that over the long term retailers prefer to move away from concentrated sourcing. it is proposed that this preference for balanced sourcing stems from a desire to avoid excessive dependence and opportunistic behavior on the part of wholesalers, among others. We also find that wholesaler's superior role performance has a strong positive association with retailer's purchasing intentions. The notion of dependence-offsetting actions, in addition to other rationales advanced for diversifying purchases are evoked to help explain balanced sourcing.

TI CONSUMER SELF-REGULATION IN A RETAIL ENVIRONMENT

AB The importance of retail store design and merchandising policies rests in the ability of the physical retail environment to alter shopper reactions and behavior. Previous research documents relationships between physical store environments, shopper emotions, and subsequent shopping behavior. Research presented in this paper extends this research by considering the role of consumer self-regulation as a moderator of relationships between shopping emotions and consumer evaluations of the shopping experience. Structural equations analyses support this assertion and suggest disparate outcomes depending upon one's self-regulatory tendency. Results also show that feelings of dominance, previously dismissed as unimportant, significantly alter shopping behavior among those low in self-regulation.

TI CATEGORIZATION OF CUSTOMERS BY RETAIL SALESPEOPLE
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailers should be interested in the way their salespeople categorize customers. Salespeople's descriptions of customer categories contain information about the nature of customers and how salespeople sell to customers. Customer category information can be used by retailers to aid in their selling, positioning, and promotion efforts. Using a survey of 229 salespeople from a department store chain, this paper examines two specific issues. First, we examine salespeople's descriptions of the categories of customers that visit a department store. Second, we delineate the differences among salespeople based on the manner in which they classify customers. The results indicate salespeople primarily list customers that visit the store as those who seek sales assistance and those who are searching for specific products. Additionally, three salespeople clusters with distinct categorization styles emerged from the analysis: ''need based categorizers,'' ''decision styles categorizers,'' and ''training based categorizers.'' implications of these findings and directions for retailers are also discussed.

TI DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES TO RETAIL SALES PROMOTION AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN
   AND ANGLO-AMERICAN CONSUMERS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Ethnic populations are growing in numbers throughout the United States, and retailers today are challenged to develop promotional strategies to reach these consumers. Couponing is one particular sales promotion activity to which ethnic consumers have historically responded poorly. This study examines the responses of African-American and Anglo-American consumers to four types of retail sales promotion-coupons, product displays, feature advertisements, and price discounts. Results show that significant differences exist between African- and Anglo-Americans only in their use of cents-off coupons. One implication is that there are possibly some media-related factors contributing to this outcome, since using coupons is the one promotion activity involving media exposure outside of the retail establishment. Thus, there is a need for retailers replan promotional strategies so that they are effective in reaching the particular ethnic markers which they serve.

TI INVESTIGATING RETAILER PRODUCT CATEGORY PRICING FROM HOUSEHOLD SCANNER
   PANEL-DATA
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A growing body of industrial organization literature has directed attention to using the household level logit model, aggregated to the firm level, as the firm's demand function in order to study markets with differentiated products. Such models, however, have ignored the role played by the channel intermediaries, i.e., the retailer, in setting retail prices. In this paper, we study optimal retailer product category pricing policies where the retailer's objective is to maximize total category profits, and show how household scanner panel data can be used to determine these optimal prices.
   The empirical results obtained from analyzing the AC Nielsen yogurt data base reveals that the retailer's category profit maximizing markups are brand specific and simplified pricing rules such as an across-the-board constant markup can be suboptimal. We also find that there are significant interactions between the optimal prices and the retailer's decision to promote brands using feature advertisements. Additionally, we find that promoting different brands of yogurt are nor equally attractive, and the retailer can be better off negotiating for different types of trade promotions (marginal cost reduction vs. payment of fired sum) with the different manufacturers. Finally, by comparing these optimal retailer pricing rules to those obtained based on aggregate store-level sales data, we show that for purposes of normative analyses, using the household-level logit model aggregated to the brand level is theoretically and/or empirically superior to certain familiar aggregate specifications such as the constant-elasticity and linear demand models.

TI COORDINATION AND MANUFACTURER PROFIT MAXIMIZATION - THE MULTIPLE
   RETAILER CHANNEL
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This paper explores wholesale pricing behavior within a two-level vertical channel consisting of a manufacturer selling through multiple independent retailers. The introduction of multiple retailers is important for several reasons. These include: (1) the determination of optimal channel breadth; (2) an analysis of the optimality of channel coordination for all channel members; and (3) the determination of the distribution of each dyad's profits between manufacturer and retailer.
   The authors demonstrate the existence of a two-part tariff wholesale pricing policy, common to all retailers, that fully coordinates the channel. They then show that the manufacturer can generally obtain greater profits by setting a unique two-part tariff pricing-policy that does not coordinate the channel. Finally, the authors show that the fixed-fee component of either two-part tariff determines channel breadth, that is, the number of profit-maximizing independent retailers that are willing to participate in the channel.

TI A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF RETAILER SHELF MANAGEMENT MODELS
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A shelf management model was developed to assist retailers with the decision of which products to stock and how much space to allocate to those products. Due to the non-linearities in the formulation a closed form solution is not possible. Borin, et al. develop a search heuristic based on simulated annealing and compare the solution against a known optimum. A barrier to the use of such models is the fact that managers typically do not have access to error-fi ee estimates of the parameters required for the model construction (shelf elasticities, search loyalty, and consumer preferences). In this article we analyze the degree of error that may be introduced into estimates of the parameters before the model yields assortments and shelf allocations that are inferior to those produced by the merchandising rule of thumb, share-of-shelf = share-of-sales. The results indicate that judgmental estimates of parameters can vary by as much as 50 percent and still make application of the model useful.

TI USING A MENU OF GEOGRAPHIC PRICING PLANS - A THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In a menu plan of geographic pricing, the retailer allows a customer to choose either a free on board origin (F.O.B. origin) plan, or a uniform delivered plan, In this article, we develop an approach to construct the best menu plan and compare its profitability and market coverage with that of a uniform delivered plan and an F.O.B. origin plan when these are used alone. It is shown that a menu plan can generate at least as much profit as either an F.O.B. origin or a uniform delivered plan used by itself under any demand condition. However, whether the menu plan can outperform the F.O.B. origin and the uniform delivered plans depends on the specific demand conditions. When demand is linear in price and delivery cost is uniformly distributed, it is shown that the menu plan is substantially more profitable than the F.O.B. origin and the uniform delivered plans and generates at least 96% of the contribution of an optimal plan which sets a profit maximizing price for individual customers based on cost. On the other hand, when demand is a constant elasticity function of price, the menu plan is found to be only marginally superior to the F.O.B. origin plan which generates more profit than the uniform delivered plan.

TI Market power and performance: A cross-industry analysis of manufacturers
   and retailers
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Two recent studies of manufacturer and retailer profitability in the food industry have raised questions about whether the widely cited, but empirically untested, shift of power from manufacturers to retailers has really occurred. Has the marketing community been operating under a misconception or are these studies flawed? This paper uses more complete measures of exercised and potential market power and a broader sample of industries and retail classes to address this critical question. Not only do our measures have strong theoretical grounding in the industrial organization, finance and accounting literature, they incorporate in them the impact of actions that have been commonly cited as illustrations of a power shift. Our analysis of 14 consumer good industries shows that only a few of them exhibit a shift in market power towards retailers. Further this apparent shift is highly influenced by a small number of retailers within a single retail class.

TI The effect of brand characteristics and retailer policies on response to
   retail price promotions: Implications for retailers
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The variation in the impact of a brand's retail price promotion on its own sales (promotional price elasticity) and the sales of its competitors (promotional cross-price elasticities) during the period of the price promotion is studied Brand characteristics and retailer policies significantly explain the variation in promotional price elasticities and cross-price elasticities across brands. Results are used to offer guidelines to retail managers for planning promotions in terms of what brands to promote, and how and when to promote them under three different retailer objectives: (1) to liquidate inventories; (2) to maximize product category sales; and (3) to maximize product category profits. These guidelines can be used by retailers in taking actions that will result in desirable levels of responses to price promotions of a brand-promotional price elasticity and promotional cross-price elasticities.

TI An empirical investigation of the advertising spending decisions of a
   multiproduct retailer
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In a multiproduct retailing context an approach for testing marketing mix variables is presented that should be of interest to retailers and researchers alike. Traditional model building for decision evaluation purposes suffers from a serious drawback in that the underlying model is assumed to be known. The present approach incorporates the search for the ''true'' model as an intrinsic part of the method. Based on up to date modeling perspectives, the approach can be divided into three steps: (1) the use of multiple time series analysis to assist in model specification; (2) the choice of functional form, model estimation and testing; and (3) the use of statistical and simulation methods to test decision making hypotheses. The approach is applied to three years of a western wear retailer's weekly sales and advertising data; multiple time series analysis is used to specify a simultaneous equation model that captures demand interdependencies. After subjecting the model to several stability tests, it is then used as a basis for testing several interesting hypotheses concerning the retailer's advertising decision making behavior: The key insight for multiproduct retailers is that advertising budget allocation decisions across products and media are probably more important than decisions affecting the level of the total budget since the former have a greater impact on profit contribution.

TI Strategic marketing fit in manufacturer-retailer relationships: Price
   leaders versus merchandise differentiators
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The traditional channels paradigm suggests increasing one's relative power within the manufacturer/retailer dyad. Manufacturers should focus instead on increasing total marketplace power of their dyads against other manufacturer/retailer dyads. Retailers and manufacturers are interdependent, and can compete best by harnessing the interdependence. We propose and rest a model of manufacturer retailer relationships based on interdependence, called the Strategic Marketing Fit (SMF) model. Our study confirms the relationships hypothesized in the SMF model. Retailers pursuing merchandise differentiation retail strategies are better partners than retailers pursuing price leadership strategies.

The first experiment found that offering the same product in the context of a sale or with a coupon lowered consumers' price Perceptions to a greater extent than offering it in the context of a rebate. Study Two examined how the time at which the savings of a promotion are received and the effort required to redeem the savings affect price perceptions.

The authors present a model which suggests that interpersonal trust emerges as a consequence of the legal environment and the extent of interfirm managerial control. The model also suggests that interpersonal trust and managerial controls influence performance. Hypotheses are tested in retail petroleum channels in Poland, (former East) Germany, and Norway. The results indicate that the production of trust and performance varies by country. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for franchise management and theory.

TI Power and relationship commitment: Their impact on marketing channel
   member performance
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In marketing channels for farm equipment, we investigate the impact of the supplier's use of power on two key outcomes: (1) the retailer's commitment to the channel relationship and (2) both supplier and retailer performance within the channel. We also investigate how retailer commitment affects performance in the channel. We argue that key linkages are moderated by the symmetry of power within the channel (i.e., whether the retailer is move powerful, power is somewhat balanced between the two channel members, or the supplier is more powerful). The results partially support both the primary construct linkages studied here as well as the moderating effects of power symmetry upon them.

Based on data collected with a survey mailed to a national sample of computer dealers, our findings offer insight on channels communication to both researchers and practitioners. By examining the impact of communication flows on summary judgments of communication, managers can focus their efforts on vital communication flows which stimulate positive assessments of communication, and which stymie less beneficial/detrimental communication behaviors (such as distortion and withholding of information).

TI The relationship between channel conflict and information processing
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB It has long been recognized that conflict within channels of distribution can be either functional or dysfunctional. What is lacking in the literature is a clear understanding of the cognitive processes within the channel that determines whether conflict is to be viewed as functional or dysfunctional. This manuscript introduces information processing to the channel literature to explain how channel members form schema against which new information about a specific channel member is compared. The comparison of new information against an existing schema influences whether a specific conflict episode has the potential of being viewed as functional or dysfunctional. This article develops the notion that both individual boundary personnel and the organization form schema. In addition, this article contends that the organization's schema is a ''superordinate'' schema that is conveyed to the individual boundary personnel, and acts as the primary mechanism used to compare incoming information. A model of this process and managerial implications are presented. Propositions are developed throughout the manuscript.

TI Developing optimal pricing and inventory policies for retailers who face
   uncertain demand
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailers who sell products such as new fashion items or new toys face considerable uncertainty in demand. Despite this uncertainty, they are required to make two important decisions that depend on the level of demand First, they need to decide on how the product should be priced over the selling season. Second, they need to determine how much to stock and reorder each period.
   In this paper, we develop a new model for use by retailers that incorporates the following. First it includes ''learning'' or updating of demand. Second, it determines the optimal pricing policy. Third, it determines the optimal stocking policy.
   The new model appears to offer advantages for new items where the selling season is limited and the retailer is quite uncertain about the true demand distribution. Several example problems are solved to illustrate the potential advantages and to indicate the types of questions that can be investigated with the model.

A test of the conceptual framework using survey data collected from 207 retail buyers and divisional merchandise managers indicates that staffing policies significantly affect the buyers' intrinsic motivation and commitment to their firms. Commitment and intrinsic motivation, in turn, have a strong effect on a buyer's creativity, risk-taking behavior and intention to leave the organization. The results suggest that staffing policies are an important mechanism for controlling buyer attitudes and behaviors.

This research addresses key aspects of a retail employee's work environment, or 'climate,' and how these perceptions influence work-related outcomes. Specifically, a causal modelling approach tests relationships among front-line service providers. Results suggest that employee perceptions of co-worker involvement and supervisory support can reduce stress and increase job satisfaction. Other results indicate a positive relationship between role conflict and job performance, a positive relationship between job performance and job satisfaction, and that job performance mediates effects of role stress on satisfaction.

The influence of this service-enhancing factor is investigated within the nexus of SERVQUAL, a comprehensive measure of service quality. Survey data from 233 adult consumers show that ''personalization'' significantly influences customer experience and evaluation of service. As hypothesized, for a business that performs service on a physical possession, this influence is subsumed in other components of SERVQUAL. In contrast, for a business delivering service in interactive encounters with customers, ''personalization'' emerges as the most important determinant of perceived service quality, and of customer satisfaction and other patronage indicators.

TI Price competition in a duopoly common retailer channel
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Today's retail market for most consumer goods is dominated by large retail chains. These powerful retailers are often much larger than most manufactures, and they usually carry multiple brands in most product categories. Despite their increasing influence on the market, it is only recently that their perspective of channel problems began to gain attention of analytical studies. We add to this growing literature of channel studies by modeling price competition in the most common channel type: multiple common retailers. In particular, this paper deals with a channel structure in which there are duopoly manufacturers and duopoly common retailers. One of our major findings is that, while (horizontal) product differentiation helps manufacturers, it hurts retailers. Conversely, while (horizontal) store differentiation helps retailers, it hurts manufacturers. Other effects of these two types of differentiation on equilibrium solutions are also analyzed. Managerial implications of the results are derived and summarized in the Executive Summary.

This paper augments prior research by building an integrated framework within which to view private brand proneness. Factors found to influence store brand proneness included familiarity with store brands, the extent to which consumers rely on extrinsic cues such as price and packaging to judge product quality intolerance for ambiguity, perceived quality variation between national and store brand products, perceived risk, perceived value for money, income and family sire. The results suggest that consumers' negative perceptions of store brands are driven primarily by the poor quality image of these products. Implications for marketing strategy are presented.

TI Relating price sensitivity to retailer promotional variables and pricing
   policy: An empirical analysis
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB There is substantial evidence for variation in price sensitivity of products across stores and chains. Understanding the relationships between price sensitivity and promotional variables (such as price cut, feature advertising, and display), and between price sensitivity and pricing policy (Everyday Low Pricing [EDLP] and High Low Pricing [HLP]) is particularly important to retailers. We develop hypotheses on the relationships between regular price elasticity and retailer promotional variables, and between regular price elasticity and retailer pricing policy. We test these hypotheses by analyzing the variation of regular price elasticity of a frequently purchased consumer packaged brand across stores, both within and across chains, through a multistage regression analysis. In the first stage of our analysis, we use a mixed double-log model to estimate the sales response function for the brand in each store using time series data. In the second stage, we explain the differences in the estimated regular price elasticities across stores within a chain by a process function model. In the final stage, the differences across all stores and chains are explained through an aggregate process function model. We extend the literature by separating regular (long-run) price elasticily from promotional (short-run) elasticity and by studying the influence of both strategic and tactical retailer variables on regular price elasticity in a single framework within and across chains. Our results for the brand analyzed show that a higher level of display and feature advertising together is associated with a lower level of regular price elasticity in EDLP stores and that an EDLP policy is associated with a higher level of regular price elasticity, whereas an HLP policy is refuted to a lower level of regular price elasticity.

TI Coupon face value: Its impact on coupon redemptions, brand sales, and
   brand profitability
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Although much research has examined the impact of coupons on redemption rates, incremental sales, and market share, only a few studies have addressed the impact of coupons on brand profitability. One possible reason is lack of readily available profitability data. In the absence of such data, researchers have used managerial judgments (Neslin and Shoemaker, 1983) and experiments (Chapman, 1986) to investigate the profitability of coupons. We propose an integrative framework for evaluating the impact of coupon face value on brand profitability and implement it by using readily available scanner data. The research reveals that when a manufacturer optimizes the market-level profitability from a coupon program profit for individual chains in the market could be suboptimal.

TI Retail ''sale'' advertising, perceived retailer credibility, and price
   rationale
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailers often advertise products at ''reduced'' prices. Past research has suggested this is an effective way to appeal to consumers; but recent evidence indicates growing consumer mistrust of this type of advertising claim. This paper presents an experiment that suggests consumer perceptions of retail price reductions may depend on the rationale the retailer provides for the reductions. Directions for future research are discussed.

TI Hispanic and Native American adolescents: An exploratory study of their
   approach to shopping
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study investigates the role of ethnicity as a determinant of adolescent consumers' approach to the retail marketplace and the factors ultimately related to consumer socialization. A total of 1,846 respondents were classified into three groups based on their ethnicity: Hispanic, Native American and White. Multivariate and univariate analyses of covariance were utilized to determine whether the three ethnic adolescent groups differed with respect to shopping orientation and the socialization process. The covariance procedures allowed for an examination of ethnic differences apart from social class differences. The study's most notable findings revealed a distinctive shopping orientation on the parr of each group. Hispanics exhibited a Social/Hedonistic orientation, Native Americans an Overpowered orientation, and Whites a Utilitarian orientation. The findings have specific implications for retailing and public policy, particularly with regard to Native American and Hispanic adolescents who heretofore have received scant attention in the retailing and marketing literature.

TI Productivity assessment of multiple retail outlets
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB One of the main problems in assessing the relative efficiency of multiple retail outlets is the fact that customers are an essential component of the ''production process'' in retailing. Hence, the efficiency of a particular retail store depends both on the seller's and the buyers' efficiency. While there is often data an each store's inputs to the production of retail services, the contribution of each store's customers to this process is difficult to measure, and often goes unmeasured. In the absence of data on variation in customer efficiency across stores, it is difficult to make comparisons of the relative efficiency of the retailer's operation across stores In this paper, we propose to solve the problem of missing data on customer inputs by treating stoves as members of different latent classes, where the classes are defined by differences in customer inputs and other market characteristics. We consider the clusterwise estimation of multiple translog cost functions, which identifies sets of retail outlets operating under similar conditions and simultaneously estimates multiple cost functions for these classes. The efficiency of each outlet would then be evaluated relative to others in its class, which allows for a more equitable evaluation of each retail outlet, in comparison to other units operating under similar conditions.
   We apply this approach in the evaluation of multiple branches from a commercial bank in Latin America, and compare the efficiency measures obtained from it with measures obtained from other methods, using the bank's central managers' classification of markets as a benchmark. Our results indicate that the clusterwise estimation of translog cost functions leads to a more equitable assessment of the branches more in tune with the market differences perceived by the bank managers.

TI Aggregate versus product-specific pricing: Implications for franchise
   and traditional channels
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Franchisors often charge a common franchise fee and royalty an all the products sold or serviced by their franchisees. Since the potential demand for each product may be different, a product specific pricing scheme may be optimal. Hence, the common strategy of aggregate pricing appears to be a puzzling practice However we show that under certain conditions the aggregate pricing scheme improves channel coordination of retail prices and local services, and improves the total channel profit and the franchisor's profit. In order to highlight the important role of franchise fee, we also consider a traditional channel in which the manufacturer does not have enough market power to charge a positive franchise fee. We consider two pricing arrangements: quantity discount schedules and slotting allowance. We find that for a manufacturer using quantity discount schedules, aggregate pricing is (weakly) worse than product-specific pricing. If the retailers have enough power to extract all the surplus from the manufacturer through slotting allowances then the manufacturer is indifferent between using product-specific and aggregate pricing.

TI Market share forecasting: An empirical comparison of artificial neural
   networks and multinomial logit model
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We empirically compare the forecasting ability of artificial neural network (ANN) with multinomial logit model (MNL) in the context of frequently purchased grocery products for a retailer. Using scanner data on three grocery product categories we find that performance of ANN compares favorably to MNL in forecasting brand shares. We test the sensitivity of the forecasting error in the two approaches to the length of the estimation period and the clustering of households which is used to define homogenous segments of households. We find the results to be robust to these variations. We also derive a few empirical propositions regarding performance of ANN and MNL from our analysis. The results are consistent with those in Kumar, Rao and Soni (1995) and suggest that although neural networks suffer from interpretability problem, they are a useful method to forecast brand shares in grocery product categories where large amounts of scanner data are readily available.

AB Research regarding sales promotions has focused on information processing of price discounts for relatively uninvolving consumer goods. Sales promotions for leisure retail operators, on the other hand, often emphasize some form of added value to patrons who are likely to be relatively involved in hedonic consumption. We propose and rest a model of sales promotion for hedonic consumption illustrating that consumer response to sales promotions in leisure settings is a function of consumers' variety-seeking tendencies, loyalty to the service provider, and perceptions of the value of the service provision.

AB Oxenfeldt and Kelly's provocative ownership redirection thesis-the premise that there may be a deliberate effort on the part of the more powerful franchisors to convert the previously franchisee-owned outlets into company-owned outlets-has attracted considerable research attention. However, the empirical evidence on the thesis remains equivocal. This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of the existing studies of ownership redirection. The focus of the analysis is on the disparate operationalizations of the phenomenon itself and the manner in which the construct measurement affects the determination of its existence.

TI Customers' motivations for maintaining relationships with service
   providers
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Understanding why customers are receptive to relationships with service providers is a key issue in relationship marketing. This paper suggests that four broad drivers-environmental variables, partner variables customer variables, and interaction variables-affect customers' receptivity to relationship maintenance. Customers may maintain relationships either because of constraints (they ''have to'' stay in the relationship) or because of dedication (they ''want to'' stay in the relationship). The potentially differential effects of these dual motivations on customers' subsequent relationship attitudes and behaviors are examined. A model of relationship maintenance is developed and propositions are presented regarding the antecedents and consequences of customers' relationship maintenance. Theoretical and practical implications of the paper are discussed.

Leading firms and scholars propose a possible relationship between the fair treatment of these employees and excellence in service delivery. This important proposition, however, lacks much more than anecdotal evidence. An empirical investigation is presented which offers support for positive relationships between contact employee fairness perceptions and their prosocial service behaviors (customer service behaviors and cooperation with fellow employees) and job satisfaction. Fairness of job supervision, pay and promotion rules and supervisor administration of these rules emerge as the key predictors of contact employee prosocial service behaviors and job satisfaction. The paper concludes with a discussion of research and managerial implications.

An experimental study was conducted to test three different constructs-perceived wait duration, emotional evaluation of the service environment, and emotional response to the wait-as mediators between music and behavioral response to the service organization. Results of the study showed that, regardless of its valence, music ameliorates emotional evaluation of the service environment which in turn positively affects approach behavior towards the service organization Furthermore, positively valenced music triggers a more positive emotional response to the wait and a stronger approach behavior towards the service organization than negatively valenced music. Although positively valenced music also increases perceived wait duration, the latter does nor have a significant effect on consumers behavioral response to the service organization.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The quest for a better understanding of how consumers' quality perceptions and satisfaction judgement contribute to ultimate purchase intentions continues to represent one of the key challenges facing service marketers. Using regression models the traditional approach is to employ direct measures of these constructs to identify the additive contributions of quality perceptions and satisfaction judgments as independent variables to consumers' stated future purchase intentions as a dependent variable. This study demonstrates that unobserved potential higher-order factors (and their interactions) in such efforts can lead to problems associated with interpreting regression coefficients as importance weights. A framework is proposed, and empirically validated in a multiindustry study, to assist service marketers in identifying potential higher-order factors and their interactions in their own models of consumer decision-making in service settings. The managerial and research implications of the study are presented and discussed.

In order to lest the hypotheses an experiment was conducted; twelve different scenarios were created, each describing a situation in which a customer was returning a product to a retail store. In the various scenarios, the customer was allowed to exchange the product or was given a partial discount on a new product, was treated either with courtesy and respect or was treated rudely and was able to take care of the problem promptly or was asked to come back to the store the next day. Subjects were asked to read one of the twelve scenarios and to imagine that this situation happened to them, they were then asked to imagine how they would have felt and what they subsequently would have done. In order to make the scenarios more vivid, subjects then watched a videotape depicting the same event. Of the three dimensions, interactional justice had the largest impact on complainants' repatronage and negative word-of-mouth intentions.

AB Determining the relative importance of service attributes is one of the most important objectives of customer satisfaction measurement. Two popular methods that are currently used are ''gap analysis'' of expectations minus performance and linear regression of the overall satisfaction rating on the ratings far the attributes. Unfortunately, both these methods have shortcomings, so Ice develop a new method which is based on a conjoint analysis of nine hypothetical service scenarios. This information is used to fit a satisfaction response model as a function of the component service attributes. In turn, the current service level is plotted on the response surface and the ''path of steepest ascent'' in the direction of maximum customer satisfaction gives the best ''direction'' for management to plan a quality improvement program. We compare the proposed method with those currently being used and find it is more responsive to changes in attribute performance as a firm's quality improvement strategy evolves.

After summarizing what is known about voice in apr inter-firm context, the paper proposes that a firm's voice is affected by its cost to exit the relationship, its overall relationship satisfaction, and demographic variables. These proposals are tested in a field survey. While satisfaction and the cost to exit the relationship were stronger predictors of voice than the demographic variables, the results suggest that several partner firm demographic variables could be useful to relationship managers interested in the maintenance of business-to-business relationships via partner firm voice cultivation Because these demographic variables are less sensitive (ie., partner firms are likely to provide this information without insisting on their anonymity), they could be used to identify partner firms by name that are likely to be nonvocal when they are experiencing relationship problems.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This research examines if there are consumer segments that have a propensity to be deal prone in general and/or segments that reflect a proneness to deals at some more specific level (e.g., a segment reflecting a propensity to respond to price promotions but not nonprice promotions, a specific coupon prone segment, a rebate prone segment). Analyses using multi-item scales assessing consumers' proneness to eight different types of sales promotion indicate the existence of a consumer segment that reflects a generalized deal proneness across deal types. These segment-based findings are validated by relating segment membership to deal-responsive behaviors assessed in a natural field setting. Significant differences between the consumer segments are shown across eleven dependent measures. Given the objective of reaching deal prone consumers in an efficient manner, these results suggest that usage of a broad variety of promotion types may not be necessary to achieve this goal.

TI Customer delight: Foundations, findings, and managerial insight
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Many business practitioners have addressed the importance of delighting delighting the customer as an extension of providing basic satisfaction. Yet the concept of customer delight has not been given a clear behavioral foundation, and the antecedents and consequences of customer delight, when manifest in specific service contexts, have not been empirically explored. This paper attempts to provide a first step toward establishing a behavioral basis for customer delight, empirically testing its hypothesized antecedents and consequences, and exploring the resulting implications. Based on data from two service fields, structural equation results support the proposition that unexpected high levels of satisfaction or performance initiate an arousal double right arrow pleasure (positive affect) double right arrow delight sequence. Mixed support is found for the hypothesis that delight is a combined result of pleasure and arousal. Satisfaction, acting in parallel with delight, was strongly related to pleasure and disconfirmation and had a clear effect on behavioral intention; the effect of delight on intention, however, appears to be moderated by the service context. Managerial implications include the consideration of whether delight is a reasonable and meaningful consumer expression in particular service contexts, the necessity of focusing an surprising levels of satisfaction or performance when attempting to produce delighting consumption experiences, and potentially separate strategies for inducing satisfaction and delight.

It broadens traditional thinking about components of service transactions and develops behaviorally based service encounter dimensions, each with multiple measures, for the two countries. The study reveals a conversation factor not presently identified in the services literature and significant cross-cultural differences in both the dimensions and behaviors identified in the two countries. it also examines the relationship of dimensions to encounter satisfaction in both countries.

TI The sex of the service provider: Does it influence perceptions of
   service quality?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This work builds on recent streams of research on both service quality and the relationships between consumption and gender. It explores whether the sex of the service provider should be regarded as art element of the servicescape that influences perceptions of service quality in the contexts of fast food restaurants hair cutting salons, and dental offices. For each setting, two possibilities were explored. The first was that men might believe male servers provide higher quality and women believe female servers did, due to in-group bias or homophily based perceptions. The second was that consumers' ''server stereotypes'' concerning which sex does a better job of serving in a particular setting would interact with the sex of the service provider to influence perceived quality. Across the three settings studied server stereotypes were found to interact with sex of server and/or sex of consumer to affect ratings of some dimensions of service quality. The reasons for and implications of the inconsistent effects of stereotypes are addressed.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Customers contribute to service quality through their roles as promoters of the firm, co-producers of the firm's service and consultants to the organization. A model of customer voluntary performance (CVP) is developed and empirically tested with a sample of grocery customers. Customer voluntary performance refers to helpful, discretionary customer behaviors that support the ability of the firm to deliver service quality Global customer satisfaction, perceived support for customers and customer commitment are considered as antecedents of CVP. interrelationships among these variables are also considered. The results provide support for eight of the twelve hypothesized relationships. Implications of the study are discussed for researchers and managers.

AB This research investigates the relationships among service provider and customer positive affect, employee-and customer-directed prosocial behaviors, and sales-oriented behavior; three types of behavior commonly exhibited in the context of service delivery. In addition, employee and customer perceptions of service quality are considered. Three studies are presented. The principle findings indicate that employee positive affect is positively related to employee perceptions of altruistic organizational citizenship behavior and customer-oriented behavior, and negatively related to sales-oriented behavior. Customer positive affect is positively related to customer perceptions of customer-oriented behavior and service quality, and negatively related to sales-oriented behavior. Managerial and research implications are also discussed.

By building a formal model that demonstrates interactions between the determinants of search, we are able to distinguish between different types of human capital, and to provide insight into the measurement of each type. We test this model employing sun ey data on consumer perceptions of the various variables in our model in the domain of grocery shopping. In general, we find that self-reported search for information about buying groceries is related to perceptions of the benefits and costs of search in a manner predicted by our theory.

TI Information and channel profits
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB New marketing information technologies, associated with point-of-purchase scanner systems, have increased the potential information available to manufacturers and retailers. In this paper, we explore the pricing and profit implications of this technology within a channel setting. We find that improved information about demand always results in greater absolute profits, as well as a claim on greater division of channel profits for the informed channel member The greater profitability is due to the informed channel member's ability to "fine tune" prices in response to changes in demand conditions. However, total channel profits are highest when only one channel member acquires information. We also show that fine-tuning of price has the effect of smoothing sales, as informed firms charge higher prices during high demand periods and charge lower prices during low demand periods. Lastly, we show that an equilibrium rt here both channel members acquire information does not lead to a prisoners' dilemma.

TI Studying patterns of consumer's grocery shopping trip
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Previous research on (grocery) shopping trips has focused on studying the relationship between shopping frequency and shopper's demographic characteristics. Recognizing that shoppers are heterogeneous in terms of their shopping trip regularity as well as shopping frequency, we propose a mixture model of the exponential and the Erlang-2 distribution with heterogeneous frequency for shopping trip intervals. Applied to IRI (Information Resources, inc.) shopping trip data, we found that 70 percent of shoppers visit grocery st6res with random intervals and 30 percent with relatively fixed intervals. We also found clear differences between these "random" and "routine" shoppers in terms of several demographic and purchase behavioral characteristics. The "routine" shoppers are identified to have higher opportunity costs which make it difficult for them to visit grocery stores more often and/or to switch stores. However, they spend more dollars for a given shopping trip. Finally, we discuss managerial iniplications of segmenting shoppers by their shopping trip regularity.

TI Modeling retail trade areas using higher-order, multiplicatively
   weighted Voronoi diagrams
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Voronoi (Thiessen) trade area models are geometrically based procedures for generating theoretical trade areas using store characteristics and assumptions about consumer behavior. Existing models assume that customers patronize only one facility resulting in mutually exclusive trade areas. We introduce two new Voronoi models which include the assumption that a customer selects from the k (k = 1, 2, 3,...) nearest most attractive facilities. When the customer is indifferent between the k facilities, the trade areas are gir en by the order-k, multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram. If the customer shows a preference for nearer facilities, the trade areas are given by the ordered order-k, multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram. Both models produce overlapping trade areas. The ordered, order-k, multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram model also enables us to examine the effects of different preference levels on the sales estimates for a facility. The new models are demonstrated using data relating to a chain of supermarkets in the twin cities of Kitchener-Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.

We first generalize the inventory-level-dependent demand inventory model to explicitly model the demand rate as a function of the displayed inventory level. We then investigate the product assortment and shelf-space allocation problems by extending this model into the multi-item constrained environment. A greedy heuristic and a genetic algorithm are proposed for the solution to the integrated problem.

TI Distribution services and economic power in a channel
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We explore the consequences of formally acknowledging the influences of distribution services on the economic power of a retailer relative to a manufacturer in a simple channel dyad. The work is in the tradition of the analysis of successive monopolies and features the analysis of the well-known double marginalization problem. We compare two stylized cases of the provision of distribution services, the first exclusively by the downstream agent and the second by the upstream agent. In reference to a standard leader/follower model without acknowledged distribution services, the results of these two cases establish the importance of including distribution services in empirical and analytical investigations of the distribution of power in the channel. Briefly, distribution services may afford the agent that controls their provision unusual opportunities to capture economic power, and benefit consumers in a decentralized channel more than in a vertically integrated one.

TI Retail sales force scheduling based on store traffic forecasting
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Although retailers acknowledge the impact of sales force scheduling decisions on store profits and customer service, current scheduling methods may fail to capture the sales potential of customers who enter their premises. These methods do not recognize the effect that the sales staff availability has upon the customer purchasing, thus leaving significant opportunity for additional sales volume unrealized To resolve this problem, we propose a model which sets store sales potential as a function of store traffic volume, customer type, and customer response to sale force availability. We test our model for a profit minimizing sales force schedule with data providing hourly data of store sales, store traffic and staff head count. The solution for this optimal schedule indicates that the store may be seriously understaffed and that expanding the number of salespersons would both generate higher profits and provide customers with better service. Our scheduling method also provides a tool for identifying the time periods when service is most heavily demanded by customers.

Data Envelopment Analysis, an operations research-based performance evaluation methodology, is introduced as one solution for resolving this problem and assessing managerially useful measure of store-level retail productivity. Data Envelopment Analysis measures relative-to-best performance efficiency of retail outlets characterized by multiple inputs and outputs. In an empirical illustration, using data collected over time from retail stores belonging to a restaurant chain, the potential applications and strengths of Data Envelopment Analysis in assessing retail productivity are highlighted.

TI Development of a theory of retailer response to manufacturers' everyday
   low cost programs
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Manufacturers' everyday low cost (EDLC) programs have been prescribed as a means of eliminating inefficiencies associated with trade deals. However, the long-term success of EDLC programs is largely dependent upon favorable responses from retailers. In an effort to investigate retailer response to manufacturers' EDLC programs, in-depth interviews were conducted with executives of retail and manufacturing firms. Data analysis was guided by Glaser and Strauss' grounded theory approach. These efforts resulted in theory detailing antecedents and consequences of the focal construct, "retailer attitude toward the EDLC program." Research findings indicate that retailers' attitudes toward EDLC programs are based on an assessment of the compatibility between the program and their marketing environment. Several factors including retailer characteristics (e.g., perceived weakness in buying power, commitment to forward buying) and program characteristics (e.g., whether program is optional, product storage costs) were found to influence retailers' assessments of program/environment compatibility and in turn their attitudes reward EDLC programs. Whether retailers' attitudes toward EDLC programs led to supportive, nonsupportive, or adaptive behaviors was found to be contingent upon the relative dependence existing within the channel relationship. The implications of these findings on the development and diffusion of pricing/promotion initiatives are discussed.

TI The hierarchical influence of personal values on mall shopping attitude
   and behavior
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The primary objective of this study was to employ a value-attitude-behavior model in order to investigate the role personal values play in the patronage of regional shopping malls. A secondary objective was to examine whether one's ethnic group membership and ethnic identification serve as important factors that influence personal values as well as attitudes and patronage behavior in the context of regional shopping malls. The sample of regional mall shoppers consisted of white and Hispanic consumers residing in ten metropolitan cities of the southwest. Structural equation modeling indicated that both self-actualizing and social affiliation personal values were positively related to a favorable attitude toward regional shopping malls, and that the social affiliation value played a greater role in influencing attitude than did the self-actualizing value. Individual attitudes toward shopping malls, in turn, were a direct predictor of mall shopping behavior and mediated the relationship between personal values and attitudes. The findings indicate that, independent of ethnic group membership, both self-actualizing and social affiliation values can be used effectively to position regional malls in such a way as to reinforce these views and to provide a strong means for shoppers to satisfy these needs.

TI A discrete optimization model for seasonal merchandise planning
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Buyers in retail chains typically plan promotional markdowns and accompanying advertising for the complete season, subject to budgetary and scheduling constraints. Because of the large number of possible alternatives and the difficulty of predicting the sales responses to novel plans, promotional plans are currently prepared through trial and error, by modifying previous years' plans. This paper proposes a methodology for developing an optimal promotional plan that maximizes total season profit, subject to promotional resource constraints and a set of possible market scenarios, by selecting from a discrete set of candidate ads and markdowns. The benefit of the optimization model is illustrated by applying it to promotional data from a major department store chain and comparing the results to plans previously implemented by the buyers.

TI A modes of consumer perceptions and store loyalty intentions for a
   supermarket retailer
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Slow growth and intense competition in retail markets in recent years increases the need for retailers to use strategies focused on retaining and attracting the right customers. However, a strategy that is effective in acquiring new customers may not be the most effective in retaining current customers. In order to understand the effectiveness of activities designed to retain customers, we study the store loyalty intentions of current customers for a multi-store grocery retailer. Using Partial Least Squares, on data averaged across at least 100 customers per store for each of about 160 stores, we find that service quality is by far the most critical determinant of merchandise quality perception. Perceived value for money depends on perceived relative price and sales promotion perceptions, and to a lesser extent on service quality and merchandise quality perceptions. Store loyalty intentions, measured by intent to continue shopping, intent to increase purchases and intent to recommend the store, depend on service quality and merchandise quality perception. By separating the stores according to average consumer perceptions of competitor attractiveness, we further find that perceived value does play an important role in the determination of store loyalty intention if there is a high degree of competitor attractiveness. When this attractiveness is low, our. results fail to show a relevance for perceived value for money.

TI Is dependent what we want to be? Effects of incongruency
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A paradigm shift within marketing has focused attention on the relational end of the exchange continuum where dependence justifies relationship behavior and drives outcomes.. Previous research, however, ignores the possibility that attitudes toward dependence might also be responsible for relational and economic outcomes. We propose that the impact of adverse attitudes might be partially responsible for previous empirical results, contradicting the notion that parties respond favorably toward relationships and experience positive outcomes. Building on dependency theory, transactional cost analysis (TCA), and congruency theory, this study examines the influence attitudes toward dependence have on the ability of a channel member to work effectively under conditions where dependence exists. Results indicate that when dependence exists adverse attitudes toward dependence moderate the relationships between dependence and dealer satisfaction, and dependence and revenue generated from the relationship, but nor necessarily in a negative fashion or under all dependent conditions.

TI Grocery market pricing and the new competitive environment
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This article seeks to examine the effect of changes in retail-grocery market conditions upon consumer prices and the response of food retailers to these conditions. We explore these issues for two different product groups. One is composed primarily of branded, dry and frozen groceries (PI) while the second largely represents produce, meat, and perishable products (P2). Our statistical model finds that the effect of the of these new market conditions is often markedly sensitive to product type. Competitive conditions affect both price measures, bur entry by warehouse and similar grocery formats surprisingly lower perishable prices more than those for staple goods. We also observe that frequent price changes in a market serves to reduce food prices, suggesting that promotional activities in response to new format competition are beneficial for consumers. There is strong evidence of a fast food-supermarket rivalry, but we are unable to identify its specific nature. Operating costs significantly effect prices for staple items, but have virtually no evident influence on perishable.

TI Is the price right? Understanding contingent processing in reference
   price formation
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Although interest in buyers' reference prices continues to grow, relatively little is known about how they are formed and the factors that shape the formation of such price standards. This paper explores the contingencies triggered in buyers' reference price formation by (a) the discrepancy of price claims encountered in the marketplace relative to prior price beliefs, and (b) shopping experience. In a normal price estimation task both experienced and inexperienced shoppers displayed a tendency to rely more on the price claims presented in the task than on prior price beliefs. This tendency increased when the claims were below price expectations and diminished when the claims were above expectations. Interestingly, experienced and inexperienced shoppers showed almost an identical approach to normal price estimation when the claims either matched ol were below expectations. However, significant differences emerged when the claims were above expectations. There as experienced shoppers reduced their reliance on such discrepant claims, inexperienced shoppers did not. The results of this investigation underscore the usefulness of a contingency approach for guiding future research efforts directed at understanding buyers' reference price formation.

TI The effect of store name, brand name and price discounts on consumers'
   evaluations and purchase intentions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This paper develops and tests a conceptual model of the effects of store name, brand names and price discounts on consumers' evaluations (store image, brand quality perceptions, internal reference prices, and value perceptions) and purchase intentions. The moderating effects of consumer knowledge and prior ownership on the proposed relationships in the model are also explored. A store's perceived image is influenced by the store name and the quality of merchandise it carries. Results also indicate that internal reference price is influenced by price discounts, brand name, and a brand's perceived quality. The influence of price discounts on a brand's perceived quality was minimal. Price discounts, internal reference price, and brand's perceived quality exerted significant influence on perceived value. Perceived value and store image, in turn, positively, influenced purchased intentions. High knowledge respondents are more influenced by brand name, while low knowledge respondents are more influenced by price discounts. Low knowledge consumers are also swayed by stare name and brand name.

Yet how different implementations of a price promotion influence consumers' perceptions and purchase intentions has been insufficiently, studied. In this study, we framed a price reduction in percentage versus dollar terms on either a high-price or a low-price product. For the high-price product, our subjects indicated that a price reduction framed in dollar terms seemed more significant than the same price reduction framed in percentage terms, and the opposite was true for the low-price product. We also offered the same savings in either coupon or discount promotions and found that coupon promotions were evaluated more favorably and were more effective in changing subjects' purchase intentions. These results provide implications for when retailers should stress the absolute versus the relative magnitude of discounts to advertise price promotions.

TI Consumer response to quantity surcharges: Implications for retail price
   setters
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Quantity surcharges occur when a larger-sized package of a brand has a higher per-unit price than its smaller-sized counterpart (which is otherwise equivalent in terms of quality and type of packaging). Although consumers typically expect larger packages to have a quantity discount (ie., lower per unit prices), quantity surcharges are common among package goods items. Two experimental studies are presented in which consumers' reactions to surcharges are examined. Surcharge pricing was found to impact consumers evaluations of surcharged brands and their evaluations of retail pricing. In addition, quantity surcharges were found to have a substantial influence on purchase behavior. Moderators of these effects include quantity discount beliefs (i.e., the extent to which consumers believe that large packages are assigned smaller unit prices), surcharge magnitude, and gender. Implications of these findings for retail price setters and suggestions for future research are discussed.

TI The impact of internal and external reference prices on brand choice:
   The moderating role of contextual variables
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The impact of internal reference price discrepancy (between actual price cmd internal reference price), and external reference price discrepancy (between actual price and external reference price) on brand choice is studied in two different contexts: whether the consumer faces a stockout condition at the time of purchase or not, and whether the consumer is a deal-prone consumer or not. Internal reference price is based on the past prices paid for the brand by the consumer, and external reference price is dependent upon the prices of all brands in the category at the point of purchase. Hypotheses are tested by estimating brand choice models using IRI scanner panel data for two product categories-saltine crackers and baking chips. Results indicate that, in general, the impact of the external reference price discrepancy on brand choice is greater than that of the internal price discrepancy. However, this varies depending upon the contextual conditions. For consumers facing a stockout condition at the time of purchase, and for deal-prone consumers, the impact of the external reference price discrepancy on brand choice is greater than that of the internal reference price discrepancy. However, for consumers not facing a stockout condition, and for non-deal-prone consumers, there is no difference in the impact of the internal and external reference price discrepancy on brand choice. Also the impact of both the external and internal reference price discrepancy on brand choice is greater for consumers not facing a stockout condition at the time of purchase relative to facing a stockout condition, and for deal-prone consumers than for nan-deal-prone consumers. Implications for pricing strategies are discussed for retailers, and limitations and extensions of this study are also provided.

TI Variability of brand price elasticities across retail stores: Ethnic,
   income, and brand determinants
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retail pricing decisions are often made with respect to the price sensitivity of shoppers in a retail store or market area. This paper explores how certain brand and consumer characteristics relate to the variability of brand price elasticities across stores belonging to the same chain. The authors measure the price sensitivity of 14 liquor brands sold in 35 store locations. Since the stores operate in a monopoly environment, the analysis is free from the confounds caused by competitive pricing or promotional activity that often hamper retail pricing studies. Also, the monopoly situation provides data that represent a census of brand sales in the categories studied Results of a two-stage econometric analysis show that brand price elasticity is higher for brands that are promoted more frequently and for brands that have higher market shares. The magnitude of brand price elasticity is also found to be directly related to the household income in a market area and inversely related to the proportion of residents in a market area who are African-American.

TI SERV*OR: A managerial measure of organizational service-orientation
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB An organizational service orientation scale (SERV*OR) is developed and validated in this study Service orientation is defined as cut organization-wide embracement of a basic set of relatively enduring organizational policies, practices and procedures intended to support and reward service-giving behaviors that create and deliver "service excellence." The SERV*OR managerial measure captures the extent to which an organization is perceived by its employees as having adopted and embraced specific policies, practices and procedures that represent an organizational service orientation. A comprehensive and rigorous program to develop the valid and reliable measure was undertaken. Key features of the methodology included executive focus group interviews, multiple rounds of pre-testing, multi-sample assessment and multi-industry replication The results strongly indicate that organizational service orientation may be represented by a structure comprised of ten factors. The factors are carefully described and theoretically based. Managerial implications and future research directions are discussed.

TI Variety for sale: Mass customization or mass confusion?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailers who implement a high variety strategy need to ensure that customers are not confused with the complexity inherent in a wide assortment of options. Experimental evidence shows that when asking consumers to choose among items in a wide assortment, both the way the information is presented and the type of customer input to the information gathering process influence customer satisfaction. First, asking consumers to indicate their within-attribute preferences through an attribute-based information format, as opposed to an alternative-based format, increases satisfaction and learning. Second, consumers are likely to be more satisfied and perceive less complexity in the choice set when they are asked to explicitly indicate their preferences within each attribute, as compared to more effortful tasks or less effortful tasks.

TI Measuring consumer, nonlinear brand choice response to price
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Nonlinear price responses by shoppers in brand choice decisions have important managerial and theoretical implications for designing pricing and price promotions. However, the study of these phenomena by traditional parametric techniques is not only tedious, but may lead to an incorrect confirmation of theory. To avoid these problems I demonstrate a simplified means for detecting the possible presence of nonlinearities in consumer response by means of a unique, nonparametric method. This method relaxes the usual linear-in-parameters character of the multinomial legit (MNL) model by an additive sum of one-dimensional nonparametric functions of explanatory variables. In an application of this model to aseptic and red drink databases, I document the presence of these nonlinearities in the form of price threshold effects and a saturation effect with respect to price reductions. I further apply the model to orange juice and ground coffee scanner data by employing the framework of a previous parametric study by Kalyanaram and Little (1994). The model easily found the expected existence of weak price sensitivity around the reference price and a greater consumer negative reaction to price increases than positive reactions to price decreases. Researchers may find this nonparametric technique a useful addition to their kit of statistical tools.

TI Barriers to change in regulated channel environments: Pharmacists'
   prescribing
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Based on attitude-behavior theory and its extensions, the authors develop and test a model of pharmacists' intentions to prescribe medication under the Florida pharmacists Self-Care Consultant Law. Data from a random sample of 490 Florida retail pharmacists, one of the few states where independent prescribing is currently allowed, revealed that frequency of past prescribing directly affects behavioral intentions. Also revealed are the underlying attitudinal and normative effects on frequency of past behavior. Post-behavioral reactions reinforce negative attitudes and the pharmacist's perception of the law's intent operates through perceived subjective norms. Suggestions for increasing pharmacists' prescribing, implications for service delivery channels, and future research directions are drawn from the findings.

TI The impact of price thresholds on profit contribution - Should retailers
   set 9-ending prices?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retail prices typically end in 9 cents. This can be due to thresholds between odd and even prices where sales decrease sharply (e.g., $2.89 versus $2.90). However, empirical evidence is inconclusive as to whether such thresholds really exist.
   We show that observed retailer behavior is rational even when there is uncertainty about the existence of price thresholds. Our analysis is based on the losses in profit contribution that are incurred when a retailer makes the wrong assumptions about the presence of thresholds. By analyzing different response and cost functions, were find that a retailer should typically set 9-ending prices, unless he suspects strong quality-image effects of price endings.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study extends previous research on perceived value by including the role of perceived risk within a model of the antecedents and consequences of perceived value. The model was tested in a retail setting using a sample of consumers actively looking for an electrical appliance. The mediating impact of perceived risk on the quality-value relationship ms specifically examined. Empirical results confirmed that not only do perceived product and service quality lead to perceived value for money in a service encounter but that these quality components reduce perceived risk. Perceived risk was found to play an important role in the perceived product and service quality-value for money relationship and was found to be a significant mediator of this relationship. Perceived value for money was also found to be a significant mediator of perceived quality, price and risk and willingness-to-buy. The results obtained have major implications for retailers as well as for future research in this strategically important area of consumer research.

TI Legal and social safeguards against opportunism in exchange
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A considerable literature in marketing, economics, and law has emphasized the organizational structures and governance approaches employed by participants to enhance their exchange relationships and safeguard against the hazards of opportunism. The age-old mechanism of protecting against opportunism is the legal contract. Various literatures have attacked the inadequacies of contract in the context of complex, modern day exchange relationships. Some theorists have argued for the superiority of social mechanisms of control while others have beer? skeptical rewards their use. This paper proposes that both legal contracts and social safe guards are useful means of mitigating opportunism. However, they rarely, occur in isolation in modern exchanges and the interesting questions about their governance properties have to do with their interaction effects. This article employs a behavioural simulation to empirically examine the individual and combined effects of contract and relational norm safeguards against opportunism directly and in the context of asymmetric commitments by exchanging parties.

TI The influence of pre-existing negative affect on store purchase
   intentions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study investigates the effects of two negative emotions, boredom and distress, on purchase intentions. The two emotions basically differ on their levels of arousal (low versus high). Based on notions of adaptively coping with negative emotions, it is proposed that willingness to purchase is a manifestation of a goal-directed attempt to improve one's emotional state. The results of an experiment suggested that "when bored subjects were offered the prospect of shopping in a favorable environment" they expressed higher purchase intentions; however, when offered the prospect of shopping in an uncomfortable environment, they expressed lower purchase intentions. Higher distress led to higher purchase intentions. The differences in purchase intentions between boredom and distress were interpreted by the restriction in attentional capacity induced by heightened arousal. The results also showed that (a) personal relevance accentuated boredom's influence, and (b) considering the prospect of a favorable store experience reduced levels of positive affect. implications of the theory and findings for understanding the influence of negative affect on store patronage are discussed.

TI Identifying price sensitive consumers: The relative merits of
   demographic vs. purchase pattern information
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We have very limited knowledge of the antecedents of household-level price sensitivity. In this paper we systematically examine the price sensitivities of a large number of households across multiple product categories to attempt to uncover the antecedents of price sensitivity. Using ERIM scanner panel data provided by A. C. Nielsen, we estimate the price sensitivity of each household in the panel for each of five product categories in two market areas. We test two competing structural models that link household price sensitivity to a series of demographic and shopping pattern variables. We find that the shopping pattern variables have substantially greater predictive validity in determining a household's price sensitivity. Thus, our model suggests that shopping pattern variables, commonly available to retailers through means such as scannable "loyal shopper" cards, provide retailers with better information about household-level price sensitivity than, typically much more difficult to procure, household-level demographic data.

TI Unmasking a phantom: A psychometric assessment of mystery shopping
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Because of increasing concern over whether they are really satisfying their customers, more retail and service firms are using mystery shoppers (sometimes also referred to as secret, phantom, or anonymous consumer shoppers) to monitor their frontline operations, to assess their customer service, and to benchmark their competitors' performance. But virtually nothing is known about the psychometric quality of the data collected in mystery shopping studies, and how it compares with that of customer survey data. Yet such information is necessary for organizations to know when to use mystery shopping, how to design mystery shopping studies, and what weight to place on their results. Here we use a generalizability theory approach to assess the psychometric quality of mystery shopping data. First, we design a study to compare the use of mystery shopping and a traditional customer survey when collecting data to assess the service quality of competitive stores. Second, we evaluate the psychometric performance of a set of secondary mystery shopping data collected to evaluate and benchmark the performance of branches of a retail network. Finally, in a follow-up study, we examine whether mystery shopping data collected to scale the more objective store environment are more reliable than data for service quality.

TI Changing patterns of channel governance: An example from Japan
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In Japan, the distribution system is undergoing revolutionary changes leading toward enhancing retailers' power in the channel. Theory in distribution has long taught that where retailers obtain greater power they are likely to exercise greater control and governance of the system will change. This study seeks to ascertain whether the observed structural changes taking place in Japan's distribution system will cause this pattern to emerge in this country as in western environments. To make this determination, we collected information from Japanese manufacturers and retailers about their expectations of the future locus of control in their channels. Analysis of the data found that both retailers and manufacturers expected control to shift toward the retailers. Across the ten different channel governance issues we studied, retailers forecast that they would gain greater control for all. Apparently reading reality largely in the same way, Japanese manufacturers also forecast that they would lose control, but for only six of the ten distribution activities studied. These findings indicate that despite the enormous differences historically found between western distribution systems and those in Japan channels from bath environments respond in much the same way to changes in structure and power. The tight grip that Japanese manufacturers have long held over the channel is now slowly loosening.

TI The selection and pricing of retail assortments: An empirical approach
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Determining the best assortment to carry is one of the most central problems in retailing. The key decisions are what items to stock and how to price them. In this article, we develop and rest an empirical (or nonparametric) approach that simultaneously addresses the selection and pricing problems. The approach is then applied to the problem of selecting an optimal assortment of backpacks from a field of eight available items. The empirical procedure generates data from a calibration sample of shoppers that we use to determine supposedly optimal assortments (of size k = 2, 3, 4, and 5). In a validation analysis on a new sample of shoppers, from the same parent population, it is shown that in this instance the new approach does yield significantly more profitable retail assortments, in all cases (e.g., for all assortment sizes), when compared with more traditional approaches. Additionally, the experimental approach predicts sales and profitability more accurately than traditional approaches.

In an application to florist stores we find that in-store purchase decisions are affected by the size and composition of the assortment and by the presence of a competing store, but not by ambience. We find substitution effects between powers of the same variety, but not for all varieties. Effects differ between consumption goals.

TI The effect of product assortment on buyer preferences
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Using product assortment to gain a sustainable differentiation is becoming increasingly difficult in the current retail environment and is likely to become evert more challenging as the importance of location continues to decline and the share of Internet-based retailing increases. Recent research, however, suggests that product assortment can play a key role, not only in satisfying wants, but also in influencing buyer wants and preferences. This article reviews and synthesizes empirical evidence indicating that (a) retailers can use the assortment subset that buyers consider to enhance the likelihood that a purchase will be made and to affect the specific option selected (b) the manner in which the set of considered options are presented also affects buyer preferences and purchase decisions, and, (c) the effects of the considered options and presentation format interact with other elements of the marketing mit such as sales promotions. The implications of these findings for retailers, including ethical aspects of influencing buyer preferences, are discussed.

TI Assortment overlap: Its effect on shopping patterns in a retail market
   when the distributions of prices and goods are known
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The majority of households divide their grocery shopping between two or more stores each week. This paper examines the merchandising factors affecting the sharing of customers between stores through a pairwise analysis of their assortment overlap, price differentiation, and interstore distance. Results front a study of a market of 27 stores show that assortment overlap and interstore distance are determinants of shared patronage. Results also support hypothesized relationships concerning the differentiation of assortments and price in a spatial market.

TI Consumer strategies for purchasing assortments within a single product
   class
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Different uses, users, and usage occasions for a giver,, product category give rise to the possibility of multiple preference contexts within individuals and households. Each context is assumed to have a unique preference structure, and hence the consumption utility for a given alternative will be context dependent. if the most preferred alternative in one context is not the same as the most preferred in another consumers will need to fill their "shopping baskets " with assortments of goods. In this paper we hypothesize an Assortment Valuation Model that describes how people assemble assortments within a single product class. The basic premise is that consumers evaluate varying assortments based on the anticipated, but probabilistic, consumption utilities of the items within the assortment. Using a three-phase experiment, we provide a preliminary test of the proposed model. Mie then discuss the results and introduce possible directions for future research.

TI Planning merchandising decisions to account for regional and product
   assortment differences
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The last decade has fundamentally changed the face of retailing! The genesis has been increased customer fragmentation, enabling technologies such as the internet and increased competition In this era of "hypercompetition," retailers need to have a better understanding of the performance of individual stores so they can more accurately plan their merchandise assortments and set more realistic merchandising goals. In this paper, we determine the performance of retail outlets relative to the "best practice" set of outlets and demonstrate the importance of accommodating both regional and assortment differences. We empirically assess the performance of stores from a major Fortune 500 multinational retailing chain. Multiple inputs and outputs from 59 stores in three regions were used to determine sales goals for two different product categories. The results of three alternative models suggest that incorporating both assortment and regional differences significantly affects both performance and predicted sales volume estimates. Implications and avenues for future research are discussed.

TI The role of retail promotion in determining future brand loyalty: Its
   effect on purchase event feedback
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We model and estimate the role of retail promotion in determining future brand loyalty through its effect on purchase event feedback. Purchase event feedback represents the effect of current purchases on future brand preference. Our model assesses the extent to which put-chases made under a retail promotion enhance or detract from the level of feedback, compared to nonpromotion purchases. We apply the model to two product categories and compare the effects of price versus nonprice retail promotions. We find that in-store price promotions are associated with negative purchase event feedback compared to nonpromotion purchases, whereas nonprice promotions such as features or sampling have no effect or in fact are associated with positive purchase event feedback, compared to purchases made of promotion.

TI Do franchised chains advertise enough?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Evidence from the research literature and the trade press suggests that advertising is a common source of controversy among channel partners in franchised chains. A theoretical explanation for this controversy is that investment in an asset will be less when that asset is shared. Hybrid organizational forms such as franchised chains share a brand name among the franchisor and its franchisees, so advertising that brand name is predicted to be less in a franchised chain than in a corporate chain. To test the hypothesis, this paper analyzes empirically advertising levels based upon the extent of franchising in restaurant chains and in hotel chains. Advertising falls with the level of franchising in both industries, controlling for size of chain and other variables. Implications for theory and marketing practice are discussed.

TI Reasonable access for mobility-disabled persons is more than widening
   the door
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) introduced enforced accommodations implemented by retail businesses for disabled shoppers. Despite such legislation, disability advocates and disabled shoppers report that access remains incomplete. In this article I investigate an apparent dilemma facing retailers: that architectural interpretations of the ADA do nor create the reasonable access that mobility-disabled shoppers actually desire. Despite this law, I propose that reasonable access depends heavily on a commitment by individual retailers to interpret the ADA in terms of consumer experience. Critical ethnography is used to uncover the multiple sides of this issue through the voices of retail students simulating disabilities, retail strident teams accompanying disabled students, and retail managers discussing disabilities access. Analysis of these data exposes numerous contradictions between structural compliance and desired consumer access. Based on those contradictions, a Reasonable Access Framework is proposed that potentially could assist retailers in developing a code of reasonable access based on their own professional standards. Public policy implications are also presented.

TI Marketing program planning, process benefits, and store performance: An
   initial study among small retail firms
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Despite the importance of thinking strategically when adapting to environmental change, independent retail firms often find that day-to-day operational demands inhibit their ability to participate in the marketing planning process. Further, the marketing and retailing literature provides few insights to retailers interested in better understanding how to plan most effectively. Past research has emphasized the formal aspects of planning and the empirical evidence is mired regarding the relationship between planning and performance. This study develops new measures of both marketing program planning (MPP) and the intermediate process benefits that result from planning. We then assess their impact on performance using data collected from independent computer store retailers. Results indicate 1) the planning dimension "strategic clarity" is significantly related to the process benefits "market knowledge" and "marketing program effectiveness," 2) process benefits mediate the relationship between planning and performance, and 3) process benefits are positively related to financial performance.

The implications of these differences in effects are discussed and indicate that channel managers should be aware of the kind of satisfaction they are fostering in their channel counterparts.

TI Shopping values of Russian consumers: The impact of habituation in a
   developing economy
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In this research, we report upon comparative measures of shopping value in the U.S. and Russian, Given the relatively limited shopping environments provided to Russian consumers, one would anticipate that the measures we examine would reflect much higher evaluations for U.S. shoppers. We inject doubt into that expectation through reset? to habituation theory. Habituation theory, for which a number of articles have appeared in the 1990s reflects the belief that for emotional and physiological reactions, consumer evaluations may be subject to adaptation. Consumers exposed to relatively poor conditions may nevertheless adapt and show little difference in enjoyment than those who benefit from richer conditions. Consumers, in short, adapt to their surroundings and produce measures of evaluation that reflect their interaction with the environment. Our research results find evidence of this adaptation. Shoppers in Russia report lower ratings in the utility of their shopping systems, specifically their ability to complete a shopping task. Contrarily, their reports for hedonic values, or the pleasure derived from using their shopping systems, are similar to those in the U.S. We conclude that habituation is more likely to meaningingfully affect hedonic values as compared to utilitarian. These results also suggest that the evaluation of measures of pleasure or satisfaction for consumers may need to be scrutinized carefully for evidence of the habituation effect to insure correct interpretation.

In this research, we suggest that elements of knowledge structures held by salespeople enhance their understanding of the antecedents to retail sales effectiveness. These structures also provide information that can help retail sales managers select, train and supervise salespeople more efficiently. For better salespeople, such knowledge structures contain useful insights about customers and how to respond to their needs effectively. We examine retail salespeople's knowledge structures and find strong relationships between the complexity of knowledge structures of salespeople and their performance.

TI Dynamic cooperative advertising in a channel
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The paper studies a two-member channel in which a manufacturer and an exclusive retailer can make advertising expenditures that have both short and long term impacts on the retailer's sales. The manufacturer can also support both retailer's advertising efforts through a cooperative advertising program. Four scenarios are considered III the first, which acts as a benchmark, the manufacturer provides no support to the retailer's advertising. In the second, the manufacturer supports both types of retailer advertising. In the two remaining cases, the manufacturer supports only one of the two types of retailer advertising efforts. II I all cases we assume that the manufacturer wishes to coordinate the channel so as to obtain maximal profits for himself: Our analysis of these options skews that supporting both types of retailer advertising provides more profit to both channel members than any of the two cases of partial support. The latter is, however, better than no support. We derive managerial implications from the theoretical results.

TI Unit prices on retail shelf labels: An assessment of information
   prominence
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Although unit prices have been provided to consumers for nearly 30 years, the format in which this information is presented has been largely ignored. An examination of major grocery retailers found considerable differences in how prominently unit prices are presented to shoppers on shelf labels. Two methodological approaches are then used to examine the prominence of unit prices in a grocery-shopping context. The results of a field study support expectations that, among consumers who are relatively low in price consciousness, the prominence of unit price information has a positive effect on awareness and usage of such information. In a second study, a controlled experiment shows that increasing the prominence of unit price information affects consumers' shopping behaviors by shifting purchases toward low:er unit priced items and ultimately reducing grocery expenditures. Suggestions for future research and implications for retailers and policymakers are discussed.

TI Multi-unit retail site selection processes: Incorporating opening delays
   and unidentified competition
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Multiunit site selection models have long ignored the impact of rime delays in store openings. To determine the effect of this limitation and to identify a solution, Mie compare three multiunit site selection procedures. The first is a sequential procedure that selects sires and then opens them one at a rime. The second is a global approach that selects all future sites in a single decision process. Third, is a proposed anticipated-delay procedure that incorporates opening delays, Jinn planning horizons and discount rates in determining appropriate sites for multiunit retail systems. I We further compare the results of these site-selection procedures to similar procedures that incorporate leakage to unidentified competitors when seeking locations for new, outlets. We make the comparisons based upon discounted revenues by using a two-part, game-like simulation. The simulation estimates revenue results under the various alternatives while allowing for reactive and preemptive competitive store openings. Our results indicate that the anticipated-delay procedure incorporating leakage produces a significantly better revenue stream than either the standard sequential or global approach procedures.

TI Consumer-level factors moderating the success of private label brands
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We examine how different determinants of perceived risk help explain variations in purchasing preferences for national brands versus private label (store) brands (PLBs), across twelve different product categories. Such intercategory differences are the most important source of variation in PLB share across markets, retailers and categories (Dhar and Hoch, 1997), bur little prior consumer-level research has thus far tried to explain these crucial variations. Supporting theory-based expectations, we find that PLB purchases in a category increase when consumers perceive reduced consequences of making a mistake in brand choice in that category, and when that category has more "search" than "experience" characteristics. Theoretical and managerial implications of these results are discussed, especially the important role played by "experience" attributes in lending consumers to favor national brands over PLBs.

The magnitude of these losses depends art specific consumer reactions, which have been found to vary with product, consumer, and situation factors. This paper presents a conceptual frame work that integrates the major determinants of consumer reactions to stock-outs. The theoretical relationships provide explanations for the marked differences in stock-out effects observed in previous studies. Moreover, the framework can be empirically implemented, allowing retailers and manufacturers to determine how much each factor contributes to stock-out losses. We collect survey data to provide evidence on the relevance of the framework and the direction and importance of the effect of different consumer behaviors.

TI Insights into cross- and within-store price search: Retailer estimates
   vs. consumer self-reports
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Past research of the accuracy of retail grocers' beliefs about consumer search and patronage behavior has found that executives tend to overestimate the size of the consumer segment that regularly switches stores for price specials. With surveys of consumers and executives in a large midwestern market, we extend and replicate the earlier research. In this study, we find that executives demonstrate, on average, an accurate sense of the proportion of consumers who are primarily loyal to one store or are shoppers of multiple stores. However, they still tend to overestimate aggregate price comparison behavior and cross-store shopping. At the same time, we also find that managers simultaneously underestimate consumer newspaper readership, in-store search for specials, and stockpiling. This new result suggests that the more loyal primary customers may account for a greater proportion of incremental promotional sales than has been recognized in the past. These results suggest a significant increase in the information value to be derived from the desegregation of sales data by shopper loyalty status.

TI Switching barriers and repurchase intentions in services

AB The current study moves beyond satisfaction and proposes that switching barriers are important factors impacting a customer's decision to remain with a service provider. Switching barriers make customer defection difficult or costly and include interpersonal relationships, perceived switching costs, and the attractiveness of alternatives. We propose and find support for a contingency model between core-service satisfaction and switching barriers. The results indicate that the influence of core-service satisfaction on repurchase intentions decreases under conditions of high switching barriers. Although switching barriers had no influence on repurchase intentions when satisfaction was high, switching barriers positively influenced repurchase intentions when satisfaction was low. Implications of the results are discussed.

TI Ensuring greater satisfaction by engineering salesperson response to
   customer emotions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In this research, we develop and empirically investigate a framework to help retail managers engineer effective salesperson response to customer emotions and ensure greater satisfaction. Building on an interpersonal view of emotions, we argue that managers must be familiar with (1) diagnostic cues for assessing emotion-soliciting contexts and how customers generally display these emotions; (2) the normative salesperson responses that customers expect to their different emotions; (3) and the naturally occuring responses from the salesperson as observed by the customers. We report upon an emotional study that tested these arguments for the two negative (anxiety, anger) and two positive (joy, delight) emotions in the context of one of two retail stores (clothing or electronic goods). We find that observed salesperson response that positively disconfirms customers' normative expectations will lead to greater customer satisfaction, across positive and negative emotions. Based on the results, we believe that detailed planning of these more interpersonal aspects of a retail strategy may be as critical to customer satisfaction and repeat purchase as the planning of store layout and merchandise.

TI e-satisfaction: An initial examination
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB As more e-retailers promise their customers that online experiences will be satisfying ones, understanding what creates a satisfying customer experience becomes crucial. Even though this understanding appears crucial, no studies have examined the factors that make consumers satisfied with their e-retailing experiences. To partly fill this void, the authors examine the role that consumer perceptions of online convenience, merchandising (product offerings and product information), site design, and financial security play in e-satisfaction assessments. They find that convenience, site design, and financial security are the dominant factors in consumer assessments of e-satisfaction. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and offer directions for future research.

TI Consumer store choice dynamics: An analysis of the competitive market
   structure for grocery stores
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study aims at formulating and testing a model of store choice dynamics to measure the effects of consumer characteristics on consumer grocery store choice and switching behavior. A dynamic hazard model is estimated to obtain an understanding of the components influencing consumer purchase timing, store choice, and the competitive dynamics of retail competition. The hazard model is combined with an internal market structure analysis using a generalized factor analytic structure. We estimate a latent structure that is both store and store chain specific. This allows us to study store competition at the store chain level such as competition based on price such as EDLP versus a Hi-Lo pricing strategy and competition specific to a store due to differences in location.

TI The moderating role of target-arousal on the impact of affect on
   satisfaction - An examination in the context of service experiences
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on the emotional role of satisfaction in the consumption of services. In this study, a new moderating variable called "target-arousal level" was introduced to advance our understanding of the role of pleasure and arousal in the satisfaction evaluation process. The results from our experimental study indicate that the traditional pleasure-arousal interaction effect (e.g., Mehrabian and Russell, 1974) might be limited to high target arousal situations. Optimal arousal theories (e.g., Berlyne, 1960), on the other hand, might offer a fruitful framework for the satisfaction-arousal link in low target arousal environments.

TI Analysis of cross category dependence in market basket selection
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Market basket choice is a decision process in which a consumer selects items from a number of product categories on the same shopping trip. The key feature of market basket choice is the interdependence in demand relationships across the items in the final basket. This research develops a new approach to the specification of market basket models that allows a choice model for a basket of goods to be constructed using a set of "local" conditional choice models corresponding to each item in the basket. The approach yields a parsimonious market basket model that allows for any type of demand relationship across product categories (complementarity, independence, or substitution) and can be estimated using simple modifications of standard multinomial logit software. We analyze the choice of four grocery store categories that exhibit common cross-category brand names for both national brands and private labels. Results indicate that cross-category price elasticities are small. We argue that store traffic patterns may be more important than consumer-level demand interdependence in forecasting market basket choice.

TI Charitable programs and the retailer: Do they mix?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB As cause marketing promotions become more prevalent, retailers must develop an increasing understanding of how consumers evaluate such offers. Using attribution theory and the gift-giving literature, we derive four predictions about conditions that may lead cause-marketing efforts to be evaluated more positively. The conditions are donation situation (disaster vs. ongoing cause), congruency of donations with the firm's core business, effort exerted by the firm, and commitment of the firm to the cause.
   We employed an experiment to test our expectations across two retail contexts: grocery and building supply stores. Across both stores, respondent evaluations were more positive for disaster-related as compared to ongoing causes, and for donations involving greater effort (i.e., product rather than cash contributions). There were no differences in evaluations related to the firm's degree of commitment (i.e., the retailer matching vs. not matching consumers' donations). This was surprising because the greater commitment condition doubled the contribution to the cause.
   Differences between stores were found for congruency of the donated product with the retailer's core business. For grocery stores, there was no difference; however for the building supply store, consumers rated the incongruent product donation (i.e., food and cleaning supplies) more positively than the congruent donation (i.e., building supplies).

TI A decision support system for Vendor Managed Inventory
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Recently, vendors and retailers have begun to forge cooperative agreements to manage inventory, which requires sharing demand information and setting mutually agreed upon performance targets for the supply chain. This paper describes the market forecasting and inventory management components of a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) decision support system and how this system was implemented by a major apparel manufacturer and over 30 of its retail partners. The DSS also helped the vendor and retailers arrive at jointly agreed upon customer service level and inventory turnover targets. As a result of implementing this VMI system, customer service levels improved dramatically, often coupled with a significant improvement in inventory turnover The VMI performance results relative to the existing system and related insights for supply chain coordination are discussed.

TI The effectiveness of automatic inventory replenishment in supply chain
   operations: Antecedents and outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The issue of buyer-seller relationships in supply-chain management research is becoming increasingly critical. Global competition and maturing domestic markets have driven supply-chain members to reassess their distribution techniques to remain competitive in the market. Finns need inventory replenishment systems that enhance customer service whereas at the same time reduce inventory costs. Many retailers are demanding time-phased replenishment. They want delivery made just as they need the stock for sale. High levels of anticipatory inventory are no longer acceptable. Retailers want high-volume, high-rum items delivered on a just-in-time basis. In this study, we investigate the use of automatic replenishment programs (ARPs) and the effectiveness of these ARPs in today's markets. Through a survey of U.S. retailers and manufacturers, we examine the transaction specific, strategic, and organizational antecedents that drive automatic replenishment efforts, as well as the effects of these efforts on the firms' strategic and economic performance.

TI Determinants and outcomes of plan objectivity and implementation in
   category management relationships
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Category management holds great potential, but has several inherent barriers that can impede category performance. This study examines factors thought to impact category performance because of the critical role category management plays at the end of the supply chain in Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) relationships between ma,manufacturers and grocery retailers. Two central factors, category plan objective and implementation of the plans, as well as five factors antecedent to objectivity and implementation, were identified through a qualitative study of retailer and supplier category managers. The interrelationships of these factors were tested in an empirical study of 128 supplier category managers.
   As a direct effect on performance, implementation of category plans had a stronger impact on category performance than did the objectivity of the plans. The retailer's trust in the category management process was found to be a critical component on the implementation of category plans. Preplanning agreement between the retailer and the supplier was found to impart both objectivity and implementation. The internal conflict between supplier's brand management and sales/category managers had only a minor impact on objectivity, and that effect was mediated by the supplier's overall opportunism. Several theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

TI Is channel coordination all it is cracked up to be?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A fundamental task for supply-chain managers is to determine wholesale-prices. Such determination is a core theme in the marketing science literature on distribution channels-which seems to have concluded that channel coordination-setting wholesale-prices to maximize total channel profit-represents the best of all possible objectives, This judgment is based on analyses of bilateral monopoly models, within which profit may be redistributed to the benefit of all channel members. However, many manufacturers deal with multiple, competing retailers. The pure logic of bilateral monopoly models holds in the presence of multiple retailers if and only if the manufacturer can price discriminate between retailers. Although mechanisms for price discrimination exist, in many situations they are infeasible, illegal, or both.
   When retailers compete there are two feasible and legally permissible methods of achieving channel coordination: an explicit quantity-discount schedule or a menu of two-part tariffs. (The latter is derived in detail in this paper.) A feasible and legally permissible alternative to channel coordination is for the manufacturer to utilize a sophisticated Stackelberg two-part tariff-itself a form of a quantity-discount schedule. Although such a tariff cannot coordinate the channel, it is the best of all possible two-part tariffs from the viewpoint of maximizing manufacturer profit.
   Because manufacturers are ultimately interested in their own profitability, it follows that channel coordination is manufacturer-optimal only if it generates at least as great a level of profit for the manufacturer as does noncoordination. In this paper we determine the conditions under which a channel-coordinating wholesale-price strategy will manufacturer-profit dominate a sophisticated Stackelberg two-part tariff: We show that the optimal policy is dependent on (1) the retailers' fixed costs, (2) the relative size of the retailers, and (3) the degree of inter-retailer competition. We conclude that, from the perspective of a manufacturer, channel coordination is often undesirable relative to utilizing a noncoordinating, sophisticated Stackelberg price-strategy. Therefore, channel coordination can no longer be regarded as the ultimate goal which supply-chain managers should uncritically pursue.

TI Retail product-line pricing strategy when costs and products change
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Rapid changes in technology can have a sudden and differential impact on cost components of variants within product lines such as computers, printers, digital cameras and cellular phones. How should retailers react to such changes? We address this issue by answering three questions. First, when the costs of specific product components change (perhaps, precipitously), how should retailers adapt their prices in the affected product lines? Second, what will be the impact on profit margins, the range of prices and average price of the line? Finally, if a product variant is either added or removed from the line, how should the retailer adjust the other prices in the line? Our analysis reveals that the nature of interaction between the variants of the product line plays a central role in determining the appropriate retailer response to cost shocks. We also provide empirical support for our analysis. (C) 2001 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI Can culture affect prices? A cross-cultural study of shopping and retail
   prices
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study examines whether there are differences in consumers' shopping behavior and product prices in grocery stores due to cultural orientation. The study uses a field setting in Southern California, comparing samples of American and Chinese culture on two occasions, each five years apart. Theory suggests that price sensitivity and the importance of the status of buyers differ substantially between Chinese and American cultures. Consistent with these differences. the study finds that these two cultural groups have dramatically different shopping practices. Chinese use multiple senses when examining unpackaged food, and do so far more than American shoppers. They also inspect many more items and take much more time to shop.
   The differences in shopping behavior correspond to clear differences in prices between grocery stores serving the two cultural groups, Chinese supermarkets have substantially lower prices across a range of food products than mainstream American supermarkets. These differences ranged from 37% for packaged goods of the same brand and size to more than 100% for meats and seafood of the same type and description. These differences are similar across a span of five years, We argue that differences in culture provide the most likely explanation for the differences in prices between the two types of super markets.

TI Do models of vertical strategic interaction for national and store
   brands meet the market test?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This article develops a methodology for empirically examining some of the central assumptions commonly used in the theoretical literature on vertical strategic interaction. This methodology is used to test these assumptions by using data for six individual categories across 59 local markets in 1991 and 1992, focusing on the vertical and horizontal interaction between private label and national brands. There are three central findings. First, the vertical strategic interaction observed for national brands varies considerably across categories (a single form of interaction, "Vertical Nash," tends to be more common for private label brands). Second, we generally reject the use of proportional mark-up behavior by retailers. Third, we reject linear demands in a favor of a more flexible nonlinear form. These results suggest that models specifying proportional mark-up behavior and linear demands do not accurately reflect market reality. Further, because vertical strategic interaction between manufacturers and retailers seems to be idiosyncratic to the category and brand, future research should consider multiple forms of vertical interaction to produce reasonably general results.

We then demonstrate how actual male shopping behavior belies these stereotypes. For example, men often evaluate alternatives, bargain, and even shop in "feminine" stores. Our theory of male shopping behavior is rooted in studies of gender roles in the United States. We argue that men who shop have achieved gender role transcendence, and have found ways to satisfy an ethic of achievement in the marketplace. (C) 2001 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI Coupon response in services
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB To date, most marketing research has focused primarily on the use of coupons for the promotion of packaged goods. Coupons are widely used in service establishments, even though little is known about a coupon's impact on consumer behavior. Through the use of a field experiment, this study examined coupon redemption, purchase timing, and repeat purchase for 984 subjects. Consumer purchase histories and coupon response data were gathered via identification cards and electronic cash register reports. Results of the study show, as with packaged goods, prior purchase frequency is a significant predictor of coupon redemption. Coupon redeemers were almost seven and a half times more likely to make a repeat purchase during the postpromotion period compared to nonredeemers and subsequent purchase timing was not influenced by coupon redemption. As it relates to redemption, consumers' behavioral response to coupons in the test establishment appeared to be similar to those found in some packaged goods studies, but different as it relates to purchase timing and repeat purchase probability.

TI Effective category management depends on the role of the category
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Assessing a retailer's performance in a category is important to both manufacturers and retailers. Based on data from 19 food categories sold in 106 major supermarket chains operating in the largest 50 retail markets in the U,S,, the work reported in this article uses an analysis of variations in category performance across retailers to infer the key drivers of effective category management and how those drivers depend on the role the category plays in the overall retail portfolio. Not surprisingly, the best performing retailers: (a) offer broader assortments, (b) have strong private label programs, (c) charge significantly lower everyday prices, and (d) use feature advertising to drive store traffic and display to increase in-store purchases. More interestingly, we find systematic differences in the impact of the price, promotion and assortment variables that depend importantly on the role (staple, variety enhancers, niche, or fill-in) that the particular category plays in the store's overall portfolio.

TI The stability of retail shopping choices over time and across countries
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The aggressive, geographic market expansion of successful retail organizations, the development of a global consumer market and the spatial diffusion of retail innovations led us to investigate the extent to which models helping managers to make strategic decisions can be generalized across time and place. To the extent that such generalization can occur, it would reduce the redundancy of research and associated costs for making decisions in major retail organizations. This article makes use of relatively recent developments in random utility theory to assess the stability over time and space of the preferences underlying retail-shopping choice. Data collected three times over four years in Canada are used to compare models of shopping center choice based on perceived center attributes, We hypothesize that random component variance differences are the likely source of observed differences in retailing preferences, Two waves of panel data for supermarket choice are used to assess our ability to generalize to another choice process. Data for shopping center choice collected in Canada, U,S,A., and Norway are used to assess spatial stability. The test results support the hypothesis for the spatial consistency of preferences. The test of stability over time shows no difference at all in retailing preferences, both the random component variances and the coefficients were unchanged over the four-year period studied.

TI Consumer perceived value: The development of a multiple item scale
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Value creation is widely discussed in the practitioner literature and is often a part of organizations' mission statements and objectives. It is seen by many commentators as the key to long-term success, with Albrecht (1992, p 7) arguing that "the only thing that matters in the new world of quality is delivering customer value." Despite this emphasis, little research has addressed the value construct itself and there is no well-accepted value measure, even in the retail environment in which customers evaluate products before purchase.
   The present research project describes the development of a 19-item measure, PERVAL, that can be used to assess customers' perceptions of the value of a consumer durable good at a brand level. The measure was developed for use in a retail purchase situation to determine what consumption values drive purchase attitude and behavior. Four distinct, value dimensions emerged that were termed emotional, social, quality/performance and price/value for money. The reliability and validity of the scale was assessed in a prepurchase situation, using exploratory and confirmatory analyses. All four value dimensions were found to help significantly in explaining attitudes and behavior. The scale was also tested in a postpurchase situation and found to be both reliable and valid in this context as well. The PERVAL scale has a variety of potential applications and can serve as a framework for further empirical research in this important area. (C) 2001 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI The transfer of retail formats into developing economies: The example of
   China
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The focus of this research is the strategy of international format transfer by retailers into developing countries. Transfer strategies are defined in terms of a format change pattern and the factors motivating the format change decision. Earlier studies and anecdotal evidence have indicated that retailers have pursued different format transfer policies. Some retailers transfer their total format unchanged while others introduce extensive changes. The research intent is to ascertain the set of determinants that control the extent of change to be employed. As basis for this evaluation, I interviewed executives from twenty-seven different foreign retailers with respect to their entrance into Chinese home marl;et. These retailers emanated from a variety of other countries and operated a range different retail formats such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, specialty stores, department stores, wholesale-clubs and shopping centers in China. The analysis of these data revealed the existence of six distinct transfer strategies. Basic conditions affecting the extent of transfer change were found to relate to differences in economic conditions between China and the home countries and the market segments that were targeted in China.

AB Institutional semiotics revealed a myriad of meanings in a Wal-Mart advertising flyer. Beyond a promise of deep savings on a wide assortment of merchandise, the text and illustrations in the flyer reflect a rich blend of family, community and national norms. This environmental isomorphism simulates a subtly utopian, nostalgic hometown, a place rich in American mythology where citizens achieve a balance between economic and moral pursuits. In this context, the world's largest retailer is experienced as the neighborly, small town shopkeeper, thereby legitimating itself among its consumer constituency. (C) 2001 by New York University.

TI Congruency of scent and music as a driver of in-store evaluations and
   behavior
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailers have long understood the importance of store environment in enhancing the shopping experience, and past research has examined the main effects of many pleasant ambient stimuli such as music and scent. To further our theoretical understanding, we extend the notion of Gestalt to consumers' perceptions of retail environments and demonstrated that consumers perceive Services-capes holistically. Specifically, we suggest that the arousing quality of ambient stimuli is one dimension along which holistic evaluations occur, and that pleasant ambient stimuli are perceived more positively when their arousing qualities match rather than mismatch.
   We manipulated scent and music in a 3 (no music, pleasant low arousal and high arousal music) by 3 (no scent, pleasant low and high arousal scents) factorial design in a field setting. Our findings show that when ambient scent and music are congruent with each other in terms of their arousing qualities, consumers rate the environment significantly more positive, exhibit higher levels of approach and impulse buying behaviors, and experience enhanced satisfaction than when these environmental cues were at odds with each other.

TI The retail power-performance conundrum: What have we learned?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The conventional wisdom that retailers have grown more powerful relative to packaged goods manufacturers in the packaged goods industry has not been supported by empirical analyses of the relative profitability of retailers and manufacturers. This is despite increases in trade and consumer promotion, and the prevalence of store brands, all of which were viewed as indicators of growing retail power. In recent years, researchers have developed a much better understanding of the role that these purported "indicators" play in manufacturer-retailer interaction. The objective of this article is to synthesize what this new research teaches us about the impact of promotions and store brands on the relative performance of manufacturers and retailers. It concludes that promotions are just as beneficial for manufacturers as for retailers, if not more so. Store brands do provide leverage to retailers and allow them to improve margins., but a competitive national brand assortment is still necessary for retail profitability. This helps explain why manufacturer profitability has not worsened relative to retailers even as trade and consumer promotion spending have grown and store brands have become strong in many product categories.

TI Will the growth of multi-channel retailing diminish the pricing
   efficiency of the web?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In this study, we compare the pricing behavior between online branches of traditional retailers and pure Internet retailers. We seek to determine whether the pricing policies of these two types of online organizations differ, possibly because of the different competitive environments in which each operates. While both offer product over the Internet, traditional retailers must also taken into consideration the impact that such offers will have upon the business that they transact in their land-based stores. We anticipate that the constraint of a land-based store will cause such dual-channel operators to charge higher prices than Internet operators not so constrained. Focusing on standardized DVD brands, we gather a data set with of 4896 observations; we find that prices by pure Internet retailers are significantly lower than prices by online multichannel retailers by an average of $3.27 or 14%. The evidence also shows that the price dispersion is sharply lower among the pure Internet retailers than that among the multichannel retailers online. Price changes by both types are few, but adjustment magnitudes are large. This reveals that both types of online retailers do not change their prices frequently despite the claim that menu cost might be negligible for the online market. The evidence suggests that domination of multichannel retailing format may diminish the pricing efficiency of the Web. (C) 2001 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI New product introductions, slotting allowances, and retailer discretion
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailers are increasingly demanding slotting allowances for new product introductions. We study two methods of determining the magnitude of such allowances: In the first, the retailer sets the allowance on a "brand-by-brand" basis. In the second, all introductions are asked the same "uniform" allowance. Using a mathematical model, we address the question "which is the preferred method?" This analysis reveals an important tradeoff. While the brand-by-brand method lets the retailer benefit from any successful introduction, the uniform method lets the retailer demand higher allowances. We identify the conditions favoring the use of these methods. (C) 2001 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI The impact of satisfaction and payment equity on cross-buying: A dynamic

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In the last decade, marketers have primarily focused on keeping customers. Only recently have they become aware that creating value by cross-selling additional services is also an important aspect of customer relationship management. In this article we investigate how satisfaction and payment equity, defined as the perceived fairness of the price, affect cross-buying at a multiservice provider. We also consider its competitors' performance on these factors. Our results show that the effect of satisfaction differs between customers with lengthy and short relationships. It also shows that payment equity negatively affects cross-buying for customers with long relationships, However, if the prices of the supplier are perceived as fairer than the prices of the competitor, the customers' probability of cross-buying increases.

TI Retailer power and supplier welfare: The case of Wal-Mart
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Whether retailers have become more powerful than manufacturers in recent years continues to be a burning question in the trade press and academic literature. Our research adds fresh fuel to the fire by looking at whether Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the United States, has exerted power over its suppliers and squeezed them financially. Previous academic research on retailer power has looked largely at food stores, but we extend this perspective into nonfoods by using Compustat data as a source. Our analysis of these data indicates that the answer may be more complex than a simple yes or no. We find that Wal-Mart suppliers holding a small share of their respective markets do not perform relatively as well financially when they have Wal-Mart as one of their primary customers. However, large-share suppliers to Wal-Mart perform better than their large-share counterparts reporting retailers other than Wal-Mart as their primary customers. This indicates that suppliers who seek Wal-Mart's wide market reach may derive benefits from using this association if it can be used to strengthen their market positions. Those that fail in this goal, however, may find their profits squeezed and do better by shifting their retail channel focus elsewhere. (C) 2001 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI An online prepurchase intentions model: The role of intention to search
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In this study, an Online Prepurchase Intentions Model is proposed and empirically tested in the context of search goods. The focus of this research is to determine whether intent to search the Internet for product information is a key element for marketing researchers to employ in predicting consumers' Internet purchasing intentions. Data were collected through a mail survey to computer users who resided in 1.5 U.S. metropolitan areas. Two-stage structural equation modeling was employed to test hypotheses. The results show that intention to use the Internet to search for information was not only the strongest predictor of Internet purchase intention but also mediated relationships between purchasing intention and other predictors (i.e., attitude toward Internet shopping, perceived behavioral control, and previous Internet purchase experience). Direct and indirect relationships between two antecedents (attitude toward Internet shopping and previous Internet purchase experience) and Internet purchase intention were also found. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2001 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI Consumer price sensitivity and price thresholds
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We examine consumers' price sensitivity using a new approach that incorporates probabilistic thresholds for price gains and price losses in the reference price models. We model the threshold as a function of company, competitor and consumer specific factors. Model application to scanner panel data for coffee shows that our model is superior in fit compared to ordinary logit and two existing reference price models. Our results indicate that higher own-price volatility makes consumers more sensitive to gains and less sensitive to losses, while intense price promotion by competing brands makes consumers more sensitive to losses but does not influence consumers' sensitivity to gains. Two clear segments that differ in the size of their thresholds emerge. Managerial implications of these results for segmentation and understanding brand power are discussed.

When the wholesale relationship comprises only a per-unit price that exceeds the manufacturing cost, the retailer's inventory strategy will not properly reflect the channel's overstock and understock costs. A number of researchers have advocated manufacturer return policies to remedy this misalignment of incentives, but none explain the reality that "markdown money" is sometimes paid to retailers expressly to avoid product returns. We formulate a model that distinguishes between these practices, and determine conditions under which each will be more desirable with respect to channel coordination and individual firm performance.

TI Hedonic and utilitarian motivations for online retail shopping behavior
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Motivations to engage in retail shopping include both utilitarian and hedonic dimensions. Business to consumer e-commerce conducted via the mechanism of web-shopping provides an expanded opportunity for companies to create a cognitively and esthetically rich shopping environment in ways not readily imitable in the nonelectronic shopping world. In this article an attitudinal model is developed and empirically tested integrating constructs from technology acceptance research and constructs derived from models of web behavior. Results of two studies from two distinct categories of the interactive shopping environment support the differential importance of immersive, hedonic aspects of the new media as well as the more traditional utilitarian motivations. In addition, navigation, convenience, and the substitutability of the electronic environment to personally examining products were found to be important predictors of online shopping attitudes. Results are discussed in terms of insights for the creation of the online shopping webmosphere through more effective design of interactive retail shopping environments.

Economic analysis and empirical examination yield two different predictions about how these payments should relate to one another. In this study using system level data, we find a positive relationship between the initial franchise fee and royalty rate when controlling for average outlet sales. This is consistent with the argument that the initial franchise fee is not a vehicle for extracting the surplus downstream rents left after royalty payments.

TI The manufacturer-retailer-consumer triad: Differing perceptions
   regarding price promotions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The effectiveness of any promotional strategy depends, in part, on how accurately channel members predict consumers' perceptions of their promotional activity. However, empirical research on channel member predictions and their accuracy is virtually nonexistent. In this article we examine manufacturer and retailer beliefs about consumers' (and each others') perceptions of sales promotions and assess the accuracy of these predictions. Our findings indicate that manufacturers and retailers hold similar, but equally inaccurate views of consumers' industry knowledge. When assessing consumers' specific beliefs about different types of promotions, these channel members underestimate consumer knowledge. Their motivational knowledge, however, appears quite accurate -whether predicting consumer or other channel member perceptions of motivations. The similarity of supplier and retailer knowledge bodes well for channel efficiency, yet limitations in their understanding of consumer knowledge about promotions may lead to weakness in channel marketing strategies.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The flagship brand store is an increasingly popular venue used by marketers to build relationships with consumers. As we move further into an experience economy in the new millennium, retailers are refining the flagship brand store into new forms such as the themed retail brand store. This new form not only promotes a more engaging experience of the brand's essence but also satisfies consumers looking for entertainment alongside their shopping. In this article, we conceptualize and explore themed flagship brand stores in terms of the mythological appeal of the narratives conveyed by their physical and symbolic structure. We utilize a field study of ESPN Zone Chicago to examine these features in a sports-themed retail brand store. Finally, we offer some projections, based on our research, of the possible transformations of the flagship brand store as the new century unfolds. We conclude that mindscape-related themes, which combine entertainment, therapeutics, and spiritual growth, are at the frontier of retail theming. (C) 2002 by New York University.

TI Cross-category effects of induced arousal and pleasure on the Internet
   shopping experience
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Online retailers are likely to try to influence consumers' shopping behavior through atmospherics and service, just as physical stores do. The impact of online atmospherics can be measured by the degree of stimulation and pleasure that is provided by a website. It is suggested that the characteristics of products and websites that are encountered early in online browsing can significantly influence the level of arousal and pleasure that consumers experience, and thereby can influence their later shopping behavior. Two experiments show that if the initial experiences encountered in a simulated Internet shopping trip are higher in pleasure, then there is a positive impact on approach behaviors and subjects engage in more arousing activities (e.g., more exploration, more tendencies to examine novel products and stores, higher response to promotional incentives). Further, if higher stimulation or information load is provided by the initial Internet experience, then consumers subsequently tend to engage in less arousing activities.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The authors introduce cognitive continuum theory (CCT) as a theoretical framework to examine the effect of consumer shopping tasks and retail information display properties on consumer perceptions of experiential value. In this empirical investigation, the nature of a consumer's shopping task is found to exert a direct influence on consumer perceptions of efficiency, economic value, and shopping enjoyment, all active dimensions of value. In addition, congruent interactions between shopping task and retail information display properties exert an enhancing effect on the reactive dimensions of value, as evidenced by perceptions of visual appeal, entertainment value, and service excellence. Future application of CCT is outlined and managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2002 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI Convergence and divergence in consumer behavior: implications for
   international retailing
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Converging technology and disappearing income differences across countries will not lead to homogenization of consumer behavior. Rather, consumer behavior will become more heterogeneous because of cultural differences. As consumer incomes converge across countries, the manifestation of value differences will become stronger. This phenomenon makes it increasingly important to understand values of national cultures and their impact on consumer behavior. Retailing strategies for one country cannot be extended to other countries without adaptation. Hofstede's model of national culture is applied to understand differences in consumer behavior across countries. Examples are provided of consumption differences, their relationships with culture discussed, and selected implications for international retailing management detailed.

TI Retailing as a career: A comparative study of marketers
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This note reports how positions in retailing-particularly store-based positions-compare with other marketing-related positions. While much of the past literature concerning work experiences in retail settings is primarily perceptual and anecdotal, the results of this nationwide study are based on an examination of actual workplace experiences in marketing-related positions. The findings suggest that workplace experiences in corporate retailing are positive and equivalent to other marketing-related careers. However, workplace experiences in retail store management are less satisfying. The retail store managers studied were paid less, experienced less variety and autonomy on the job, felt less satisfied and committed to their work, and had greater turnover intentions compared to the other marketing managers studied. Managerial implications and recommendations are presented. (C) 2002 by New York University. All rights reserved.

AB Experts expect great retailing changes in the next ten years. What do consumers expect? With increasing innovation in retail technology and the large-scale implementation of e-commerce formats, shifts in consumer behavior can be categorized as social change. Sociologists have long studied the interaction of social change and technology, focusing on society members' characteristics to help predict the future. One characteristic of enduring influence is age. In this research note, we consider consumer expectations regarding the evolution of retailing, with an emphasis on expectations of social change and the variance of such expectations by age cohort.

TI Antecedents of private label attitude and national brand promotion
   attitude: similarities and differences
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A model that addresses the similarities and differences in conceptual antecedents of attitudes toward private label grocery products and national brand promotions is proposed and tested. The proposed model is tested using a sample of 300 consumers who were recruited from grocery stores, provided behavioral data from sales receipts of their shopping trip, and responded to a survey that contained multi-item construct measures. We predict and find in the study that both price and nonprice related constructs impact both private label attitude and national brand promotion attitude, but the directionality and strength of several of these relationships differ. Implications of these findings for retailers and national manufacturers are discussed. (C) 2002 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI A meta-analysis of the impact of price presentation on perceived savings
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Pricing is one of the most crucial determinants of sales. Besides the actual price, how the price offering is presented to consumers also affects consumer evaluation of the product offering. Many studies focus on "price framing," i.e., how the offer is communicated to the consumer -is the offered price given along with a reference price, is the reference price plausible, is a price deal communicated in dollar or percentage terms. Other studies focus on "situational effects," e.g., is the evaluation for a national brand or a private brand, is it within a discount store or a specialty store. In this article, a meta-analysis of 20 published articles in marketing examines the effects of price frames and situations on perceived savings. The results reveal many features that significantly influence perceived savings. For instance, while both the percent of deal and the amount of deal positively influence perceived deal savings, deal percent has more impact. Further, the presence of a regular price as an external reference price enhances the offer value of large plausible deal and implausible deals, but not of small plausible deals. Thus, high value deals should announce the regular price, but not low value deals. Overall, the results have several useful insights for designing promotions. (C) 2002 by New York University.

TI The relationship between purchase regularity and propensity to
   accelerate
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Identifying random and regular-buying household segments and relating them to demographic and shopping characteristics has been the focus of many marketing studies. Missing from the marketing literature, however, is a study that relates purchase regularity to marketing mix sensitivities. Such study could provide substantive implications since it would explore a practical dimension of a segmentation scheme based on purchase regularity. In this article, we investigate the relationship between purchase regularity and propensity to accelerate through the use of a mixture Weibull model of purchase timing. Applying this perspective to purchase timing data on four product categories (ketchup, sugar, bathroom tissue, margarine), we show that in the frequently purchased categories of bathroom tissue and margarine, random buyers do not exhibit any propensity to accelerate while regular buyers do. In the occasionally purchased categories of ketchup and sugar on the other hand, random buyers exhibit at least as much propensity to accelerate their purchases as regular buyers do. Our rationale for these results is based on information-theoretic arguments suggesting that propensity to accelerate depends on the frequency at which a product category is purchased.

TI Risk sensitivity in distribution channel partnerships: implications for
   manufacturer return policies
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The manufacturer return policy is widely regarded as a means for channel partners to share risk. However, existing studies of this popular institutional practice use frameworks that assume risk-neutrality of all parties. This report analyzes how sensitivity to risk affects both sides of the manufacturer-retailer relationship under various scenarios of strategic power, and how these dynamics are altered by a return policy. A key finding is that the penalty for ignoring risk sensitivity can be substantial. This will suggest an informational motive affecting the use of return policies, a consequence of the potential difficulty of inferring another party's risk sensitivity and the positive incentive for deception.

The results of a disguised, laboratory experiment are used to suggest that customers respond to unethical cues in the environment through lower ethical assessments and satisfaction ratings, but that ethical cues may not necessarily increase satisfaction scores when compared to a neutral situation. The implications suggest that ethical cues and an honest service provider may be the expected norm, and thus will lead to (or maintain) satisfaction with the service encounter, while unethical cues will create dissatisfaction.

TI Effects of shopping information on consumers' responses to comparative
   price claims
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This article describes three studies that examine the effects of shopping information on consumers' responses to comparative price claims in retail advertisements. Results of the studies show that 1) the opportunity to shop across retail stores reduces the effect of comparative price claims on consumers' estimates of lowest price for a particular item, but has less impact on their estimates of the store's regular price; 2) access to advertising from competing retailers has the same pattern of effects; and 3) across exposure to a series of ad claims, these effects generalize from estimates of specific item prices to judgments of the store's general pricing. For branded shopping goods, the results show that comparative price claims may prove counterproductive for retail advertisers by leading consumers to believe that the store's regular prices are high without convincing them that its sale prices are low.

TI Valuation and management of money-back guarantee options
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In this article, we model money-back guarantees (MBGs) as put options. This use of option theory provides retailers with a framework to optimize the price and the return option independently and under various market conditions. This separation of product price and option value enables retailers to offer an unbundled MBG policy, that is, to allow the customer to choose whether to purchase an MBG option with the product or to buy the product without the MBG but at a lower price. The option value of having an MBG is negatively correlated with the likelihood of product fit and with the opportunity to test the product before purchase, and positively correlated with price and contract duration. Simulation of our model reveals that when customers are highly heterogeneous in their product valuation and probability of need-fit, and if return costs are low, an unbundled MBG policy is optimal. When customers have high likelihood of fit or return costs are excessive, no MBG is the best policy. When customers have small variance in product valuation, but vary greatly in likelihood of product fit, the retailer may prefer to offer a bundled MBG contract, extracting consumer surplus by charging a price close to the valuation level.

With unique, local market data available Finland, the analysis could investigate the impact of both local concentration and industry-wide concentration (which can be interpreted as multimarket contact) are taken into account in the evaluation of grocery retail competitiveness. The results show that the main factor affecting market power is the size of the retail firm. Larger share grocery retailers, for both the local and the national markets, carried higher mark-ups. At the same time, no firm-level scale economies were found from these larger firms. I conclude from these findings that the main purpose of large grocery retail mergers is to gain market power not efficiency. (C) 2002 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI The inter-store mobility of supermarket shoppers
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The allegiance of a particular customer, and the distribution across customers of strength of affiliation to a store are important indicators of store health. It is therefore important to understand the extent and determinants of shopper mobility among competing retailers. While shoppers often patronize many stores, they typically have a primary affiliation to a "main store" that captures the majority of their purchases. We examine, in detail, the tendencies of shoppers to transition away from the current main store and adopt another in its place. That is, rather than study all types of store switching behavior, we focus on the decision to change primary allegiance. The model is established in a discrete time hazard framework and estimated as random-effects probit. Data from 548 households taking 88,945 shopping trips among five stores are used to calibrate the model.
   We find that state dependence is prevalent with nearly three quarters of the shoppers showing progressive attachment to their current main store. Interestingly, this finding is not simply driven by location (i.e., because shoppers are captive to a single store based on geographical distance). More likely, shoppers are unwilling to give up the benefits of store-specific knowledge of assortment, layout and prices. Second, the decision to transition from a current maiti store is not influenced by temporary price promotions on a common basket of items: Shoppers will cherry-pick, but this alone does not cause them to change primary allegiance. The majority of transitions occur across competing stores of the same price format, which suggests "format loyalty" is an important aspect of shopper behavior. After controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, we find little relationship between observable demographics and the transition probability. We do, however, find that shoppers who spend more per trip are less likely to change main stores, as are less frequent shoppers. Implications for retail management strategy are discussed.

TI Modeling customer perceptions of complaint handling over time: the
   effects of perceived justice on satisfaction and intent
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This paper proposes a model of the effects of perceived justice on customer satisfaction and intent following a service or product failure and a recovery attempt. We tested the model using two field studies that captured customer perceptions over time, and the results largely support the model's path estimates and explanatory power. Study One also supports the hypothesis that procedural and interactional justice are more influential in forming overall firm satisfaction than distributive justice. As hypothesized, satisfaction with recovery was a stronger predictor of the likelihood of spreading positive word-of-mouth (WOM intent) than overall firm satisfaction, and overall firm satisfaction was a stronger predictor of purchase intent than satisfaction with recovery. The results also suggest that satisfaction partially mediates the effects of justice on WOM intent and purchase intent. Finally, we draw on the findings of this study to offer implications for service recovery researchers and managers. (C) 2002 by New York University. All rights reserved.

AB Does manufacturer advertising for a brand stimulate or suppress retail price promotions? This study addresses this controversial issue. The authors develop an analytical model that shows that the relationship between manufacturer advertising and retail price promotion depends on the role of advertising. If advertising differentiates brands and suppresses consumer response to retail promotion, then the relationship is negative. But, if advertising is informative enough to increase consumer response to retail promotions, then the relationship is positive. A follow-up empirical analysis shows a strong positive relationship between category advertising expenditure and size of retail price discount, and between advertising and discount frequency. The finding supports the informative role of advertising in the context of retail price promotions. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Although researchers have suggested that the performance of the salesperson during sales encounters is critical, many of the underlying mechanisms that govern the interaction between salespersons and customers are still unclear. In this research, we investigate sales encounters from a new approach based on the field of research of interpersonal perception. Results demonstrate that drivers of customer satisfaction may also be satisfying for the contact employee. Additionally, we find that customer satisfaction is not only determined by the customer's own perceptions, but also by the perceptions of the employee. Similarly, employee satisfaction is driven by the customer's perceptions. Finally, our study identifies that perceptions of employee performance and satisfaction do not only reflect the unique interaction between the customer and the employee, but also relatively stable characteristics of the employee.

TI Barriers to the advancement of modem food retail formats: theory and
   measurement
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The recent expansion of global food retailers into emerging economies has made the study of food retail modernization especially relevant at this time. We present a framework to analyze limitations to market share growth of retail formats based on diffusion across consumer segments and by product category. We then propose a measurement approach, based on consumer surveys, that quantifies the impact of these processes on supermarket market share. Food retail modernization is then examined in Hong Kong by this approach for two points in time. In a 1995 diagnostic study, we find that geographic and economic segment diffusion of supermarkets is complete, but that product category-dependent diffusion (specifically perishables) is not. The latter, thereby, becomes the major restriction on supermarket share gain. In 1999, a second study measures the impact of the introduction of superstores, a large modem format, on the perishable restriction to modem format share growth. Consumers perceived superstore perishables to be superior to supermarkets', but these views had little impact on the ability of modem format to wrest additional share from traditional markets. We discuss diagnostic and monitoring applications, and extensions of the approach to other retail contexts. (C) 2002 by New York University. All rights reserved.

TI Consumer evaluations of different promotion types and price
   presentations: the moderating role of promotional benefit level
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The effects of promotion type (i.e., price discounts and bonus packs) and price presentation (i.e., dollars and percentages) across promotional benefit levels were investigated in three experimental studies. The results suggest, for the products considered, that price discounts and bonus packs were valued similarly for both low and moderate promotional benefit levels, while price discounts were preferred when high promotional benefit levels were employed. Additionally, promotions presented in percentage terms were preferred when the benefit level was high. The implications of these results for retailers and manufacturers are that percentage price presentations should be used when large discounts are being offered. Furthermore, it appears that bonus packs are a viable alternative to price discounts when promotion levels are small or moderate since they have less of a deleterious effect on the brand.

TI Consumer price awareness in food shopping: the case of quantity
   surcharges
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Quantity surcharges, higher unit prices on larger sizes than smaller sizes, are often found among grocery items. In this study we consider the question of why consumers buy surcharged goods. We hypothesize that it is the consequence of a failure to price search, and that some buyers purchase larger sizes in the belief they are cheaper, thus avoiding the need for price comparisons. In the analysis we examine canned tuna, using 1990 data from 54 grocery regions on sales, prices, and consumer demographics. Results support the hypothesis. We find evidence that buyers of surcharged items are mainly those with high time and information costs. (C) 2003 by New York University. Published by Elsevier Science. All rights reserved.

TI Exploring the effect of retail sector and firm characteristics on retail
   price promotion strategy
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study examines why retail price promotion strategies vary across retail sectors and across firms within sectors. Using hierarchical linear modeling and a sample of 38 firms from 11 retail sectors, the authors investigate how two sector-level characteristics, related to product assortment perishability and heterogeneity, and three firm-level characteristics, related to retailer differentiation, number of stores, and average store size, influence price promotion decisions. The results indicate that assortment heterogeneity moderates the positive influence of perishability on price promotion activity; scale and scope also have significant effects. These results offer fresh insight into the ongoing debate surrounding stable versus promotional pricing, suggesting that the benefits of a particular strategy are driven largely by a complex interaction between sector-level characteristics as well as firm-level cost advantages.

TI Assimilation of advertised reference prices: the moderating role of
   involvement
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study examines the hypothesis that the level of involvement influences the assimilation of advertised reference prices (ARPs) into consumers' existing internal reference prices (IRPs). In addition, it investigates the nature of the relationship between the change in IRP and the perceived discrepancy between the ARP and IRP. Results from two different product categories are consistent with assimilation-contrast theory and reveal a nonlinear relationship between the change in IRP and the perceived ARP-IRP discrepancy. In addition, the results are consistent with involvement theory and with prior research on how involvement influences the extent to which consumers elaborate on and are persuaded by advertised information. Specifically, highly involved consumers assimilate a smaller portion of the ARP into their existing IRPs. Implications for research and practice are highlighted. (C) 2003 by New York University.

TI Structural and strategic dynamics in franchising
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In this paper we examine the changes in ownership patterns of franchise systems as they mature. We compare the predictions made by three alternative theories within the context of the fast food industry. Signaling theory predicts that franchise systems will move toward a greater reliance on franchised outlets as systems mature, while resource acquisition theory (or as it is sometimes known, ownership redirection thesis) predicts a tendency in the opposite direction. A third theoretical perspective, tapered integration or plural forms, suggests a tendency toward maintaining a steady state of mixed distribution. Results indicate that although franchisors value the benefits of the mix of ownership types and do maintain that mix over time, there is some evidence of a greater tendency to permanently convert existing franchised outlets to company-owned outlets as fast food systems mature and gain greater access to resources.

AB Given the increasing importance of entertainment as a retailing strategy, this study identifies a comprehensive inventory of consumers' hedonic shopping motivations. Based on exploratory qualitative and quantitative studies, a six-factor scale is developed that consists of adventure. gratification. role, value, social, and idea shopping motivations. Using the six-factor hedonic shopping motivation profiles, a cluster analysis of adult consumers reveals five shopper segments, called here the Minimalists, the Gatherers, the Providers, the Enthusiasts, and the Traditionalists. The utility of the proposed scale is discussed both for future research and retail strategy. (C) 2003 by New York University. Published by Elsevier Science. All rights reserved.

TI Share of wallet in retailing: the effects of customer satisfaction,
   loyalty cards and shopper characteristics
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In retailing. consumers typically patronize multiple outlets. Thus, an important issue is why consumers vary in how they divide their purchases across outlets and how outlets can get a greater share of consumer expenditures. Two potential avenues for increasing customer share are to raise customer satisfaction, and increase repeat purchase through loyalty cards. This study examines the effects of customer satisfaction and loyalty cards as well as consumer characteristics on customer share spent on the primary grocery store. The findings suggest that customer satisfaction has a positive, albeit modest, effect on share while consumer economic shopping orientation has a negative direct effect on share. The economic orientation of shoppers, their felt importance of a personal relationship with store personnel, and the level of their aggregate purchase volume moderate the effect of satisfaction on customer share. Finally, the results provide mixed support for the impact of loyalty cards on customer behavior. (C) 2003 by New York University. Published by Elsevier Science. All rights reserved.

TI A cross-cultural study of switching barriers and propensity to stay with
   service providers
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study examines the important and often underestimated role that switching barriers play in the propensity to stay with service providers. Three service types (with different structural characteristics) were studied across two diverse cultures-Australia (Western, individualistic culture) and Thailand (Eastern, collectivist culture). Six potential switching barriers are examined: search costs; loss of social bonds; setup costs; functional risk; attractiveness of alternatives; and loss of special treatment benefits. The results from a series of multiple regression analyses show switching costs capture a substantial amount of the explained variance in the dependent variable, propensity to stay with a focal service provider. Furthermore we demonstrate using interaction terms that these switching costs appear to be universal across west-east cultures. However, significant variations were found across industries. Next, using a hierarchical regression procedure, we add a satisfaction variable into each model. The incremental gain in R-2 is significant in each industry. Nonetheless the significant impact of switching barriers aives rise to the identification of a new type of service loyalty, which we term "captive loyalty." (C) 2003 by New York University.

TI Accounting for heterogeneity and dynamics in the loyalty-price
   sensitivity relationship
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Marketers have been interested in the relationship between brand loyalty and price sensitivity for many years and have examined whether loyalty reduces consumer price sensitivity. The results, to date, indicate that loyalty does indeed raise the price that consumers are willing to pay for a brand. Other than this broad finding, however, there has been little research in the literature regarding whether and how this relationship varies across consumers and product categories and, within consumers, over time. This is the issue that we investigate in this paper. Specifically, we examine whether the price sensitivity-loyalty relationship is heterogeneous and dynamic. We propose an approach wherein the price sensitivity parameter of a brand choice model is specified as a function of loyalty with three parameters. The first parameter of this function represents the maximum possible reduction in price sensitivity due to loyalty. The second parameter affects the type and shape of the relationship between price sensitivity and loyalty. In particular, depending on the value of this parameter, the relationship could be non-existent, follow a concave shape, indicating decreasing response to increases in loyalty, or be S-shaped to capture the case of increasing response initially followed by decreasing response subsequently. Finally, the third parameter captures the rate at which price sensitivity falls as loyalty increases.
   We use the proposed approach to investigate the relationship in four frequently purchased categories. In each category, we select a sample of households and calibrate the model on the choices of all the households in the sample. We next employ an Empirical Bayes approach to obtain household-level estimates of all the parameters. These parameters are then used to assign each household in each category to a no response or concave or S-shaped response groups. Within each of these three groups, we assign each household to one of four different response level and C rate segments. that is, high response-high rate, high response-low rate, low response-high rate, and low response-low rate. Each of these segments differs in the response level, that is, the maximum reduction in price sensitivity as loyalty reaches a maximum-and the response rate. that is, how quickly price sensitivity falls with increases in loyalty.
   Following the assignment of each household to a segment in each category, we pool the households across all four categories and calibrate a membership function. This function explains households' membership in different segments in terms of product category characteristics, household demographics, the household's responses to price, display, and feature promotions and the evolution of loyalty of the household.
   Our findings suggest that the nature of the loyalty-price sensitivity relationship does vary across consumers as well as over time. Specifically, the concave response is more likely than the S-shaped response or the absence of a response. We find that the S-shaped response is not related to responsiveness to in-store promotions. It is, however, associated with a slower growth in loyalty to a brand as it is purchased. The concave response. on the other hand, is associated with responsiveness to feature promotions but is unrelated to how loyalty to brands evolves with their purchases.
   We also find that demographic characteristics are related to the behavior of the concave and S-shaped responses. Specifically, for the S-shaped response, household demographics are related to both the maximum level of the curve as well as its rate of growth. In particular, the curve grows faster with age and its maximum increases with the weekly working hours of the household. In the case of the concave response, high income and more working hours raise the maximum level that the curve achieves. Its rate of growth, however, is unaffected by demographics.
   We also provide several managerial implications for loyalty and promotional programs based on our findings. Specifically, our first finding that the loyalty-price sensitivity relationship is dynamic-suggests that, rather than having promotional programs, where the value of the price promotion is fixed and some consumers are targeted with the promotion while others are not, managers should have an entire schedule of price promotions with each level of promotions targeting consumers at a different loyalty level.
   Our second finding that the nature of the loyalty-price sensitivity relationship is heterogeneous across consumers suggests that designing loyalty programs on the basis of crude classifications such as loyals and non-loyals is not appropriate. Instead, households that are identified as loyal, need to be further divided based on how the loyalty affects their price sensitivity. Promotional programs should then be based on the specific type of relationship that a household exhibits.
   The third finding that the reductions in price sensitivity to loyalty can exhibit an S-shaped or a concave pattern also has an interesting managerial implication. Specifically, given the differences between the two patterns in how long it might take a consumer to reach a point where s(he) is willing to purchase a brand due to loyalty rather than due to a price promotion, and hence be a profitable customer, it may be preferable for managers to invest more in consumers who exhibit a concave rather than an S-shaped response.
   Finally, our result that different categories may exhibit different patterns of the relationship between price sensitivity and loyalty implies that each category needs to be analyzed by itself for what the nature of the loyalty-price sensitivity relationship is likely to be so that the most appropriate program for that category can be developed.

TI Spatial diffusion of a new loyalty program through a retail market
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailers who wish to launch new innovations into their markets can be much more effective if they understand the geographic forces which affect consumer adoption of those innovations. A research field which studies this process is spatial diffusion. This paper explores and models the processes and driving forces of spatial diffusion across a market area following the launch of a new loyalty card program by a national retailer. Event history modeling is used to estimate the effects of distance, the impact of the firm's marketing efforts, and the role of previous adopters in influencing the speed and spatial pattern of the adoption process. The results, in addition to yielding new insights into the processes involved in spatial diffusion, support previous findings on the importance of targeting the Innovator adopter group in a new product launch.

AB The information that a retailer's name communicates to consumers can be a source of competitive advantage for many retailers. Indeed, retailers develop a kind of brand equity, which we refer to as "retailer equity." To aid both practitioners and researchers, we outline a method, using partial least squares (PLS) analysis for developing parsimonious measures for retailer equity. In addition, we provide four illustrations of possible ways that the index can be used by retailers: (1) as a benchmarking tool, (2) as an indicator of the success (failure) of marketing strategies and tactics, (3) as a means to evaluate the attractiveness of market segments, and (4) as an instrument to examine the relative importance of the various components of retailer equity for specific retailers. The index also provides a means for marketing researchers to examine potential antecedents and outcomes of retailer equity. (C) 2003 by New York University. Published by Elsevier Science.

TI Situational price sensitivity: the role of consumption occasion, social
   context and income
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Research on consumer reaction to price has been largely confined to examining consumers' price information search,evaluation of price alternatives, and individual purchase behaviors without regard to situational influences. At the same time, consumption has often been dichotomized in terms of its functional-hedonic nature and has been examined with regard to social influence. Surprisingly, researchers have heretofore not examined the potential effect of the consumption occasion or social context on consumers' price sensitivity. Further, research examining the effect of household resources on price sensitivity has produced mixed results. We argue that household income effects on price sensitivity are dependent upon the situation. This research addresses two key issues. First, we examine whether individuals are equally price-sensitive when purchasing products for functional (e.g., purchasing frozen vegetables or paper towels) versus hedonic (e.g., purchasing ice cream or cookies) consumption situations and whether social context (i.e., consuming the product alone or with others) influences price sensitivity. Second, we explore the interaction effects of household income and consumption context on price sensitivity. We examine these issues across a series of three studies, finding that consumers' price sensitivity is in fact attenuated by both hedonic and social consumption situations and that income moderates these effects. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed. (C) 2003 by New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

TI An empirically derived taxonomy of retailer pricing and promotion
   strategies
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Most research categorizes grocery retailers as following either an Every Day Low pricing (EDLP) or a High Low (Hi-Lo) pricing strategy at a store or chain level, whereas this paper studies retailer pricing and promotions at a brand-store level. It empirically examines 1,364 brand-store combinations from 17 chains, 212 stores and six categories of consumer package goods in five U.S. markets. Retailer pricing and promotion strategies are found to be based on combinations of four underlying dimensions: relative price, price variation, deal intensity and deal support. At the brand-store level, retailers practice five pricing strategies, labeled Exclusive, Moderately Promotional, Hi-Lo, EDLP, and Aggressive pricing. Surprisingly, the most prevalent pricing strategy is not Hi-Lo pricing strategy as is widely believed. It is one characterized by average relative brand price, low price variation, medium deal intensity, and medium deal support. The findings provide some initial benchmarks and suggest that retailers should closely monitor their competitors' price decisions at the brand level. (C) 2003 by New York University.

TI The impact of external reference price on consumer price expectations
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Comparative pricing practices are frequently used where actual product prices are accompanied by higher external reference prices. All types of stores, regular-price department stores as well as discount stores, use comparative price claims to frame price deals as attractive [Marketing Science 4 (1985) 1991. In this paper, a quadratic model is specified for the impact of external reference price (ERP) on consumer price expectations. Based on the research on communication discrepancy and advertising claim discrepancy, which in turn draw on assimilation-contrast, attribution, and prospect theories, we hypothesize a quadratic effect of external reference prices on consumer price expectations. An interactive, computer-controlled experiment using multiple levels of ERP is used to estimate the proposed model. As hypothesized. support for an inverted U-shape relationship is found between consumers' updated price expectations and the difference between ERP and initial price expectations. That is, as the difference between ERP and subjects' initial price expectations increases, subjects' updated price expectations increase to a point and then start to decrease. We find that the fit of the quadratic model specification for the effect of external reference price on price expectations is noticeably superior to that of linear, logarithmic, square root, and S-shaped specifications. Finally, we provide implications of our results for both retail managers and for regulatory authorities alike. (C) 2003 by New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

TI Antecedents of satisfaction in a marketing channel
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Because of the importance of satisfaction to inter-firm relationship quality and thus inter-firm relationship continuity, this research investigates previously unstudied antecedents of satisfaction in a marketing channel. These antecedents include the attractiveness of alternative relationships, relationship investment, and switching cost. The research also tests reciprocal relationships between satisfaction and alternative attractiveness, and between satisfaction and voice. This helps suggest answers to questions such as, does satisfaction reduce alternative attractiveness as it is generally believed, or does alternative attractiveness reduce satisfaction? Many of the study variables were antecedents of satisfaction in the study context. Together they explained almost half of the variation in satisfaction. Nevertheless, alternative attractiveness, relationship investment, and voice were the most important antecedents of satisfaction in the study. The paper concludes with suggestions for the cultivation of customer satisfaction in the study context. (C) 2003 by New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB It is well established in the marketing literature that the bond of trust is a cornerstone of interorganizational relationships. However, trust is considered to be context-specific, as it is difficult to endow on new relationships. We argue that the existing trust between organizations not only survives tough and shifting times, but also helps steer those organizations through such trying periods. We investigated a context where a major change was instituted in a cooperative marketing channel. Here, the supplier (the focal channel member) had to convince the other channel members (the retailers) about the impending merger, which may or may not bring benefits to all. We empirically show the existing trust in the supplier was a major determinant of the support for the merger and inducing the post-merger trust in and commitment to the changed supplier.

TI The effects of wait expectations and store atmosphere evaluations on
   patronage intentions in service-intensive retail stores
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Many factors, both obvious and subtle, influence customers' store patronage intentions. Using videotape technology that enabled us to experimentally manipulate the number of visible store employees, number of customers, and music, we test the relative importance of wait expectations and store atmosphere evaluations on patronage intentions. These constructs are found to be critical antecedents of store patronage intentions in the context of the service-intensive retail store at which the model was tested. We also find support for the direct effects of gender on wait expectations and store atmosphere evaluations. We discuss some implications for retailing research and practice.

TI Coupons in context: discounting prices or decreasing profits?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A coupon is a commonly used sales promotion device offering the user a discount on the purchase of a product. Consumer coupon offerings are also becoming increasingly diverse: from "% off and "$ off" to "Buy one, Get one free" (BOGO) offers and co-promotions (Buy X, Deal on Y). This paper reports the results of three experiments that examine whether the economic value of a coupon is a source of information to infer the price of the product/service, and the quality of the product/service, which inference can undercut the economic value, with resulting consequences for deal evaluations and purchase intentions. The framework predicts, and empirical results show, that increasing the value of the coupon does not always improve deal evaluations or purchase intentions. This could imply lower profits for the company. The presence of past price information about the brand, information about prices of other brands offered by the company, and information about competitors' prices moderate the impact of coupon value on brand-related inferences. When such alternate sources of information are present and are diagnostic of the price of the promoted product, consumers are less likely to infer price and quality from the value of the coupon and higher coupon values are more likely to increase deal evaluations and purchase intentions. Implications for managers designing and communicating promotions are offered. (C) 2004 by New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

TI Emerging trends in retail pricing practice: implications for research
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This article represents the first of several editorials to appear in the Journal of Retailing designed to examine the nexus between retail practice and research, with the goal of stimulating further research. This essay on emerging trends in pricing discusses recent advances in retail pricing optimization. We begin with a review of how retailers typically make pricing decisions using time-honored heuristics and attempt to infer the optimal decisions. However, current methods are suboptimal because they do not consider the affects of advertising, competition, substitute products, or complementary products on sales. Most fail to take into account how price elasticity changes over time, particularly for fashion merchandise, or how market segments react differentially to price changes. In addition, many retailers find it difficult to know how to price merchandise when their suppliers offer temporary "deals". They are also generally unaware of how their pricing strategy influences their overall image. As these issues demonstrate, optimal pricing is not a static problem. Retailers must be able to react quickly to changes in the environment or sales patterns. This paper also provides examples of the more sophisticated pricing techniques that are currently being tested in practice. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the critical components that must be incorporated into retail pricing. (C) 2004 by New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

TI Virtual store layout: an experimental comparison in the context of
   grocery retail
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Interface design and the interaction between customer and computer are factors critical to business effectiveness over the Web. A key aspect of conventional retailing is store layout; an analogous aspect in virtual retail is virtual store layout. This paper reports on an experimental investigation into the use of three different layouts in online grocery retailing: freeform, grid, and racetrack. These three most common conventional retailing layout types were transformed into virtual layouts for computer-mediated interfaces. Subjects in Greece and the UK participated in a laboratory experiment: they were given a planned shopping task with money to spend, and performed their shopping through a virtual store with layout as the manipulated variable. The results show that layout significantly affects online consumer behavior, but that predictions generated from the literature of conventional retailing about differences in the outcome of layouts do not generally hold in a virtual setting. Some of the findings can be explained by reference to research in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). (C) 2004 by New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

TI Managing price expectations through product overlap
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB How should a retailer think about the decision to carry, price, and promote products that overlap with another store when such overlap is predicted to intensify price competition and drive down product prices? The existing research suggests that retailers should look to carry an ever-increasing percentage of unique or non-overlapping products [J. Marketing 61 (1997) 38; Marketing Sci. 19 (2000) 83], thereby eliminating the ability to compare prices across stores.
   We challenge this recommendation, arguing that overlapping products allow one type of retailer-the higher end retailer-to signal the fairness of its prices and foster a more favorable price image than might otherwise exist. In a laboratory study, we show that, for higher end stores, the existence of overlapping products can significantly increase perceptions of pricing fairness and subsequent store choice, even when those overlapping products are no cheaper in the focal store than in a competing store.

CL SAN ANTONIO, TX
SP Amer Marketing Assoc
AB Important marketing scales such as SERVQUAL are often adapted for use in a particular applied/theory-testing context and/or refined using some statistical method, assuming the resultant scale will have improved psychometric properties for a particular application. However, little attention has been paid to the consequences of how scale modifications are made, the criteria that are used to assess how well a modified scale performs. and whether scale modification is in fact worthwhile. To investigate these issues, we review approaches to scale modification, select an influential marketing scale and use context, and then examine the effects of the different scale modification approaches on which items are included in the refined scale. We then cross-validate the psychometric performance of the resulting scales using criteria that reflect the multiple purposes to which a scale can be applied. The results show approaches that leads to a more reliable scale for one purpose (e.g., segmentation) can be far less adequate for another purpose (e.g., benchmarking).

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Two studies explore the conditions under which redundant reference price information (ARP) is likely to influence consumers' perceptions of an advertised sale price. Study 1 suggests that an ARP enhances offer-value, but only for consumers who are not involved with the product. Study 2 incorporates a wider array of price presentation tactics (SP Only, SP + ARP, SP + %Saving and SP + ARP + %Saving) and investigates a range of responses (transaction value, acquisition value and subsequent purchase intentions). Again, results suggest that ARP only influences perceived transaction value, and saving information only impacts purchase intentions. Most importantly, these effects are seen only when involvement is low. (C) 2004 by New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

TI It's all at the mall: exploring adolescent girls' experiences
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB While overall mall patronage in the United States has been declining for several years, patronage among U.S. adolescents (especially girls) has risen sharply. We describe a qualitative study that examines in-depth the young girl's mall experience. A theoretical model was developed from the findings that includes some factors that have been examined in previous research, such as mall atmosphere and utilitarian and hedonic shopping motives. In addition, several new factors specifically relevant to girl shoppers, aged 12-19, also emerged, including education cohort, trend consciousness, comfort, safety, mall companion, freedom as a mall-patronage motivation, and accessibility issues. This insight into young girls' patronage behaviors and motivations will provide academics, mall developers and retailers a richer understanding of the various components that contribute to the female adolescent mall experience, and allow them to more effectively study and market to this segment.

AB Though it is a well-accepted fact that consumers indulge in multi-purpose shopping, most previous models of store choice assume that grocery shopping trips are single-purpose trips. This paper provides the first empirical analysis of multi-purpose shopping using data on actual shopping trips. A latent class factor analytic logit model is proposed, which provides a representation of the market structure of grocery store competition, while integrating; multi-purpose shopping, retail pricing formal and location strategy. We conclude that incorporating multi-purpose shopping trips provides a better understanding of the competitive market structure, and discuss the managerial implications for the selection of marketing strategies.

TI Shopping with friends and teens' susceptibility to peer influence
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB While some retailers may discourage groups of teenagers from shopping in their stores, there is reason to believe that peer groups may affect teen behaviors and evaluations in ways that could benefit retailers. In this paper, we examine the phenomenon of teenagers' shopping with friends, and, in particular, whether shopping with friends might enhance teens' attitudes toward retailing and their tendency to spend more when shopping with friends. We also examine why teens shop with friends. Specifically, we relate friends' knowledge and teens' age to teenagers' susceptibility to informational and normative influence from friends. Susceptibility to peer influence is then related to various aspects of teen shopping, such as frequency and enjoyment of shopping with pals, which, in turn, are related to sentiment toward retailing and spending tendencies. With the exception of susceptibility to normative influence, results based on data from a sample of high school students generally supported the model. (C) 2004 by New York University.

TI Price-matching guarantees as signals of low store prices: survey and
   experimental evidence
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Many retailers offer a price-matching guarantee that promises to pay consumers the difference if they find a lower price elsewhere. This article proposes that the effectiveness of a price-matching guarantee as a signal of low store prices depends on individuals' beliefs about the degree to which other consumers in the market engage in price search, enforce price-matching guarantees, or both. Consistent with signaling theory, results of a survey and two experimental studies demonstrate that market level factors affect consumer beliefs about the extent to which others engage in price search and thereby the effectiveness of price-matching guarantees in lowering perceptions of store prices. The implications of the findings for retail strategy are discussed along with directions for future research. (C) 2004 by New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

In two empirical studies, this paper examines the influence of the product category on consumers' knowledge of prices for durables. The first study utilizes data from the popular television game show The Price is Right to establish significant cross-category variations in price knowledge, while the second study links these variations to the specific characteristics of each product category. The results extend existing research findings by isolating the impact of product category determinants, such as purchase frequency, advertising exposure, and use of the price-quality cue, on consumers' knowledge of prices.

TI The four levels of loyalty and the pivotal role of trust: a study of

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A four-dimension scale of loyalty that reflects Oliver's [Satisfaction, a Behavioral Perspective on the Consumer, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1997] conceptualization of a sequential loyalty chain is proposed, operationalized, and tested. Further, through both synthesizing and building on existing research into loyalty, trust, satisfaction, value, and service quality, a framework is proposed and tested that positions trust as a pivotal driver of loyalty. Data is collected and analyzed from two surveys of online customers, the first being purchasers of books and the second being a study of online flight purchasing. Analysis suggests that the hypothesized cognitive-affective-conative-action loyalty sequence is statistically most likely out of all possible variations. Although some differences emerge in the two studies, structural modeling largely supports the hypothesized framework and positions trust as central to service dynamics.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Organizational learning in a retail setting relies on the motivation of boundary-spanning retail associates to identify and implement organizationally functional changes with respect to work methods, policies, and procedures within the context of their jobs, stores, or organizations-referred to as change-oriented organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs). A theoretical model of situation and person antecedents of change-oriented OCBs is developed and tested with a sample of 183 full-time boundary-spanning employees of a national retail sales organization. The results reveal that learning goal orientation and leader-member exchange quality are direct positive antecedents of these behaviors. The results also demonstrate interesting Person x Situation interactions. Direct relationships between transformational or contingent reward leadership behaviors and change-oriented OCBs are moderated by employee performance goal orientation. A positive relationship between organizational commitment and change-oriented OCBs is moderated by employee learning goal orientation. Contingent reward leadership and transformational leadership behaviors also have indirect positive relationships with change-oriented OCBs via leader-member exchange quality.

   efforts
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The increasing globalization of business provides a compelling reason for understanding the cultural context of consumer behavior. The research reported here examines the impact of culture on consumers' perceptions of service recovery efforts. In particular, we studied in an experimental setting, across East-West cultures, the combined effects of explanation and compensation in shaping customers' attributions and post-recovery perceptions in a medium contact service-a restaurant setting. Our findings show that the differential sensitivity of East Asian and American consumers to situational constraints influence their attributions for service failures, and thus moderate their satisfaction with service recovery process. More specifically, the results suggest that a causal explanation for service failure decreases the likelihood of US consumers falling prey to the fundamental attribution error. Conversely, among East Asians, an explanation had minimal influence in attributional processes. Finally, our results indicate that attributional processes influence customer perceptions of employee effort, which in turn is linked to post-recovery satisfaction. (C) 2004 by New York University.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study explores the impact of the e-tailer's inventory policy on its pricing strategy and profitability via a two-period model. Specifically, we identify two inventory policies: zero inventory and positive inventory. The findings show that the zero-inventory e-tailer charges lower prices than the positive-inventory one, but the price differential decreases over time if the market expands rapidly. The findings also show that the zero-inventory policy is preferred under a moderately positive relationship between reservation price and impatience for delivery, whereas the positive-inventory policy is preferred when these two variables are independent of each other. Furthermore, the results show that a more rapid expansion of market is a favorable condition for the zero-inventory e-tailer. The authors also discuss the implications of the inventory policy for an e-tailer's performance. (C) 2004 by New York University. Published by Elsevier.

   challenges, different payoffs
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Anxiety and anger, two frequently experienced emotions during service consumption, arise from different appraisals of the eliciting event, i.e., attribution to uncontrollable circumstances and low coping potential for anxiety versus attribution to providers and high coping potential for anger. These appraisal differences were hypothesized to impact the occurrence of supportive provider responses (higher for anxiety than for anger), and the value given to supportive responses by anxious versus angry customers (higher evaluation for anxiety than for anger). It was also hypothesized that, although evaluation of provider response would mediate the relationship between the intensity of both anger and anxiety and satisfaction with the service encounter as a whole, the power of this mediating effect would be stronger for anxiety than for anger. Hypotheses were confirmed in a survey of air travel passengers reporting episodes of anxiety and anger. Implications of these results for challenges and payoffs involved in the development of adaptive response strategies to anxious and angry customers are discussed. (C) 2004 by New York University.

TI E-satisfaction: a re-examination
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB E-satisfaction as a construct has gained increasing importance in the marketing literature in recent times. The examination of consumer satisfaction in an online context follows the growing consensus that in Internet retailing, as in traditional retailing, consumer satisfaction is not only a critical performance outcome, but also a primary predictor of customer loyalty and thus, the Internet retailer's endurance and success. The current study replicates the initial examination of e-satisfaction within the U.S. by [Szymanski, David M., & Richard I Hise (2000). E-satisfaction: An initial examination. Journal of Retailing, 76(3), 309-322] among a sample of online consumers drawn from Germany. The replication was extended to two contexts--consumer satisfaction with Internet retail shopping and consumer satisfaction with Internet financial services sites. The results yield rich insights into the validity of extending the measurement and predictors of e-satisfaction to a trans-national context. (C) 2004 by New York University. Published by Elsevier.

AB With an increasingly competitive retail environment and decreasing customer switching costs, customer retailer loyalty is a critical goal for merchants of all types. We investigate customer retailer loyalty in the context of multiple channel retailing strategies. Results show that multiple channel retail strategies enhance the portfolio of set-vice outputs provided to the customer, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and ultimately customer retailer loyalty. These results suggest that multiple channel retailing can be a useful strategy for building customer retailer loyalty. (C) 2004 New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

TI How category characteristics affect the number of store brands offered
   by the retailer: a model and empirical analysis
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Our research examines why retailers offer, not one, but multiple store brands in some product categories. More specifically, we are interested in how certain product category characteristics affect the number of store brands. We model a product category consisting of two incumbent national brands that may differ in strength. The retailer may introduce one or two store brands depending on which maximizes category profits. Our analysis suggests that the retailer is likely to carry two store brands in categories where (i) the national brands are similar in strength; and (ii) the price sensitivity between the national brands is low. Interestingly, the conditions that support the introduction of more than one store brand are quite different than the conditions that would facilitate the introduction of additional national brands. We provide empirical evidence that support our model-based predictions. (C) 2004 New York University. Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

TI Relationship hindrance: why would consumers not want a relationship with

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Relationship marketing tactics, such as loyalty programs, company credit cards, and e-mail promotions, are becoming increasingly popular. Benefits offered to a consumer for engaging in relational exchanges include price decreases, special offers, personalized attention, and customized products. With such benefits, the assumption is that consumers will want to develop a relationship with an organization and be rewarded for their loyalty. However, consumers might patronize a retailer, be satisfied with the service and product delivery, and yet not want to develop a relationship with them. As such, the purpose of this study was to determine why seemingly satisfied customers do not want to engage in relationship marketing and loyalty enhancing programs with retailers.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The concept of customer loyalty is conspicuous by it's ubiquity. Therefore, there is no surprise that it is one of the most widely studied areas by researchers and one of the most widely implemented marketing initiatives, by practitioners. This article draws upon past research to review important findings related to customer behavior and attitude in the context of customer loyalty. Further, research related to linking loyalty to profitability and forward looking metric such as the customer lifetime value is reviewed to propose a conceptual framework for building and sustaining loyalty and profitability simultaneously at individual customer level. A two-tiered rewards structure is presented as a means for marketers to operationalize the framework. The conceptual framework hopes to serve as a platform to understand the evolving dominant logic of loyalty programs for building and sustaining loyalty in the twenty first century as well as induce further research in that direction.

TI The different faces of coupon elasticity
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Coupons account for over two-thirds of all consumer promotional efforts initiated by the manufacturers of consumer goods. In this study, the impact of coupons on brand sales is investigated and how that impact decays over the life of the coupon is demonstrated. Specifically, we present an econometric model that can capture coupon effects in terms of equivalent price reduction, account for coupon effects over time, allow inference of coupon effects when retailers decide to double or triple the coupon value, and provide both self-coupon and cross-coupon elasticities at different levels of aggregation. A widely used sales response model is adapted, and an analytical model is proposed to estimate both the self-coupon and cross-coupon (face value) elasticities of sales at the store level. From the store-level elasticity estimates for a given week, the authors analytically derive the coupon elasticities for the chain level by aggregating across stores, and over the life of the coupon by aggregating over time. The proposed sales response model is estimated with the data obtained from three markets for various product categories, and the coupon elasticities are computed. The proposed framework allows one to demonstrate the hypothetical equivalence of a shelf-price reduction for a given coupon face value in each week. Also, the effect of doubling the face value of a coupon results in more than a proportionate increase in elasticity. The authors find that both self and cross-coupon elasticities are much smaller in magnitude than the average self and cross-price elasticity measures reported in the literature.

TI The impact of brand equity and the hedonic level of products on consumer
   stock-out reactions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We investigate the impact of brand equity and the hedonic level of the product on consumer stock-out responses. We also examine whether the hedonic level of the product moderates the effect of brand equity. Using a sample of Dutch consumers divided over eight product groups and eight retail chains, we tested our hypotheses and found that consumers were more loyal to high-equity brands than to low-equity brands in the case of a stock-out situation. In hedonic product groups, consumers were more likely to switch to another store. Purchasers of high-equity brands in hedonic product groups were, compared to purchasers of high-equity brands in utilitarian product groups, less inclined to postpone the purchase but were more likely to switch to another item by that brand. In addition to these two main variables, we also investigate the effect of variables from prior research and some new variables, such as stockpiling and impulse buying. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of pricing and promotion on consumer perceptions: it depends on
   how you frame it

AB This research examined the extent to which different promotional frames increased perceptions of deal value. Price discounts dominate the sales promotions employed by marketers. The framing literature suggests discounts have robust positive effects on consumer perceptions of deal value. However, the current research showed that negative quality inferences moderated discount framing effects and undermined deal value, particularly when no assurance of product quality was provided. Every-day-low-price offers were also vulnerable to negative quality inferences, while free gift frames maintained quality perceptions and increased deal value. Product trial acted to further magnify promotional framing effects, according to a confirmation bias. These findings were consistent with an attribute framing mechanism.

TI The dimensional stability of the standards used in the disconfirmation
   paradigm
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Disconfirmation judgments are defined as the difference between a consumer's consumption experiences and the comparison standards brought to mind at the time of judgment. Although disconfirmations are one of the most strongly related antecedents of customer satisfaction (CS), little is known about the dimensional stability of the standards used in the disconfirmation paradigm. The most commonly used standards in the measurement of disconfirmations, and the focal constructs in this research, are goals, expectations, and norms. Using three datasets in retail service settings, the authors investigated whether these standards are changed in the process of measuring disconfirmation judgments. The results of the structural equation models indicate that while consumers can generate comparison standards that are distinct, consumers appear to assimilate disconfirmation judgments into a single construct. One implication for retailers is that when using direct measures of disconfirmations in surveys, there appears to be little difference in the ability of these standards to predict customer satisfaction.

TI Asymmetric competition in retail store formats: Evaluating inter- and
   intra-format spatial effects
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Our study aims to analyze the role of store format in retail competitive interactions, specifically, the relationship between growth; location strategy, and market response. To assess this relationship, we propose an extension of the classic models of spatial interaction, which incorporate the asymmetric competitive effects linked to the concept of store format. An empirical application allows us to confirm greater spatial rivalry within store formats (intra-format) than between store formats (inter-format). This implies a certain hierarchical organization when consumers select a retail store, first choosing the type of store at which they will shop and later a particular store within this format. The results are important for retailers who want to configure an optimal network of store locations as well as public administrators who must regulate commercial activity.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The goal of relationship marketing is to build and maintain a committed, loyal relationship between a customer and an organization. Although studies have discussed the types of relational bonds that enhance customer loyalty, empirical research that focuses on the application of relational bonds in a virtual environment is relatively sparse. In response, this study investigates the effects of various relational bonds on customer commitment across search-experience-credence goods/services on Internet. The results suggest that financial, social, and structural bonds have positive impacts on customer commitment. In addition, financial bonds are more successful in strengthening customer commitment for search goods/services than for experience or credence goods/services. Structural bonds are more important for credence and experience goods/services than for search goods, and social bonds are almost equally important for all three types of goods/service.

TI Animating the big middle
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB A Consumer Culture Theory (CCT) perspective captures the motivating social and cultural contexts of retail patronage and purchase behaviors and the myriad motivating factors behind the retail purchase decision. A CCT perspective complements behavioral decision theory and social cognition research in retailing. For consumers, retailers represent a field in which operant resources interact. In these marketspaces, firms and consumers exert a mutual gravitational pull. Firms compete for a role in the culturally constituted projects that consumers pursue by offering certain resource combinations. A CCT-based approach to retailing strives to account for co-creation, namely, how consumers deploy their own cultural resources, aided by retail er-provided resources, to accomplish the pursuit of their personal identity and communal projects. The paper discusses strategic orientations for retail firms that spring from a resource view, four types of firm supplied operant resources, suggests some mechanisms through which consumers animate cultural resources and their motivations to do so, and offers suggestions for future research.

TI Supply chain management and the evolution of the "Big Middle"
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The authors define the "Big Middle" as the marketspace in which the bulk of retailers compete for the majority of customers and the preponderance of expenditures occur. Therefore, it is the space in which retailers aspire to exist in their quest for increased revenues, scale economics, and profits. An enduring concept, the Big Middle appears in any economy in which large-scale retailing has developed. In general merchandise retailing in the U.S., there have been three Big Middle subperiods, each defined by a distinct branch of the general merchandising tree; driven by geographic, technological, and socioeconomic changes; and dominated by preeminent retail chains. During the variety store subperiod, the F.W. Woolworth chain dominated. In the national-chain department store subperiod, Sears Roebuck and JCPenney were the primary retailers, and in the modern discounter subperiod, Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target have emerged as leaders. The authors argue that the development of these subperiods and the success of their major retailers have depended on the efficient and effective flow of merchandise from suppliers to customers. Optimizing this flow always has entailed harnessing current technology, given the geographic and socioeconomic realities of the time. Currently, technology facilitates a comprehensive application of supply chain management, whereas previous technology only permitted a simplified version. (c) 2005 New York University.

TI Succeeding in the Big Middle through technology
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Big Middle retailers serve the mass market composed of mainstream consumers and face competition from both other Big Middle retailers and specialized (niche) retailers that want a share of the Big Middle consumer market. How can Big Middle retailers leverage technology to strengthen their competitive position? The authors explore this question by offering a framework for characterizing the Big Middle and a consumer-based taxonomy for classifying technology strategies in the retailing arena. In particular, the authors emphasize the following key points: (1) most technological advancements in retailing in the twenty-first century will relate to information technology; (2) many technologies have the potential to both cut the cost of retailer operations and enhance service to customers; (3) the adoption of these technologies requires significant upfront investments; (4) successful retailers in the Big Middle are in the best position to adopt these technologies because of their deep pockets and because they can pass on part of the costs to their vendors; (5) Big Middle retailers must take a longer term view with respect to returns on their technology investments; and (6) Big Middle retailers should consider consumers' reactions to these technologies and be cautious about "overengineering." In this regard, this editorial points to several directions for further research in the realm of technology investments by retailers. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI The organizational ecology of retailing: A historical perspective
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Little empirical research has been done on how to help retailing firms survive recessions. Using the "natural experiment" of the Great Depression and the theoretical lens of organizational ecology, we explore survival of retailers during 1929-1939 to test whether strategic competitive advantages related to human capital, the liability of newness, organizational form, and legitimacy facilitated survival through this upheaval. Consistent with theory from organizational ecology, survival was positively influenced by the average wage paid in the population, the average age of the population, chain store penetration, and an interaction of level of chain store penetration and age. The study offers recommendations for research and practice to retailers. The most important application for retailing managers is that high wage employees, presumably of higher quality, help retailers survive recessions better than low wage employees.

TI Understanding product migration to the electronic marketplace: A
   conceptual framework
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We present a conceptual framework that organizes current thinking regarding increased interactivity in the electronic marketplace and its implications for product migration. Product migration refers to the extent of reliance by buyers and sellers on the electronic marketplace for activities pertaining to information search, purchase, acquisition, use, and disposal of a product. We posit that value outcomes derived by buyers and sellers from increasing interactivity mediate the relationship between interactivity and product migration. The relationship between interactivity and value outcomes for buyers and sellers is moderated by three sets of product-related characteristics: the core characteristics of the product, its purchase and use-related characteristics, and market characteristics. Inertia and resistance exhibited by buyers and sellers negatively impact product migration to the electronic marketplace and also attenuate the impact of value outcomes on product migration. In addition to guiding theoretical and empirical work in this emerging area, the proposed framework can also be employed to structure a firm's strategic discussions related to the electronic marketplace.

TI Customer-oriented boundary-spanning behaviors: Test of a social exchange
   model of antecedents
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Using a sample of 281 frontline service employees of a national retail bank, we testa social exchange model of antecedents of three dimensions of customer-oriented boundary-spanning behaviors suggested by prior boundary-spanning and services marketing/management literatures: external representation, internal influence, and service delivery. In support of our hypotheses, we identify fully mediated relationships from procedural, interactional, and distributive justice to external representation and internal influence via job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Our results generally support our expectation that the indirect effects of procedural justice on external representation and internal influence are stronger than the indirect effects of distributive or interactional justice on these behaviors. Also, our results reveal no significant indirect effects of procedural and distributive justice on service delivery behaviors. However, we find an unexpected direct positive path from interactional justice to service delivery behaviors. We interpret this latter finding in light of the normative value of interactional justice as a source of role modeling or managerial legitimacy. (c) 2005 New York University.

TI Perceptions of assortment variety: The effects of congruency between
   consumers' internal and retailers' external organization
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This research shows that consumers' perceptions of variety and satisfaction are dependent upon how the assortment is organized, both internally by the consumer and externally by the retailer. The results of three laboratory studies indicate that for familiar categories, congruency between a consumer's internal categorization structure and the external store layout leads to higher perceptions of variety and higher satisfaction with product choices, while for unfamiliar product categories, congruency. between shopping goals and external structure leads to lower perceptions of variety but increased satisfaction with the store's assortment. However, if retailers institute external category filters congruent with consumers' internal shopping goals that allow them to bypass products, consumers have both lower variety perceptions and satisfaction with the assortment offering.

TI The competitive impact of service process improvement: Examining
   customers' waiting experiences in retail markets
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In this paper, we investigate the impact of a service process improvement in front-end retail operations on the waiting experiences of shared customers, that is, those customers who patronize a retailer as well as its competitors. Our findings from two studies-a field study and a controlled laboratory experiment-suggest that while customers' waiting time perceptions are independent across competing firms, their waiting time satisfaction is interdependent. As a result, the impact of a retailer's service improvement initiative that reduces waiting times is not merely local to the retailer but propagates to its competitors through its shared customers. Specifically, such an improvement not only raises shared customers' satisfaction with the focal retailer, it also concurrently lowers their satisfaction with the retailer's competitors. By implication, current approaches that assess the impact of a service process improvement by just measuring the difference in customer satisfaction before and after the improvement may be underestimating the true impact of such improvements.

   online auctions?
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Manufacturers and retailers are using online auctions to liquidate excess inventory. Using a field study of 11,879 online auctions, this paper builds upon theories of competitive processes to relate four key seller-controlled variables (starting price, day of close, auction length, and brand) to outcomes of online auction for apparel goods. Results suggest that to obtain a higher percentage of the original retail price, retailers should start with a lower price and feature national brands. These and other findings are discussed and a number of future research topics are offered. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Category-specific coupon proneness: The impact of individual
   characteristics and category-specific variables
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In seeking to enhance the effectiveness of coupon promotions, researchers have long sought to identify "coupon prone" consumers. Previous measures of coupon proneness have not examined differences in coupon usage across product categories and have ignored the confounding effect of coupon attractiveness. An Item Response Theory (IRT)-based framework overcomes these limitations and yields category-specific estimates of propensity to redeem coupons that are independent of coupon attractiveness. The authors utilize an IRT-based model to estimate consumers' category-specific propensities to redeem coupons for two product and two service categories, and investigate how coupon proneness varies across consumers and across categories as a function of individual characteristics and category-specific variables.
   The authors find that category-specific measures of propensity to redeem coupons achieve an average accuracy of 89 percent in predicting redemption intentions. Propensity to redeem coupons is also found to be related to category-specific brand loyalty and perceived coupon availability, as well as to individual characteristics such as general coupon proneness, value consciousness and price consciousness. These findings highlight the importance of studying coupon proneness at the category level and suggest that the IRT-based approach has considerable promise as a methodology for studying coupon usage. Using the approach proposed in this study, marketers can forecast the impact coupons are likely to have in their particular category, rather than relying on general coupon proneness measures to predict coupon redemption rates at the category level. The study's findings can also be used to identify categories and consumer segments where coupon promotions are likely to have a larger impact, and have important implications for managers planning joint couponing strategies.

TI Removing the contextual lens: A multinational, multi-setting comparison
   of service evaluation models
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Four service evaluation models are identified from the literature that are commonly offered to depict the relationships amongst the primary service evaluation constructs of sacrifice, service quality, service value, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions. We comparatively test the models using samples of service consumers in Australia, Hong Kong, Morocco, the Netherlands, and the United States, as well as across varied temporal and service settings. The results of the comparative analyses reveal that one conceptualization, the "comprehensive" model, best captures the identified relationships. This model is the best fitting across all countries and settings, which indicates it has the greatest external validity. These findings are discussed relative to the limitations associated with the use of less generalizable models. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The effects of merchandise coordination and juxtaposition on consumers'
   product evaluation and purchase intention in store-based retailing
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Many retailers attempt to juxtapose and coordinate complementary products in their stores on the basis of key attributes because good coordination of complementary items can provide consumers with relevant information for their evaluation of individual products. In addition, the aesthetic appeal and the social impression that good coordination offers can be transferred to the products themselves. On the basis of these theories, the authors test the effects of merchandise coordination and juxtaposition (vs. separation) on consumer behavior using actual clothing items as stimuli in a laboratory setting. The authors find that coordination affects consumers' evaluation of and purchase intention toward a target item only when the item is juxtaposed with a complementary item. This effect can be explained by the aesthetic response of consumers to and their social impression of a grouping of the items. Furthermore, in comparison with displaying the two items separately, juxtaposing them in a poorly coordinated manner appears to depress the target item's evaluation, though juxtaposing them in a well-coordinated manner does not seem to improve the evaluation.

TI Internet versus bricks-and-mortar retailers: An investigation into
   intangibility and its consequences
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Intangibility has long been studied as a unidimensional construct with the focus being placed upon the physical element. This paper explores the effects of three unique intangibility dimensions on a consumer's ability to evaluate goods and services, and the perceived risk (PR) associated with the transaction. The authors examine these relationships in purchase environments that include both traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers and the Internet. Their investigation further incorporates prior knowledge as a moderating factor into the proposed framework. This allows for a thorough comparison of the effects and relationships that exist between intangibility and its consequences in general, evaluation difficulty (ED) and perceived risk (PR) in particular. The authors develop hypotheses pertaining to the proposed model and test them with two experiments. The empirical results are broadly supportive of the hypotheses. Theoretical and managerial implications to the services marketing literature are discussed. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of low price guarantees on consumer post-purchase search
   intention: The moderating roles of value consciousness and penalty level
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB While past research has focused on pre-purchase effects of low price guarantee (LPG), the present paper examines probable post-purchase consequences of such signals. Results of an experiment indicate that in an effort to enhance value from a purchase, consumers are more likely to engage in post-purchase search for lower prices when a purchase is made under an LPG. The experiment also indicates that presence of an LPG encourages post-purchase search intention only for consumers who are highly motivated to enhance value. Furthermore, it is seen that an LPG that offers higher refund leads to higher post-purchase search intention and this effect is also stronger for consumers with high concerns for enhancing value. The paper discusses several important implications of these findings for signaling theory and LPG-related retailing strategy. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI The current and future sales impact of a retail frequency reward program
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This research presents an empirical study of the impact of a retail frequency reward program on store sales. We examine both the "points pressure," or short-term impact, and the "rewarded behavior," or long-term impact. The points-pressure impact is due to forward-looking customers increasing their purchase levels in order to earn the reward. The rewarded-behavior impact is evidenced as purchases above baseline levels after an individual has received a reward and could result from either behavioral learning reinforcement or positive affect resulting from the reward. We investigate a turkey reward program that awarded free turkeys to shoppers who accumulated the required sales levels during an 8-week period. We find both a points-pressure and rewarded-behavior impact. These effects are statistically significant and managerially relevant in that the program is apparently profitable. The points-pressure impact is especially strong among customers who do not place value on frequent shopper programs that in general deliver immediate price discounts. The key implications are that frequency reward programs of the form, "buy x, then receive xx" can be profitable, are segmentation strategies, and can complement a store's overall frequent shopper program.

Both the affiliated private value model and a reference price explanation explain seller earnings.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB What consumers know or think they know about stores' relative price levels is an important research area from both a societal as well as a retail perspective. This study investigates the determinants of objective as well as subjective store-price knowledge. Using structural equation modeling, the effects of price consciousness, income, education, and three forms of price-related experience on the two knowledge dimensions, as well as the relationship between objective and subjective knowledge, are tested. Whereas out-of-store price search had positive effects on both subjective and objective price knowledge, the two other types of experience, number of stores shopped, and length of residence in the market only affected objective price knowledge, indicating that the two knowledge dimensions are determined differently. Furthermore, price consciousness had a larger effect on subjective than on objective knowledge. Finally, subjective and objective store-price knowledge were not significantly related in this study.

TI Profiling the reference price consumer
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Researchers in marketing have devoted considerable attention to understanding how price impacts the purchase decision. Some individuals, termed memory-based reference price (MBR) consumers. take into account price expectations developed from past purchase behavior when making a current choice. Other individuals, termed stimulus-based reference price (SBR) consumers. make choices by constructing a reference point from the currently observed distribution of prices. Using a latent class model of structural heterogeneity applied to purchase histories from the toilet tissue category, we classify households in terms of the pricing mechanism used in buying decisions. We find strong evidence that memory-based (internal) reference price consumers are more price sensitive than other consumers. Moreover, we find that variables associated with the accessibility of price information are predictive of consumer use of memory-based reference prices. Managerial implications of these results are discussed. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We empirically study the effects of shipping fees and marketing activities on customer acquisition, customer retention, and average expenditures using data from an online grocer. We find that shipping fees greatly influence order incidence rates and graduated shipping fees significantly affect average expenditures. The analysis indicates that customer acquisition is more sensitive to order size incentives while retention is more influenced by base shipping fee levels. Furthermore, a profitability analysis suggests that shipping policies that provide incentives for larger order sizes may outperform free shipping promotions and standard increasing fees structures.

   outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB By incorporating distrust as a distinct entity from trust, the current study proposes a mechanism by which trust and distrust are formed and manifested in behavioral intentions in the context of business-to-consumer (B2C) Internet exchange relationships. Specifically this paper investigates the way consumers' evaluations of an e-vendor's business operations relate to their judgments of trustworthiness (i.e., competence and benevolence of the e-vendor) and how such judgments shape consumer trust and distrust. This paper also examines two different behavioral intentions (i.e., consumers' self-disclosure and willingness to commit) as outcomes of consumer trust and distrust. The proposed relationships are tested across two online purchasing contexts, books and clothing. Our framework receives strong support from the data. In particular, results support the proposition that trust and distrust are shaped by different dimensions of trustworthiness, and trust affects behavior intentions differently from distrust.

By exploring the narratives of consumers with visual impairments, consumer normalcy is shown to be an important value of shopping implicit in discussions of shopping experiences. The informants often achieve consumer normalcy, which they reveal consists of four dimensions: participating or being-in-the-marketplace (I am here), achieving distinction through the marketplace (I am me), demonstrating competence and control (I am in control), and being perceived as an equal in the marketplace (I belong). The consumer normalcy construct reveals to readers how shopping experiences contribute to identity and the tension between acceptance by others and individual agency. Reality differs between informants. but their collective realities inform how consumers realize their self and consumption aspirations by shopping (c) 2005 New York University.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retail performance is driven in part by a retailer's ability to not only develop knowledge resources, but also convert these resources into the dynamic capability of market responsiveness. The results of this study add to the growing literature on dynamic capabilities by showing that the management orientation of entrepreneurial proclivity not only aids in the accumulation of knowledge resources. but can aid (as well as hinder) the conversion of these resources into dynamic capabilities. Specifically, we show that the management orientation of entrepreneurial proclivity increases the accumulation of knowledge resources, in addition to enhancing the conversion of one knowledge resource (knowledge of suppliers) in the capability of market responsiveness. However, this same management orientation also diminishes the conversion of another knowledge resource (knowledge of regulatory agencies). The results are based on a survey of 269 small retailers.

   relationship and their impact on performance
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Managing the distribution channel is a key concern to firms operating in the world's largest developing economy. This study examines channel exchange relationships in China using data on department stores' relationship with their tenants. The power-satisfaction-commitment-performance framework was used as a basis for the study. Department stores' contingent use of coercive power was found to have little or no effect on their tenants' economic and social satisfaction, which suggests that coercive power is perceived as 'legitimate' by small and medium-sized retailers in China. Tenants' behavior towards power also reflects a subtle difference in channel member behavior, which reflects the differences between China's collectivistic culture and the individualistic culture in many Western countries. This study adds to the existing knowledge on channel behavior in Chinese cultural setting. In addition, it tests the degree of cross-cultural generalization of established channel constructs. It also provides managerial insights on channel relationship management in China's market. (c) 2005 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The 99 price ending as a signal of a low-price appeal
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB There is evidence that the rightmost digits, or endings, of retail prices can communicate meanings to consumers. To better understand how such meanings are formed, this paper addresses the question of how the 99 price ending can have a low-price meaning even though 99-ending prices tend to be higher rather than lower competitive prices. Analysis of two large samples of newspaper price advertising indicates that there is a strong and robust correlation between the use of the 99 price ending and the presence of a low-price appeal such as a claimed discount. It is suggested that the salience of price advertising leads it to dominate other sources of information in the consumer's learning of price-ending meanings. (c) 2005 New York University.

TI Private label positioning: Quality versus feature differentiation from
   the national brand
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This paper investigates the retailer's problem of positioning her private label against two national brands in terms of both product quality and product features. Using a demand function derived from consumer utility, we show that the private label's best positioning strategy depends on the nature of the national brands' competition and its own quality. When the national brands are differentiated. a high quality private label should position closer to a stronger national brand, and a low quality private label should position closer to a weaker national brand. When the national brands are undifferentiated, the private label should differentiate from both national brands. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Semantic cues in reference price advertisements: The moderating role of
   cue concreteness
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailers use a variety of semantic cues to advertise discounts at their stores. In this paper we introduce the concept of cue concreteness and examine its impact on effectiveness of semantic cues. Four studies were conducted which concur with the findings of earlier research in this area and expand our knowledge about the effectiveness of semantic cues. Results indicate that between-store cues are perceived to be more effective than within-store cues at moderate price discount levels only when the cues are concrete in nature. In addition, a between-store cue resulted in more favorable evaluations than a within-store cue when the ad was viewed at home, but only when the cue was concrete. Implications for marketers and public policy makers are discussed. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Offering low price guarantees to improve customer retention
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Major retailers in the USA offer money back guarantees (MBGs) under which they return money to dissatisfied customers. Some of these retailers also offer low price guarantees (LPGs) under which they promise to refund price differences if buyers find a lower price after purchase. Some researchers have argued that LPGs should be legally challenged because they limit price competition and contribute to higher prices. This paper shows that adding an LPG to an MBG can help improve economic efficiency as both retailer loss and customer hassle costs from excessive returns are reduced. This reduction serves as a counter argument against those who believe that LPGs should be prohibited. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Retailer interest was found to have a significant main effect on looking forward to visiting the retailer again, loyalty, positive word of mouth, and a desire to learn more about the retailer, even while modeling the influence on satisfaction on these variables. Retailer interest was also found to have a significant interaction with satisfaction in predicting repatronage intentions and positive word of mouth.

TI Do reward programs build loyalty for services? The moderating effect of
   satisfaction on type and timing of rewards
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB While reward programs have been widely used as a means to engender customer loyalty, it is not clear if the ends are justified. Some researchers argue that we do not fully understand the mechanism underlying reward programs and how it affects consumer acceptability of such programs. In this study, we examine two variables; timing (immediate vs. delayed) and type (direct vs. indirect) of rewards in two service conditions (satisfied vs. dissatisfied). We conduct the experiment in two service settings and the results indicate that when consumers are satisfied, they prefer delayed, direct rewards (of higher values) to immediate, direct rewards. However, when consumers are dissatisfied, they prefer immediate, direct rewards to delayed, direct rewards (of higher values). Interestingly, the preference for direct over indirect rewards is apparent only if the rewards are delayed (for the satisfactory service experience) or immediate (for the dissatisfactory service experience).

TI From Fatwallet to eBay: An investigation of online deal-forums and sales
   promotions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Sales promotions are an important part of retail advertising strategy. Traditionally, research on sales promotions has generally assumed that the buyers are end consumers who do not engage in reselling, in large part due to high transaction costs. However. the recent Internet related technologies have dramatically lowered the cost of transferring goods between consumers, leading to relative ease of reselling activity amongst individual consumers. Little is known about the impact of this phenomenon on retailer's sales promotion strategy. In this research we investigate the reselling activity in online auctions for products that active deal seekers can obtain at deeply discounted prices from retailers. We further investigate the role of deal-forums in the resale process. Data is collected from an online deal-forum (http://www.fatwallet.com/) and eBay to test various reselling-related hypotheses. The results show that there is a significant abnormal increase in the number of newly posted auctions of a product after the deal information of this product is posted on deal-forum website. We also find that there is a significant price incentive for individuals to resell. The implications for sales promotion research and practice are discussed. (c) 2006 New York University.

TI Paying before consuming: Examining the robustness of consumers'
   preference for prepayment
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Prior research on consumers' preference for timing of payment suggests that consumers prefer to prepay for certain kinds of purchases (e.g., vacations) and postpay for others (e.g., washer dryers). This research extends this finding by first comparing preference for timing of payment for products that vary by type (hedonic vs. utilitarian) and durability (nondurable vs. durable) to reveal that it is only hedonic-nondurable products that elicit a preference for prepayment (study 1). The two studies that follow examine the robustness of the prepayment preference by (1) varying the favorability of the transaction (study 2), and, (2) by eliminating the choice of payment timing from the transaction (study 3). Results reveal that the preference for prepayment for hedonic-nondurable goods is robust when transaction characteristics are favorable but shifts when transaction characteristics are unfavorable. Furthermore, when the choice of payment timing is not offered, consumers become indifferent towards when they prefer to pay for hedonic-nondurable products. The implications of these findings for marketers and retailers are discussed. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB In the first of two experiments, the estimated duration of a given interval was shorter when familiar as opposed to unfamiliar music was played, but only for respondents waiting idly; music had little or no effect on respondents engaged in a memory task during the interval. In the second experiment, respondents waiting idly again reported shorter estimates of duration when they heard familiar as opposed to unfamiliar music, but only when they heard a sufficient number of songs during the interval. On the other hand, respondents engaged in a memory task reported longer estimates of duration when they heard familiar as opposed to unfamiliar music, but again only when they heard a sufficient number of songs. These results are consistent with attentional (i.e., waiting condition) versus discrete events (i.e., memory task condition) models of duration judgments, respectively.

TI The effect of sales promotion on post-promotion brand preference: A
   meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The benefit of sales promotions is that they induce choice. However, this benefit may be offset by undermining preference for the brand when it is no longer promoted. Despite the fact that sales promotions have long been employed in marketing practice and researched academically, a clear understanding of the impact of sales promotion on post-promotion brand preference continues to evade brand managers and marketing scholars alike. This manuscript attempts to provide insight on the effects of sales promotions on brand preference by integrating results from 51 studies on the subject. Our meta-analysis suggests that, on average, sales promotions do not affect post-promotion brand preference. However, depending upon characteristic of the sales promotion and the promoted product, promotions can either increase or decrease preference for a brand. The empirical results provide insights for crafting promotion strategy and for understanding the process by which promotions influence brand preference. (c) 2006 New York University.

TI Opportunities for active stock-out management in online stores: The
   impact of the stock-out policy on online stock-out reactions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This paper investigates the impact of an online retailer's stock-out policy on consumers' category purchase and choice decisions. We investigate three different policies: (1) stock-outs are immediately visible and there are no replacement suggestions, (2) stock-outs are only visible after purchase attempts and (3) stock-outs are immediately visible but a replacement item is suggested. Results from an online grocery shopping experiment reveal that the adopted stock-out policy has a significant impact on both decisions. Making stock-outs not immediately visible creates confusion and intensifies the consumer's loss experience, thereby reducing the tendency to buy in the category. Suggesting a replacement item, in contrast, facilitates the substitution decision and slightly reduces the purchase cancellation rate. It also substantially increases the suggested item's choice probability. Yet, this effect disappears when higher-priced - suspicious - items are suggested. Overall, these results indicate that online grocery retailers have an interest in pursuing open and convenience-oriented stock-out policies. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Low price guarantees as signals of lowest price: The moderating role of
   perceived price dispersion
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This article presents two experimental studies examining the effects of a low price guarantee on consumers' pre-purchase evaluations and behavioral intentions. The authors first examine how the effects of a low price guarantee are moderated by consumer perception of market price dispersion. The results show that low price guarantee effects are likely to be attenuated when consumers perceive market price dispersion for a product to be high. The second study shows that higher levels of penalty can help restore a low price guarantee's effectiveness. Specifically, a low price guarantee with progressively higher levels of penalty leads to incrementally more favorable effects on key consumer outcomes when perceived price dispersion is high. Interestingly, penalty level has no such incremental benefit in case of low perceived price dispersion. Theoretical and managerial implications of the authors' findings, the limitations of the studies, and future research opportunities are discussed. (c) 2006 New York University.

AB This paper offers a property rights theoretical interpretation of the ownership redirection hypothesis advanced by Oxenfeldt and Kelly [Oxenfeldt, Alfred R. and Kelly, Anthony O. (1968). "Will Successful Franchise Systems Ultimately Become Wholly-owned Chains?", Journal of Retailing, 44, 69-83]. In a nutshell, couched in resource dependence theory, the ownership redirection hypothesis argues that successful franchise systems will eventually become corporate owned systems because of the reacquisition of franchisee units by the more powerful, and resource-flush franchisors. We argue that the structure and dynamics of ownership patterns in franchising networks depends on the contractibility of the franchisor's system-specific assets and the contractibility of the franchisee's local market assets. Under the property rights view, ownership redirection will result from an increase in the contractibility of the franchisee's local market assets (local market information, financial resources, and managerial capabilities) and the resultant increase of the franchisor's bargaining power during the contract period. We extend the franchise literature by arguing that informational, financial and managerial resource constraints are only relevant for the change of ownership structure if they are noncontractible. This hypothesis is evaluated using data collected from the Austrian franchise sector. The empirical results are largely supportive of the hypothesis. (c) 2006 New York University.

TI Managing retailer profitability - one customer at a time!
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study examines how customer lifetime value (CLV) can be computed at individual customer level in a retail setting to maximize profitability. The study finds that maximum positive impact to CLV occurs when the customer cross-purchases, shows multi-channel shopping behavior, stays longer with the firm, buys specific product categories and purchases more frequently with the firm. Interestingly, the CLV follows an inverted U relationship with increase in return of prior purchases. Other interesting findings include a surprisingly low correlation between customer loyalty and future profitability and low correlation between stores' historic revenues and future profitability. Several implications are suggested for retailers to manage and maximize customer profitability as well as store profitability. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Effects of prior brand usage and promotion on consumer promotional
   response
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We examine how prior purchases influence consumer response to promotional activity in brand choice decisions. To improve understanding of the nature of this influence, we separate previous purchases into those on promotion and those not on promotion, and consider their differential impact on subsequent brand choices. Impact may be observed at the brand level, category level, or both and we suggest circumstances in which each might occur. Across four product categories, consumer sensitivity to price, price promotions, and feature advertisements increases for all brands in the product category following a promotional purchase but also decreases for the most recently purchased brand. The magnitudes of the results indicate that prior promotional purchases influence choice more than prior brand usage does. We offer managerial recommendations regarding promotional activities, for both retailers and manufacturers. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Consumers' responses to price presentation formats in rebate
   advertisements
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Although rebates offer an important and popular promotion tool in retailing, little research has investigated whether their presentation format can influence consumers' evaluations of and purchase intentions toward products featured in rebate ads. Retailers generally use two different rebate ad formats: one that transparently shows both before- and after-rebate prices and the other that displays the after-rebate price in relatively large print and the before-rebate price in small print. Three experimental studies attempt to determine which format is more effective for eliciting favorable consumers' responses, and the results show that the format emphasizing only after-rebate prices generally leads to lower purchase intentions because of the negative affect it elicits. Furthermore, the effect of a rebate presentation format is moderated by the rebate amount, consumers' price knowledge, and rebate processing time. The results show that consumers' responses to different rebate presentation formats entail both emotional responses and rational evaluations.

This study introduces polychronic-orientation, or an employee's preference for switching between multiple tasks within the same time-block, as an employee trait with important implications for retail employee turnover. It demonstrates empirically that a polychronic-orientation has both direct (employee fit) and indirect (through fairness perceptions) effects on retail employee satisfaction. Moreover, by exploring these effects across career stages, polychronicity is revealed to be a stable and enduring trait but one whose impact is magnified in early stages of the retail career. Implications for hiring and employee education are derived. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Exploring the impact of online privacy disclosures on consumer trust
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We explore the impact of privacy disclosures on online shoppers' trust in an e-tailer through a two-phase study. In the first study, we use a between-subjects factorial design to test whether the presence of an online privacy policy influences consumer trust and find that consumers are likely to respond more favorably to a shopping site with a clearly stated privacy message than to one without it, especially when privacy risk is high. In our second experiment, we examine the effects of different forms of privacy disclosures. The results suggest that online shoppers find a short, straightforward privacy statement more comprehensible than a lengthy, legalistic one. However, how a privacy policy is presented (in terms of wording) does not affect a shopper's trust in the store to any significant degree. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A pilot study is conducted to verify the existence of the search regret construct and to identify its potential antecedents and consequences. A conceptual model is then presented and tested. Based on the results, implications for retailers as well as suggestions for future research relating to search regret are discussed. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Retailer-buyer supplier relationships: The Japanese difference
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The purpose of this study, which draws data from a national survey of Japanese retail buyers, is to provide insight into how culture influences channel relationships and to suggest how non-Japanese partners can facilitate long-term relationships. Results indicate that Japanese retailer long-term orientation with a supplier is an antecedent to trust, economic dependence and satisfaction with the supplier rather than an outcome of these constructs. This study implies that Japanese retailers are expected to look out for the best interests of their partners, rather than continuously seek new partners, and, further, partners learn to negotiate differences rather than seek dissolution of the relationship.

TI Adding consumer behavior insights to category management: Improving item
   placement decisions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Although practitioners attribute significant sales growth to category management, many believe more potential ties untapped. This paper suggests improvements through the use of consumer behavior research as a supplement to point-of-purchase scanner information. In particular, we outline several concepts and theories with special promise in six decision areas of category management, suggesting opportunities for both future research and industry application. An empirical demonstration of one such opportunity is presented showing how two consumer behavior concepts - context effects and categorization theory - reveal insights relevant to item placement decisions within category management that would not be revealed by scanner data.

TI Multi-channel service retailing: The effects of channel performance
   satisfaction on behavioral intentions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The number of channels that retailers can use interchangeably to provide customer service has increased. We report on a study of clients of a large retail bank that investigates the channel performance satisfaction-behavioral intentions relationship when the traditional service channel (i.e., branch office) is extended with technology-mediated channels (i.e., internet banking and telephone banking). For routine services, our findings suggest that behavioral intentions are most strongly influenced by satisfaction with office-related performance factors. For nonroutine services, satisfaction with service employee performance is the most significant driver of intentions. Our analysis also reveals interaction effects between traditional and technology-mediated channel performance satisfaction levels. These effects vary across service types, indicating contingencies in channel substitution and complementarity. (c) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of customer service on retailers' shareholder wealth: The
   role of availability and reputation cues
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Retailer customer service has been shown to lead to increases in consumer attraction and retention, but what is less apparent is whether shareholders are fully rewarded for retailers' customer service efforts. Results from an event study on 48 retailer announcements of customer service strategies indicate that customer service increases retailer market values by 1.09 percent on average. The magnitude of this abnormal return suggests that customer service is one of the more effective ways for firms to create shareholder wealth. Further, analysis of the abnormal returns suggests that the shareholder value created by the retailer's customer service is affected by the heuristics and cues used to judge the likelihood of service delivery. Consistent with the availability heuristic, we find that services that are difficult to bring to mind and non-vivid services create significantly less shareholder value. Results further show that the retailer's reputation can also significantly inhibit the customer service's shareholder wealth creation. (C) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI An assessment of value creation in mobile service delivery and the
   moderating role of time consciousness
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This study focuses on the perceived utilitarian value of a new service delivery mode, the mobile channel. The authors develop a framework that incorporates three mode-specific benefits - time convenience, user control, and service compatibility - as well as two costs - perceived risk and cognitive effort - as antecedents of perceived value. Because of the pervasiveness of time criticality as a value-added characteristic of the mobile channel, they also investigate the moderating influence of consumers' time consciousness. They empirically investigate the model using mobile brokerage services as an illustrative application. The results reveal that the identified antecedents, with the exception of service compatibility, have a strong impact on mobile channel value perceptions, which in turn influence behavioral intentions. The authors also find that time consciousness moderates the aforementioned relationships. (C) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The implications of this research are meant to stimulate a new research stream towards a theory of customer reacquisition management as well as to provide service firms with a framework to regain defected customers. Through two studies, we develop an empirical model that identifies the factors driving win-back offer effectiveness. The findings indicate that, in order for win-back offers to be effective, service providers must consider a customer's reasons for leaving and their relationships with the current service provider. Value determinants (price and service benefits provided in the win-back offer), social capital and service importance play a prominent role in shaping customer switch-back intentions regardless of the level of previous satisfaction, regret, or delight with the new service provider.

TI The impact of code switching on service encounters
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Many service retailers, particularly those competing on speed of service with standardized encounters of short duration, rely on scripts to keep both employees and customers on-task and service operations running smoothly. While the benefits of such scripts are well known, what happens when customers do not stay on script? The authors analyze more than 2,000 service encounters and find evidence of two types of code switching suggested by sociolinguists: language and dialect. In addition, the concept of brand codes, the idiosyncratic terminology used in a service provider's script, is introduced. While on-script encounters are preferred, language code switching can also have positive outcomes at little cost to organizational efficiency. In contrast, dialect and brand code switching subvert the service script with negative consequences. Brand code switching is found to be particularly problematic for small market players attempting to compete against market leaders. (C) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Interactional service failures in a pseudorelationship: The role of
   organizational attributions
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB The current research investigates customer responses to interactional service failures, such as a service provider who is rude or inattentive, or unfriendly. We study interactional failures within pseudorelationships, which exist when a customer interacts repeatedly with the same firm but encounters different employees across service occasions. Empirical results demonstrate that customers' responses to these interactional failures distinguish between the offending employee and the organization. Dissatisfaction with the organization critically depends on the customer's attribution of globality-how widespread the interactional failure is throughout the organization. Globality attributions and dissatisfaction with the organization can be lowered by excellent past experience with the organization; however, that same positive experience increases dissatisfaction with the offending employee. Thus, customers' discrimination of the organization and employee in a pseudorelationship can work in the organization's favor after an interactional failure, and managing customers' attributions of globality should be a managerial priority.

TI Understanding brand and dealer retention in the new car market: The
   moderating role of brand tier
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Dealers may contribute to brand retention through their sales and service efforts. In this study we investigate the degree to which dealers contribute to brand retention and how this contribution is moderated by brand tier. To this end we distinguish between economy, volume and prestige brands. We also investigate how the effectiveness of dealer instruments to increase dealer retention differs across these brand tiers. We collected data on brand retention and dealer retention among consumers who recently purchased a new car. Our findings show that dealers selling volume brands are able to improve brand retention rates. In contrast, dealers of prestige and economy brands are unable to affect brand retention. In line with the notion of brand-dealer fit we also find that the effects of dealer extrinsic service quality and dealer payment equity on dealer retention differ between prestige, volume, and economy brands. Extrinsic dealer service quality has the smallest effect for dealers selling economy brands, while dealer payment equity is the most important determinant of dealer retention for these dealers.

TI The role of pleasant music in servicescapes: A test of the dual model of
   environmental perception
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB This article explores the psychological processes by which background music in servicescapes influences service evaluation and purchase intention. Drawing on the dual model of environmental perception, it is hypothesized that: (1) servicescape is perceived in an ambient holistic manner and serves as the background for perceptions of the provider and thereby has direct and provider-mediated effects on outcomes; (2) the presence of music influences outcomes because it reinforces the holistic quality of the servicescape, makes the provider stand out, and moderates the contribution of provider-mediated servicescape effects; (3) when pleasant music is present, a double-mediating process fully accounts for the impact of variations in the music valence, such that music valence gets transferred into servicescape attitude, which then exercises direct and provider-mediated effects on service outcomes. Two experimental studies in real and online environments support the above research hypotheses. (C) 2006 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Employee versus supervisor ratings of performance in the retail customer
   service sector: Differences in predictive validity for customers
   outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Based on data from Maxham and Netemeyer [Maxham, J. G. and R. G. Netemeyer (2003). "Firms Reap What They Sow: The Effects of Employee Shared Values and Perceived Organizational Justice on Customer Evaluations of Complaint Handling," Journal of Marketing, 67, 46-62], the authors present two field samples to examine predictive validity differences of service employee ratings of their performance versus supervisor ratings of employee performance with respect to customer satisfaction and customer likelihood of spreading positive word-of-mouth (WOM) after a service recovery attempt. The results generally show that supervisor ratings are more strongly positively related to customer satisfaction and WOM than are employee ratings of their own performances. The results also show that both supervisor ratings and employee ratings are related to customer satisfaction and WOM in a curvilinear fashion (as well as linear fashion). Employee extra-role performances (toward customers and the firm) show increasing returns at the higher levels of performance, and employee in-role customer performance generally shows a decreasing return at the higher level of customer in-role performance.
   These results suggest two managerial implications. First, supervisor ratings of customer service employee performances may be the preferred form of measurement for predicting customer outcomes. Second, maximizing in-role performance inputs may have decreasing returns for customer evaluations in the service recovery context; but maximizing extra-role performance inputs may actually "delight" customers, i.e., increasing returns for customer evaluations.

TI Multiple reference effects in service evaluations: Roles of alternative
   attractiveness and self-image congruity
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB Customer satisfaction and service evaluation research has examined the reference effect but largely adopted an expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm that focuses on referents centered on the product or service in question. This study examines two additional reference effects, alternative attractiveness and self-image congruity, and their interaction. The framework of multiple reference effects in service evaluations integrates insights from regret theory, the investment model of interpersonal relationships, and self-image congruity theory. An empirical study of a hairstyling service confirms that comparisons involving other-object and self-based reference points contribute significantly to consumer service evaluations. Self-image congruity has the most significant impact on both customer satisfaction and commitment judgments. In general, the negative effect of alternative attractiveness on both customer satisfaction and commitment becomes weaker as the level of self-image congruity increases; as long as consumers find a good fit between their self-image and the service image, they are less likely to consider alternative services. However, for consumers with high self-image congruity with the focal service, the presence of an attractive alternative may induce them to exhibit an enhancement bias or "play up" effect (i.e., report higher satisfaction with the focal service).

TI Chain-wide and store-level analysis for cross-category management
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB When planning and implementing their price-promotions strategy, retail chain managers face the typical dilemma of "thinking globally, but acting locally." In other words, they must plan their strategy, keeping in mind the global chain-level impact of their promotions, to deliver on the commitments made to manufacturers. At the same time, managers need to make sure that the implementation of such strategy takes into account the fact that each store caters to a different market with different needs and responses to marketing programs. Moreover, the retail chain manager must consider not only how the promotion of a brand affects competing brands and total category sales, but also how it could affect sales in other categories.
   Our proposed model addresses these two important aspects of chain-wide and store-level cross-category analysis. First, our proposed factor-regression model takes store differences and longitudinal market shifts into account, thereby providing the retail chain manager with unbiased global, chain-level estimates. It also provides stable local estimates of cross-category promotion effects at the store level. Second, while allowing this flexibility, our proposed model is parsimonious enough over existing alternatives, making it particularly useful for chain-wide and store-level cross-category analysis.
   We apply the proposed model to store-level data from one retail chain, comparing it with several competing approaches, and demonstrate that it provides the best balance between flexibility and parsimony. Most importantly, we show that the proposed model provides useful insights regarding cross-category effects at the chain-level, for individual stores, and their patterns across stores.

TI The role of warehouse club membership fee in retail competition
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB There are several explanations as to why warehouse clubs charge membership fees and how the fees play a role in the competitive landscape of the retail grocery market. We provide another insight into the nature of the membership fee using a model of price competition between a warehouse club and a supermarket. We show that the warehouse club's membership fee is an optimal competitive reaction to the supermarket's promotional activity. The more frequent the promotion is, the lower is the membership fee. However, the larger the promotion depth is, the higher is the fee. We show that the cherry-picker segment plays a key role behind these results. Our analysis not only provides a justification of warehouse club membership fees by discovering its duality with the cherry-picker segment but also gives managers several guidelines on yearly fee and retail prig e decisions.

TI Retail environment and manufacturer competitive intensity
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING
AB We study how the intensity of competition and the degree to which manufacturers enjoy market power depends on the retail environment in a given market. Past research has discussed the growing importance of retailers and the power they enjoy over manufacturers. Yet, the empirical literature to date has not determined which retail characteristics have the largest impact on competitive behavior.
   Our starting point is it e estimation of a structural demand-and-supply model, where both consumers' decisions and the strategic interactions between manufacturers and retailers are explicitly modeled. We identify the type of competitive behavior of manufacturers by measuring the deviation from a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium. This measure of competitive conduct is expressed as a function of key retail characteristics such as size of the retailer, its assortment depth, and category expertise.
   We illustrate the proposed approach using data for the ground coffee category in Germany. Our findings indicate that retail characteristics have indeed a significant effect on competitive intensity among upstream firms and on their ability to exercise market power. Hence, a manufacturer considering entry into a new market should not only take into account its competitors but also the specifics of the retail environment in this market.

In the research, a series of studies were conducted to develop and validate a knowledge measure designed to assess pricing tactic persuasion knowledge (PTPK). Consistent with the persuasion knowledge model, individuals with higher levels of PTPK were shown to have more knowledge-related thoughts regarding pricing tactic information than those with low levels of PTPK. Additionally, pricing tactic persuasion knowledge was shown to be more predictive of consumer choices regarding quantity surcharge offers and purchase interest evaluations following exposure to tensile claim offers (e.g., "Save up to 50 percent Off") than several competing constructs.

The findings suggest that loyalty schemes have positive effects on customer lifetimes and share of consumer expenditures. However, multiple loyalty card memberships of geographically close retailers reduce lifetime duration. Furthermore, the higher the share of consumer expenditures in a store, the longer the lifetime duration will be. (C) 2007 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Retailers can benefit from allowing customers to touch their products. The influence of tactile input on evaluation, however, remains undemonstrated in the literature. In four experiments, effects of tactile input were observed for product categories wherein tactile input was diagnostic, and depended on product quality. While this effect was moderated by individual differences in need for touch when there was no opportunity for multiple product comparisons, there was no support for a mediating role of affect. Implications for retailing theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2007 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
