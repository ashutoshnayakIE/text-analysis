AB This study examines online commercial group chat from a structuration
   theory perspective. The findings support the influence of perceived
   technology attributes (control, enjoyment, reliability, speed, and ease
   of use) and chat group characteristics (group involvement, similarity,
   and receptivity) on customer satisfaction and the moderating role of
   advisor communication style on these influences. Furthermore, our
   results show that chat group characteristics influence customer
   satisfaction directly as well as indirectly via perceived technology
   attributes. Online chat satisfaction in turn influences behavioral
   intentions. Finally, group-level perceptions are found to add
   considerably to perceptions at the individual level. Our study
   illustrates that structuration theory provides a sound foundation for
   theoretical development and empirical investigation of online group
   chat. Also it shows that retailers need to carefully manage the
   intricate interplay between technology, chat groups, and online advisors
   to foster a satisfying experience for customers. (c) 2007 New York

AB Recent developments in marketing thought and practice highlight the
   opportunities that co-production of services provide for creating
   customer value. The authors propose a model of co-production with which
   they investigate the links between co-production and customer loyalty
   and the factors likely to increase the level of co-production in a
   financial services context, with support from an investigation in the
   medical services context. Further, the authors consider the
   relationships of customer expertise, customer-advisor communication,
   customer affective commitment, and interactional justice with the level
   of co-production. On the basis of testing with a sample of 1, 197
   customers of a large multinational financial services organization and
   100 patients of medical services, the model is partially supported.
   Therefore, the authors suggest that co-production may have an important
   role as a basis for competition in the financial services industry. (c)

AB Introducing a "disruptive" technology into an existing service market
   provides new opportunities for firms and customers, often altering the
   nature of the market. Consequently, new technology often destabilizes
   market equilibrium, forcing firms to consider the role new technology
   will play in determining the new market structure. In this paper, we
   focus on understanding how significant new technology forces firms to
   evaluate and renegotiate their market positions in a service industry
   newly infused with technology (i.e., brokerage market). Specifically, we
   examine how firms integrate technology into the service process to
   create new forms of interaction. We used content analysis and a
   combination of structuralist methods including multidimensional scaling
   analysis (MDS), clustering methods, and property-fitting regression
   techniques (ProFit) to examine how technology changes the service
   process, and how firms leverage these changes for positioning. Our
   research demonstrates a strategic approach to positioning that suggests
   (1) introducing significant technology opens new positioning avenues by
   providing new service interactions, (2) technology must be leveraged via
   links to customer value sets, and (3) firms that leverage technology
   through customer values outperform their competitors. (c) 2007 New York

AB The "intangible" nature of e-commerce may cause shoppers to be uncertain
   about whether products ordered online will fit their needs or perform up
   to expectations. Such uncertainty is a dimension of consumer risk, or
   feelings that result because the actual outcome of a purchase decision
   can only be known in the future. However, the ability of e-retailers to
   offer a plethora of product-related information can ameliorate this
   uncertainty. This research assesses the influence of three online
   retailer communication practices-evoking vividness through pictures,
   allowing consumers to control information presentation, and presenting
   information from third-party sources. We demonstrate that these
   practices materially affect consumer perceptions of product performance
   uncertainty. Importantly, we also find that the influence of the
   practices differs by the search or experience orientation of the
   product, sometimes in counterintuitive ways. These results can serve to
   help enhance the effectiveness of e-retailers' communications and, in
   the case of multichannel retailers, help determine which products are
   best suited for different channels. (c) 2007 New York University.

AB Businesses are increasingly turning to call service centers located
   abroad to provide customer support. Although the country-of-origin
   literature as well as other reports may lead one to believe that
   consumers will expect offshore call centers to deliver poorer service,
   call center location is simply one cue which consumers can utilize to
   form expectations. This research investigates how two factors (location
   and reputation) impact a consumer's expectations regarding an upcoming
   service encounter. We employ information integration theory to examine
   how these two cues are combined. Results from two experiments
   demonstrate that call center location does not impact pre-encounter
   expectations if the firm is reputable. If, however, the firm is less
   known, consumers anticipate being less satisfied if they believe the
   call center is located in a nation dissimilar to the U.S. (e.g., India
   or the Philippines) versus in the U.S. or similar to the U.S. (e.g.,
   England). Belief about training provided by the firm is shown to be the
   key mediator. (c) 2007 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Consumers often encounter multiple unit price promotions whereby a price
   reduction is presented as a reduced total price for multiple units of
   the same item (e.g., an item regularly priced at $1.25 each is promoted
   as "5 for $5"). In a series of experiments, we find that the positive
   effect of these promotions on quantity purchase intentions is contingent
   on the magnitude of the quantity specified in the offer and the rate of
   product consumption. However, offer effectiveness is not influenced by
   highlighting single unit prices, the unrestricted nature of these
   promotions, or aggregate savings. As predicted by the selective
   accessibility explanation, the effect of multiple unit price promotions
   on quantity purchase intentions is shown to be mediated by accessing
   anchor-consistent knowledge. An agenda for further research and the
   implications of our findings for retail practice are discussed. (c) 2007

AB The widespread use of partitioned pricing by marketers may be the result
   of perceptions that it enhances the perceived value of the offer. This
   research identifies boundary conditions for the effectiveness of
   partitioned pricing by examining the role of the reasonableness of a
   surcharge and the need for cognition in consumers' processing of pricing
   information. Three studies, each consisting of two experiments, examine
   the effectiveness of partitioned versus combined pricing and show that
   for high need for cognition persons, partitioned pricing has a more
   favorable effect than combined pricing when the surcharges are
   reasonable; these effects reverse when the surcharges are unreasonable.
   The studies indicate no differences between partitioned and combined
   pricing across surcharge conditions for low need for cognition
   consumers. A fourth study incorporating both reasonable and unreasonable
   surcharges in one experiment substantiates the conclusions of the first
   three studies. Finally, detailed process measures provide evidence that
   high versus low need for cognition persons evaluate partitioned pricing
   information differently in distinct surcharge conditions. (c) 2007 New

AB Models of consumer store patronage generally employ the economic
   theory-based assumption that, all else being equal, consumers seek to
   minimize travel distance. Moreover, consistent with reference-dependent
   theory, findings from recent experimental research conducted in a
   controlled lab setting suggest that holding travel distance constant,
   the configuration of stops along multi-stop routes may also impact
   store-patronage decisions. However, given the use of simplified map
   configurations of multi-stop routes, along with the stimulus-based
   nature of the laboratory exercise, the external validity of these
   findings are open to question. Thus, the purpose of the three
   experiments in the present paper is to replicate and test the external
   validity of the reference-dependent predictions supported in previous
   research. In experiment one, consumer travel preferences are examined in
   a memory-based field experiment with results replicating those of
   earlier research. In experiment two, results are again replicated, but
   this time in a lab setting using realistic maps. Finally, experiment
   three provides a test of boundary conditions for the theory-consistent
   results of experiments one and two. (C) 2008 New York University.

AB For a shopping mall, sales leakage occurs when consumer purchases
   facilitated by the mall are finalized outside it. These sales include,
   for example, catalog orders filled at the leased premises in a physical
   mall; For an Internet mall, they include the ones consumers make on an
   on-line store's website after learning about the store from an Internet
   mall website. While these sales are difficult to track in the physical
   mall, Internet malls like Yahoo can track them by placing cookies on
   consumers when they visit the mall. The challenge for a mall owner then
   is to design an appropriate pricing model which takes sales leakage into
   account. In fact, Yahoo currently uses an All-Revenue-Share Fee with
   Yahoo collecting from on-line stores a share of all sales revenue,
   regardless of whether the purchase was made through the mall or directly
   from the store's own URL. We explore this new All-Revenue-Share Fee
   model, compare it with the commonly used Fixed Fee model and the
   two-part tariff model, and identify the model with the highest profits
   for the mall under different conditions. We suggest that although an
   All-Revenue-Share Fee is appealing for Internet malls due to its ability
   to capture sales leakage directly, it may cause the stores to refrain
   from joining the mall in certain circumstances. Thus, in certain
   situations charging a fixed monthly fee can actually be more profitable
   for the mall versus the All-Revenue-Share Fee model. We also examine how
   mall and product category characteristics as well as market expansion
   affect the optimal pricing strategy. We show that a mall should price
   discriminate across product categories, not just by charging different
   amounts of fees, but by using different pricing models. Our research
   provides many managerial implications on how to price over time. (C)

AB Rapid acceptance of the relationship paradigm, within marketing, is in
   no small part due to the powerful metaphor of marketing-as-relationship.
   Through observation of localized television home shopping (THS), with
   its intensive use of communication between salesperson and customer, we
   examine how local meanings of relationship marketing are abstracted to
   their constituent values for broadcast over television, extending the
   metaphor of marketing-as-relationship to more accurately reflect
   differing values among American, Japanese, and Chinese retailing
   cultures. Combining observations with historical records, and
   ethnographic data, we propose culturally specific shopping relationship
   metaphors that help managers quickly understanding core local values of

AB In this research, we examine the role of brand equity as a strategy to
   offset the negative effects of a performance failure. Two independent
   studies. spanning four industries and involving 669 respondents are
   employed to investigate this issue. Results suggest that high brand
   equity leads to more favorable satisfaction evaluations and behavioral
   intentions than low brand equity. The brand equity effect is identified
   as a prevailing advantage that spans the entire failure and recovery
   sequence. This is an important finding because it implies that the
   advantages of high brand equity theoretically can apply to all failures,
   not just those for which recovery is attempted. Further inspection,
   however, reveals that despite the prevailing advantage. high-equity
   brand failures lead to a more drastic decline in customer evaluations
   immediately after the failure episode. Managerial implications and

AB In retailing, inventory analysis and inventory practice have
   traditionally been based on the assumption that underlying demand does
   not vary with inventory levels. A growing body of research supports the
   contention that the validity of this assumption has significant
   implications for optimal inventory policies. The concern for such
   inventory effects motivated a major US magazine publisher to conduct the
   market study documented in this article. It presents empirical evidence
   that demand can indeed vary with inventory, and it quantifies the
   magnitude of these inventory effects which are twofold. An inventory
   decrease for one brand can, first, result in a decrease of demand for
   the brand and, second, in an increase of demand for a competing brand.
   These observations support the expansion of the traditional Newsvendor
   model to include inventory effects as well as the practice to make
   inventory decisions for retail categories rather than individual brands.

AB The retailing of information media either in a pure digital form or
   bundled with the conventional form has become increasingly common in
   product categories such as books, newspapers, music, etc. A general
   problem with these media is that much of the content that they offer is
   common to both conventional and digital formats. This makes the media
   inherently substitutes, and limits the attractiveness to consumers of
   acquiring both formats. However, the electronic and print formats often
   have advantages over one another in specific usage situations. For
   example, a print book may be most suitable for casual reading, while an
   electronic version might be most suitable for locating specific
   passages. In this paper we investigate whether increased awareness of
   advantages that different forms may have over one another in different
   usage situations can increase demand for buying both items
   simultaneously. We do this through an experimental manipulation where
   participants are provided either with communications that emphasize
   using the different forms in different situations, or using the
   different forms in the same situations. Employing book and newspaper
   subscription categories, we find that the "different usage situation"
   manipulation does significantly increase intent to purchase both print
   and electronic forms as long as the second item is discounted. In
   addition, we provide evidence that communicating different usage
   situations and pricing the forms differentially are likely to be
   effective strategies in selling information product form bundles. (c)

AB There are growing interests in understanding how word-of-mouth (WOM) on
   the Internet is generated and how it influences consumers' purchase
   decisions at retail outlets. A unique aspect of the WOM effect is the
   presence of a positive feedback mechanism between WOM and retail sales.
   We characterize the process through a dynamic simultaneous equation
   system, in which we separate the effect of online WOM as both a
   precursor to and an outcome of retail sales. We apply our approach to
   the movie industry, showing that both a movie's box office revenue and
   WOM valence significantly influence WOM volume. WOM volume in turn leads
   to higher box office performance. This positive feedback mechanism
   highlights the importance of WOM in generating and sustaining retail

AB Two powerful, highly effective strategic tools that retailers possess
   involve pricing and store format decisions. From the several strategic
   choices available for each decision, a retailer can choose any
   combination. We focus on two gaps in the literature. First, both
   decisions are specific to the consumers to whom the stores cater and the
   environments within which they operate, yet little academic research
   studies them jointly. Thus, it is important to determine the joint
   effects of considering pricing and format decisions in a single
   framework. Second, do retailers, privy to findings from rich prior
   literature pertaining to consumer store choices related to their pricing
   and format preferences, actually take such information into account when
   making strategic choices? In this descriptive rather than prescriptive
   study, we determine whether a retailer that makes an initial choice
   about which policy to implement complies with existing understanding
   about consumer preferences. Using a unique data set that covers all
   grocery retailers in three states, we apply a multinomial logit model to
   study the determinants of price, format, and combination strategies for
   retailers. Although some combinations are more similar than others. a
   consideration of the pricing or format strategy in isolation fails to
   depict a complete picture, and the strategic implications change

AB A tool retailers often use to improve their negotiating position with
   brand manufacturers is to delist - or threaten to delist - the
   manufacturers' brand. Because brand manufacturers rely mainly on
   retailers to sell their products to consumers, a brand delisting will
   cause a sales loss for the brand manufacturer. Therefore, many brand
   manufacturers feel enormous pressure to give in and improve buying
   conditions to favor the retailer. The question thus emerges: Can a brand
   manufacturer resist a retailer's threat to delist its brand(s)? If a
   brand delisting severely hurts retail sales, it is easier for a brand
   manufacturer to resist. The authors study the impact of brand delistings
   on store switching and brand switching using a controlled online
   experiment and in-store shopper survey. They develop and test a
   conceptual model with several antecedents of consumers' reactions to a
   brand delisting and conclude that brand equity, market share, and the
   products' hedonic level drive store and brand switching. (C) 2008 New

   education and employment positively influence redemption rates and our

   individual effects. The focus is on comparing coupon-use discrepancies
   between national and private label brands when the characteristics of
   coupons are taken into account. A higher face value appears to be a
   critical element in electronic coupon format, and this gives rise to
   more purchases for nonperishables (shampoo and detergent). Results also
   show significant seasonal variations in milk and orange-juice coupon
   usage. Furthermore, the distance of consumers from the redemption
   location has a significantly negative effect, whereas the expiration

   frequently employ in the fashion industry. With this stipulation, the
   store demands a vendor's guarantee of its target mark-up rate, even in a
   markdown operation. This makes the retailer order too much and later
   liquidate a greater amount of leftovers. We propose a new GPM scheme for
   supply chain coordination. Specifically, if the retailer compensates the
   vendor for the same fraction of the joint costs as the guaranteed
   mark-up rate, the retailer's quantity choice results in profit
   maximization for the entire supply chain. Thus, the supply chain becomes
   fully coordinated and provides win-win outcomes for both retailer and
   vendor. (C) 2008 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

   include themed retailing, brandscapes, flagship brand stores, themed
   entertainment brand stores, themed flagship brand stores, and brand
   museums. This research uses an extended case-study method to investigate
   the World of Coca-Cola brand museum located in Atlanta, Georgia. A brand
   museum is a type of themed flagship brand store, but there are some
   unique aspects. One key feature of brand museums is the resemblance to
   traditional museums, but, in the former, the brand is positioned within
   historical and educational contexts. Within the brand museum context,
   this study explains how brand meaning can be expanded along seven
   dimensions: humanization, socialization, localization, globalization,
   contextualization. theatricization. and characterization. Retailing
   implications are discussed. (C) 2008 New York University. Published by

AB Surprise gifts offer more business opportunities than gifts suggested by
   recipients. because a larger part of the selection and purchase
   processes can be molded, and such gifts are especially valued by
   recipients. Yet the extant gift-giving literature explicitly takes into
   account neither the giver's intention to surprise nor the consequences
   for the gift selection and purchase processes. The present study
   investigates surprise gifts from the giver's point of view and
   disentangles the selection and purchase processes of surprise gifts and
   gifts that are not meant as surprises. The hypotheses emerge as a
   consequence of the enhanced pleasure and experiential motivation
   underlying surprise gifts, as well as their greater inherent perceived
   risk. According to panel data, design and money-back guarantees are more
   important for the purchase of surprise gifts (compared with non-surprise
   gifts), whereas good deals appear less important, and brand name does
   not seem to matter any more than it does for gifts not intended as a
   surprise. Also, surprise gifts more often are bought on the spot than
   non-surprise gifts, without extended information search (similar to
   impulse purchases), by women alone, and for someone within the
   household. Finally, the giver usually has a poorer idea of what he or
   she wants to buy before entering the shop and visits fewer stores to
   purchase surprise gifts. However, the last three results apply only to
   appliances which often serve as gifts. These insights lead to
   significant managerial implications for retailers and manufacturers. (C)

AB The proliferation of channels has created new challenges for research,
   including understanding how consumers may be segmented with respect to
   their information search and purchase behavior in multichannel
   environment. This research considers shopping a dynamic process that
   consists of search and purchase phases, in which the total utility of
   shopping process is determined by the perceived consumer utility toward
   channel use, which is mainly driven by consumer characteristics. The
   authors (1) segment consumers on the basis of their attitudes toward
   multiple channels as search and purchase alternatives; (2) investigate
   the association among psychological, economic, and sociodemographic
   covariates and segment membership; and (3) explore how multichannel
   behavior might differ across different product categories. Using survey
   data from 364 Dutch consumers and Latent-Class Analyse, they identify
   three segments - multichannel enthusiasts, uninvolved shoppers, and
   store-focused consumers - and covariates, such as shopping enjoyment,
   loyalty, and innovativeness that predict segment membership. The
   category-specific analysis suggests that overall segment descriptions
   apply generally to a variety of categories, though some differences
   exist, including the impact of covariates, across categories. The
   authors discuss implications for further research and practice. (C) 2008

AB This paper investigates the processes underlying consumers' memory-based
   store price judgments. The numerosity heuristic implies that the greater
   the number of relatively lower priced products at a store that consumers
   can recall, the lower will be their overall price image of the store.
   That is, people use the number of recalled low-price products to judge
   the overall store price image. We show that this expectation holds only
   for knowledgeable consumers. Instead, less knowledgeable consumers use
   the ease with which low-price products are recalled (i.e., the
   availability heuristic) as a cue to make store price judgments.
   Therefore, the fewer low-price products they recall, the easier their
   recall task, and the lower their price perceptions of the store.
   Field studies using different manipulations tested and confirmed these
   predictions. Managerial implications for retailers are offered.
   Theoretical implications for behavioral price perceptions, memory-based
   judgments, and the use of heuristic cues are also discussed. (C) 2008

   intentions after a service failure, the authors use an experimental
   procedure and evaluate the impact of compensation in different stability

   using scenarios from different service industries indicate that
   compensation is necessary only when the company is responsible for the
   failure and the failure occurs frequently. If the failure occurs
   infrequently or the company is not responsible, compensation does not
   affect repurchase intentions. The results further demonstrate that
   stability and locus of responsibility attributions influence the
   perceived equity of the exchange, which mediates the effectiveness of
   compensation as a recovery effort. The authors discuss the theoretical
   and managerial implications. (C) 2008 New York University. Published by

   introduce the new concept of trade equity, defined here as the value
   that accrues to a firm from being known in a trading network as a
   trustworthy trading partner, to explore the relational resources that
   are inherent in a firm's ties with trading partners. We consider brand
   equity to represent relational resources that are located in a firm's
   relational ties with end consumers. Based on data collected in a survey
   of 797 home appliance retailers, results show that a manufacturer's
   trade equity and brand equity have differential effects on the
   retailer's dependence and commitment to the manufacturer. Findings show
   that a manufacturer's brand equity strengthens the effect of its trade
   equity on the retailer's dependence and weakens the effect on the
   retailer's commitment. (C) 2008 New York University. Published by

AB The long-term effects of promotions on sales are increasingly linked to
   the supposed shift of economic power within channels from manufacturers
   to retailers. However, formal knowledge about how they influence channel
   decisions under different promotional arrangements and the distribution
   of channel profits remains very sparse. In this paper, 1 develop two
   2-period models to investigate the impact on channel decisions and
   profits of manufacturer-control led and retailer-controlled promotions
   targeted at consumers. My findings indicate that retailers always invest
   in retailer promotions, while manufacturers may find it optimal to not
   invest in consumer promotions. Economic power shifts from manufacturers
   to retailers when consumer promotions significantly expand the baseline
   demand in the long-term. Otherwise, manufacturers remain more powerful.
   Trade promotions or other profit-transfer mechanisms may be
   indispensable in easing conflicts over who should undertake promotions,
   especially when these promotions substantially increase future sales.

AB While many frameworks of service dynamics assume that consumers will not
   intentionally disrupt service encounters, a growing body of studies
   argues that dysfunctional customer behaviors are far from rare. Although
   a number of studies have explored such behaviors, deliberate fraudulent
   returning by consumers is relatively under-researched. Fraudulent
   returning refers to consumers taking back goods to a retailer knowing
   that such a return is contrary to the firm or legal rules and
   regulations governing such returns (including returning functional but
   used or consumer-damaged goods). This article is structured in the
   following way. First, in order to clarify the nature of demographic
   control factors, we briefly outline existing research into the
   demographic characteristics of complainers and fraudulent returners.
   Thereafter, we present the findings of a study designed to identify
   which demographic factors are linked to fraudulent returning. Second, we
   present a conceptual model of the psychographic antecedents of
   fraudulent returning proclivity. After describing the research design,
   methodology, and the approach adopted to test this model, we present the
   results of a second study developed to model the predictors of
   fraudulent proclivity that also controls for the demographic factors
   identified in Study 1. We conclude with a discussion of the
   contributions and limitations of these studies. (C) 2008 New York

AB Until recently, retailers have taken an either/or approach to
   competition: either reacting fiercely to competitive price changes or
   ignoring them altogether. Today. however, firms make a concerted effort
   to determine and quantify competitive effects. In this paper, we focus
   on how pricing and competitive effects interact as a general phenomenon,
   particularly as it applies to retailing. We attempt to construct a
   general framework that enhances our understanding of the emerging
   research issues in the area of pricing and competitive effects, and we
   examine their implications for practice. The areas that show high
   promise/opportunity are in the online setting for all types of
   goods-fashion, perishable and packaged staples, and
   durables-particularly with respect to pricing, for profitability and
   understanding, the impact of competition. other opportunities include
   understanding the pricing and competitive effects in the perishable
   goods category sold in specialty. discount. and convenience stores. (C)

   we continue this introspective process, by reviewing the theories used
   in 173 articles published in the Journal of Retailing in the 2004-2009

   their application to various substantive issues. A total of 119
   different theories were used across these 173 articles, which we
   sub-grouped into twelve broad-based theoretical categories: (1)
   marketing theories, (2) microeconomic theory, (3) consumer choice
   theory, (4) social exchange theory, (5) information processing theory,
   (6) satisfaction theory, (7) reference price theory, (8) competitive
   theory, (9) attribution theory, (10) other psychological theories for

AB This research investigates the influence of retail chain-level
   activities (e.g., district supervisor directives and policies) and store
   manager behaviors on the sale of physical products versus services.
   Using data gathered within a U.S.-based retail automotive parts chain,
   the authors discover that to sell services, especially in competitive
   environments, store managers should focus on sales planning and
   transformative leadership behaviors, which accentuate both the long-term
   planning horizon and the effects of managerial actions. In less
   competitive environments though, a more transactional approach (e.g.,
   selling orientation) can be effective for selling services.
   Alternatively, to sell products, store managers' selling effort appears
   to be the most important driver of success, and a transformative
   leadership approach may be detrimental when the retailer faces a high
   level of direct competition. In total, the findings suggest that
   corporate chain activities, such as the level and clarity of store
   managers' goals and supervisor monitoring, influence store manager
   behaviors, which in turn affect the sale of physical products and
   services. (c) 2008 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB While there is a sustained interest in research focusing on issues
   relating to trust development in the electronic marketplace, significant
   gaps remain in the literature. In particular, little is known of the
   underlying processes that may be occurring in online trust development.
   For example, research suggests that factors such as site design and
   navigability are among the factors that impact trust perceptions. Extant
   literature, however, is largely silent about why certain trust-related
   effects are observed in online environments. In this paper, we propose a
   new process-centric perspective for understanding the formation of
   online trust-through buyer's assessment of the e-retailer's assistive
   intent, implicitly embedded in task-facilitative interactive tools.
   Specifically, we develop and test a model delineating the relationship
   between seller's provision of interactive product information management
   and product information comprehension tools, buyer's perceptions of
   seller's assistive intent, and buyer's initial trust in the seller. The
   results of two studies provide support for the trust-enhancing effects
   of task-facilitative informational tools and the mediating role of
   buyer's perceptions of seller's assistive intent. Importantly, these
   effects occur without any explicit expressions of seller's intentions.
   The results also suggest that the efficacy of interactive informational
   tools in engendering perceptions of seller's assistive intent, and hence
   trust, varies with the buyer's level of involvement with and knowledge
   of the product category. (c) 2009 New York University. Published by

   between three role stressors (i.e., role ambiguity, role conflict, and

   and supervisor-rated performance of retail professionals. Results
   indicate that the effect of role ambiguity on job efficacy is moderated
   by perceived competitive climate, such that the harmful effect of role
   ambiguity is lessened when competitive climate is high, thus
   highlighting a potential benefit of stress reduction through an increase
   in perceptions of competitive climate. In addition, the influence of job
   satisfaction on supervisor ratings of performance is moderated by
   perceived competitive climate, such that higher levels of job
   satisfaction result in improved supervisor ratings when the competitive

AB Retailers selling items through Internet auctions frequently use buy-now
   prices (BNPs), which allow the immediate selling of an item to consumers
   at a fixed price. Previous research has proposed several theories of the
   usage of BNPs by bidders. We study the usage of BNPs from a seller's
   point of view. We propose that a retailer may use BNPs as external
   reference prices, influencing bidders' valuations in Internet auctions.
   We focus on the effect of BNPs on bidders' willingness to pay (WTP) and
   study under what conditions a BNP can be effectively used as an external
   reference price. Results of two empirical studies clearly indicate that
   BNPs have a reference-price effect. In addition, we find that this

   studies involving 656 respondents and multiple methods are employed to
   investigate customer rage. Scales for each form of rage emotion,
   expression, and behavior were developed and used to assess their
   interrelationships. Results suggest that different forms of customer
   rage emotions tend to be linked to different types of expressions and
   behaviors. For example, both Rancorous Rage and Retaliatory Rage
   emotions tend to increase Verbal expressions (such as raising one's
   voice, yelling, and making insulting remarks). In contrast, Retaliatory
   Rage emotion increases Physical expressions (tried to physically harm a
   service employee, tried to cause damage to property, and threatened to
   damage property) and Displaced expressions (took anger out on other
   people nearby, yelled at other people, and took their anger out on other
   people later on) whereas Rancorous Rage emotion decreases Physical and
   Displaced expressions. Interestingly, Verbal expressions are linked to
   passive-aggressive behaviors, such as switching service providers and
   spreading negative word of mouth while Physical expressions are linked
   to relatively aggressive behavior, such as a desire for revenge.
   Implications for scholarly research and retailers are discussed. (c)

AB Search theories Suggest that a decline in search costs increases search
   behavior. This relationship has been well supported by prior
   experimental research but not by studies conducted in retail settings.
   Our review of the literature suggests that this discrepancy might be
   driven by the fact that prior experiments typically involve money-based
   search whereas actual search in retail settings is usually time-based.
   We argue that the Currency of search plays a moderating role. We find
   that when participants spend money oil search, a decrease ill search
   costs has a significant effect on search decisions but, when they spend
   time oil search, a decrease in search costs either has a relatively weak
   effect (Experiment 1) or no effect at all (Experiment 2). Furthermore,
   this insensitivity ill time also emerges for search payoff's (Experiment
   3). We also offer evidence for the processes underlying these effects.
   Our results provide a new lens to examine inconsistencies ill the search
   literature, and present a view of search that is more applicable to the

AB Within the context of quick service restaurant meals, three Studies (a

   examine how accurately consumers estimate calorie, fat, and sodium
   content and explore how objective nutrition information may influence
   product evaluations, perceptions, and purchase intentions. The results
   indicate that many consumers have little understanding of the calorie,
   fat, and sodium levels of many typical quick service meals, and this is
   especially true for less healthful meals. Consistent with rationale
   drawn from the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm, results demonstrate
   that menu-based nutrition information provision negatively influences
   consumers' responses when that information is less favorable than
   expected. Findings suggest that the relationship between actual and
   expected nutrition levels drives responses, rather than the disclosure
   of information per se. Since these relationships can vary both within
   and between restaurants, results suggest that the effects of mandated
   nutrition information disclosure may not be uniform across the industry.

   demonstrates that the presence of soldout products in the decision
   environment can prompt consumers to purchase available options and
   decrease choice deferral. This effect can be explained by two underlying
   decision processes. First, soldout products may create a sense of
   urgency for consumers to expedite their purchases. which the authors

AB Retailers frequently attempt to attract shoppers by offering large
   product assortments. The prevailing literature on assortments has
   recognized that although lame assortments benefit consumers by providing
   many choices, wide choices also challenge consumers to use extensive
   cognitive processes in making purchase decisions. Therefore when
   retailers offer extensive product assortments, they may also be adding
   cognitive costs to consumers-costs that may diminish the assortment's
   attractiveness. This research draws on the literature related to the
   Heuristic-Systematic Model (HSM) of information processing and the
   literature related to optimal Stimulation level (OSL) in testing for the
   presence of two possible processing benefits provided by large
   assortments: their capacity to aid consumers in achieving
   decision-making certainty and their ability to provide consumers with
   desired stimulation. In two experiments. we find support for both models
   of assortment evaluations and demonstrate that Purchase context and
   individual traits can lead consumers to prefer large assortments from a
   processing perspective. (C) 2009 New York University. Published by

   clothing retailer examining how consumers' preferences to shop and buy
   on the Internet rather than at bricks-and-mortar stores differ depending
   on their compulsive buying tendencies. Using shopping motivations such
   as seeking product and information variety, the ability to buy
   unobserved, avoiding social interactions, and experiencing positive
   feelings during shopping and buying, we find a positive linear
   relationship between a tendency to buy compulsively and Internet
   shopping and buying motivations. The research demonstrates that the
   items used to measure these motivations can also be used to identify
   buyers who have a tendency to buy compulsively. The paper also offers
   important retailing, managerial and public policy implications of the

   rigorous empirical evidence of this phenomenon is lacking. This Study
   synthesizes extant literature from a broad range of areas and advances
   two alternative conceptions of the factors associated with dysfunctional

   disaffection with service. and servicescape variables are significantly
   associated with the severity of deliberate dysfunctional Customer acts.

AB Although there is growing interest in themed brandstores, we still know
   very little about the source of these retail environments' power to
   affect consumers profoundly. Utilizing an ethnographic study of American
   GO Place, a culturally rich and highly Successful retail environment, we
   find that effective retailing in these contexts is an intensely
   ideological affair. In our participant-observation of, and on-site
   interviews with. consumers at American Girl Place we find that the
   ideology of the brand manifests powerfully through a variety of
   different and distinct areas within the store: the Museum, the Library,
   the Cafe, the Salon, the Theater, and the Photo Studio. Ideological
   expression is central to each of these places. Tracking the influence of
   brand ideology through consumers' retail experiences, we theorize about
   the centrality of retail place in ideological branding. Although the
   confluence of ideology and retailing has been referenced in prior
   research, this paper focuses on and systematically develops the
   theoretical interconnection between the two. The physical immediacy of
   themed brandstore experience acts as a quilting point that links
   together related cultural concepts into a strong retail brand ideology.
   The implications of this theory draw Our attention to ideological and
   morally-bound retail brand expressions, emphasize the importance of a
   variety of retail formats within a single store, and provide practical
   guidelines for retailers eager to build successful brands of their own.

   obtain wholesale promotional Support that compensates the retailer for

   in developing methods to identify those shoppers who are extreme cherry
   pickers, but they have been less successful in developing methods that

AB Relationship marketing has taken on a significant role in both retail
   practice and academic study. However, from the introduction of the
   concept of relationship marketing into the literature scholars have
   noted that relationship building may not be beneficial to all firms
   under all conditions. In this study, we investigate this issue
   attempting to gain a greater understanding of the value of relationship
   marketing activities across targets (i.e., customers and suppliers) and
   within contexts (i.e., competitive intensity and three elements of
   market dynamism) on a retailer's ability to develop the capability of
   market responsiveness. Our findings, based upon a sample of 172 small
   retailers, demonstrate that differences do in fact exist in the value
   delivery to retailers from relationships with different targets and
   across different contexts in which the retailer operates. As such, the
   results of this study extend the extant relationship marketing
   literature, refining our understanding of the value of relationship
   marketing. Implications for academics and practitioners are discussed.

AB Retailing practice and the research resulting have experienced
   significant changes in recent years. This article reflects on Journal of
   Retailing articles published during our editorial tenure (2002-2007).
   Although Journal of Retailing publishes articles on many retailing
   topics, they have chosen four categories that they believe has had the
   largest impact on retailing research during that time, and the potential
   for the greatest contribution in the future: Growth of the Internet and
   e-commerce; branding and customer loyalty; service success strategies;
   and behavioral issues in pricing and patronage. Several illustrative
   studies are highlighted in each category, and directions for future
   research are provided. (C) 2009 New York University. Published by

AB This research examines how consumers' efforts as a nonmonetary sacrifice
   influence their price and promotion fairness perceptions in the context
   of price promotions. Multiple studies using different price promotion
   tactics demonstrate that consumers' perceived level of effort to obtain
   a reduced price negatively influences their fairness perceptions when
   they deny the promoted price. Exploring the underlying mechanisms of
   this effect, we show that the amount of effort consumers exert to obtain
   a promoted price leads to their feeling of deservingness and
   entitlement. When the promoted price is denied, this feeling of
   entitlement is violated, causing unfairness perceptions to occur. The
   research demonstrates that, in addition to retailers' actions such as
   price changes, consumers' actions, in the form of their effort input,
   are also an important determinant of fairness perceptions. (C) 2009 New

AB Adaptive customization systems are common in the delivery of e-service.
   However, consumers vary in their reaction to these systems. We introduce
   computer-mediated customization tendency (CMCT), a composite individual
   difference variable that reflects a consumer's personal preferences for
   designing and interacting with adaptive online environments to create
   valuable e-service experiences. To measure CMCT, we developed a
   formative index composed of need for control, technology innovativeness,
   and aesthetic appreciation. The results show CMCT influences adaptive
   online behavior and the perceived value of the adaptive e-service
   experience. In addition, customization-prone and customization-averse
   consumers differ in how they perceive the costs, benefits, and overall
   value of the experience. (C) 2009 New York University. Published by

AB This paper investigates the influence of channel structures and channel
   coordination on the supplier, the retailer, and the entire supply chain
   in the context of two single-channel and two dual-channel supply chains.
   We extensively study two Pareto zone concepts: channel-adding Pareto
   zone and contract-implementing Pareto zone. In the channel-adding Pareto
   zone, both the supplier and the retailer benefit from adding a new
   channel to the traditional single-channel supply chain. In the
   contract-implementing Pareto zone, it is mutually beneficial for the
   supplier and the retailer to utilize the proposed contract coordination
   policy. The analysis suggests the preference lists of the supplier and
   the retailer over channel structures with and without coordination are
   different, and depend on parameters like channel base demand, channel
   operational costs, and channel substitutability. (C) 2009 New York

AB This paper is concerned with the use of multiple stores by supermarket
   customers. It relates the number of stores patronized to a set of
   customer factors under a unifying theoretical framework emphasizing cost
   benefit analysis. Respective hypotheses are tested in a large random
   sample. This study is a first attempt to empirically address the
   structure of multiple store patronage. It is demonstrated that multiple
   store patronage is affected by variables such as customer income,
   satisfaction, and expenditure that are suggestive of heterogeneous cost
   benefit tradeoffs and opportunity costs of time. It is shown that
   customers are intrinsically different in the predisposition to being
   loyal. In this respect, store patronage is a continuum between single
   store loyalty and use of several different stores, on which customers
   vary depending on individual preferences. The empirical analysis also
   suggests that exclusive patronage of the favorite store arises from two
   observationally equivalent Patent segments that differ in their
   inclination to remain loyal. The results yield valuable insights into
   the structure of store patronage and lead to important implications for
   retail managers. Several extensions are considered. A broad set of
   research questions surrounding store patronage can be considered from a
   cost benefit viewpoint in the sense that consumer decisions in this area
   involve trading off economic resources against assortment, spatial and
   temporal benefits. (C) 2010 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB Should manufacturers of products such as automobiles and household
   appliances offer cash rebates to all consumers at the time of purchase,
   or offer trade deals to retailers? The authors conduct an analytical
   inquiry that shows that choosing between these two types of price
   promotion critically depends on the consumer sensitivity to both regular
   and promotional prices. More specifically, when consumers are more
   (less) sensitive to promotions than to regular prices, manufacturers are
   better (worse) off offering trade deals (consumer rebates) rather than
   consumer rebates (trade deals). Consistent with traditional predictions
   found in the economic literature, either of the two promotions can be
   offered indiscriminately if consumers make no difference between
   promotional offers and regular-price reductions. The theoretical and
   managerial implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2010 New

AB e-Stores and online shopping have become important aspects of a

   fundamentally different from traditional offline shoppers. However,
   based on the Big Middle Theory (Levy et al. 2005), the authors believe
   that there are segments of online shoppers that are very similar to
   regular shopper groups. To determine this, online shopping motivations
   and e-store attribute importance measures are separately used as the
   basis to develop online shopper typologies. Results reveal that there
   are more similarities than differences among traditional and online
   store shoppers. However, there are a few unique shopper types present at
   online stores, attracted by the distinctive characteristics and

AB We develop a model that jointly optimizes a retailer's decisions for
   product prices, display facing areas, display orientations and
   shelf-space locations in a product category. Unlike the existing
   shelf-space allocation models that typically consider only the width of
   display shelves, our model considers both the width and height of each
   shelf, allowing products to be stacked. Furthermore, as demand is
   influenced by each product's two-dimensional facing area, we consider
   multiple product orientations that capture three-dimensional product
   packaging characteristics. That enables our model to not only treat
   shelf locations as decision variables, but also retailers' stacking
   patterns in terms of product display areas and multiple display
   orientations. Further, unlike the existing studies which consider a
   retailer's shelf-space allocation decisions independent of its product
   pricing decisions, our model allows joint decisions on both and captures
   cross-product interactions in demand through prices. We show how a
   branch-and-bound based MINLP algorithm can be used to implement our
   optimization model in a fast and practical way. (C) 2010 New York

AB Multiple categories of retail products suffer limited shelf life, demand
   uncertainty, and, in some cases, long lead times. To provide retailers
   with an incentive to increase the stocking quantity of such products,
   manufacturers may offer an option to return unsold items at wholesale or
   less than wholesale prices. This article extends the additive
   price-dependent demand model in three ways. First, partial returns are
   optimal for the manufacturer but do not induce higher stocking
   quantities compared with when the manufacturer offers no returns.
   Second, in terms of the effect of investment in demand-enhancing
   activities, when retailers invest, they set higher resale prices, but an
   optimal partial returns policy still does not induce higher stocking
   quantity, whereas when manufacturers invest, the optimal returns policy
   induces higher stocking quantity. Third, when the manufacturer and
   retailer have different expectations of demand uncertainty, the
   retailer's estimate influences the expected profits for both, whereas
   the manufacturer's estimate has a major impact on its profits only. (C)

AB We model a supply chain consisting of a national brand manufacturer and
   an independent manufacturer, both of whom are potential suppliers of
   store brand to a single retailer. The retailer serves two customer
   segments-a quality sensitive segment (high type) and a price sensitive
   (low type) segment. The retailer serves these two segments by targeting
   the national and store brands to the quality and price sensitive
   segments, respectively. When the national brand manufacturer supplies
   the store brand he internalizes the effect of store brand quality on the
   national brand's retail prices. This leads the national brand
   manufacturer to choose a lower store brand quality than the independent
   manufacturer. This decrease in store brand quality has the benefit of
   increased revenues from the high type customers along with an associated
   cost of decreased revenues from the low type customers. Thus, when the
   benefit outweighs the cost the retailer chooses the national brand
   manufacturer to supply the store brand. We show that the retailer will
   choose the national brand manufacturer to supply the store brand when
   (a) the size of the high type customer segment is large relative to the
   low type customer segment, (b) the valuations of the high type customer
   segment is large relative to the low type customer segment, and (c) the
   retailer's margin requirement on the store brand is not very high.
   Overall, these results suggest that retailers who serve a bigger sized
   quality (price) sensitive clientele would have the national brand
   (independent) manufacturer supply the store brand. (C) 2010 New York

   by the retailer, (iii) retailer forward buying behavior, and (iv) both
   own- and cross-price effects of all the brands in the category. Second,
   we use this model to compare differences in ordering and pricing
   decisions, and in profits, resulting from using a category management
   versus a brand-by-brand management approach. Our approach allows us to
   derive implications in a dynamic setting about the impact of
   interdependence among the brands upon decisions on pass-through of trade
   deals and retailer order quantity. We show that category management
   results in noticeably higher profits versus brand-by-brand and cost-plus
   (markup) approaches. Further, our results suggest an interaction between
   a brand's own-price effect and its cross-price effect emerges. If the
   cross-price effect for a brand is low that is, the brand takes away
   relatively few sales from the other brands the retail pass-through
   should increase with that brand's own-price effect. On the other hand,
   when the cross-price effect is high, the retail pass-through decreases
   with the brand's own-price effect. (C) 2010 New York University.

AB Expectations play a significant role in determining customer perceptions
   and satisfaction. Accordingly, retailers seek to manage customers'
   service expectations. However, the tangible signals of service quality
   that are available to brick-and-mortar retailers (such as location,
   store appearance, and salespersons' behavior) may not be available in
   online markets. Using a signaling model, we obtain conditions when
   Internet retailers (e-tailers) use price to manage their customers'
   service expectations. In contrast to extant theory, we find that it is
   possible for both low and high service e-tailers to use price in
   signaling their service levels. Further, we develop an appropriate
   deductive test of our theory based on price-ending patterns as an
   artifact of the signaling process. Based on this test, we find evidence
   that e-tailers indeed manage service expectations using price.
   Interestingly, we also find preliminary evidence that suggests customers
   implicitly associate price-ending patterns with a retailer's expected
   service level. We discuss several other implications of our findings for
   researchers and managers. (C) 2010 New York University. Published by

AB Contributions to the theory and application of the Williamson's

   its initial appearance in the late 1970s, the Williamsonian approach has
   moved from a theoretical curiosity to the workhorse model in one
   subfield of marketing; viz. channels. Possible reasons for this success
   are traced here. The consistent empirical support for the core model,
   its applicability to a broad range of managerially relevant problems,
   its successes in horse races against competing theories, and its
   co-existence with complementary theories are unpacked. The paper closes
   with speculation about future trends about transaction cost analysis in

   must rely on information asymmetry as well as asset specificity, and
   that the study of modes of foreign market entry leads to alternative

   a few personal vignettes, the paper compiles citation statistics from

   the most frequently cited authors, most frequently cited papers, and
   dynamics of annual citations with respect to the most frequently cited
   authors. The paper also considers the breadth of topics to which
   Williamson's research contributes. The evidence suggests that
   Williamson's impact on strategic management research is not only
   profound but also continues to grow. Shifting to a prospective
   assessment, the paper explores the extent to which Williamson's research
   may impact future research in strategic management. To conclude the
   assessment, the paper turns to Williamson's PhD students who
   self-identify as strategic management scholars to understand his direct
   impact on a more personal dimension. (C) 2010 New York University.

AB The 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
   Alfred Nobel Prize to Oliver Williamson was not a surprise to scholars
   in business research. Transaction cost economics (TCE) has been among
   the most important streams of empirical investigation in business
   research during the last four decades. TCE has formed, developed and
   changed business research across disciplines during this era.
   Williamson, (1999:1092) himself noted that "I have no hesitation,
   however in declaring that transaction cost economics is an empirical
   success story." The Nobel Prize is a milestone event in business
   research, and the use of the criterion of falsification in this essay
   provides a compass to navigate future efforts. We present potential
   avenues of TCE research based on a Popperian lens focused on research
   discussed throughout this milestone issue of the Journal of Retailing.

AB Etailers have been losing market share to brick and mortar retailers
   that also sell products online Two related studies investigate means by
   which etailers can convey trustworthiness to consumers and thereby
   increase purchase intentions relative to hybrid firms Study 1 examines
   whether consensus information (i e the extent of satisfaction agreement
   among previous customers) and brand familiarity exert independent or
   interactive effects on consumer perceptions across retailers that
   possess or lack a physical presence Study 2 tests a potential boundary
   condition of the effects of consensus information and brand familiarity
   by introducing generalized suspicion which is a common condition for
   online buyers Results suggest that consensus information provides a
   broad cue that conveys trustworthiness and leads to greater purchase
   intentions for both familiar and unfamiliar brands, as well as hybrid
   and etailer firms In comparison, the effects of physical presence and
   brand familiarity were somewhat narrower m scope However we find that
   consensus information alone is not sufficient to buffer against active
   generalized suspicions online Instead a combination of high consensus
   and brand familiarity is necessary for this purpose The paper concludes
   with recommendations on how etailers can convey trustworthiness in
   online exchanges and how future research can build upon these findings

AB A conceptual model for a cause-related marketing (CRM) campaign which
   examines the effects of purchase quantity and firm donation amount on
   consumer perceptions of the firm (i e, firm motive and corporate social
   responsibility) and participation intentions, is developed and tested in
   three separate studies In Study I we find the positive effect of firm
   donation amount on participation intentions was fully mediated by
   consumer inferences about the firm and the negative effect of purchase
   quantity on participation intentions was only partially mediated by
   these inferences In Study 2 and consistent with the persuasion knowledge
   model we demonstrate that the effects of purchase quantity on firm
   Inferences and subsequent participation intentions are moderated by
   consumer participation effort where higher participation requirements (e
   g, mail-in proof-of purchase) yield more negative purchase quantity
   effects We extend the model in Study 3 to incorporate multiple exchange
   mechanisms and find that although purchase quantity does affect
   participation intentions by social exchange the effects of purchase
   quantity are primarily the result of the economic exchange
   Recommendations tor the design of cause-related marketing campaigns and

AB The popularity of online rate-and-review websites has increased the
   importance of word-of-mouth (WOM) volume (number of ratings) yet the
   retail literature has not paid adequate attention to understanding its
   impact. This paper highlights WOM volume as a high-scope,
   decision-making cue upon which the influence of other WOM-relevant
   characteristics on a WOM message's persuability depends. We begin, via a
   pretest, by demonstrating the intuitive expectation that high volume,
   relative to low volume, accentuates or assimilates perceptions of
   positivity or negativity of WOM targets. Then, through two experimental
   studies, we show that depending upon how high volume interacts with WOM
   consensus and consumer decision precommitment, it can contrast
   preference away from the valence of a target also. In our third and
   final experimental study, we demonstrate that consumers differ in their
   susceptibility to the influence of high volume. Those with a higher
   desire to be different from others, compared to those with a higher
   desire to be similar, are resistant to high volume's assimilative sway
   and do not show the valence-accentuating effects demonstrated in the
   pretest. Retail managers and researchers should find these insights
   about the different roles of WOM volume beneficial. (C) 2011 New York

AB While many offline retailers have developed informational websites that
   offer information on products and prices, the key question for such
   informational websites is whether they can increase revenues via
   web-to-store shopping. The current paper draws on the information search
   literature to specify and test hypotheses regarding the offline revenue
   impact of adding an informational website. Explicitly considering
   marketing efforts, a latent class model distinguishes consumer segments
   with different short-term revenue effects, while a Vector Autoregressive
   model on these segments reveals different long-term marketing response.
   We find that the offline revenue impact of the informational website
   critically depends on the product category and customer segment. The
   lower online search costs are especially beneficial for sensory products
   and for customers distant from the store. Moreover, offline revenues
   increase most for customers with high web visit frequency. We find that
   customers in some segments buy more and more expensive products,
   suggesting that online search and offline purchases are complements. In
   contrast, customers in a particular segment reduce their shopping trips,
   suggesting their online activities partially substitute for experiential
   shopping in the physical store. Hence, offline retailers should use
   specific online activities to target specific product categories and
   customer segments. (C) 2010 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB We offer a method of analysis that allows for an "unbundling" of the
   data to a disaggregate household level, and then "rebundling" it in a
   manner designed to identify patterns and relationships which are
   otherwise masked. Applying the method in the context of 'healthy'
   products and using census block group level data, we study consumption
   over several categories in two locations. The analyses show that studies
   involving geographically dispersed data must test for, and take into
   account when required, conceptually sound spatial effects in order to
   accurately assess impact. We also show that while both location and the
   product category have a significant impact on the proportion of healthy
   products purchased, the degree to which consumers choose healthier
   alternatives is a function of the category as well as the location.
   Finally, we provide preliminary evidence from survey data that supports
   the variations we find, and further explores attitudinal differences as
   well. There are rich implications for retailers in that new products
   introduced to benefit from popular trends (such as 'healthy'
   alternatives) may not succeed for all categories or locations. Retailers
   would benefit from understanding the spatial, demographic and
   attitudinal effects that play into consumption behavior, and such
   effects can be better understood when studying choice at the category
   and region level. Finally, public policies aimed at promoting healthier
   purchasing habits may have greater impact if special attention is given
   to specific categories and regions. (C) 2010 New York University.

AB This paper studies how households choose organic products on a given
   store visit. We develop a three-stage purchase incidence/brand
   choice/purchase quantity model for organic products. Shared random
   effects parameters link the three stages of the model. We empirically
   quantify the effects of category variables, marketing mix, and
   demographic variables on the purchase of organic products using a unique
   household panel dataset that includes actual organic purchase data from
   two markets, by over 4,500 households in 25 stores for the period
   between January 2004 and June 2009. First, we find that the purchase of
   organic products is greater among the high income, college educated, and
   older families as well as among consumers holding high-level
   occupations. Second, households tend not to purchase organic products
   when buying in concentrated categories. Third, on average, households
   tend to buy organic store brands more than the organic national brands.
   Promotions of organic brands (feature ad and display) are less likely to
   drive households to buy organic brands and so does the organic brand's
   distribution breadth. Finally, price has an inverted U-shaped effect. We
   discuss the implications of these results for retailers, manufacturers
   and researchers. (C) 2010 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB Production costs are critical in every business. In this research, we
   explore how variations in the manufacturer's production cost affect both
   the manufacturer retailer channel relationship and the manufacturer's
   and the retailer's choice of a price-setting rule (e.g., a dollar-amount
   margin or a percentage-based margin). We employ a multidisciplinary
   approach that combines executive interviews, survey research, and a
   game-theoretic analytical model. The analytical model shows that both
   the manufacturer's and the retailer's price-setting rule influences the
   other party's approach to production cost. Therefore, the manufacturer's
   and the retailer's optimal choice of a price-setting rule is not
   invariant, as previous marketing literature has suggested; such choices
   depend on the shape of the production cost function. Overall, the
   results offer new insight into the channel outcomes in light of
   production Costs. The empirical results support the analytical results.

AB Shelf-based scarcity in the form of relative stocking level depletion
   significantly affects consumer preferences (van Herpen et al. 2009).
   While both popularity and quality inferences are induced by
   stocking-level depletion, this paper demonstrates that popularity
   (rather than quality) inferences are the primary driver of the effect.
   Shelf-based scarcity is shown to have an impact in the presence of other
   signals, such as brand names and quality ratings, which indicates its
   effect may be widespread. However, its effect on preferences is greatly
   decreased by the presence of strong prior preferences and/or price
   promotions, indicating that shelf-based scarcity is likely to affect
   choices when consumers lack strong prior preferences and under
   conditions where price promotions are either not present or are similar

AB This study examines the emotion blends and the subsequent customer
   reactions that occur in advantaged price inequality situations, that is,
   when consumers learn that retailers charged them a lower price than what
   the same retailers charged another customer. Drawing on the appraisal
   theories of emotion and on social comparison theory, an experiment
   (n=272) and a field study (n=261) are conducted. The results reveal that
   in advantaged price inequality situations, customers experience a host
   of positive and negative emotions depending on two factors: the quality
   of relationship that the customer has with a disadvantaged other
   customer (neutral, positive, or negative) and the attribution of agency
   for the price advantage (situational attribution to competition,
   external attribution to store policies, or internal attribution to
   customer abilities). Positive emotions include happiness, gratitude,
   pride, and malicious joy; while negative emotions include pity, outrage,
   and guilt. These emotions are shown to mediate the occurrence of
   customer reactions (i.e., customer satisfaction, loyalty, WOM referral,
   and WOM activity). The article concludes with theoretical implications
   and recommendations for retail practitioners on how to use dynamic

AB Always low price (ALP) and low price guarantee (LPG) are store-price
   signals that retailers frequently use to induce favorable store-price
   image and discourage consumers from comparing prices across stores.
   Although both policies signal low prices, only LPG is an obligatory
   promise to beat rival stores' prices. Results of two shopping
   simulations show that when consumer search costs are relatively low, ALP
   may effectively discourage consumer search whereas LPG may trigger more
   search. Paradoxically, consumers tend to evaluate ALP stores less
   favorably (as having lower integrity and higher self-serving intention)
   than LPG stores even when both signals appear to be credible. These
   findings suggest that LPG is a superior tactic for creating a favorable
   store image while ALP is more effective for discouraging consumer
   search. The results also indicate that consumers visit fewer stores when
   the LPG is not a credible signal of lowest market price than when it is
   credible. This is because consumers are inclined to either claim
   discounts or refunds at the non-credible LPG store or to purchase at the
   competing store with a lower price rather than continue searching. (C)

AB Although direct mails have traditionally been used to sell a product or
   service, they can also be effective in enhancing retailer customer
   relationships. This study examines how customers respond to
   'promotional' ('call to action') and 'relational' ('retailer-image
   enhancement') direct mailings. The study develops a model that includes:
   (i) the dynamic effects of both types of direct mailings over time; and
   (ii) the moderating role of strength of the relationship that a customer
   enjoys with the retailer. Past purchase behavior is also considered. The
   model is then used in a study of customers of a Belgian apparel
   retailer. The results show that relational mailings positively affect
   customer response, irrespective of when they are sent. In contrast, the
   effects of promotional mailings are less clear-cut: although they work
   well in the short term, their effects can vary in the longer term. In
   addition, the study finds that a direct-mailing strategy should be
   planned in accordance with the strength of the relationship between the
   retailer and the target customers. The results of the study provide
   valuable insights for retailers in optimizing the effectiveness of their
   direct-mail initiatives. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by

AB Price-matching guarantees are commonly used by sellers as promises to
   match the lowest price for an item that a customer can find elsewhere.
   In this paper, we use a market experiment approach to examine buyer
   search as well as sellers' pricing decisions in the presence versus
   absence of Price-Matching Guarantees. We use student subjects as well as
   real consumers in an interactive laboratory setting to trade with each
   other, acting as buyers and sellers. Our findings from two experiments
   indicate that when searchers' demand is more elastic than non-searchers,
   PMGs can result in more intense price competition, even when sellers are
   symmetric. Price-Matching sellers benefit from converting more consumers
   into searchers who buy a larger quantity at a lower price. The lower
   (average) market prices also benefit buyers. These implications should
   be of great interest to researchers, practitioners, and public
   policymakers. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Self-service technologies (SSTs) have enhanced the role technology plays
   in customer interactions with firms, yet instruments that systematically
   measure the service quality of SSTs from the perspective of customers
   remain underdeveloped. Based on psychometric scale development
   approaches, this study conceptualized, constructed, refined, and tested
   a multiple-item scale that examined key factors influencing SST service
   quality. Through qualitative and quantitative studies in four separate
   phases, a 20-item seven-dimension SSTQUAL scale was developed that
   includes functionality, enjoyment, security, assurance, design,
   convenience, and customization. The scale demonstrates sound
   psychometric properties based on findings from various reliability and
   validity tests as well as vigorous scale replications across industries
   and consumer traits using several different samples. The utility of the
   proposed scale is discussed for implications, limitations and future

AB This research investigates cross-functional integration in contexts
   where customers interact with multiple frontline functions during a
   retail transaction. Specifically, this study: (1) proposes and
   empirically tests a framework for frontline cross-functional
   integration, (2) shows that joint reward valence alters the effects of
   other integration mechanisms in ways that can sometimes be detrimental,
   and (3) demonstrates the effects of cross-functional integration on
   individual sales performance and job satisfaction. The proposed
   framework is empirically tested in the automobile sales context with
   sales and finance as the frontline functions. Results indicate that
   cross-functional training and cohesion influence quality of
   communication, which in turns leads to more effective relationships. As
   joint reward valence increases, the positive impact of cross-functional
   training on communication quality is enhanced; however, the positive
   impact of cohesion on communication quality is reduced. Similarly, as
   joint reward valence increases, relationship effectiveness leads to
   higher individual sales performance but the positive benefits of
   relationship effectiveness on job satisfaction diminish. Thus, this
   study improves the understanding of frontline cross-functional
   integration and the process by which integration mechanisms influence
   employee outcomes. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB Prior research suggests that adoption decisions are primarily based on
   product features and experiential opportunities, like trial and
   observation. Our research follows inquiries that identify anticipated
   regret (AR) as an emotion integral to consumer decision making. Prior
   research and current retailing practice assume that AR can be alleviated
   by compelling product attribute-based rationales for immediate purchase.
   These rationales often take the form of direct attribute comparisons
   between the current best and the future technologies.
   Counter-intuitively, we find that giving consumers attribute-based
   justifications for immediate purchase produces a uniform level of AR and
   purchase delay regardless of the perceived rate of innovation (PRI).
   However, under conditions of low PRI and no justification, AR decreases
   significantly. A clear implication of our findings is that firms
   marketing current technology should not rush to provide consumers with
   justifications for immediate upgrade since such communications will
   remind consumers of what they might miss if they adopt now, resulting in
   increased AR and purchase delays. Instead, we suggest that retailers
   focus promotional efforts on highlighting the hedonic benefits consumers
   experience by adopting today. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by

AB In recent years. the combination of economic growth and population
   growth in emerging markets and less developed markets has accelerated
   the progression of globalization of retailing and globalization by
   retailers. The challenges faced by global and globalizing retailers
   (retailers who currently have or intend to establish a market presence
   in mature markets, emerging markets and less developed markets) can be
   more daunting compared to those faced by firms in other industries such
   as automobiles, steel, and computers. Retailing innovations that are
   responsive to the characteristics of distinctive national markets and
   broader aggregations of markets such as mature. emerging. and less
   developed markets are critical to the success of global and globalizing!
   retailers. Against this backdrop. this paper focuses on retailing
   innovations in the context of a globalizing retailing environment. It
   attempts to shed insights into the characteristics of retailing
   innovations conducive to superior performance in distinctive national
   markets and across broader aggregations of markets. Towards this end, we
   first examine the environmental conditions of markets in different
   development statics. namely mature, emerging and less developed markets.
   and explore consumer based, industry based. and legal/regulatory based
   challenges faced by globalizing retailers in these markets. Second. we
   show how these challenges can be transformed into opportunities with
   retailing innovations. We conclude with a roadmap for future research
   and present propositions on future development with respect to retailing
   innovations in these markets. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by

AB A retail business model articulates how a retailer creates value for its
   customers and appropriates value from the markets. Innovations in
   business models are increasingly critical for building sustainable ad
   vantage in a marketplace defined by unrelenting change, escalating
   customer expectations. and intense competition. Draw in from extant
   strategy and retailing research we propose that in in retail business
   models are best viewed as changes in three design components: (1) the
   way in which the activities are organized, (2) the type of activities
   that are executed, and (3) the level of participation of the actors
   engaged in performing those activities. We propose six major ways in
   which retailers could innovate their business models to enhance value
   creation and appropriation beyond the levels afforded by traditional
   approaches to retailing. We also describe the drivers of business model
   innovations, the potential consequences of such innovations, and
   numerous examples from retail practice that highlight our concepts and
   arguments. lit doing So. we provide a starting point for academic
   research in a domain that is deficient in theoretical and empirical
   research, and offer retailing manners a framework to guide retail

   distinct stages emerge, with highest levels of variables in the
   honeymoon stage, lower levels in routine and crossroad stages, and
   increasing levels in the stabilization stage. Franchisors should strive
   for "stability on high levels" before operational realities influence
   the franchisees. Franchisees' intermediate lifecycle phases are most
   critical for the system, since opportunistic behavior and switching are

AB Satisfaction of franchisees and employee-managers affects the overall
   performance of a franchise system. We argue that different actors in the
   same franchise system need to be treated in different ways. The
   franchisor's choice of control mechanisms affects the satisfaction of
   franchisees and employee-managers differently. To our knowledge this is
   the first study that gathers primary data from franchisees and
   employee-managers in the same franchise system at the store level with
   almost identical questionnaires. We show based on data from the largest
   German franchise system that outcome control leads to higher
   satisfaction among franchisees and employee-managers, while behavior
   control enhances employee-managers' satisfaction. Thereby, outcome
   control leads to higher satisfaction among more experienced franchisees,
   while behavior control enhances both highly and lowly experienced
   employee-managers' satisfaction. Our results suggest that franchisors
   face a dilemma: On the one hand, behavior control is associated with
   high costs and has no impact on franchisees' satisfaction at all. On the
   other hand, it might still be necessary to prevent franchisees from
   behaving opportunistically. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by

AB This paper develops the first global index of international franchise
   expansion that ranks countries according to their attractiveness to
   US-based franchise firms. A quantitative model combining insights from
   academic research and business practice generates a ranking of 143
   potential expansion target countries according to their risk/opportunity
   profiles. The rankings suggest that countries with large markets and
   strong political and legal systems (large European countries, and
   Canada. Japan, and Australia) are the most attractive for US-based
   franchisors, while the small, unstable African countries are the least
   attractive. China (and the other BRIC countries Brazil, Russia. India)
   though attractive from a market opportunity perspective, is nevertheless
   not highly ranked due to their significant risks and large cultural and
   geographic distances. This study reaffirms the importance of a strategic
   approach to international franchising decisions, underscores the
   importance of properly assessing the relative importance of key
   determinants in internationalization decisions, highlights the
   importance of a comprehensive and systematic assessment of the various

   from a sample of 40 journals, we use co-citation analysis, employed in
   both multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, to
   evaluate 67,073 citations and determine the theoretical underpinnings of
   franchising research. As the results indicate, the retailing literature
   has had an integral influence on studies related to franchising. To
   advance this research domain, we develop a three-dimensional typology
   (franchise structure, consumer exchange, and strategic intention) based
   on established and emergent franchise-related topics. The typology
   indicates six suggested topics for examination to advance franchising
   research based on the domain's accomplishments to date. (C) 2011 New

   qualitative study regarding the significant role independent franchisee
   associations play within franchise systems. The data reveal that
   successful franchisee associations help manage the inherent tension that
   exists between cooperation and conflict in franchise relationships. A
   distinctive adaptive organizational identity provides an association the
   capability necessary to reframe its relationship with the franchisor as
   either combative or cooperative in response to changes in a franchisor's
   identity. Challenging the views of both franchisor stability and the
   dyadic form that franchisee franchisor relationships assume, behavioral
   insight is provided into the actual functioning of franchise systems and
   new avenues are suggested for theory building in franchising. (C) 2010

AB An exchange perspective of franchising recognizes the important role
   that both the franchisor and franchisee assume in developing and
   maintaining sustainable relationships. However, should franchisees not
   perceive value in the quality of provided products or services, some
   incentive misalignment between agent and principal is likely (e.g. free
   riding, non-compliance with system standards), potentially resulting in
   greater perceptions of financial risk, diminished levels of franchisee
   satisfaction, reduced unit performance and conflict (Harmon and
   Griffiths 2008; Kaufmann and Dant 1998). A greater understanding of
   franchisee perceptions of value is very important if ongoing
   satisfaction in the franchising relationship is the goal. This paper,
   therefore, makes a significant contribution to such an understanding by
   empirically testing the dimensions of value that influence franchisee
   perceptions of risk and relationship satisfaction. Moreover, we make
   important comparisons across gender, the results of which provide rich
   information. In theoretical terms, we advance the literature in the
   context of value and franchising and, in practical terms, the results,
   by managing for performance (financial risk and relationship quality),
   assist franchisors in developing, delivering and managing what is of
   value to their franchisees. Furthermore, the findings of this study
   provide a solid platform for future research in this area. (C) 2010 New

AB In this paper, we examine the strategic use of debt in franchise
   organizations. We focus on both the franchisee's and the franchisor's
   capital structures. The primary goal of this study is to examine whether
   franchisors impose limits on franchisees' debt levels to be able to
   increase their own leverage. We find that the franchisor's leverage is
   significantly related to the maximum leverage allowed for the
   franchisee. As the franchisor sets an upper limit on the franchisee's
   debt ratio, the franchisor can raise more debt and therefore seizes tax
   benefits, since interest payments are tax deductible. We find that this
   effect is stronger in chains with larger fractions of franchised
   outlets. (C) 2010 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB A retail franchisor needs growth capital so that the brand continues to
   grow and franchisor-franchisee relations remain strong. However, access
   to corporate liquidity to fund such franchise growth options is not
   unlimited. A method of raising finance particularly suited to retail
   franchisors is intellectual property (IP) securitization that allows
   companies to account for intangible assets such as intellectual
   property. royalty and brands and realize their full value. In recent
   years, a number of large restaurant franchisors have securitized their
   brands to raise hinds, including Dunkin Brands and Domino's Pizza
   (Domino's). We use property rights approach to show that IP
   securitization provides mechanisms that explicitly define ownership of
   intangible assets within the securitization structure and thus enables a
   company to raise funds against these assets. Using a case study example
   of a retail franchise IP securitization transaction, we also provide
   evidence that these mechanisms are not overly restrictive and can be
   used more widely to help fund retail franchise growth and expansion. (C)

AB Franchising has attracted the attention of retailing and
   entrepreneurship scholars in the past three decades, but evidence
   pertaining to how franchising affects financial performance is mixed and
   inconclusive. Thus, the question remains as to whether franchising firms
   exhibit better financial performance than non-franchising firms in the
   same industry. In order to find an answer to this question, our study
   compares the risk-adjusted financial performance of franchising versus
   non-franchising restaurant firms over the 1995-2008 interval, using five
   different performance measures: the Sharpe Ratio, the Treynor Ratio, the
   Jensen Index, the Sortino Ratio, and the Upside Potential Ratio. For
   each measure, the results revealed that franchising restaurant firms
   outperformed their non-franchising counterparts. Thus, we provide very
   robust evidence that franchising is superior on average in the
   restaurant industry, which can help explain the increasing popularity of
   franchising as a business form. (C) 2011 New York University. Published

AB Even within a store chain and format, supermarket outlets often exhibit
   substantial differences in selling surface. For chain managers, this
   raises the issue of correctly anticipating the promotion lift, and of
   profitably managing promotion activities, across these outlets. In this
   paper, we conceptualize why and how store size influences the category
   sales effectiveness of four promotional indicators (depth of the
   promotional discount, display support, feature support, and whether the
   promotion is quantity-based). We then estimate the net moderating effect
   on four product categories for 103 store outlets belonging to four
   chains. For each of the promotion instruments, we find the percentage
   sales increases to be lower in large stores. For instance, whereas a 10%
   point increase in feature activity enhances category sales by about
   1.64% in a 700 m(2) store, this figure drops to only 1.03% in a 1300
   m(2) store a 59% reduction. This moderating effect is especially
   pronounced for discount depth, the relative sales lift from a typical
   price cut being about 78% lower in the larger-sized outlet. However,
   since large outlets also have larger base sales, the picture changes
   when we consider absolute sales effects. The net outcome is that deeper
   discounts or quantity-based promotions do not systematically generate
   larger or smaller absolute sales bumps in large stores, whereas for
   in-store displays and features, we obtain a clear positive (be it less
   than proportional) link between store size and absolute category sales
   lift. When it comes to margin implications, we show that large stores
   gain higher profit from price cuts than small outlets only as long as
   the retailer keeps part of the manufacturer discount to himself.
   Managers can use these insights to improve their promotional forecasts
   across outlets, as well as to tailor their mix of instruments to store
   selling surface. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB Retailers use various promotions, such as gift cards, to increase
   profits. When retailers give gift cards "free" to consumers who spend
   above specified thresholds in a single purchase, some consumers may buy
   more goods. We develop a model to derive the optimal purchase amount
   thresholds and gift card values. The model is developed for consumers
   without and then with a spending constraint. We find that the retailer's
   profit margin, the degree of forward buying and stockpiling, and use of
   gift cards in future purchases that would have been made with cash, are
   the most important factors in determining the profitability of gift
   cards. Gift cards may be very profitable for high-margin retailers who
   can limit the degree of forward buying and stockpiling, particularly
   when consumers use gift cards to buy goods they would not have bought
   from the retailer without gift cards. If this is how consumers use the
   gift cards, then consumers spending above the cards' value at redemption
   can significantly increase their profitability. Without a consumer
   spending constraint, it is best for the retailer to offer at most one
   gift card at a large purchase amount. With a consumer spending
   constraint, it may be profitable to give gift cards at multiple purchase
   amount thresholds. We also show that the commonly observed policy of
   giving gift cards at equally spaced purchase amounts may be profitable
   when forward buying and stockpiling can be controlled. Moreover, we show
   that gift cards become more profitable when consumers are inconsistent,
   that is, they overestimate their probability of redeeming the gift card
   at purchase time. Finally, gift cards may have only a slight profit
   advantage over discounts if consumers are consistent. Consumer
   inconsistency and spending above the cards' value increase this
   advantage. (C) 2010 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB We consider a monopolistic supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and
   a retailer (service provider) who in addition to selling new durables,
   buy and resell used ones. The supply chain provides services for both
   new and used goods. Accordingly, consumers incur service charges for all
   types of goods. This study is motivated by the modern trend in cell
   phone businesses where retailers commence buying used phones from
   customers willing to upgrade their phones. The used phones are then
   refurbished and resold along with the services. The question that this
   trend gives rise to is how the interaction with the secondary market
   affects the performance of the supply chain in terms of its
   intracompetition and thereby its profit. We show that for a wide range
   of service rates, the second-hand market coordinates the supply chain by
   either reducing the double marginalization effect or by offsetting it
   with extra profits gained by servicing the used goods. This, however,
   does not imply that both parties always improve their profits.
   Furthermore, we find that when the service rates are low, the supply
   chain would be better off if the goods were not durable thereby
   precluding the very existence of the second-hand market. (C) 2011 New

AB Luxury retail strategy differs from other retail strategies not merely
   in distinctive formulations of product, price, distribution, and appeals
   to customer distinction. Instead, it increasingly stands or falls on the
   legitimacy of a charismatic creative director. The director offers an
   aesthetic brand ideology. Luxury retail draws on the principles of art
   and magic to assemble the charismatic persona of the creative director
   and to diffuse his aesthetic ideology to the brand. Moreover, luxury
   retail strategy enlists magical and aesthetic principles within and
   without the store to achieve these ends. Finally, retail luxury is
   producer rather than consumer oriented and seeks to generate awe rather
   than community. This strategy appears to be to some extent a response to
   legitimacy crises provoked by recent strategic extensions of luxury
   brands into mass marketing. We offer some implications for marketing in
   which the charisma of a key personage is at stake. (C) 2011 New York

   partner. The results of two studies one a national survey of dealers for

   distress caused by a supplier's destructive act, high affective
   commitment induces more negative extra-role behaviors, high calculative
   commitment induces more positive extra-role behaviors, while high

   category. We propose that when a retailer offers a single store brand,
   consumers expect it to be of lower quality even when it is described as
   a premium brand. On the other hand, quality perception of a premium
   store brand increases in the presence of a value store brand.
   Importantly, quality perceptions of a value store brand are not affected

   lead to a cumulative loss of control. This paper discusses how some
   organizations can reduce their internal hierarchy by slicing it into two
   components and substituting the supervisor subordinate relationship with
   an independent contract. This substitution allows the organization to
   shift its lower-level hierarchy to the contractors. These contractors
   are less likely to indulge in moral hazard, which can further reduce the
   size of hierarchy required. The paper examines this theory in the domain
   of multi-unit franchising and tests the hypotheses with a longitudinal

AB In addition to the traditionally investigated profit-drivers of retail
   adoption, such as gross margin, trade support, consumer marketing
   support. and product uniqueness, the authors investigate to what extent
   relatively under-investigated variables, such as relationship variables
   and category variables, are potential antecedents of retailers' new
   product adoption decisions. Based on a sample of 392 new product
   adoption decisions by buyers of a Dutch food retailer, the authors
   provide evidence that both relationship and category variables do matter
   in new product adoption decisions by retailers. They show a significant
   negative effect of relationship dependence, and a significant positive
   effect of relationship length on a retailer's new product adoption
   probability. Furthermore, the authors show that higher levels of
   expected category growth due to the new product introduction are
   associated with higher levels of retailer adoption probability. Finally,
   in contrast with all previous retail adoption studies, this study shows
   a significant, positive relation between the relative gross margin of
   the new product and the retailer adoption probability. (C) 2011 New York

AB Online user-generated product reviews have become an indispensible tool
   for consumers and thus for retailers who want to attract and retain
   consumers. Yet, relatively little is known about what causes consumers
   to find an online peer review helpful to their shopping tasks. Prior
   research examines mostly the effects of product reviews on consumer
   product attitude, product choice, and product sales. This paper,
   however, provides an analysis of the determinants of review helpfulness.
   In two studies, we examine the effects of review characteristics,
   product type, and reviewer characteristics on perceived review
   helpfulness. With data collected from a real online retailer, we provide
   empirical evidence to support our conceptual predictions. Specifically,
   both review valence and length have positive effects on review
   helpfulness, but the product type (i.e., experiential vs. utilitarian
   product) moderates these effects. Using content analysis of reviews, we
   develop a measure of expressed reviewer innovativeness (i.e., the
   predisposition toward new products as revealed in review content). A
   curvilinear relationship exists between expressed reviewer
   innovativeness and review helpfulness. These findings lead to pertinent
   managerial implications. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by

AB The field of marketing has witnessed substantial improvement in modeling
   household level heterogeneity. However, relatively little has been
   written about how modeling household heterogeneity translates into
   better marketing decisions. In this paper, we study the impact of
   household level heterogeneity in reference price effects on a retailer's
   pricing policy. Reference prices are certain anchors or standards that
   households use to compare the observed purchase price of a product
   against. If the observed price is greater than the reference price it is
   perceived as a "loss" and if it is smaller than the reference price it
   is perceived as a "gain". In order to study the impact of heterogeneity
   in reference price effects on retail pricing, we test a nested logit
   model under two alternative reference price (memory and stimulus based)
   and heterogeneity (finite mixture and hierarchical Bayes)
   specifications. In the empirical analysis, we find that households are
   quite heterogeneous in terms of their gain and loss effects. For some
   households a gain has higher impact than a corresponding loss, while the
   opposite is true for others. Using individual level estimates we then
   develop a normative pricing policy for a retailer maximizing category
   profit. Our results indicate that the optimal pricing policy derived
   from the heterogeneous case is qualitatively different, and more
   profitable, than the case when heterogeneity is ignored. We show that
   for an important marketing problem pertaining to a retailer, the optimal
   pricing decisions for various brands in a category are inextricably
   related to household heterogeneity in reference effects and brand
   preference. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of New York

   knowledge of consumers about marketers' pricing tactics. Employing an
   acquisition transaction utility theoretic perspective, this study
   examines the differential effects of value consciousness and coupon
   proneness on the accuracy, confidence, and calibration of consumers'
   pricing tactics persuasion knowledge. The study finds that coupon
   proneness is negatively related to accuracy, confidence, and calibration
   of PTPK, while value consciousness is positively related to accuracy,

AB There is evidence that consumer knowledge of prices is limited, implying
   that, on occasions, consumers may not be fully informed of prices when
   making a brand purchase. On such occasions, how do consumers make their
   brand choice decision? One possibility is that consumers use their
   expectation of prices. This raises an interesting question. To what
   extent is brand purchase either a function of preferences and posted
   prices or, of preferences and expectation of brand prices? Another
   important issue relates to the role of displays and features in
   simplifying consumer brand choice. First, do promotions cause consumers
   to restrict their attention to only promoted brands? Second, do
   promotions affect the price aware consumers more than the price unaware
   consumers? Our study uses scanner data on ketchup and peanut butter
   categories to answer the foregoing questions. We find that between 40
   and 50% of the purchases are made by consumers using expectations of
   prices rather than posted prices. Consumers using price expectations may
   be thought of as being "unaware" of prices. We also find that promotions
   cause some consumers to focus exclusively on promoted brands, and this
   effect is greater on the price aware consumers than on the price unaware
   consumers. Our findings have an important bearing on the rationality of
   consumer expectation of prices, especially of the promoted brands. Price
   aware consumers act as a check against firms promoting without
   accompanying price cuts. Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of New York

AB We build an econometric model of a household's contemporaneous brand
   choice outcomes in complementary product categories. This model
   explicitly captures cross-category dependencies in brand choice outcomes
   of a household. Such dependencies have not been modeled in existing
   multi-category demand models.
   Our model accommodates cross-category dependencies that arise on account
   of three component effects: (1) complementarity due to the additional
   utility that a household derives from the joint purchase of brands in
   complementary categories, (2) marketing spillovers due to the effects of
   brands' prices in one category affecting the households' latent
   utilities for brands in the complementary category, (3) unobserved
   dependencies due to correlations in households' latent utilities for
   brands across categories.
   We estimate our proposed multi-category brand choice model using scanner
   panel data on cake mix and frosting categories. We find that
   complementarity accounts for the vast majority of the estimated
   cross-category effects in demand. We also find that as much as 55
   percent of the total retail profit impact of price promotions arise on
   account of brand-level (focus of our study), as opposed to
   category-level (focus of previous studies), dependencies in household
   demand. Finally, we propose an easily interpretable visual
   representation Largess and Free-Ride Plot of cross-category price
   elasticities that summarizes the differential abilities of brands to
   influence, or be influenced by, brands in the complementary category.

AB We examine the indirect impact of price deals, which occurs through the
   formation of expected future prices, on households' purchase decisions.
   Two competing learning processes of households' formation of expected
   future deals that lead to opposite predictions are proposed. Under a
   deal-probability learning process, a current deal on a brand raises
   households' expectations of a deal on the same brand in the immediate
   future, while under a deal-timing learning process, a current deal on a
   brand lowers households' expectations of a deal on the same brand. We
   embed each learning specification within a comprehensive econometric
   framework that simultaneously examines three purchase decisions
   incidence, brand choice and quantity at the household level, while
   explicitly correcting for two sources of selectivity bias in discrete
   quantity outcomes. We estimate the proposed model using scanner panel
   data on paper towels, and find that (I) the deal-probability learning
   process better describes how households incorporate the deal information
   into the formation of future price expectations compared to the
   deal-timing learning process; (2) the indirect impact of price deals is
   greater for brand-loyals than for brand-switchers; (3) the indirect
   impact of price deals is greater for larger families, heavy users, less
   educated and less employed households, and infrequent shoppers. We also
   show that ignoring the indirect impact of price deals severely
   overstates the sales effects. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by

AB Advances in information technology have led to a substantial increase in
   the use of interactive pricing mechanisms, where buyers (i.e.,
   consumers) and sellers (i.e., retailers) enter a formal
   computer-mediated price-negotiation process during which consumers
   submit bids for a specific product. This article examines how the
   interface used for bid elicitation affects bidding behavior and,
   ultimately, retailer profit. Our focus is on one key aspect of the
   bid-elicitation interface how retailers require bidders to articulate
   their bids. Evidence from four experiments involving economically
   consequential bids demonstrates that the candidate bid amounts specified
   by the retailer have a strong influence on bidding behavior, and
   consequently also on retailer profit. In particular, the level of
   candidate bid amounts has a positive effect on actual bid amounts,
   whereas it has a negative impact on the likelihood that a consumer will
   actually submit a bid. Critically, we show that the former effect can
   more than offset the latter to cause an increase in retailer profit. We
   propose and find support for two distinct pathways driving this
   phenomenon the candidate bid amounts (I) influence bidders' valuations
   of the offered product and (2) shape bidders' beliefs about what bid
   amounts will be successful. Our results highlight the importance of the
   design of user interfaces for interactive pricing, demonstrating that
   even seemingly innocuous aspects of interfaces can have a dramatic
   impact on bidding behavior and retailer profit. 2011 New York

AB Low-price guarantees help buyers make inferences about retailers'
   prices. However, researchers are concerned that consumers might be
   vulnerable to relying on guarantees associated with high market prices.
   Furthermore, truly low-priced retailers that issue low-price guarantees
   might be vulnerable to consumers' discounting of such guarantees. This
   article experimentally assesses these concerns and finds that the
   effects of adding a low-price guarantee to a low or high offer price on
   consumers' pre-purchase perceptions depend on consumers' confidence in
   their product category price knowledge and their decision involvement.

AB Retailers' presentation of merchandise to consumers is often organized

   price sort, leading to differences in sensitivity to prices for a target

   examine this issue and find that sorting of alternatives interacts with
   consumers' motivation and influences price perceptions. Our results add
   nuance to the findings from previous studies examining how assortment
   affects consumers' price sensitivity, and suggest that retailers whose

   non-hagglers (# bids <= 2), hagglers who employ a constant bid increment
   (i.e., a linear) strategy and a decreasing bid increment (i.e., concave)
   strategy save more, while those who employ an increasing bid increment
   strategy (i.e., convex) fare no better. A post hoc analysis also shows

AB Expiration date-based pricing (EDBP) occurs when a grocery retailer
   reduces the price of a perishable product according to its remaining
   shelf life. While, conventional wisdom suggests that this practice leads
   to negative consumer evaluations of brand quality, a series of field
   experiments reveal negative effects on brand quality perceptions only
   among loyal consumers and those who perceive low risk associated with
   perishables. The effect is also mediated by consumer distrust (Study 1).
   In addition, EDBP has no effect on brand quality image if consumers are

AB Research into nine-ending pricing indicates a clear effect on sales but
   strong variance, suggesting that their effects are context dependent.
   This research relates nine-ending effects to a broad set of determinants
   and investigates the influence of brand, category, store, and store area
   clientele characteristics. The numerous empirically supported hypotheses
   indicate that the framework built on level and image effects is well
   adapted for explaining the effectiveness of nine-endings. They validate
   that a wide and indiscriminate practice of nine-ending pricing is not
   effective. The findings show that the impact of nine-endings can lead to
   sales losses (e.g., premium brands); however, a nine-ending price is
   more effective for increasing sales of small brands (e.g., low
   market-share, low price, and new items) that belong to weaker categories
   (e.g., low price, low budget-share). The effect erodes as the store's
   nine-ending pricing practices intensify. For category sales, a
   simulation reveals the existence of a threshold for which overuse is
   counterproductive. (C) 2011 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB This paper offers a fresh approach to the literature examining the
   effect of internationalization on retail-firm performance. We draw on
   the organizational learning theory to test the moderating effect of four
   variables which are hypothesized to affect the performance of
   internationalizing retailers through facilitating the transfer of
   learning in international markets. The study innovates by introducing a
   new performance metric, and an advanced methodology to account for the
   dynamic aspects of organizational learning. Testing our hypotheses on a
   sample of international retailers, we find that the relationship between
   internationalization and performance is U-shaped, and moderated by
   mergers and acquisitions, age at entry to international markets and
   country of origin. The findings extend prior research by providing more
   comprehensive evidence regarding the conditions under which
   internationalization leads to improved performance. The authors conclude
   by outlining the implications for practice. (C) 2011 New York

AB Many retailers are implementing policies that encourage customer
   adoption of self-service technology (SST) offerings, such as
   self-checkout lanes, in order to enhance profitability. Instead of
   explicitly forcing customers to use SST, retailers create situations in
   which patrons are subtly pushed toward SST adoption. The authors examine
   the effects of fairness perceptions of these SST "push" policies on
   relationships between established antecedents of SST adoption and
   customer behavioral intentions toward the provider in a retail context.
   The results suggest fairness perceptions exert a significant influence
   on the relationships between these antecedents and customer patronage,
   future spending, and negative word of mouth intentions. Consistent
   findings across both users and nonusers of SST underscore the importance
   of fairness perceptions in the context of retailer SST push policies.

AB Understanding the effect of temporary price reductions, or price
   promotions, on sales of consumer packaged goods is an area of ongoing
   interest, both in academia and in practice. Price promotions, however,
   are becoming an increasingly important method of managing consumer
   demand for fresh produce items. Modeling the impact of price promotions
   must take into account the differentiated nature of fresh produce and
   the fact that consumers tend to purchase multiple items of only a few of
   the products available to them. Neither a continuous nor a discrete
   model of demand is appropriate. In this paper, we apply a
   multiple-discrete/continuous model of fresh produce demand to study the
   impact of price promotion on retail apple sales. Our findings show that
   the brand switching/category incidence effect of promotion is closer to
   65/35 than the more usual 80/20 rule (80 percent of the effect is brand
   switching and 20 percent purchase incidence) when the nature of the
   decision is appropriately taken into consideration. (C) 2012 New York

   holds across both high and low involvement categories and in particular

AB Recent empirical evidence regarding the relationship between store brand
   purchase and store loyalty suggests a nonmonotonic relationship
   (inverted U): positive up to a certain store brand consumption level,
   after which it becomes negative. To investigate this idea further, this
   research analyzes the role of (1) the retailer's competitive
   positioning, and specifically its price positioning, and (2) the product
   category. On the one hand, the more price oriented the retailer's
   positioning, the more favorable is the relationship between store brand
   consumption and store loyalty. The threshold level of store brand
   purchasing at which the relationship becomes negative occurs later, and
   this negative relationship is less prominent. On the other hand, the
   relationship between store brand consumption and store loyalty appears
   to differ across product categories as a consequence of several factors,
   including perceived risk. The relationship therefore appears more
   favorable for risky categories. An empirical study of ten retailers that
   adopt different price positions corroborates these propositions. (C)

AB During most consumer exchanges, particularly in service and retailing

   of other customers can have a profound impact on customer experiences.
   Despite studies demonstrating the importance of managing the customer
   experience and customer portfolios, the marketing literature lacks a
   comprehensive scale that can be used to assess individuals' perceptions
   of other customers during commercial transactions. This study
   conceptualizes a three-dimension, Other Customer Perception (OCP) scale
   to address this gap. Using a seven-step scale development process, the
   multi-dimensional conceptualization is supported and validated and the
   research demonstrates the impact of the OCP dimensions on consumers'
   approach and avoidance intentions. The findings provide a clearer

AB Though brand loyalty has been studied extensively in the marketing
   literature, the relationship between brand loyalty and retail pricing
   strategies is not well understood. Designing promotion strategies
   involves two key decisions: the percentage reduction in price from the
   existing price point (depth), and the frequency with which a product is
   promoted. These decisions, in turn, are critically dependent upon how
   many consumers can be convinced to switch to a brand by temporarily
   reducing its price, and how many are instead brand loyal. Theoretical
   models of how the strength of brand loyalty influence optimal promotion
   strategies have been developed, but there are no rigorous tests of their
   hypotheses that take into account wholesale price variation. We test how
   brand loyalty impacts promotion strategies for two frequently purchased
   consumer packaged good categories. Our results confirm that retailers
   promote strong brands shallower and more frequently compared to brands
   with weak loyalty. Our results highlight the importance of carefully
   modeling wholesale prices when testing behavioral models on retail
   pricing. (C) 2012 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB This study investigates how price promotions for one pack-size of a
   brand steal sales from the other pack-sizes of the same brand. To do so,
   the study examines twelve grocery product categories (seven US, three
   UK, two Australian). The analysis finds heavy cross-pack
   cannibalization. On average, 22 percent of the sales uplift for a
   promoted brand-pack size comes from other pack sizes of the same brand.
   Cross-pack cannibalization most typically occurs in the week of the
   promotion, but also transfers future week's sales away from the
   non-promoted pack size in 31 percent of cases. The study finds higher
   cannibalization is associated with packs that sell for a higher dollar
   value than others sold under the same brand; whereas higher
   price-per-weight, a packaging difference, and the item having a larger
   relative share of sales in the brand portfolio, are linked to lower
   cannibalization. Also examined is the impact of pack-size
   cannibalization on promotion profitability for retailer PLs. That
   analysis finds PL price promotions have generally negative impacts on PL
   profits, and that pack-size cannibalization exacerbates this negative
   outcome. The results suggest both retailers and manufacturers should
   carefully consider pack-size cannibalization when evaluating the outcome
   of temporary price promotions. The study also provides some
   evidence-based recommendations from which managers can attempt to
   minimize such cannibalization. (C) 2012 New York University. Published

AB The tendency of managers to focus on short-term results rather than on
   sustained company success is of particular importance to retail
   marketing managers, because marketing activities involve expenditures
   which may only pay off in the longer term. To address the issue of
   myopic management, our study shows how the complexity of the service
   profit chain (SPC) can cause managers to make suboptimal decisions.
   Hence, our paper departs from past research by recognizing that
   understanding the temporal interplay between operational investments,
   employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and operating profit is
   essential to achieving sustained success. In particular, we intend to
   improve understanding of the functioning of the SPC with respect to time
   lags and feedback loops. Results of our large-scale longitudinal study
   set in a multi-outlet retail chain reveal time-lag effects between
   operational investments and employee satisfaction, as well as between
   customer satisfaction and performance. These findings, along with
   evidence of a negative interaction effect of employee satisfaction on

AB The domain of customer experience management (hereafter, CEM) includes
   every point of customer contact with products, services or businesses
   (Grewal, Levy, and Kumar 2009). In a recent special issue of the Journal
   of Retailing, Puccinelli et al. (2009) assert that a key atmospheric
   element of CEM that can shape customer satisfaction within the retail
   setting is the "interaction between the customer and employee" (p. 24).
   In this paper, we delve further into the social-interaction aspects of
   retail atmospherics, by focusing on how retailers and service providers
   use language to facilitate a specific type of provider/customer
   experience that we label the "marketplace ritual." We use depth
   interviews and participant observation to: (1) analyze the structure and
   function of the specific utterances providers identify as salient when
   creating and executing marketplace rituals; (2) discuss the ways
   language contributes to perceived strategic CEM-related outcomes; and
   (3) examine providers' perceptions of the potentially negative
   consequences of ritual language for CEM. (C) 2012 New York University.

AB Existing literature suggests that the increasing concentration in the
   retail industry is allowing powerful retailers to exploit their weaker
   suppliers, which causes the suppliers' performance to suffer. This study
   takes a Collaborative perspective of resource dependency theory and
   suggests that when suppliers engage in supply chain relationships with
   key retail account (KRA) customers, their performance may improve,
   depending on the varying levels of the supplier's and KRAs' market
   shares. The empirical analysis of data from two large retailers,
   Wal-Mart and Target, and a broad cross-section of their suppliers
   provides ample support for most of the hypotheses set forth in this
   paper: Suppliers that depend on KRAs for a significant share of their
   total revenues relinquish some of their leverage in the marketplace, but
   as the KRAs gain market share, their suppliers' performance tends to
   increase. Cumulatively, these results provide evidence of collaborative
   supplier-KRA relationships, such that a supplier's dependency on KRAs
   may positively affect supplier performance. This finding supports a more
   positive, symbiotic view of dependency, resulting in important
   implications for key account management, supply chain management, and
   retail research and practice. (C) 2012 New York University. Published by

AB A significant game-theoretic literature on the coordination of
   distribution channels has developed over the past three decades. We
   provide an extensive analysis of an important subset of this literature,
   channels without competition. We review four major models that build on
   the initial work of Jeuland and Shugan (1983) - who developed a
   quantity-discount schedule that induces channel members to set price and
   non-price, marketing-mix variables (MM-variables) at
   channel-coordinating levels. Moorthy (1987) criticized their schedule's
   complexity, arguing for a simpler wholesale contract that induces
   coordination by avoiding double marginalization.
   Our focus is on coordinating mechanisms that enable decentralized
   channels to replicate an integrated channel's performance. To ascertain
   the complexity required for coordination, we build a general model that
   can be adapted to different channel structures. We employ all two-part
   tariffs that are embedded in the Jeuland-Shugan and Moorthy schedules;
   and we offer an original disquisition on how MM-variables affect the
   wholesale-price contract needed for coordination. Specifically, we show
   that:
   center dot The impact of MM-variables on coordination pivots on which
   channel level provides them and whether their impact on sales is
   dyad-specific (e.g., co-op ads for a specific retailer) or multi-dyadic
   (e.g., national advertising that impacts multiple retailers).
   center dot Coordination requires non-zero margins for all channel
   members when both channel levels have dyad-specific MM-variables.
   center dot There are multi-dyadic MM-variables that a Jeuland-Shugan
   schedule cannot coordinate.
   center dot We develop an original wholesale-price schedule that
   coordinates all non-competing channel structure/MM-combinations. The
   Jeuland-Shugan and Moorthy schedules are special cases of our schedule.

AB There is a great deal of evidence that method bias influences item
   validities, item reliabilities, and the covariation between latent
   constructs. In this paper, we identify a series of factors that may
   cause method bias by undermining the capabilities of the respondent,
   making the task of responding accurately more difficult, decreasing the
   motivation to respond accurately, and making it easier for respondents
   to satisfice. In addition, we discuss the psychological mechanisms
   through which these factors produce their biasing effects and propose
   several procedural remedies that counterbalance or offset each of these
   specific effects. We hope that this discussion will help researchers
   anticipate when method bias is likely to be a problem and provide ideas
   about how to avoid it through the careful design of a study. (C) 2012

   a new retail brand on overall performance of the parent stores in which
   the boutiques are placed, and on customer spending on merchandise
   offered by each of the two brands. Findings from the two studies
   generally support that the in-store boutique enhances three key
   store-level metrics: average customer transaction value per store visit;
   comparable sales growth from one year to the next; and customer
   conversion ratio. At the customer-level both studies show that average
   customer transaction value on merchandise offered by the new brand is
   negatively related to average customer transaction value on the parent
   brand, and vice versa. Furthermore, both studies reveal that the
   relationship between the perceived fit between the two brands and
   average customer transaction value on the parent brand increases at an
   increasing rate (positive main and quadratic effects of perceived fit),
   but that the impact of perceived fit on average customer transaction

AB Self-service technologies (SSTs), such as airport check-in kiosks, can
   provide customers faster, better, and less expensive services. Yet
   sometimes customers experience service failures with these technologies.
   This study investigates the process by which customers recover from SST
   failures using their own effort (i.e., customer recovery) and explores
   their decisions to stay with or switch from the SST. Drawing from
   expectancy and attribution theories, we develop a process model centered
   on customer-recovery expectancy and test the model by tracking actual
   failure responses. The results show that internal attribution, perceived
   control over the SST, and SST interactivity all positively influence
   customer-recovery expectancy. In turn, expectancy affects customers'
   recovery effort and recovery strategies, depending on the availability
   of competitive information. Furthermore, greater recovery effort
   increases the likelihood of staying with an SST, whereas more recovery
   strategies increase the likelihood of switching. The theoretical and
   managerial implications of these findings include ways to design SSTs to
   enhance recovery expectancy, a key mechanism of the recovery process,
   and thus to encourage customers to persist with the technologies. (C)

   aversion result as an empirical generalization. Next, we provide and
   test an explanation: two empirical regularities in pricing cause that
   consumers tend to observe few losses for external reference price and
   many losses for internal reference price, making them less sensitive to
   internal than external losses. We use two scanner panel data sets to
   show that the two empirical regularities contribute to asymmetric loss
   aversion, while accounting for alternative explanations. We explore the

AB The back-story of customer rage, that is, what is behind a rage episode,
   specifically the customer's cognitive appraisal processes that trigger
   extreme negative emotions, and the customer's background (culture) is
   not well understood. This study involving 435 adult customers,
   investigates over two time periods (Episode 1: initial failure, and
   Episode 2: ineffective recovery), the association between the initial
   service failure type, subsequent ineffective service recovery attempts,
   and customers' cognitive appraisals. Our two country research clearly
   shows that service failure types are differentially associated with
   different forms of cognitive appraisals (i.e., perceived threats to
   resources, self-esteem, justice, control, and physical well-being),
   irrespective of the customer's home country. However, US and Thai
   customers appear to place different relative importance on cognitive
   appraisal types. Marketing managers can use this study to identify
   triggers of customer rage thus equipping them to implement strategies
   designed to mitigate this potentially harmful behavior. (C) 2012 New

AB Researchers and employers have largely neglected the wider influence of
   Staff Word-of-Mouth (SWUM), whereas employee referral programs are an
   established form of recruitment. This paper positions SWUM as a specific
   form of WOM, communicated by present and former employees, which can
   influence potential applicants at the prerecruitment stage.
   Scenario-based Study 1, with retail employees/applicants, shows
   differential effects on organizational attractiveness of SWUM with
   positive versus negative messages and tangible versus intangible
   information, if obtained from strong versus weak social ties.
   In Study 2, a survey of retail prehires demonstrates mediation and
   moderation effects on organizational attractiveness of job-seekers'
   precommitment, fit perceptions with the retailer, and
   mentoring/aspirational ties. Retailers are urged to develop the
   potential of SWUM through improved understanding, responding,
   motivating, and keeping employees informed. The study establishes a
   conceptual foundation to encourage further research into SWUM as a
   communication channel and a means to influence precommitment of
   prospective employees. (C) 2013 New York University. Published by

AB With increased competitive pressures in the grocery retailing industry,
   managers have greater interest in measuring the productivity of the
   stores of their own chain relative to the other similar stores. In this
   paper, we measure and compare the inefficiencies of major grocery
   retailers across various formats and pricing strategies using stochastic
   frontier (SF) methodology. Using a unique dataset covering 2500 stores
   across 50 chains, we find that the average inefficiency was about 28.59
   percent. Kroger and Wal-Mart are found to be the least inefficient
   chains with inefficiencies of 2.18 percent and 3.06 percent
   respectively. With respect to pricing strategy, EDLP and hybrid stores
   are found to do better than HiLo stores in generating weekly sales and
   with respect to format strategy, supercenters are found to do better
   than supermarkets and limited assortment stores. Using SF analysis, we
   also find that stores could potentially reduce the proportion of inputs
   such as selling area, number of checkout counters, number of employees
   and store features without threatening outcomes (i.e., by holding the
   output level constant). (C) 2012 New York University. Published by

AB Although the use of color in promotional ads is ubiquitous in the

   This research reports findings from four studies that assessed the
   impact of red on consumers' perceptions of savings. These studies reveal
   that the effect of red versus black prices on perception of savings is
   moderated by gender. Male consumers perceived greater savings when
   prices were presented in red than when presented in black (studies la
   and 1b). The effect persists in a multi-ad context (study 2). However,
   this effect of red abated when the level of involvement in the task was
   high (study 3). Women appeared to be naturally inclined toward greater
   elaboration of the ad and showed greater price recall. Theoretical and
   practical implications are discussed. (c) 2013 New York University.

AB Chain retailers continually open stores and close stores to improve
   their performance. Yet, there are few insights on the effects of store
   openings and closings on chain retailer performance. The authors examine
   the effect of changes in opening and closing stores on retailers'
   performance. They hypothesize that a chain retailer's market share,
   advertising intensity, age, and size moderate the effects of opening and
   closing stores on firm value. They test and find support for the
   contingent effects of opening and closing stores on firm value using a
   panel of 1,447 retailer-years of 132 publicly listed US chain retailers
   from 1998 to 2009. By relating chain retailers' store openings and
   closings to their performance, using a contingent framework, the
   findings extend the marketing literature, which has hitherto not
   examined the effects of changes in distribution strategy on shareholder
   value. Insights on the performance implications of opening and closing
   stores are also useful to chain retailers to achieve superior
   performance. Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of New York University.

AB Retail pass-through has been extensively analyzed analytically and
   empirically, and recent empirical work has stressed the importance of
   appropriate methodology and data for inferring correct retail
   pass-through. However the literature on retail pass-through has
   interpreted 'pass-through' as being confined to a specific product
   category, and only to brands within that category. This category
   restriction has been derived from a tradition of modeling retailers as
   'category profit maximizers'. Yet it is widely accepted that retailers
   strive to maximize profits across categories, with several categories
   specifically functioning as 'loss leaders'. In this paper we argue that
   this pragmatic view of retailers makes it necessary to reevaluate
   retailer pass-through from being merely a 'within category' phenomenon
   to also a 'cross category phenomenon'. Using a unique dataset we
   construct category price indices and empirically evaluate cross category
   pass-throughs with a variety of categories selected on the basis of
   profitability. We find that by and large cross category pass-throughs
   tend to be negative (about eighteen percent as compared to nine percent
   positive), that is, price cuts in a focal category being accompanied by
   price increases in other categories. Category characteristics such as
   price elasticity and proportion of loss leaders increase the probability
   of negative cross-category pass-throughs. We conclude that future work
   on retailer pass-throughs needs to incorporate cross category analysis
   in order to capture the 'true' strategic behavior of the retailer. (c)

AB We explore the phenomenon of gift registry as a specific ritual within a
   larger set of wedding rituals to understand interactions between
   consumers and retailers. We find that roles for retailers in family
   based rituals are expanding, given how consumers employ brands to
   negotiate meaning, experiences of identity, and the dispersion of social
   systems. These changes allow retailers, as ritual orchestrators, an
   opportunity to participate more fully in the gift registry ritual by
   shaping the experience for each type of ritual participant-bride, groom,
   and gift-giver. Our research contributes an interpretation of how
   consumers negotiate brand meaning within a temporary gift system, as
   they perform gift giving rituals situated squarely within the
   marketplace. We explore the implications these rituals have for the
   construction of identity, consumer-to-consumer and consumer-to-brand
   relationships. We provide suggestions for managers and directions for

   responses to recommendations are contingent on the type of customization
   strategy and level of recommendation offered by the firm. Specifically,
   consumers incorporate vendor recommendations in a build-up customization
   strategy but ignore recommendations when paring-down, as long as the
   recommendation is offered at a level which does not cause consumers to
   question the motives of the firm. However, when the level of
   recommendation is substantially different from the starting point of
   customization, consumers begin to question the motives of the firm which
   reveres the effect of recommendations on consumers' customized choices.

AB Retailers rely on employees' promotive work-related ideas to spur
   service delivery innovations. Yet a well-established finding in the
   literature is that employees refrain from sharing such ideas when they
   are dissatisfied, and a mountain of evidence suggests that job
   dissatisfaction is an epidemic in the retail industry. The intuitive
   solution would be for supervisors to support these employees; by
   willfully listening to employees' problems and providing help,
   supervisors could expect employees to voice their ideas. However, our
   results, from a field study and a controlled experiment, suggest that
   support should only be provided if a dissatisfied retail employee is
   also committed to his or her organization out of necessity. Otherwise,
   support ends up inducing levels of employee voice that are not
   significantly different than would be the case had the support been
   withheld, yielding the support a misallocation of effort. Published by

AB This extensive literature review highlights the state of the art
   regarding the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty,
   both attitudinal and behavioral. In particular, it brings to light
   several issues that should be carefully considered in analyzing the
   efficacy of customer satisfaction in explaining and predicting customer
   loyalty. In fact, for many years companies all around the world have
   heavily invested in customer satisfaction in the hope of increasing
   loyalty, and hence, consequently, profitability. But after having gone
   through a detailed analysis, it is clear that this link it is not as
   strong as it is believed to be and customer satisfaction is not enough
   to explain loyalty. In fact, the major findings of this review are
   captured in the form of a few empirical generalizations. We generalize
   that, while there is a positive relationship between customer
   satisfaction and loyalty, the variance explained by just satisfaction is
   rather small. Models that encompass other relevant variables as
   moderators, mediators, antecedent variables, or all three are better
   predictors of loyalty than just customer satisfaction. Further, the
   satisfaction-loyalty relationship has the potential to change over time.
   Similar weaker findings are uncovered and the study offers specific
   guidelines on who, when, and how much to satisfy. Finally, suggestions
   for future research to explore this domain are offered. (C) 2013 New

   research suggests that both quality and network effects are significant

   replicate and extend this research in several directions: (1) we
   replicate and confirm prior results that both quality and network
   effects are critical drivers of market share; (2) network and quality
   effects vary over the product generation life cycle, and hence, quality
   does not always win; and (3) in the Growth and Maturity phases of the

   effects. Our empirical results provide some practical insights for

   this growing literature by extending the hurdle model to capture
   customer dynamics using a hidden Markov chain. We find our dynamic model
   performs better than static and latent class models. Our results suggest
   the customer base can be segmented into four segments: Deal-prone,
   Dependable, Active, and Event-driven. Each segment reacts differentially
   to marketing activities. Although catalogs influence both purchase
   incidence and the number of orders, this marketing activity has the
   largest impact on purchase incidence across all four segments. In
   contrast, retail promotions are more likely to influence the number of
   orders a customer will make for all of the segments except for the
   Deal-prone segment. For this segment, retail promotions have the

   help determine what format of email advertising is most effective with
   customers at different lifecycle stages. The experiments examine
   customer response to picture-dominant versus text-dominant advertising.
   Although the relative effectiveness of picture- versus text-dominant
   advertising has received some attention in previous research, the issue
   of which type would be most effective at different points in the
   customer's relationship with the brand and for different metrics has not
   been explored. The two field experiments were executed by a major
   fashion retailer that sells clothing and accessories for special events.
   The first experiment was conducted with prospective customers and
   focused on advertising for the retailer's primary product, which
   typically occurs first in the purchase cycle. The second experiment was
   conducted with customers who had already purchased the primary product
   and focused on advertising for an accessory typically purchased later in
   the cycle. The investigation was conducted from a customer relationship
   management perspective, examining the financial impact of each type of

AB Adopting an interpersonal communication perspective, this study examines
   the propositions that a salesperson's touch increases trust, which
   increases product evaluations and purchase intention. These
   relationships are evaluated in a contact and non-contact culture, with
   need for touch (NFT) examined as an additional moderator. An exploratory
   series of in-depth interviews provides an initial understanding of these
   relationships, followed by a 2 (touch/no touch condition) x 2 (consumers
   in France/Germany) experiment with wine serving as the example category.
   The findings indicate that touch does not uniformly instill trust in
   customers. Instead a salesperson's touch relates to greater trust only
   when consumers have an inherent NFT or when they are from a culture
   where personal touching behavior is less prevalent. Trust, in turn,
   relates positively to evaluations of product attractiveness, quality,
   and to purchase intention. (C) 2013 New York University. Published by

AB The present research develops and tests a theory explaining how
   customers respond to failed service recoveries (i.e., double
   deviations). This work offers three novel and important conclusions.
   First, inferences about a firm's motive (negative vs. positive) mediate
   the impact of perceptions of the double deviation (i.e., severity,
   blame, and fairness) on resulting outcomes (i.e., customer anger, desire
   for revenge, and desire for reconciliation). Second, when inferred
   motive is positive, desire for reconciliation overwhelms desire for
   revenge, leading customers to choose more reparatory than retaliatory
   behaviors. Third, following a double deviation, firms that both
   compensate and apologize to customers can change customers' inferred
   motives from negative to positive, leading customers to desire more
   reconciliation than revenge, and engage in more reparatory than
   retaliatory behaviors. These studies demonstrate that, contrary to
   common wisdom, customers do not always respond negatively to a double
   deviation, and firms still have a "second chance" following a failed
   recovery. (C) 2013 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB It is a common trend in the retail industry for catalog retailers to
   mail multiple catalogs, each promoting different product categories. The
   existing catalog mailing models do not address the issue of optimizing
   multi-category catalog mailing. We address this research gap by
   introducing a model that integrates the when and what components of a
   customer's purchase decision into the how much component (number of
   catalogs) of a firm's cross-selling strategy. In addition to comparing
   the impact of category-specific versus full product catalogs in
   generating sales in a specific category, the study also finds relative
   impacts of various category-specific catalogs. We jointly estimate the
   probability of purchase and purchase amounts in multiple product
   categories by using multivariate proportional hazard model (MVPHM) and a
   regression based purchase amount model in a Hierarchical Bayesian
   framework. The model accounts for unobserved heterogeneity, and uses a
   control function (CF) approach to account for endogeneity in catalog
   mailing. The results from the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization
   suggest that the catalog mailing policy as per the proposed model would
   be able to generate 38.4 percent more customer lifetime Value (CLV) from
   a sample of 10 percent of the households as compared to the current
   catalog mailing policy of the retailer by reallocation of the catalogs
   across customers and mailing periods based on their propensity to buy.

AB Customized temporal discounts are price cuts or coupons that are
   tailored by size, timing, and household to maximize profits to a
   retailer or manufacturer. The authors show how such discounts allow
   companies to optimize to whom, when, and how much to discount. Such a
   scheme allows firms to send just enough discounts just prior to the
   individual's purchase of a rival brand. To do so, the authors model
   household purchase timing and brand choice in response to discounts and
   use Bayesian estimation to obtain individual household parameters. They
   illustrate the model on a Japanese data set having price cuts, a US data
   set having coupons, and another US data set having discounts. They
   formulate the optimization task of customized temporal coupons as a
   constrained multiple-knapsack problem under a given budget. They use
   simulations of the empirical contexts to obtain optimal solutions and to
   assess improvement in profits relative to existing practice and
   alternate models in the literature. The proposed model yields increase
   in profits of 18-40 percent relative to a standard model that optimizes
   the value but not timing of discounts. (C) 2013 New York University.

   variables, under discrete and uniform continuous distributions of
   reservation prices. We find that selling pure components by both
   manufacturer and retailer is the equilibrium except in a narrow region
   of the parameter space. However, if the manufacturer can sell bundles
   and prevent unbundling, then such a bundling strategy is optimal in many
   cases. Interestingly, the channel and retailer also benefit from this

   how reciprocal relationships between consumers' perceptions of corporate

   studies with longitudinal designs. We find that retail store equity
   interacts with corporate reputation and is a more important driver of

AB When a retailer distributes manufacturer coupons to consumers without
   perfectly identifying their product valuations, consumers may have
   incentives to trade coupons. We develop a model to capture the coupon
   trading phenomenon and compare three scenarios: (I) no coupon, (II)
   coupon without trading, and (III) coupon with trading. We find that
   coupon trading can increase the profits of either the retailer or the
   manufacturers, but not at the same time. The retailer benefits from
   coupon trading when the coupon market is competitive and consumer hassle
   cost is low, while the manufacturers benefit from coupon trading when
   the coupon market is uncompetitive and consumer hassle cost is high. In
   addition, coupon trading does not always increase total demand. Firms
   benefit from coupon trading by charging higher prices, which leads to a
   decreased total demand. As a result, consumers end up with a higher
   average cost under coupon trading. We also compare coupon trading with
   improved coupon targeting, and find that coupon trading may allow firms
   to gain higher profits than improved coupon targeting. Further, we
   extend the main model to a competitive setting where the products are
   substitutable, and find that the main results still hold Finally, we
   employ numerical analysis to identify the optimal coupon face values in
   different scenarios, and the results suggest that coupon trading
   combined with incentive mechanisms may lead to Pareto improvement for
   the channel as a whole. (C) 2013 New York University. Published by

   context of closing time, we show that issuance of boundary markers, or
   closing time cues, before the closing time boundary can result in
   perceptions of territory intrusion and territorial responses from
   customers. In study 1, we identify six types of cues used by employees
   to signal to customers the closing time boundary is approaching:
   productive, personal, audio visual, withdrawal, hostility, and blocking
   cues. Three additional studies show these cues affect customers'
   perceptions of intrusion pressure and their subsequent territorial
   responses, including: retaliation, abandonment and accession (studies
   2-4) and negative word of mouth and temporary abandonment (study 4).

   promote positive attitudes toward the ad, and stimulate word of mouth.
   Most importantly, ambient media increase purchase intention and sales

AB Coalition loyalty programs are on the rise, yet few studies investigate
   the impact of service failures in such programs. Using data from a
   retail context, the authors show that a program partner deemed
   responsible for a service failure suffers negative customer responses.
   However, customers' perceptions of the benefits of the coalition loyalty
   program buffer these consequences. Perhaps most importantly, when
   customers perceive the program's special treatment benefits as low,
   direct and indirect spillover effects occur, such that a service failure
   by one program partner has a negative effect on customer loyalty toward
   the program itself. (C) 2013 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB It is common among producers of consumer packaged goods to reduce the
   volume of product per package such that the new size replaces the old
   one. This tactic is commonly referred to as package downsizing. In this
   article, we investigate the extent to which consumers have different
   sensitivities to package price and package size in order to shed light
   on the managerial implications of package downsizing. To do so, we
   estimate a random utility model of demand to measure consumer response
   to price and package size using household scanner panel data on bulk ice
   cream purchases in Chicago. The estimation framework involves modeling
   household heterogeneity, addressing price endogeneity and accounting for
   unbalanced choice alternatives. Our main finding is that consumers are
   less responsive to package size than to price; the demand elasticity
   with respect to package size is approximately one-fourth the magnitude
   of the demand elasticity with respect to price. This result implies that
   marketing managers can use downsizing as a hidden price increase in
   order to pass through increases in production costs, that is, cost of
   raw materials, and maintain, or increase, their profits. (C) 2013 New

AB A myriad of front-of-package (FOP) nutrition labeling systems have been
   developed by both food retailers (e.g., Walmart, Safeway, Hannaford) and
   manufacturers (e.g., Kellogg's, General Mills) to help consumers
   identify more healthful options at the point-of-purchase. Given the
   uniqueness of these different approaches, two studies examine the
   effects of alternative FOP systems on shoppers' product evaluations,
   choices, and retailer evaluations. When a single food item is evaluated
   in isolation, both the reductive and evaluative systems had a positive
   effect on product evaluations. However, when several choice options are
   presented simultaneously in a realistic retail environment, the
   evaluative (reductive) system has a stronger (weaker) influence on
   product evaluation and choice. Results also show that FOP nutrition
   labeling systems have both direct and moderating effects on attitude
   toward the retailer and perceived retailer concern for shoppers. These
   retailer-related outcomes, in turn, mediate the effects of the labeling
   system on shoppers' intentions to patronize the retailer. Results
   suggest that FOP nutrition labeling may help retailers build a non-price
   competitive advantage. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of

   assessing different design elements of online product reviews, and

   of 26 empirical studies yielding 443 sales elasticities to examine how
   these variables relate to retail sales. Building on well-established
   meta-analytical methods, we address the following questions: How does
   review valence influence the elasticity of retailer sales? What about
   review volume? For which product types and usage situations do online
   product reviews have a greater impact on retailer sales elasticity?
   Which types of online reviewers and websites exert the greatest
   influence on retailer sales elasticity? Our study answers these
   important questions and provides a much needed quantitative synthesis of

   product categories, the relationship between market share and retail
   distribution is increasing and convex at the SKU level. The degree of
   convexity is greater in categories with higher revenues and more
   concentration in market shares. The relationship is also typically
   convex within leading brands' SKU portfolios, showing that the "double
   jeopardy" phenomenon of low share and distribution not only affects
   small brands competing against market leaders, it also affects low-share
   SKUs within a category leader's product line. Holdout evidence shows
   that the distribution/share relationship within a brand's portfolio of
   existing SKUs usually holds for new SKUs as well. We explain how
   knowledge of the distribution/share relationship can help to improve a

AB This article presents a meta-analysis of 1,268 estimates of shelf space
   elasticities, that is, the ratio of additional sales to additional space
   allocated in retail settings. The study finds several new empirical
   generalizations about shelf space elasticity. The most important
   generalizations are as follows: The average observed shelf space
   elasticity is .17, which varies across product categories, with the
   lowest estimates for commodities, followed by staples, and the highest
   estimates for impulse buys. Store size moderates the effect of product
   characteristics on shelf space elasticity: in large stores, the
   difference between elasticities for brand versus category is greater
   than in small stores. Furthermore, the shelf space elasticity estimates
   are less dependent on method characteristics than commonly assumed in
   the literature. Regarding the influence of the direction of space
   variation, the study finds that shelf space increases results in greater
   elasticity estimates than shelf space reduction, a finding that
   emphasizes the application of shelf space variation as a useful
   marketing tool. These findings provide several implications for managers
   and researchers. (C) 2013 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB Loss aversion is a behavioral phenomenon with game-changing implications

   studies (providing 109 observations) investigating loss aversion in
   random utility models of brand choice. Specifically, we use multilevel
   modeling techniques to examine potential moderators of preference
   asymmetries as well as the variability of loss-aversion effects within
   and between studies. We find that loss aversion is manifest in product
   choice, but that it exhibits substantial variation across research
   contexts. Product-related variables (e.g., the category type), consumer
   characteristics (e.g., reference-point mechanisms), and particularly
   methodological decisions (e.g., model specifications) determine the
   observed degree of loss gain disparity. Practical implications of the
   specific findings and opportunities for future research are discussed.

   the directions and magnitudes of the determinants' effect sizes,

AB This research investigates the interrelationship between service

   service retailing literature: (1) As a means of better understanding the
   effectiveness of switching costs, the study suggests a two-dimensional
   typology of switching costs, including internal and external switching
   costs and (2) it reveals that the effect of these switching costs on
   customer loyalty is contingent upon four service characteristics (the
   IHIP characteristics of service). We carried out a meta-analytic review
   of the literature on the switching costs-customer loyalty link and
   created a hierarchical linear model using a sample of 1,694 customers
   from 51 service industries. Results reveal that external switching costs
   have a stronger average effect on customer loyalty than do internal
   switching costs. Moreover, we find that IHIP characteristics moderate
   the links between switching costs and customer loyalty. Thus, the link
   between external switching costs and customer loyalty is weaker in
   industries higher in the four service characteristics (as compared to
   industries lower in these characteristics), while the opposite
   moderating effect of service characteristics for the internal switching
   costs loyalty link is noted. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by

AB Premium private labels (PLs) are considered one of the hottest trends in
   grocery retailing. Still, retailers do not feel the need to introduce
   premium PLs in every category. Generalizing across approximately 150
   categories for six retailers from two countries that already carry
   premium PLs for several years, the authors find that retailers are more
   likely to introduce premium PLs in categories with a higher industry PL
   share, and with a more proliferated assortment in terms of standard PLs.
   However, retailers are also aware of the risk of creating PL fatigue at
   high levels of standard PL proliferation. Further, premium PLs are more
   likely to be introduced in categories with more frequent price
   promotions, a longer interpurchase time, a higher need for variety, and
   higher functional, but lower social, risk. In addition, retailers
   consider category growth and the prevailing practice of their country's
   premium-PL pioneer when deciding in which categories to also introduce a
   premium PL. Finally, when NBs spend a smaller amount on advertising and
   NB proliferation is moderate, premium PL introductions are more likely.
   Importantly, while some of the earlier empirical generalizations on
   factors conducive to a standard PL entry still hold for a premium PL
   entry, new variables need to be considered as well, while other insights
   need to be updated to better reflect the new reality of
   higher-quality/higher-price premium PL introductions. (C) 2014 New York

AB Many companies have made significant investments in socially responsible
   production practices for their products. Environmentally safe cleaning
   products, fair trade coffee, and sustainable seafood are just a few
   examples. In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis of over 80 published
   and unpublished research papers across a large number of product
   categories to better understand differences in willingness to pay (WTP)
   for socially responsible products. In particular, we are interested in
   whether the beneficiary of the social responsibility program-humans,
   animals, or the environment-affects WTP. We use two dependent variables:
   the percentage premium people are willing to pay and the proportion of
   respondents who are willing to pay a positive premium. We find that the
   mean percentage premium is 16.8 percent and that, on average, 60 percent
   of respondents are willing to pay a positive premium. Importantly,
   across both dependent measures, we find that WTP is greater for products
   where the socially responsible element benefits humans (e.g., labor
   practices) compared to those that benefit the environment. Implications
   for retailers, manufacturers, and future research are discussed. (C)

AB Through an ethnographic study of how consumers perceive and experience
   Louis Vuitton flagship stores, we show that luxury stores are becoming
   hybrid institutions, embodying elements of both art galleries and
   museums, within a context of exclusivity emblematic of luxury. We create
   the term "M(Art)World" to capture the essence of this aesthetically
   oriented strategy. Participants take note of the company's sleekly
   elegant architecture, interior design, and adroit use of lighting that
   are modelled after those of museums housing world-class exhibits. The
   store's merchandize is artisanal, often produced in collaboration with
   artists. Objects for sale are displayed alongside actual art, rendering
   both products equivalent. Employees function as curators, offering
   guidance and knowledge, as well as goods for sale. We analyze how luxury
   consumers experience and evaluate the ways in which luxury stores
   operate as contemporary art institutions, and extrapolate those insights
   into managerial implications for other retail venues. (C) 2014 New York

AB This study examines how different information sources are used by
   consumers prior to their purchase of used durable goods, specifically
   used cars. We examine how online and offline search are related.
   Categories of online sources are dealer websites and resale websites,
   and of offline sources are print media and dealer visits. Prior research
   on new car purchases finds that online sources substitute for
   traditional, offline sources such as dealer visits. We examine whether
   this theory extends to used-car purchases and distinguish between dealer
   websites and resale websites (a distinction relevant to used-goods
   markets) by collecting data from a sample of used-car buyers. Because
   search in different sources can be interrelated, and due to data
   censoring, we build and estimate a simultaneous equations Tobit model.
   In contrast to existing research, we find that online search on dealer
   websites is complementary to and not a substitute for dealer visits.
   This complementary effect highlights the importance of dealers' web
   presence in used markets. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by

AB Obesity is described as the fastest growing public health challenge
   facing developed nations (Prentice, 2006). This research introduces the
   topic of obesity to the retailing literature by examining the interplay
   between obesity in frontline employees and customer evaluations of
   service transactions. Baseline effects are established that show
   customers evaluate employees and firms more negatively if the frontline
   worker is obese compared to average weight. Two follow-up studies
   identify means by which firms may offset the negative obesity effects.
   Specifically, signaling theory is drawn upon in Study 1 to justify the
   introduction of observable quality cues as a means to offset negative
   stereotypes. Results indicate that the presence of unambiguous quality
   cues attenuate unfavorable judgments of the obese employee and the
   affiliated retail store. In Study 2, a countervailing, jovial stereotype
   is primed as a means to offset the more prominent negative ones. Retail
   managers can use this research as a means to understand an important
   caveat to frontline service evaluations and as the basis for managing a
   prominent negative stereotype. (C) 2014 New York University. Published

AB Category captainship is a collaborative channel arrangement wherein a
   retailer cedes control of category management decisions, such as
   developing a marketing strategy to grow the category and assortment
   selection, to one of the category's leading manufacturers. This paper
   studies the consequences of captainship practices on the breadth and
   appeal of a retailer's assortment. We consider a model where multiple
   manufacturers sell a product to consumers through a common retailer. In
   the benchmark, the retailer decides on effort to drive traffic into the
   category and assortment. Under captainship, the retailer delegates both
   of these decisions to a captain in return for target sales. The
   capability of the captain to stimulate demand is unknown to the
   retailer. We find that the breadth and/or appeal of the assortment at
   the retailer can increase or decrease under captainship relative to the
   benchmark. We identify three factors that play a role on the impact of
   captainship on the breadth and appeal of retailer's assortment: (i) the
   retailer's beliefs about the captain's capability, (ii) the captain's
   true capability, and (iii) product set heterogeneity. We find that the
   benefit to the captain sometimes comes at the expense of the non-captain
   manufacturers, but we also identify conditions where captainship can be
   beneficial for not only the retailer and the captain but also the
   non-captain manufacturers. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by

AB Targeting the "right" consumers is a core part of marketing. Whereas
   existing techniques to identify these consumers use demographic or
   psychographic variables or behaviors such as response probabilities, a
   proposed new targeting approach builds on consumers' incremental
   responses to identify them by their willingness-to-pay (WTP) ranges.
   These WTP ranges reveal a consumer as a definite buyer, a definite
   non-buyer, or an indecisive buyer. The proposed theoretical framework
   indicates that indecisive buyers offer the highest incremental responses
   to targeted marketing mix activities and thus should be the most
   preferred targeting group. A sequence of three laboratory experimental
   studies validates the proposed approach for targeted price discounts and
   non-price tactics. In addition, a large-scale field experiment involving
   a consumer engagement campaign that includes observed purchase behavior
   demonstrates the high external validity and applicability of this
   approach. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Existing studies on the role of switching costs (SC) as moderator of the
   relationship between satisfaction and repurchase behavior are
   inconclusive. We attempt to explain these inconclusive findings by
   synthesizing an amplifying and a lock-in effect, and hypothesize a
   nonlinear moderating effect. In Study 1 (a main study and three
   replications), we find strong evidence for an inverted u-shaped
   moderating effect of overall SC. Our results suggest that satisfaction
   is a particularly important predictor of repurchase behavior in
   situations characterized by medium-levels of SC. Based on Prospect
   Theory, Study 2 (a main study and one replication) reveals that this
   inverted u-shaped moderating effect of SC is stronger for positive
   (relational and financial) SC than for negative (procedural) SC. We
   conclude with recommendations for satisfaction management of different
   customer segments, and describe possibilities to influence customer
   switching costs in various industries. (C) 2014 New York University.

AB Many retailers face the questions of whether providing consultation
   services would enhance store performance and, if so, what the retailers
   could do to increase the number of shoppers seeking salesperson
   consultation. Despite its importance, prior research has not answered
   the question of what influences retail shoppers to consult with
   salespeople. We use motivation theory and recent theorizing on
   behavioral decision-making to develop a model of four utilitarian and
   hedonic motivators of shopper consultation with salespeople. This model,
   which includes the relationship between consultation and amount of money
   spent by shoppers, was tested with data from 425 shoppers. Our results
   demonstrate situational and individual influences, both utilitarian
   (i.e., shoppers' purchase uncertainty and efficiency orientation) and
   hedonic (i.e., shoppers' situation-related affect toward salespeople and
   shopping enjoyment), that prompt retail shoppers to consult with
   salespeople. As well, we find that salesperson consultation is
   positively related to the amount of money spent by shoppers and
   completely mediates the spending effects of the four motivators of
   consultation. This research shows that motivation theory is useful for
   better understanding salesperson consultation and can assist retailers
   that compete on service to better implement consultation-oriented
   strategies. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Past research on consumer price knowledge has varied considerably partly
   due to differences in how and when price knowledge is measured. This
   paper applies a multi-point, multi-measure approach to reconcile
   differences in past price knowledge research by examining systematic
   relationships between time of measurement and type of measures applied.
   Examination of consumer price knowledge before, during, and after store
   visit sheds light on what is measured at the individual points in time:
   episodic price knowledge and/or reference prices? With a
   between-subjects design interviewing 1,204 respondents, the authors
   investigate three price knowledge measures (price recall, price
   recognition, and deal spotting) demonstrating that these are
   hierarchically related. Results suggest that reference prices dominate
   before store visit, but also that episodic price knowledge,
   surprisingly, is still accessible at the store exit. These findings
   enable the authors to reconcile diverging results from past research,
   showing how consumer price knowledge evolves and suggesting that the
   vast majority of consumers learn about prices, whether consciously or
   unconsciously, during grocery shopping. Thus, when applying a
   multi-point, multi-measure approach, consumers appear to know more about
   prices than suggested by past research. Determinants of price knowledge
   are also examined and the results indicate that price knowledge builds
   up not only because of active search but also due to accidental exposure
   to prices and with low degrees of conscious processing. Implications for
   managers are discussed. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by

AB Retail firms commonly offer products of different quality levels to
   serve different consumer segments. In doing so, some firms adopt a
   "one-roof policy," selling all of their products in one store, whereas
   others adopt a "two-roof policy" to better segment consumers, selling
   high-quality products in a high-end store and low-quality products in a
   separate, low-end store. Although roof policies are widely practiced and
   an important aspect of retail management, they are overlooked in the
   literature and thus not well understood. In this paper, we look at a
   multi-product retail firm and explore the implications of roof policy
   for its quality signaling strategies. In our model, the firm carries two
   vertically differentiated products to serve two consumer segments. We
   first demonstrate that when product quality is readily observable to
   consumers, a two-roof policy yields a greater profit than a one-roof
   policy if the benefit from segmentation outweighs the cost of an
   additional roof. Then, we assume that a proportion of consumers are
   uninformed about quality a priori. We show that under both policies,
   there exists an equilibrium in which the retailer uses both price and
   in-store services to signal quality. Surprisingly, now there are
   conditions under which a two-roof policy is outperformed by a one-roof
   policy, even if the cost of an additional roof is zero. This result
   sharply contrasts the conventional wisdom that segmentation is optimal
   as long as its associated marketing cost is low, and suggests the
   importance of quality information issues in roof policy decisions. (C)

AB To support managerial practice and help improve analytical models in
   retailing, this article extends the literature on processes in the
   psychological chain of effects from perceived quality to customer
   loyalty by making three original and fundamental contributions. Based on
   multilevel structural equation modeling of consumer data from Bolivia,
   Japan, and the USA, it shows that product beliefs mediate this chain of
   effects and that cross-over effects connect rational and emotional
   processes within this chain. Moreover, it elucidates conditions
   moderating the strength of these emotional and rational processes.
   Breadth of experience positively moderates the mediating role of product
   beliefs. Relative price positively moderates the effect of hedonic
   product beliefs on affective customer satisfaction and negatively
   moderates the effect of utilitarian product beliefs on cognitive
   customer satisfaction. Time since purchase positively moderates the role
   of emotional processes and negatively moderates the role of rational
   processes. The moderating effects of sensory, affective, and
   intellectual brand experience support the predictive validity of the
   research model. Further analyses illuminate how social recognition,
   customer value co-creation through product usage patterns, and
   product-service bundling affect product beliefs, as well as how
   affective and cognitive customer satisfaction influence positive
   word-of-mouth. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The marketing literature provides a solid understanding of auctions
   regarding final sales prices and many aspects of the processes that
   unfold to result in those outcomes. This research complements those
   perspectives by first presenting a new bidder behavior model that shows
   the role of emergent network ties among bidders on the auction outcome.
   Dyadic ties are identified as the bid and counter-bid patterns of
   interactions between bidders that unfold throughout the duration of an
   auction. These structures are modeled using network analyses, which
   enables: (1) a richer understanding of detailed auction processes, both
   within auctions and across auctions of multiple lots, (2) a mapping of
   the processes to the forecast of prices and the trajectory toward final
   sales prices, (3) the clear and early identification of key bidders who
   are influential to the bidding action and who impact final auction sales
   prices, and (4) the results clearly show that the network exchange
   patterns are significant and contribute to an understanding of auction
   processes and outcomes above and beyond simple economic predictors such
   as the number of bids or bidders or the bidders' economic status. We
   conclude by providing some managerial implications for online auction

AB This research investigates the relationship between types of financial
   gifts and evaluations of products' advertisement messages designed at
   different construal levels. Based on the theory of goal-related
   mind-sets, the authors propose that gifted cash recipients are more
   likely to activate the first subgoal of the shopping procedure or script
   (deciding whether to buy something) and thus more likely to construe
   information at abstract, high-levels, whereas gift card recipients are
   more likely to adopt a latter subgoal or decisional stage (deciding
   which to buy, where, when and how to act and so on) and thus more likely
   to construe information at concrete, low-levels. Further, fit (vs.
   non-fit) between the gift recipients' mind-set and the construal level
   at which product information is represented can typically lead to more
   favorable attitudes toward the advocated product, because fit enhances
   engagement that in turn intensifies reactions. Five studies demonstrate
   the proposed fit effect as well as provide support for their theoretical
   explanation. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Prior ingredient branding research has examined the influence of
   "stated" factors such as fit between partner brands on composite product
   (e.g., Tide with Downy fabric softener) attitudes. This research focuses
   on choice of composite products, and addresses three managerially
   relevant questions: Which consumer segments are more likely to adopt the
   composite product? Will the choice of the composite product have
   positive or negative reciprocal effects on partner brands? Will the
   introduction of the composite product benefit the primary or the
   secondary brand more? The authors use a brand choice model to
   investigate the "revealed" choice of complements-based composite
   products. Study results indicate that (i) despite high fit between the
   composite product and the primary brand, consumer segments may have
   different choice likelihoods for these products, whereas prior research
   suggests equal likelihood; (ii) the choice of a composite product may
   not provide a positive reciprocal effect to the secondary brand; and
   (iii) the introduction of a composite product may benefit the primary
   brand more than the secondary brand, whereas prior research suggests a
   symmetrical benefit for the partner brands. Finally, the finding that
   introducing a composite product may not cannibalize the sale of the
   primary brand extends the ingredient branding literature, which has been
   silent on this issue. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by

AB To help consumers deal with increasing amounts of information, many
   online retailers offer simple decision aids, such as the ability to sort
   on a particular attribute or eliminate undesired alternatives. The
   authors propose that consumers use simple decision aids as substitutes
   for cognitive effort, potentially with adverse consequences for decision
   making. An experimental study shows that providing unrestricted sorting
   increases decision quality only when choice conflict is low; beyond a
   certain point, greater use of the decision aid is associated with
   declines in decision quality. A second study shows that that allowing
   consumers to sort alternatives only one time enhances decision quality
   and, when choice conflict is high, reduces decision effort. A third
   study shows that providing elimination as well as sorting tools helps
   mitigate the negative effects of simple decision aids. Although the
   availability of sorting alone hurts decision quality when choice
   conflict is high, decision quality under choice conflict is improved
   when both sorting and elimination tools are provided. Implications for
   retail practice are discussed. (C) 2014 New York University. Published

AB Visual appeal is an important consideration in the design of brand
   packages because attractiveness guides behavior. The visual complexity
   of a context (i.e., the quantity, irregularity, detail, and
   dissimilarity of objects) in which a retailer displays a package may
   impact its attractiveness by influencing attention and processing
   fluency. Employing consumer samples, and stimuli ranging from the
   abstract to the realistic, three studies provide evidence that people
   process a package more fluently, thus increasing its attractiveness,
   when it is presented in a low rather than high complexity context. This
   effect is more pronounced with inherently appealing packages, and with
   people who are more field-dependent or pursuing utilitarian shopping
   goals. Study 1 establishes effects by employing psychometric measures
   and abstract stimuli; study 2 corroborates findings with another product
   category and realistic stimuli; and study 3 complements psychometric
   measures with eye tracking data to demonstrate that visually more
   complex contexts divert viewer attention, hereby lowering processing
   fluency and target attractiveness. The authors discuss the theoretical
   contribution and strategic insights the research provides for retailers,
   brand managers, and designers. (C) 2014 New York University. Published

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that the most recent online reviews may
   have a greater impact than out-dated online reviews on consumers'
   purchase decisions because of their up-to-date nature. However, building
   on the theory of temporal distance and construal fit, this study
   proposes a new perspective, suggesting that the influence of online
   reviews posted at different times is a function of the timeframe for the
   consumers' intended purchase. Four experiments demonstrate that although
   recent online reviews are more influential in shifting consumer
   preferences towards near-future consumption decisions, the relative
   influence of out-dated online reviews in shifting consumer preferences
   increases when consumers are making distant-future consumption
   decisions. This effect occurs because of a construal fit between the
   construal level of the online reviews posted at different times and that
   of the timeframe of consumers' purchase decisions. The recent reviews
   are represented at a relatively lower construal level, with the
   low-level construal matching the timeframe of the near-future
   consumption decision. Out-dated reviews, however, are represented at a
   relatively higher construal level and match the timeframe of the
   distant-future consumption decision. This construal fit, in turn,
   enhances consumer engagement and consequently exerts a greater influence
   on consumer preferences. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of

AB Retailers gather data about customers' online behavior to develop
   personalized service offers. Greater personalization typically increases
   service relevance and customer adoption, but paradoxically, it also may
   increase customers' sense of vulnerability and lower adoption rates. To
   demonstrate this contradiction, an exploratory field study on Facebook
   and secondary data about a personalized advertising campaign indicate
   sharp drops in click-through rates when customers realize their personal
   information has been collected without their consent. To investigate the
   personalization paradox, this study uses three experiments that confirm
   a firm's strategy for collecting information from social media websites
   is a crucial determinant of how customers react to online personalized
   advertising. When firms engage in overt information collection,
   participants exhibit greater click-through intentions in response to
   more personalized advertisements, in contrast with their reactions when
   firms collect information covertly. This effect reflects the feelings of
   vulnerability that consumers experience when firms undertake covert
   information collection strategies. Trust-building marketing strategies
   that transfer trust from another website or signal trust with
   informational cues can offset this negative effect. These studies help
   unravel the personalization paradox by explicating the role of
   information collection and its impact on vulnerability and click-through
   rates. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB A firm's ability to offer better service and to co-create valuable
   customer experiences is critically important to achieving competitive
   advantage. Service-dominant (S-D) logic, along with resource and
   capability perspectives, provides the underlying theoretical reasoning
   for the relevance of such capabilities. However, despite researchers'
   recent contributions to marketing theory, empirical support for S-D
   logic and its implications is very limited at the strategic level. An
   open question, therefore, is what empirically constitutes a value
   co-creation capability, and what is its impact on important performance
   outcomes. Building on the conceptualization of an S-D orientation as a
   portfolio of value co-creation capabilities, this research first
   operationalizes and validates an S-D orientation measure through a
   multi-study approach across different contexts. The authors then apply
   the measurement instrument to an automotive retail setting to
   investigate the outcomes of S-D orientation in terms of both customer-
   and firm-related performance metrics. Results provide the first
   empirical demonstration of the importance of S-D capabilities, and thus

AB In this study, the authors aim to understand whether, to what extent,
   and under what circumstances, organizational responses to customer
   complaints improve customer profitability. To do so, they build upon the
   congruence approach and propose a contingency framework in which the
   effectiveness of three organizational responses to customer complaints
   (timeliness, compensation and communications) in improving customer
   profitability is contingent upon the strength of the relationship and
   the type of failure. The framework is tested empirically in the
   financial services industry applying latent class techniques to
   longitudinal data for a sample of complaining customers. The results
   reveal that: (1) different complaint-handling initiatives affect
   customer profitability differently for each of the four segments of
   complaining customers that are obtained; (2) these heterogeneous
   responses to complaint handling are explained by differences in the
   orientation of the relationship and in the failure context; and (3)
   complaint-handling initiatives are more (less) effective at improving
   customer profitability when the benefits they offer strongly (poorly)
   match the benefits sought by customers in each segment to recover from
   the failure. These results contribute to a better theoretical
   understanding of customers' heterogeneous responses to complaint
   handling and offer managerial recommendations to allocate marketing

AB Retailers often organize at least part of their assortment by displaying
   complementary products from different product categories together (e.g.,
   a pair of pants with a shirt) rather than grouping items by product type
   (e.g., a pair of pants with other pants). However, little is known about
   how retailers should choose between complement-based and
   substitute-based organizations. The present paper shows that consumers'
   preferences for such store organizations are a function of the effort
   and assortment perceptions cued by these organizational formats. Holding
   the underlying assortment constant, complement-based organizations are
   always more effortful than substitute-based organizations. This
   difference in effort can create downward pressure on complement-based
   store choice. Moreover, the effects of organization format on assortment
   perception depend on whether consumers hold a hedonic or utilitarian
   focus. When consumers have a highly hedonic focus, complement-based
   based stores create more positive assortment perceptions than
   substitute-based stores. Such positive assortment perceptions can, in
   turn, raise complement-based store choice. However, as consumers'
   utilitarian focus increases, substitute-based assortments are seen as
   both easier and more attractive, leading to a strong advantage in store
   choice. Our findings provide actionable guidance for retailers
   considering various store organizations and suggest opportunities for
   future research. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB We study retailer bundling in a distribution channel when the
   manufacturer for one bundled product can strategically set the wholesale
   price. We show that the retailer can use a bundling option as a
   strategic leverage to extract concessions from the manufacturer in form
   of a lower wholesale price. This finding contributes a novel rationale
   for retailer bundling to the bundling literature. Whenever the bundling
   option causes this concession-extraction effect, the retailer always
   benefits from the lower wholesale price. The manufacturer, nevertheless,
   does not necessarily suffer because bundling can lead to a higher
   consumer demand. We also show that the manufacturer's marginal
   production cost plays a critical role in driving the retailer's bundling
   decision, concession extraction behavior and consequently the total

   connectivity data from five consumer social networks. The findings
   suggest that the effect of consumer homophily-the similarity of adjacent
   consumers in a social network-on the profit impact of seeding depends on
   the seeding target. Consumer homophily negatively affects the profit
   Impact of seeding early adopters but it exhibits a U-shaped relationship
   with the profit impact of seeding social hubs and random seeding. The
   right side of the U-shaped curve (high homophily) reflects a higher
   profit impact when compared to the left side (low homophily). We
   integrate literature from sociology, social networks, and marketing to
   explain this finding. The results also suggest that seeding social hubs
   generates the greatest NPV (net present value), followed by seeding
   randomly chosen targets, and early adopters, in that order. Finally, we

AB Consumers increasingly rely on Internet price comparison sites (PCS) to
   gain knowledge about the market. The prices generated by a PCS search
   can act as contextual reference prices and influence the attractiveness
   of prices encountered later as consumers shop offline at local stores.
   This paper demonstrates that both PCS retailer ratings and the shape of
   the PCS price distribution influence the impact of PCS search results on
   later price evaluations. A favorable PCS retailer rating increases the
   perceived validity of the price associated with that retailer, enhancing
   the impact of that PCS price on offline price evaluations (Study 1). The
   shape of the PCS price distribution can also influence later price
   evaluations, however this effect depends on the information provided by
   the PCS retailer ratings. When PCS retailer ratings are similar,
   implying similar validity for the associated prices, low PCS prices and
   those appearing more frequently in the PCS price distribution have more
   impact (Studies 2 and 3). When PCS retailer ratings are variable (some
   high and some low), the PCS price distribution effect occurs only when
   the PCS retailer ratings provide congruent information about price
   validity that is, the most frequent price is offered by retailers with
   more favorable ratings. Study 3 shows that price validity inferences do
   mediate this result. Finally, we depart from the offline shopping
   context to show that when consumers choose a retailer directly from the
   PCS search results, the effect of PCS retailer ratings is stronger for
   high-priced retailers and for consumers who rely less on the retailer
   price as a heuristic to infer retailer service level. Based on our
   findings we offer insights for online and offline retailers when
   considering strategic responses, such as price matching guarantees. (C)

   consumer-perceived cultural content embedded in the product and (2) the
   general cultural environment of the foreign market. To test
   cross-culture predictability in international retailing, we develop a
   novel text mining procedure to elicit the specific cultural content of
   the product using consumers' online product reviews. In addition, to
   measure the general cultural environment of the market, we apply
   Hofstede's cultural distance measure. To explain foreign markets'
   acceptance of culturally specific elements, we theorize that the
   relationship between inter-country cultural distance and product sales
   is U shaped because of both cultural discount and cultural premium. In
   our empirical analysis using American movies in international retailing,
   we find that the two specified types of cultural factors determine a
   movie's success, along with the movie's characteristics and the market's
   economic environment. From a managerial perspective, international
   retailers that understand the delicate implications of the
   match/mismatch of their general national culture and the imported
   product's specific cultural content can better predict the international
   success of imported cultural products. (C) 2014 New York University.

AB Consumers in grocery retailing commonly buy bundles of products to
   accommodate current and future consumption. When all products in a
   particular bundle share common attributes (and are selected from the
   same product category), the consumer is said to assemble an assortment.
   This research examines the impact of assortment variety on the
   assortment choice process. In particular, we test the prediction that
   consumers demand less variety for higher quality items. To investigate
   this relationship, we employ a flexible choice model, suitable for the
   analysis of assortment choice. The model, based upon the assumption that
   the utility of purchase of one item in an assortment depends upon the
   set of items already selected, allows for a general utility structure
   across the assortment items. We apply the model to household assortment
   choice histories from the yogurt product category. Substantively, we
   show that yogurt choice is affected by brand quality perceptions
   (quality-tier competition). Moreover, we show that reaction to
   reductions in variety (number of yogurt flavors) is mediated by brand
   quality perceptions. Taken together, these empirical facts paint a
   picture of a consumer who is willing to trade-off variety against
   product quality in assortment choice. (C) 2014 New York University.

AB The world of retailing has changed dramatically in the past decade. The
   advent of the online channel and new additional digital channels such as
   mobile channels and social media have changed retail business models,
   the execution of the retail mix, and shopper behavior. Whereas
   multi-channel was in vogue in the last decade in retailing, we now
   observe a move to so-called omni-channel retailing. Omni-channel
   retailing is taking a broader perspective on channels and how shoppers
   are influenced and move through channels in their search and buying
   process. We discuss this development conceptually and subsequently
   discuss existing research in this multi-channel retailing. We also
   introduce the articles in this special issue on multi-channel retailing
   and position these articles in the new omni-channel movement. We end
   with putting forward a research agenda to further guide future research
   in this area. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A crucial decision firms face today is which channels they should make
   available to customers for transactions. We assess the revenue impact of
   adding bricks-and-mortar stores to a firm's already existing repertoire
   of catalog and Internet channels. We decompose the revenue impact into
   customer acquisition, frequency of orders, returns, and exchanges, and
   size of orders, returns, and exchanges. We use a multivariate baseline
   method to assess the impact of adding the physical store channel on
   these revenue components. As hypothesized, store introduction
   cannibalizes catalog sales and has much less impact on Internet sales.
   Also as hypothesized, returns and exchanges increase. Interestingly,
   transaction sizes of purchases, returns, and exchanges do not change.
   The "availability effect" produces a net increase in purchase frequency
   across channels. This more than compensates for increased returns,
   producing a net increase in revenues of 20% by adding the store channel
   Our findings yield a deeper understanding of the revenue relation
   between channels, and of the dynamic cross-channel effects of marketing
   actions. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Mobile shopping (M-shopping) has become increasingly important in
   marketing and retailing. Using a unique dataset from an Internet-based
   grocery retailer, we evaluate changes in customers' spending behavior
   upon adopting M-shopping, i.e., using smartphones or tablets to compose,
   modify, or place orders online. We find that order rate, i.e., number of
   orders placed per year, increases as customers adopt M-shopping.
   Especially for low-spending customers, both their order rate and order
   size, i.e., the amount of the order in dollars, increase as they become
   accustomed to M-shopping. In addition to the effect on customer's
   spending behavior, we also find that M-shoppers tend to use mobile
   devices to shop for habitual products that they already have a history
   of purchasing. We propose that customers utilize mobile devices because
   the technology provides convenient access, which leads them to
   incorporate M-shopping into their habitual routines. Managerially, we
   recommend that firms should fully leverage their mobile platforms, but
   they should also keep in mind that mobile devices may not be the most
   optimal channel for launching new products or promoting products that
   require more consideration during the buying process. (C) 2015 New York

AB We develop and test hypotheses regarding the role of social contagion in
   customer adoption of new sales channels. We examine two aspects of
   social contagion (local contagion and homophily) and two channels
   (Internet and bricks-and-mortar store). Drawing on diffusion theory, we
   propose a conceptual framework that identifies the factors associated
   with new channel adoption. Using longitudinal data from a major catalog
   company and a discrete-time hazard model, we find that (1) social
   contagion plays a major role in the adoption of new sales channels, (2)
   both local contagion and homophily influence channel adoption, (3)
   longer-tenured customers are less influenced by social contagion, and
   (4) adoption of the Internet channel is more influenced by social
   contagion than adoption of the bricks-and-mortar store. Managerially,
   our results suggest that marketing programs that encourage social
   contagion, for example, word-of-mouth campaigns, be targeted based on
   both physical and socio-economic proximity, and that such campaigns will
   play a bigger role in the adoption of new-to-the-world channels. (C)

AB This research examines the impact of online-offline channel integration
   (OI), defined as integrating access to and knowledge about the offline
   channel into an online channel. Although channel integration has been
   acknowledged as a promising strategy for retailers, its effects on
   customer reactions toward retailers and across different channels remain
   unclear. Drawing on technology adoption research and diffusion theory,
   the authors conceptualize a theoretical model where perceived service
   quality and perceived risk of the Internet store mediate the impact of
   OI while the Internet shopping experience of customers moderates the
   impact of OI. The authors then test for the indirect, conditional
   effects of OI on search intentions, purchase intentions and willingness
   to pay. Importantly, they differentiate between retailer-level and
   channel-level effects, thereby controlling for interdependencies between
   different channels. The results of three studies provide converging
   evidence and show that OI leads to a competitive advantage and channel
   synergies rather than channel cannibalization. These findings have
   direct implications for marketers and retailers interested in
   understanding whether and how integrating different channels affects
   customer outcomes. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB To what extent should multichannel retailers integrate assortments
   across channels? Previous literature controversially discusses the
   question of which integration strategy is most successful but arguments
   are only conceptual, and no empirical assessment exists. This article
   presents a framework that (a) shows how customers' perceived shopping
   benefits of variety, convenience, and reduced risk mediate the impact of
   multichannel assortment integration (full, asymmetrical, no) on
   patronage intentions and (b) differentiates the impact for retailer
   types based on substitutive, complementary, and independent assortment
   relations. Two large-scale experimental studies empirically investigate
   whether a dominant integration strategy exists in the context of full
   and simultaneous information (Study 1) and more uncertain and subsequent
   information accessibility (Study 2). We consistently find that full
   integration dominates no integration across assortment relations, but
   asymmetrical integration the strategy that is most often realized by
   multichannel retailers can have a detrimental impact for substitutive
   relations compared with no integration. Asymmetrical integration can be
   more beneficial than full integration for independent relations, while
   customer outcomes differ less for complementary relations. Researchers
   and managers can use our findings to understand how shopping benefits of
   variety, convenience, and reduced risk explain the different customer
   outcomes of multichannel assortment integration, depending on retailer
   type. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB The increasing product commoditization and price transparency afforded
   by online retail channels have left many brick and mortar stores bearing
   the costs associated with being used as a physical showroom without
   reaping the rewards of the final sale. As customers continue to take
   advantage of retail stores to gather information and turn to competing
   channels for purchasing, the role of the retail salesperson has shifted
   and retailers have been left without a clear understanding of how to
   manage this change in the retailing landscape. In this research, we
   first define "showrooming" - and investigate individual (i.e.,
   salesperson)-level experiential consequences of perceived showrooming.
   We find negative relationships between perceived showrooming and
   salesperson self-efficacy and salesperson performance, which are
   positively moderated by salesperson coping strategies and cross-selling
   strategies. Our findings suggest that the negative effects of
   showrooming can be combated though specific salesperson behaviors and
   strategies. Further, exploratory findings at the store level reaffirm a
   negative relationship between perceived showrooming behaviors and
   performance. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical
   implications of our findings and offer specific managerial actions to
   address showrooming. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier

   online channel and investigates the effects of their online channel
   adoption on purchase volumes across segments. The data cover 12.5 years
   of purchase history and individual transactions at a large multichannel
   French retailer of natural health products. Contrary to conventional
   wisdom, it is not innovators or early adopters, but rather the late
   majority segment that purchases more than the other segments, both
   before and after online adoption. Adoption of the firm's new online
   channel does not influence purchase volumes of heavy shopper segments
   (late majority and innovators), whereas light shopper segments tend to
   increase their purchases after adopting this new channel. (C) 2015 New

AB Marketers face the challenge of resource allocation across a range of
   touchpoints. Hence understanding their relative impact is important, but
   previous research tends to examine brand advertising, retailer
   touchpoints, word-of-mouth, and traditional earned touchpoints
   separately. This article presents an approach to understanding the
   relative impact of multiple touchpoints. It exemplifies this approach
   with six touchpoint types: brand advertising, retailer advertising,
   in-store communications, word-of-mouth, peer observation (seeing other
   customers), and traditional earned media such as editorial. Using the
   real-time experience tracking (RET) method by which respondents report
   on touchpoints by contemporaneous text message, the impact of
   touchpoints on change in brand consideration is studied in four consumer
   categories: electrical goods, technology products, mobile handsets, and
   soft drinks. Both touchpoint frequency and touchpoint positivity, the
   valence of the customer's affective response to the touchpoint, are
   modeled. While relative touchpoint effects vary somewhat by category, a
   pooled model suggests the positivity of in-store communication is in
   general more influential than that of other touchpoints including brand
   advertising. An almost entirely neglected touchpoint, peer observation,
   is consistently significant. Overall, findings evidence the relative
   impact of retailers, social effects and third party endorsement in
   addition to brand advertising. Touchpoint positivity adds explanatory
   power to the prediction of change in consideration as compared with
   touchpoint frequency alone. This suggests the importance of methods that
   track touchpoint perceptual response as well as frequency, to complement
   current analytic approaches such as media mix modeling based on media
   spend or exposure alone. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by

AB Technology is transforming the marketing function in many ways, and this
   transformation is particularly apparent for information goods such as
   movies where digital technologies provide marketers with new
   distribution channels, which in turn create new opportunities for
   cross-channel effects. However, these digital channels also provide
   researchers with new opportunities to measure micro-level customer
   behavior to understand the impact of cross-channel effects in real-world
   settings.
   In this paper, we study cross-channel effects between movies sold in
   digital purchase (commonly known as Electronic Sell Through or EST) and
   digital rental (commonly known as Video-On-Demand or VOD) markets. We do
   this using a unique sales dataset from a major digital movie retailer
   provided by a major movie studio. Our analysis takes advantage of a
   14-week field experiment that allows us to measure the impact of price
   discounts on own- and cross-channel sales. We use this experiment to
   estimate own and cross price elasticities, whether price discounts
   cannibalize future sales, and most importantly whether price discounts
   in one channel affect sales for the same product in a presumably
   competing channel.
   Our analysis indicates that digital movie consumers are highly sensitive
   to price promotions. However, we also find that, contrary to
   expectations, price promotions in a digital sales channel for a movie do
   not seem to cannibalize digital rentals. Indeed, our results suggest
   that, if anything, price promotions for digital movie sales can increase
   digital rentals. We explore a variety of explanations for this
   counterintuitive result, including the possibility that the ease of
   information transmission online through third-party websites, blogs, and
   online discussion areas may create information spillovers such that
   price discounts in one channel may increase product awareness in other
   competing sales channels. From a managerial perspective, our results
   suggest that cross-channel cannibalization can be reduced or even
   reversed in the presence of information spillovers, and that there are
   many new opportunities for marketers to directly measure these
   cross-channel effects using experimental data from online platforms. (C)

AB More and more grocery retailers are becoming multi-channel retailers, as
   they are opening an online alternative next to their traditional offline
   supermarkets. While the number of multi-channel grocery shoppers is also
   expanding at a fast growth rate, there are still large differences in
   online shopping frequency, and as a result, in the levels of experience
   with buying in the online grocery channel. This study wants to (i)
   identify the underlying drivers of online store choice and (ii) explore
   if and how these drivers change when multi-channel shoppers gain online
   grocery shopping experience. We investigate this question with an online
   store choice model using purchase data of an extensive UK household
   panel over a two-year period, covering all multi-channel retailers in
   the grocery market. Our results show that multi-channel shoppers, at the
   start of online grocery shopping, tend to select the online store
   belonging to the same chain as their preferred offline store, especially
   when the online store is strongly integrated with the offline store in
   terms of assortment. When online grocery shopping experience increases,
   multi-channel shoppers' focus shifts from a comparison within a chain
   across channels to a comparison across chains within the online channel,
   resulting in an increasing importance of online assortment
   attractiveness and online loyalty when choosing an online store. (C)

   investigate the process of auction fever in retail auctions and
   demonstrate when and how auction fever affects bidding behavior. In
   contrast to previous studies, we employ physiological measurements as an
   objective and continuous assessment of bidders' arousal in addition to a
   subjective assessment of bidders' emotions through psychometric scales.
   Moreover, we explicitly study the interaction of time pressure and
   social competition on arousal and bids. We find that bidders' arousal is
   increased in high time pressure auctions and that this leads to higher
   bids in ascending auctions but only when bidders compete with human
   opponents. Thus, social competition is the actual driver underlying the
   auction fever phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that the "joy of winning"
   is significantly stronger than the "frustration of losing" in ascending
   auctions. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the
   design of retail auctions. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by

AB With the amount of online advertising on a steady rise, generic ads
   noticeably lose effectiveness. In order to break through the clutter,
   retailers employ a method called retargeting to tailor their
   advertisements to individual consumers based on inferred interests and
   preferences. However, while personalization should generally make ads
   more appealing, the authors use field data to show that the
   effectiveness of retargeting considerably hinges on consumers' trust in
   a respective retailer. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this
   phenomenon, they investigate how trust moderates the impact of ad
   personalization on consumers' internal and external responses in the
   lab. They propose a two-dimensional conceptualization of ad
   personalization: First, a banner's personalization depth defines how
   closely the ad reflects a consumer's interests. Second, its
   personalization breadth determines how completely the banner reflects
   these interests. The lab results show that more trusted retailers can
   increase the perceived usefulness of their ads through a combination of
   high depth and narrow breadth of personalization without eliciting
   increased reactance or privacy concerns. On the other hand, for less
   trusted retailers, banners with higher depth are not perceived more
   useful, but instead trigger increased reactance and privacy concerns,
   regardless of their personalization breadth. These effects directly
   translate into consumers' click-through intentions so that retailers
   should adjust their personalization strategies accordingly in order to
   increase the effectiveness of their online advertising. (C) 2015 New

AB Integrating theory related to psychological distance and elaboration on

   elaboration levels moderate the effect of temporal distance on choice of
   energy efficient products. In three experiments, the authors examine the
   influence of temporal and psychological distance and the moderating
   effect of a consumer's propensity to elaborate on potential outcomes
   (EPO) in retail choice-based situations. Results support these
   predictions with consumers lower in elaboration more likely to choose an
   energy efficient product when perceived distance is proximal versus
   distal, while the distance effect has less of an influence on consumers
   prone to higher elaboration. We test the effect of distance perceptions
   within a retail lab environment, as well as across ad and retail
   contexts. These results will help marketers better understand how to
   promote products in ad versus retail-based contexts and across different

AB Determination of the merchandize assortment is an important decision for
   retailers since the composition and depth of the product mix greatly
   impact both unit sales and costs. This paper considers how Probabilistic
   Selling (PS), an emerging marketing strategy, impacts the type and
   number of products a retailer should carry. We find that adopting PS can
   alter the optimal number of products (i.e., encourage the retailer to
   offer more or fewer products), depending on demand- and supply-side
   factors. Furthermore, introducing probabilistic goods sometimes
   increases the optimal degree of product differentiation and sometimes
   reduces it. Specifically, less differentiated products are warranted if
   there are either few or many consumers with extreme tastes, but more
   differentiation is needed otherwise. Our analysis reveals that PS can
   serve either as a substitute to new product introduction (because it
   enables a retailer to serve a diverse market at a lower cost) or as a
   complement to new product introduction (since, under PS, a new product
   enables a retailer to offer additional probabilistic goods that utilize
   this new product as one of its components). In sum, our results indicate
   that a retailer must adjust its merchandize assortment appropriately in
   order to fully benefit from probabilistic selling. (C) 2015 New York

AB Marketing literature emphasizes the importance of organizational
   identification in the sales force. However, empirical research has so
   far focused on the separate analysis of the consequences of either sales
   managers' or salespersons' organizational identification, largely
   ignoring their interactive effects. This study seeks to address this
   research void by exploring the phenomena of organizational
   identification agreement and organizational identification tension in
   the sales manager salesperson dyad. In contrast to organizational
   identification agreement, organizational identification tension occurs
   in a sales manager salesperson dyad if the sales manager and the
   salesperson differ in the strength of their organizational
   identification. Analysis of a triadic data set using hierarchical linear
   modeling supports the authors' hypotheses that increasing the level of
   organizational identification agreement is beneficial but increasing
   organizational identification tension can have severe negative
   consequences for the satisfaction of a salesperson's customers and the
   salesperson's performance. The study additionally explores how sales
   managers' leadership styles (charismatic vs. transactional), combined
   with the appropriate control system (behavioral vs. outcome control),
   can be effective in avoiding organizational identification tension. (C)

AB Online user reviews constitute a new element of the marketing
   communication mix that can significantly affect product sales. A general
   consensus holds that positive user reviews valence benefits product
   sales, yet the effect of variance is less intuitive and current findings
   are mixed. We propose that user reviews variance actually constitutes a
   double-edged sword that can either hurt or help product sales, depending
   on the variance of critic reviews and other quality signals. Three
   complementary studies in multiple industries (movies, digital cameras,
   and books) with multiple methods (secondary data analysis and behavioral
   experiment) reveal three key insights in this setting. First, after
   recognizing a high variance in user reviews, many potential buyers may
   simply exclude the focal product from their consideration sets for fear
   that it does not match their needs and preferences, which is termed the
   customer breadth effect. Second, high user reviews variance, in
   combination with high critic reviews variance, can elicit a sense of
   uniqueness and thus enhance purchase intentions of some consumers, which
   is termed the customer depth effect. Third, quality signals (e.g.,
   product cost and product extension) can strengthen the positive customer
   depth effect. The overall effects of user reviews variance, therefore,
   can be negative, insignificant, or even positive. These findings have
   important theoretical and managerial implications. (C) 2015 New York

   The results of a series of studies show that decision frames influence

AB Retailers recently became required to provide specific country-of-origin
   information for muscle cuts of beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and goat.
   Drawing from the consumer inference and activation theory literatures,
   hypotheses are offered regarding how consumers use country-of-origin
   labeling (COOL) to draw inferences related to specific product
   attributes and how these inferences, in turn, lead to differences in
   mediation effects for purchase intentions. Results from a pilot study
   and two experiments reveal that consumers are more likely to purchase
   meat when it is identified as a U.S. product. Furthermore, the relative
   strength of the mediating effects of perceived food safety, taste, and
   freshness differs as expected. The authors show how the direct and
   indirect effects of the country-of-origin disclosure are attenuated by
   the presentation of objective information about the meat processing
   systems of competing countries. Given the recently mandated COOL
   disclosures, results have important implications for food retailers,

AB Marketing channels are among the most important elements of any value
   chain. This is because the bulk of a nation's manufacturing output flows
   through them. The intermediaries (e.g., distributors, wholesalers,
   retailers) constituting marketing channels perform specific distribution
   functions, such as transportation, storage, sales, financing, and
   relationship building, better than most manufacturers. Over his
   distinguished career, Louis P. Bucklin investigated many questions about
   the structuring and functioning of marketing channels using conceptual,
   empirical, and microeconomics model-based methodologies. Today, the
   academic marketing literature contains hundreds of articles that have
   employed these three broad classes of methodologies to investigate
   issues of channel intermediaries' interorganizational relationships, for
   example, power-dependence, relational outcomes, conflict and
   negotiations, and manufacturing firms' channel strategy, for example,
   channel structure, selection, coordination and control. So far, however,
   there has been no review of how the three different methodologies have
   contributed to advancing knowledge across this set of channels research
   domains. This paper is the first that aims to (1) chart how channels
   research employing each of the three classes of methodologies
   conceptual, empirical, microeconomics model-based has evolved over seven
   decades along with current trends; (2) review the contributions and
   shortcomings of research to date using these methodologies; and (3)
   suggest future research opportunities using these methodologies,
   separately or in an integrated fashion. (C) 2015 New York University.

AB Despite the rise of emerging markets as lucrative destinations for
   business expansion, marketing literature in this area is largely
   anecdotal and conceptual. Further, owing to the largely unorganized
   retail structure in emerging markets, managers tend to make sub-optimal
   marketing-mix decisions by taking an aggregate view of their
   distribution network. In this study, we develop an econometric model to
   help firms develop a multichannel distribution strategy in emerging
   markets while accounting for (a) own-marketing mix, (b) competitive
   actions, (c) brand-level heterogeneity, and (d) dependencies that may
   arise between product offerings. The proposed model is tested on
   longitudinal data from a large Indian CPG manufacturer. The results
   indicate that firms must consider store format-specific distribution
   elasticities (as opposed to aggregate effects), especially in an
   emerging market, where the role of distribution is critical in brand
   success. Further, depending on the offering, price (own- and cross-) and
   advertising elasticities could vary even though the brand is essentially
   the same. Also, we find that there are significant dependencies between
   product forms that need to be considered when designing the marketing
   mix. Finally, we provide re-allocation recommendations to help managers
   choose the level of store format distribution in order to maximize
   profits. The proposed distribution re-allocation strategy resulted in an
   average of 7.7% increase in profits across three product forms for the
   focal firm. Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of New York University.

   strategic discovery of the anchoring of SCM thought in marketing. A
   prominent feature of this paper is a set of takeaways, delineated from
   the cross-section of SCM literature bases (marketing channels,
   logistics, purchasing, and operations management) that will facilitate
   the development of the topic of SCM in marketing. These takeaways serve
   as agenda setters for future research and potential applications of SCM
   in marketing. Overall, we contribute to the marketing and SCM
   literatures by (1) reviewing the breadth of the most impactful

AB Over the past fifty years, the scope of research on international
   marketing channels has significantly evolved. From an early focus on
   factors influencing the expansion of marketing channels internationally,
   the literature now investigates a myriad of topics related to the
   challenges of selecting channel structures and managing channel
   relationships. This article investigates the evolution of international
   marketing channels research by reviewing 353 international
   channels-related articles published from 1965 to 2014 under a
   periodization approach. The assessment of the state and evolution of the
   literature is used as a foundation for the identification of emerging
   themes that will move the field of international marketing channels
   forward. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB A unique characteristic of emerging economies is the wide variety of
   dominant channel formats. We evaluate the influence of a brand's
   marketing mix on channel partners and consumer sales in both full and
   self-service channels in one emerging economy (Brazil). We use monthly
   stock-keeping-unit (SKU) level sales, and marketing mix data from the
   beverage category in southeastern Brazil spanning more than four years.
   In this study, we specify a panel vector autoregression framework with
   error decomposition to account for endogeneity between sales and
   marketing mix, cross-sectional heterogeneity among SKUs, seasonality,
   and the different aggregation of marketing mix elements across the
   channels. The results show that structural differences in these channels
   cause differences in the responses to some of the manufacturers'
   marketing mix elements. Package size variety, price and merchandising
   have a greater long-term effect on sales in self-service than in
   full-service channels. Brands' channel relationship programs support
   price increases in self-service channels without a corresponding
   decrease in sales. Distribution gains are important in both channels. In
   the full-service channel, package size variety has the highest long-term
   effect among all of the modeled marketing mix elements. Our study
   highlights that marketing mix strategies popular in the self-service
   dominant channels of the developed economies are not as effective in the
   full-service formats that remain important in emerging economies. (C)

AB Many suppliers invest heavily in channel partner programs that
   incentivize selling and learning. The authors conduct a multi-wave field
   study to investigate the roles of indebtedness and gratitude in
   transforming these investments into returns. The results show that
   indebtedness has negative effects on commitment to the supplier, as well
   as the reseller's sales effort. Gratitude however attenuates the effects
   of indebtedness on sales effort and commitment, and thus offers a buffer
   against indebtedness' negative effects. Indebtedness and gratitude thus
   play key roles in channel partner programs. In addition, the results
   highlight the importance of perceived motives as they differentially
   predict these two states. Benevolent motives are found to increase
   gratitude, though ulterior motives do not detract from it. Ulterior
   motives do however increase indebtedness. Finally, the results also
   reveal how entitlement negatively impacts channel partner programs. It
   decreases the positive effect of perceived program 'value on partner
   gratitude while increasing the effect of ulterior motives on
   indebtedness. This study thus assesses the simultaneous yet contrasting
   role of gratitude and indebtedness, as well as the complexity associated
   with realizing the full benefits of channel partner programs. The
   findings have implications for suppliers, marketers, and further
   research. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB The dominance of the interne as a shopping and distribution channel also
   necessitates an understanding of e-service quality. Using
   means-ends-chain theory, we develop a conceptual framework to understand
   the different models and the associated multiple measures that have been
   developed to examine this construct. We test the measures empirically
   using meta-analytic techniques. We also summarize the impact of
   e-service quality on key outcomes customer satisfaction, repurchase
   intentions, and word-of-mouth, as well as the moderating impact of three
   contextual factors: country culture, regulatory environment, and
   industry context. Results indicate that e-service quality has four
   underlying dimensions (website design, fulfilment, customer service, and
   security/privacy) though their relevance for overall e-service quality
   is moderated by country-specific (uncertainty avoidance, masculinity,
   power distance, individualism), regulatory environment-specific
   (financial secrecy, rule of law), and industry-specific (services/goods,
   retailing/banking) factors as well as research-design factors. (C) 2015

AB This research examines the impact of in-store digital displays on retail
   sales across four different store formats. The results of three field
   experiments show that sales in hypermarkets are enhanced when digital
   displays are on. However, in supercenters and supermarkets, having the
   digital displays on has a minimal effect on sales, and in smaller stores
   (e.g., convenience stores), the digital displays have a negative impact
   on sales. A follow-up study confirms that the lift in sales in larger
   stores when the digital displays are on continues five months after
   their initial installation, though the lift does diminish somewhat.
   Furthermore, for the digital display to result in a sales lift, the
   message content must promote the price. (c) 2015 New York University.

AB Alliteration is the repetition of initial word sounds across two or more
   proximal words. Alliterative pricing presentations consisting of words
   (brand or product names) and numbers (price and quantity information)
   can influence evaluations, choice, and purchase behavior. We provide
   evidence that alliterative pricing promotions can positively influence
   deal evaluations and product choice; for example, "Two T-shirts $21"
   elicits more positive evaluations from consumers than does "Two T-shirts
   $19," even though the latter pricing presentation is objectively better.
   We suggest phonological (word sound) overlap present in alliteration
   facilitates message processing, which in turn results in more positive
   judgments and deal evaluations and influences choice. Our findings build
   theory while presenting clear managerial implications for marketing
   communications and pricing decisions. (c) 2015 New York University.

AB Prior research on product out-of-stock (OOS) has mainly focused on the
   consequences of OOS due to consumers not being able to select their
   target options. The present research explores how OOS noticed by
   consumers without a specific target option in mind affects their
   preference among the in-stock options. We find that consumers can draw
   social inferences from OOS about the desirability of product features.
   Consequently, in-stock options that share feature with the OOS option
   enjoys choice advantage. We show that this effect occurs only when the
   OOS condition is caused by consumer demand (as opposed to by logistical
   causes), and only for consumers who are not product category experts.
   Further, consumers' belief on others' expertise and shopping goal
   determines which specific feature they will identify as the key feature
   that drives the OOS. These findings provide a more complete picture for
   how consumers respond to OOS. They also offer insights into making more
   accurate demand estimation and suggest a potential new tool for in-store
   marketing. (c) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Planning marketing mix strategies requires retailers to understand
   within- as well as cross-category demand effects. Most retailers carry
   products in a large variety of categories, leading to a high number of
   such demand effects to be estimated. At the same time, we do not expect
   cross-category effects between all categories. This paper outlines a
   methodology to estimate a parsimonious product category network without
   prior constraints on its structure. To do so, sparse estimation of the
   Vector AutoRegressive Market Response Model is presented. We find that
   cross-category effects go beyond substitutes and complements, and that
   categories have asymmetric roles in the product category network.
   Destination categories are most influential for other product
   categories, while convenience and occasional categories are most
   responsive. Routine categories are moderately influential and moderately

AB Discount negotiations are prevalent in retailing and serve as key
   instruments for adjusting retail prices to the individual customer.
   Accurate perception of the importance the customer attaches to price,
   which the authors label as customer price importance (CPI) sensing,
   should be critical to retail salespeople's negotiation performance.
   However, prior research has neither conceptually nor empirically
   investigated the role of CPI sensing in customer salesperson
   interactions. Addressing this research void, this study analyzes both
   antecedents and consequences of salespeople's accurate CPI sensing in
   discount negotiations with customers. The authors use a four-sources
   multilevel data set from the B2C automobile retailing context that
   comprises data on 537 salesperson customer interactions. Results provide
   evidence that through accurate CPI sensing, salespeople are able to
   substantially reduce the discounts they grant to customers (on average
   by $616 per transaction). Moreover, with respect to CPI sensing
   accuracy, results show that retail salespeople misperceive CPI owing to
   reliance on heuristic customer cues. (c) 2015 New York University.

AB Music congruity effects on consumer behavior are conceptualized in terms
   of cognitive priming of semantic networks in memory, and operationalized
   as congruent with a product's country of origin (Experiment 1), or
   congruent with the utilitarian (Experiment 2) or social identity
   (Experiments 2 and 3) connotations of a product. Hearing a specific
   genre of music (e.g., classical) activates related concepts in memory
   (e.g., expensive, sophisticated, formal, educated), which influences the
   memory for, perception of, and choice of products. Consistent with this
   account of music congruity effects, three laboratory experiments show
   that playing music of a specific genre during initial product exposure
   improved subsequent recall of conceptually related (i.e., congruent)
   products compared to unrelated products (Experiment 1), affected product
   choice in favor of congruent products (Experiment 1), and affected how

AB We study price guarantees in consumer online auctions. A price-matching
   guarantee (PMG) is a promise to match a competitor's lower price. A
   price-beating guarantee (PBG) is a promise to beat that price. This
   study presents a large-scale controlled field experiment involving 240
   pairs of simultaneous auctions to examine the impact of PMGs and PBGs on
   consumer consideration of alternate auctions, auction choice, and final
   auction price. We find that on average, selling prices are 5.6% higher
   with a PMG and 14.5% higher with a PBG than comparable auctions without
   a price guarantee. Results from our two-stage dynamic model show a
   positive influence of PBGs on search, that is, consideration of
   alternate auctions, but a negative influence of PMG, in particular, for
   frequently purchased goods and higher value products. Further analysis
   suggests that the positive (negative) influence of PMG (PBG) on search
   is stronger for higher value products, whereas the impact of
   consideration of alternate auctions on choice is negatively influenced
   by price differences and the number of bidders. (c) 2015 New York

AB That displaying unit prices leads consumers to choose lower unit priced
   product options is well established. However, whether this effect occurs
   persistently across purchase conditions is unclear, and if so, why? This
   paper proposes that the presence of unit prices increases the salience
   of price in decision making, making consumers more price-sensitive,
   which in turn activates a greater motivation to select cheaper products.
   Findings from three experiments show that this motivational effect
   persists even when unit prices offer little cognitive benefit, such as
   when product options have identical sizes. Results also show that the
   motivational effect of unit pricing operates independently of the
   cognitive effect, and that an individual's price consciousness moderates
   the motivational effect. The paper demonstrates that unit pricing
   increases consumer price sensitivity in the context of price discounts,
   extending the generalizability of the unit pricing effect. (c) 2015 New

AB While consumer screening of nutritional information as well as general
   health concerns have been on the rise, whether such concerns are
   reflected in purchasing behavior is not quite as certain. We postulate
   this disconnect between health concerns (more specifically concerns with
   fat, salt and sugar elements) and consumption behavior to stem from
   balancing behaviors exhibited by consumers. We address this issue
   through three core questions: (1) Are there certain segments of
   consumers who, given a focal health element, balance their purchases
   between healthy and regular versions of products across categories? (2)
   Is this balancing behavior consistent across different elements of
   health concern? And, (3) is a consumer's stated health orientation
   consistent with actual purchase behavior? We estimate a multi-category
   product choice model nested within an augmented latent class structure
   using scanner panel data and supplemented with survey based constructs
   obtained from the same consumers. We find evidence of significant
   balancing behavior across segments and also across different health
   elements. We show that our findings have significant implications for

AB Retailers can choose from a plethora of online marketing channels to
   reach consumers on the Internet, and potential customers often use a
   vast range of channels during their customer journey. However,
   increasing complexity and sparse data continue to challenge retailers.
   This study proposes a taxonomy-based approach to help retailers better
   understand how channel usage along the customer journey facilitates
   inferences about the underlying purchase decision processes. A test of
   this approach with a large, clickstream data set uses a proportional
   hazard model with time varying covariates. Classifying online marketing
   channels along the dimensions of contact origin and brand usage uncovers
   several meaningful interaction effects between contacts across channel
   types. The proposed taxonomy also significantly improves model fit and
   outperforms alternative specifications. The results thus can help
   retailers gain a better understanding of customers' decision-making
   progress in online, multichannel environments and optimize their channel
   structures. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Retailers are increasingly offering hybrid bundles products that combine
   both good(s) and service(s). Some hybrid bundles, such as Lowe's
   flooring that combines flooring material (good) and flooring
   installation (service) are sold in traditional stores, while others,
   such as Best Buy's bundle that includes a computer (good) and tech
   support (service) are also offered online. The pricing strategy of a
   hybrid bundle is critical to its success. While pricing strategies for a
   goods bundle have been well-studied, those for a services bundle have
   been underexplored. Hybrid bundles, which fundamentally differ from
   bundles of goods or bundles of services, primarily with regard to
   quality variability and scalability, have received even less attention.
   Drawing from the pricing and bundling literatures for both goods and
   services, we develop an analytic model of optimal pricing for hybrid
   bundles by a monopolist retailer. We derive and illustrate many useful
   propositions, several of which are counter-intuitive. Our results show
   that an increase in quality variability of the service is associated
   with a higher optimal hybrid bundle price and a lower optimal price of
   the good, but a lower overall bundle profit. Our findings also reveal
   that the optimal price of the service (good) in a hybrid bundle is
   higher (lower) when the good has diminishing unit cost and the service
   has constant unit cost (i.e., the good is more scalable than the
   service). Our results also show that higher unit costs incurred to
   achieve lower service quality variability can result in higher (lower)
   profits when the cost increase is low (high). We discuss important
   implications of these insights for researchers and practitioners. (C)

AB Proprietary retailer-sponsored web panels are growing in popularity. We
   examine specific ways in which retailers may benefit from the creation
   of web panels and participation of customers in them. A quasi-experiment
   conducted in the field with a large online retailer using eighteen
   months of data and a difference-in-differences estimation approach
   reveals significant economic benefits to the retailer from web panels
   beyond generation of useful customer information. Web panel
   participation increased number of purchases by panel customers by 17
   percent, cross-buying by 14 percent, and customer profitability by 36
   percent. Contrary to conventional wisdom advocating moratoriums for
   respondents, we find that for web panelists answering each survey (up to
   a maximum of 27 in nine months) led to incremental positive effects with
   no evidence of tapering or reversal. Our results extend prior research
   and managerial implications regarding the question behavior effect by
   showing that proprietary web panels yield a substantial positive
   economic impact for retailers. (C) 2015 New York University. Published

AB Mass customization systems provide consumers with the opportunity to
   create unique self-designed products. To retailers and manufacturers,
   the segment of customers configuring unique products is of considerable
   interest given their potential impact on product diffusion and profits.
   Yet field evidence suggests that only a minority of consumers use the
   full potential of such systems by configuring products with unique
   options (e.g., a volcano red car instead of a white one). The present
   research shows that the uniqueness of mass-customized products depends
   on consumer narcissism. Specifically, we demonstrate that (a) consumers
   higher in trait narcissism configure more unique products (while
   controlling for self-esteem and need for uniqueness) and (b) state
   narcissism can be primed via marketing communications to influence
   product uniqueness. Our findings suggest that firms should consider
   customers' innate narcissistic tendencies, as well as the ability to
   influence their current states of mind, to exploit the largely untapped
   individualization potential of mass customization systems. (C) 2015 The

   concern about social and environmental issues) influence evaluations of
   retailers' private label brands (PLBs). Two experiments show that
   ethical attributes enhance PLB evaluations in the presence of extrinsic

   extrinsic cues signaling low quality (i.e., low price), PLBs do not
   benefit from offering an ethical attribute. This effect is mediated by
   consumers' product quality perceptions. A third experiment replicates
   the positive effect of ethical attribute presence on PLB evaluations in
   the context of high retailer reputation, and shows a moderating effect
   of consumers' resource synergy beliefs. These findings suggest that PLBs

AB In this paper, the authors investigate whether a Wal-Mart supercenter
   entry engenders differential effects on competitive draws across
   different product categories and across distinct groups of brands within
   a product category sold at incumbent supermarkets, and if so, how. They
   use data from a natural field experiment created by openings of Wal-Mart
   supercenters near six stores of a major US supermarket chain. Using two
   different analyses a before-and-after-with-control-group analysis of
   weekly sales, and an individual household level analysis of change in
   weekly spending they find that Wal-Mart entry does produce differential
   effects across categories and brand groups. Mid-tier national brands are
   more vulnerable to Wal-Mart entry than brands on the boundary of the
   price-quality continuum, such as premium and economy national brands.
   Food categories are more vulnerable to Wal-Mart entry, whereas promotion
   intensive categories and categories with low brand concentration are
   less vulnerable. Their findings suggest the potential for specific
   category and brand assortment differentiation strategies that can help
   conventional supermarkets to better compete with Wal-Mart. (C) 2015 New

AB While most retail stores offer return policies, some offer more lenient

   policies are more likely to lead to purchases than to encourage returns.
   Examining prior research we find that return policy leniency has been
   characterized in terms of five different dimensions: time, money,
   effort, scope, and exchange. We conduct a meta-analysis of 21 papers
   examining the effect of leniency on purchase and return decisions, and
   demonstrate that overall, leniency increases purchase more than return.
   Further, we show the return policy factors that influence purchase
   (money and effort leniency increase purchase) are different from the
   return policy factors that influence returns (scope leniency increases
   returns while time and exchange leniency reduces returns). (C) 2015 New

TI Which Categories and Brands to Promote with Targeted Coupons to Reward

AB This study explores the role of category and brand characteristics in
   the effectiveness of two types of targeted coupons aimed at achieving a
   retailer's specific goals. In one case, the retailer issues the coupon
   to reward customers offering discounts in brands they already buy. In
   the other case, the retailer seeks to develop customers by issuing
   coupons in categories where they do not buy branded alternatives at the
   retail chain.
   A multi-brand and multi-category quasi-experiment consisting of 893
   targeted checkout coupons of consumer packaged goods (CPG) issued at a
   supermarket chain reveals that (1) the brands and categories with higher
   redemption rates vary depending on the retailer goal and (2) for reward
   coupons extended to current brand buyers, some of the brand and category
   characteristics driving higher redemption rates are not the same as
   those driving incremental sales. To explain these results, we propose
   that customers evaluate costs and benefits when redeeming a brand's
   coupon in a different way depending on whether they are current buyers
   of the brand. Additionally, we identify that some brands with higher
   redemption rates are not necessarily the same ones that lead to purchase
   acceleration and therefore drive incremental sales.
   These analyses are of significant managerial relevance because they
   enable us to map the categories and brands that a retailer should
   promote depending on whether the objective is to increase customer
   loyalty rewarding clients for buying brands that they are already
   purchasing or entice them to buy in categories that they are not yet
   purchasing at the store. (C) 2015 New York University. Published by

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that for price promotions offering product
   upgrades, the best promotional price to maximize promotion effectiveness
   is to offer product upgrades for free (e.g., buy an 8 '' birthday cake,
   upgrade to 10 '' for free). This research examines a counterintuitive
   pricing scheme coined "token promotional pricing (TPP)", showing that a
   price promotion can be more effective and can generate greater sales
   when the upgrade is offered at a small, token price (e.g., upgrade the
   cake for 10) rather than free. Results from Studies 1 and 2 attest to
   the robustness of the TPP effect involving hypothetical and real product
   purchase, and help rule out several alternative explanations of the TPP
   effect. Consumers' more positive reaction to a token-priced than a free
   upgrade is hypothesized to be a contrasting effect from consumers'
   comparing the upgrade's regular retail price against a disproportionally
   small (but non-zero) promotional price. Accordingly, asking consumers to
   articulate deal savings prior to evaluating the deal, which disinhibits
   relative thinking and encourages consideration of absolute values,
   renders a token-priced upgrade no more attractive than a comparable,
   free upgrade (Study 3). The article concludes by discussing research
   implications and limitations, and offers suggestions for followup study.

AB Measuring the effects of advertising on consumers' purchase decisions is
   an important yet difficult task in retailing because the effect can
   depend on both current and past advertising efforts and on the
   co-occurrence of other marketing instruments. Consumers may have
   different evaluations and preferences for advertising that can determine
   its effectiveness, and these can change over time based on factors such
   as recall of and attitude toward advertisements. The proposed
   econometric framework examines the purchase decisions of potentially
   heterogeneous consumers by means of the widely used random coefficient
   logit model for aggregate sales and information about perceptions of
   advertising at the consumer level, that is, tracking data. These
   tracking data assess individual responses to two consumer metrics that
   are to consumers' (I) recent experience with the consumption of the
   brand and (II) recall and appreciation of advertisements. The empirical
   application indicates that both consumer metrics and heterogeneity can
   be important for retailing researchers and managers by revealing the
   effects of advertising and determining the influence of other marketing
   instruments, such as price. (C) 2016 New York University. Published by

AB While many studies examined the effects of online customer reviews
   (OCRs) on product sales, a clear understanding of the effects of OCRs on
   product returns is lacking. This study examines the impact of OCRs
   characteristics (valence, volume, and variance) on return decisions with
   a rich multi-year dataset from a major online retailer covering the
   electronics and furniture category. The main finding is that overly
   positive review valence (i.e., higher than the long-term product
   average), induces more purchases, but also more returns. An explanation
   for these findings is that OCRs help to form product expectations at the
   moment of purchase. Therefore, the purchase probability increases but
   the high expectations due to overly positive reviews may not be met,
   which results in negative expectation disconfirmation and consequently
   increases return probability as well. The effect of review valence on
   returns is stronger for novice buyers and for cheaper products. We
   further find that review volume and variance mainly affect purchase
   decisions, and have little to no effect on product returns. This study
   thus demonstrates that products returns should be considered when
   examining OCR effects, especially because overly positive reviews may
   hinder a retailer's financial performance, due to large reverse
   logistics costs associated with product returns. (C) 2016 New York

AB Using sales data from 30,008 books from Amazon.de, this article studies
   the effects of four distinct online communication practices that
   e-tailers increasingly use: presenting product networks (recommender
   systems), social features (electronic word of mouth and various types of
   user-generated content), free trials, and vivid content. These practices
   vary greatly in their effectiveness in influencing consumers' purchase
   decisions. The author also provides insights into the sales frequencies
   of popular versus niche products, in response to the selective use of
   these communication practices. Long-tail theory argues that consumers
   are particularly attracted to buying niche products, because these
   products match their personal preferences better than mainstream
   products do. In contrast, superstar theory predicts increased sales
   frequencies for popular goods. However, the results from this large
   sample reveal that both popular and niche products gain sales. The
   findings specify how different communication practices relatively and

   notable implications for managers' selective uses of these tools. (C)

AB Most multichannel retailers offer larger assortment in their online
   channel than in the offline channels. Conventional belief holds that
   larger assortment leads to more sales. However, offering more products
   could also cannibalize the sales of the retailer's main product
   offerings, hence reducing efficiency in assortment management and
   increasing cost. Recent behavioral research suggests that excessive
   assortment can lead to customer cognitive overload and deter them from
   purchasing. In this paper, we investigate the effect of large online
   assortment on customer spending. We empirically estimate the effect of
   large online assortment by exploiting the natural experiment of channel
   migration, which allows us to compare the spending of customers who
   migrated to the retailer's online channel with that of a holdout group
   of pure catalog shoppers. We find that online customers outspend those
   catalog shoppers by 10.7 percent on the retailer's mainline products. We
   provide evidence that the increased spending by online customers is due
   to lower product search cost in the online channel. Lastly, our research
   suggests that the online sales of low-volume niche products can be an
   important source of revenue for the retailer. (C) 2016 New York

AB A switch from single-to multichannel grocery shopping can affect
   consumers' purchase allocations. This study investigates whether and to
   what extent a consumer's decision to start buying groceries online at a
   particular chain can lead to expansion of the share in grocery spending
   allocated to that chain. To obtain a better insight into the underlying
   mechanisms and to provide more accurate and refined managerial
   guidelines, we further investigate the moderating effects of a
   comprehensive set of factors that may stimulate or withhold these
   expansion effects. To analyze these effects, we use a large and
   representative U.K. household panel data set, composed of multichannel
   grocery shoppers and a matched group of single-channel shoppers, for a
   2.5-year period across all multichannel grocery chains. The empirical
   analysis confirms that multichannel grocery shoppers expand the share of
   wallet allocated to the online-visited chain, and that the extent of
   this expansion depends on chain as well as consumer characteristics.
   Expansion effects appear to be more profound for chains that adopt an
   integrated multichannel strategy for product prices and category
   assortments. In addition, customers who face more stringent time
   constraints, live farther away from the chain's offline store, and/or
   purchase fewer competitive private-label or hard discounter products,
   are more likely to increase their share of grocery spending at the
   online-visited chain. (C) 2016 New York University. Published by

AB Traditional grocery retailers often use price-based strategies to defend
   against hard-discounters (HDs). One increasingly popular approach is the
   introduction of an economy private label (EPL), which provides similar
   or even larger price advantages over national brands than HD products.
   However, the jury is still out on whether these EPLs actually shield
   traditional supermarkets against the HD threat. To shed light on this
   issue, we estimate an individual-level spending model across 148 product
   categories, in which we assess the retailer's losses to HDs and his
   gains from introducing an EPL. Our results show that while EPL
   introductions increase category sales among the traditional chain's
   loyal customers, they alienate its other shoppers. On average, and in
   the absence of HD competitors, EPLs can enhance sales provided they are
   introduced in the right (infrequently purchased and less-differentiated)
   categories and rolled-out sufficiently broadly. However, EPLs are not a
   good defense tool against the (equally cheap but often higher-quality)
   HDs; their impact becoming (more) negative following HD entry. The
   authors discuss implications for retailers in managing their EPL line.

   examines the cross-channel effects of price promotions on category

   (during the promotion period) and cross-period effects (after the

   effects on category purchases in the other channel during the promotion

   effectiveness in the other channel, and (4) cross-channel effects are
   more negative for more loyal customers of the chain. (C) 2016 New York

AB A gray market is an unauthorized distribution channel of genuine branded
   products. Worldwide gray markets compete with authorized distribution
   channels of branded products and pose significant challenges to brand
   owners on the management of global supply chains. Therefore, it is
   important for brand owners to understand sellers' and buyers' behavior
   in gray markets in order to better address this threat. In recent years,
   online gray markets, a rapidly growing form of gray marketing, have seen
   significant growth and provide us an unprecedented opportunity to
   empirically investigate this phenomenon. In this study, we tracked the
   number of online gray market sellers and transactions on the largest
   Internet retail website in China for a 34-week period. We focus on two
   channel control strategies that brand owners can proactively adopt to
   manage online gray market incidents: controlling product availability
   and pricing. The results show that less expensive styles are offered by
   a larger number of gray market sellers and have more transactions. While
   product availability is positively associated with the number of online
   gray market sellers, its impact on online gray market transaction
   quantities is insignificant. This study provides important implications
   on managing global supply chains that are relevant for researchers and
   practitioners alike. (C) 2016 New York University. Published by Elsevier

   statistical, behavioral, and economic theories, which integrates three
   decisions consumers must make in this context: which product-attribute
   to inspect next, when to stop processing, and which, if any, product to
   purchase. Several theoretical options are considered on how to model
   product attribute selection and how to treat uninspected attributes. The
   modeling options are empirically tested employing datasets collected at
   a popular e-tailer's website, while customers were making product
   evaluation and purchase decisions. Subsequent to identifying the best

AB In the online retailing context, we explore the impact of the
   consumption target on the relative effectiveness of scarcity versus
   popularity cues. Purchasing for oneself often triggers a need for
   uniqueness while purchasing for someone else is more uncertain and
   risky. We propose that the consumption target moderates the relative
   effectiveness of scarcity versus popularity cues in marketing
   promotions. Specifically, we predict that when purchasing for oneself,
   scarcity cues outperform popularity cues in eliciting purchase
   intentions, whereas when purchasing for someone else, popularity cues
   are more effective. In addition, we propose the serial mediation effect
   of perceived product uniqueness--> perceived product value to explain
   the "scarcity for me" effect and the serial mediation effect of
   perceived consumption risk -> perceived product value to explain the
   "popularity for others" effect. Further, we propose self-other overlap
   as a moderator of the "popularity for others" effect. Last but not
   least, we examine price level as a moderating factor of the proposed
   theory. Evidence from Google Trends analysis and four experimental
   studies across a variety of scenarios confirm the theorization. Based on
   our findings, we discuss theoretical contributions and managerial
   implications and suggest directions for future research. (C) 2016 New

AB Using survey data from 358 online customers, the study finds that the
   e-service quality construct conforms to the structure of a third-order
   factor model that links online service quality perceptions to distinct
   and actionable dimensions, including (1) website design, (2)
   fulfillment, (3) customer service, and (4) security/privacy. Each
   dimension is found to consist of several attributes that define the
   basis of e-service quality perceptions. A comprehensive specification of
   the construct, which includes attributes not covered in existing scales,
   is developed. The study contrasts a formative model consisting of four
   dimensions and sixteen attributes against a reflective
   conceptualization. The results of this comparison indicate that studies
   using an incorrectly specified model overestimate the importance of
   certain e-service quality attributes. Global fit criteria are also found
   to support the detection of measurement misspecification. Meta-analytic
   data from 31,264 online customers are used to show that the developed
   measurement predicts customer behavior better than widely used scales,
   such as WebQual and E-S-Qual. The results show that the new measurement
   enables managers to assess e-service quality more accurately and predict
   customer behavior more reliably. (C) 2016 New York University. Published

   whether these services insulate incumbents from new entrants. We address
   this question by examining how the size and uniqueness of an incumbent's
   service portfolio protects its sales after a new competitor enters. We
   study uniqueness by introducing the notion of "competitive service
   overlap" (CSO) that operationalizes service similarity, and show both
   that retailers are best served by offering many services and that
   particularly successful retailers have more unique service portfolios.
   Furthermore, the impact of uniqueness is most prominent when a grocery

AB In food packaging, light and pale colors are often used to highlight
   product healthiness. What has been largely overlooked is that this
   seemingly positive health cue may also convey another crucial piece of
   information. It is this paper's premise that light-colored packages
   evoke two opposing effects: They stimulate favorable health impressions
   (health effect) and they activate detrimental taste inferences (taste
   effect) which jointly guide the purchase decision. To contribute to a
   better understanding of when this package cue is an asset or a
   liability, this research elucidates the boundary conditions under which
   the opposing effects operate. The unfavorable color-induced taste effect
   should be particularly dominant when (i) consumers have a strong need to
   make heuristic taste inferences (i.e., when tasting is not possible) and
   (ii) when health is not the overarching goal (e.g., for less
   health-conscious consumers). A series of experiments manipulating actual
   food packages confirms that the package health cue can indeed trigger
   negative taste associations in the consumer's mind that backfire.
   Marketers therefore are advised to consider the identified contingencies
   carefully. (C) 2016 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB In the consumer packaged goods (CPGs) industry, consumers base their
   purchase decisions in part on package size because different package
   sizes offer different levels of convenience. The heterogeneous
   preference for package size allows manufacturers to use package size as
   a competitive tool in order to raise margins in the face of higher
   production costs. By competing in package sizes, manufacturers may be
   able to soften the degree of price competition in the downstream market,
   and raise margins accordingly. In order to test this hypothesis, we
   develop a structural model of consumer demand, and manufacturers' joint
   decisions regarding package size and price applied to supermarket
   chain-level scanner data for the ready-to-eat breakfast cereal category.
   While others have argued that manufacturers reduce package sizes as a
   means of raising unit prices in a hidden way, we show that package size
   and price are strategic complements downsizing intensifies price
   competition, which does not allow manufacturers to raise unit prices
   through package downsizing. Therefore, package downsizing does not yield
   a desirable outcome for manufactures. On the other hand, retailers
   benefit from package downsizing, as it leads to lower wholesale prices,
   and higher category profits. (C) 2016 New York University. Published by

AB Continual innovation and new technology are critical in helping
   retailers' create a sustainable competitive advantage. In particular,
   shopper facing technology plays an important role in increasing revenues
   and decreasing costs. In this article, we briefly discuss some of the
   salient retail technologies over the recent past as well as technologies
   that are only beginning to gain traction. Additionally, we present a
   shopper-centric decision calculus that retailers can use when
   considering a new shopper-facing technology. We argue that new
   technologies provide value by either increasing revenue through (a)
   attracting new shoppers, (b) increasing share of volume from existing
   shoppers, or (c) extracting greater consumer surplus, or decreasing
   costs through offloading labor to shoppers. Importantly, our framework
   incorporates shoppers by considering their perceptions of the new
   technology and their resulting behavioral reactions. Specifically, we
   argue that shoppers update their perceptions of fairness, value,
   satisfaction, trust, commitment, and attitudinal loyalty and evaluate
   the potential intrusiveness of the technology on their personal privacy.
   These perceptions then mediate the effect of the technology on shopper
   behavioral reactions such as retail patronage intentions and WOM
   communication. We present preliminary support for our framework by
   examining consumers' perceptions of several new retail technologies, as
   well as their behavioral intentions. The findings support our thesis
   that shopper perceptions of the retailer are affected by new
   shopper-facing technologies and that these reactions mediate behavioral
   intentions, which in turn drives the ROI of the new technology. (C) 2017

   frequently processed very quickly leading to perceptions that form
   automatically often without cognitive intervention. Thus, savvy
   retailers should strategically use design elements of the assortments
   and of packaging to direct attention and increase the ease of
   processing. Assortments that are easier to process are liked more and
   are judged to have more perceived variety. Complexity must be minimized
   so that assortments can be parsed immediately. Categorization,

AB Retailers are dynamic in nature, and their strategies keep evolving with
   changing scenarios and availability of new technologies. In the current
   scenario, there is a need for a comprehensive and organizing framework
   for retailers to develop and implement a complex set of strategies. In
   this article, we broadly categorize retailers' implementation of
   strategies at four levels-market, firm, store and customer. The
   four-level categorization has been done using a triangulation approach
   consisting of inferences from previous literature, interviews with
   practitioners, and reviewing popular press. In the future, retailers
   will expand to even more countries, and there will be plenty of scope
   for using advanced technologies and big data. This organizing framework
   accommodates for any such changes as well as guides retailers about ways
   of increasing profitability in the future. In this article, we also
   provide generalized expectations of strategies under each level which
   not only can be used by researchers as a direction of future research
   but also by practitioners to understand and implement their strategies
   in an effective and efficient way. (C) 2016 New York University.

AB Disruptive layouts, smart carts, suggestive signage, GPS alerts, and
   touch-screen preordering all foreshadow an evolution in how healthy
   foods will be sold in grocery stores. Although seemingly unrelated, they
   will all influence sales by altering either how convenient, attractive,
   or normal (CAN) it is to purchase a healthy target food. A Retail
   Intervention Matrix shows how a retailer's actions in these three areas
   can be redirected to target shoppers based on whether the shoppers are
   Health Vigilant, Health Predisposed, or Health Disinterested. For
   researchers, this review offers an organizing framework that integrates
   marketing, nutrition, psychology, public health, and behavioral
   economics to identify next generation research. For managers, this
   framework underscores how small, low cost changes can surprisingly
   increase sales of entire categories of healthy food. (C) 2017 New York

AB Franchise relationships engender franchisor franchisee conflicts and are
   prone to premature dissolution. Building on agency theory and
   institutional theory, this study examines what specific reasons from
   both franchisors' and franchisees' perspectives may cause
   post-litigation relationship dissolution (PLRD) and how franchise
   regulations moderate these relationships. We argue that both franchisor
   and franchisee may misrepresent themselves before their relationship
   begins (adverse selection) and behave opportunistically after the
   contract is signed (moral hazard), that is, 'dual agency'. Based on
   20-year archival records of franchisor franchisee relationship histories
   gleaned from multiple data sources, we found that PLRD is likely to be
   caused by franchisors' passive moral hazard and by franchisees' active
   moral hazard. In addition, franchisor adverse selection has a greater
   impact on PLRD than franchisee adverse selection. With regards to
   regulatory influences, the presence of relationship law weakens the
   impact of franchisees' passive moral hazard, but not their active moral
   hazard, on PLRD. Contrary to what we hypothesize, the presence of
   registration law amplifies the impact of franchisee adverse selection on
   PLRD. Ultimately, this study creates a better understanding of the
   antecedents and curbing mechanisms of PLRD in franchising. Published by

AB Retailers use both pricing and service strategies to respond to
   intensified competition. Here we develop a duopoly model to investigate
   the impact of the increasingly popular personalized pricing strategy
   (PPS) and the widely used Money Back Guarantee (MBG) customer returns
   policy. We consider two retailers who differ in customer satisfaction
   rates. Each retailer chooses a pricing strategy, PPS or uniform pricing,
   and a product return strategy, MBG or 'no returns.' We show that both
   PPS and MBG are dominant strategies, but their impact on retailers'
   prices and profits are different; while PPS intensifies price
   competition and may lead to a prisoner's dilemma in which both retailers
   may lose profit, MBG mitigates price competition and may result in a
   Pareto improvement in both retailers' profits. Both PPS and MBG increase
   the size of the overall market, but not the total duopoly profit. The
   total customer surplus and social welfare may increase under either
   strategy. In addition, we obtain some interesting observations as to how
   our results may change if the product quality/customer satisfaction rate
   is endogenously chosen in the duopoly. Some of our findings are in
   contrast to related results reported in the literature. (C) 2016 New

AB This paper investigates strategies for new market research and
   positioning of stores or products by competing retailers in a duopoly
   setting. We examine the scenario where the two retailers are considering
   entry into an uncertain new market that is an extension of their
   existing markets. The retailers must make decisions on whether or not to
   first conduct research about the new market's location relative to their
   existing markets and its size before deciding on their own positioning
   in it. We first study a sequential-move leader follower setup to
   highlight the choice of an "innovate-or-imitate" strategy. We find when
   the potential new market is small, neither retailer is adequately
   incentivized to do research to acquire information about the new market.
   As the size of the new market increases, the follower is induced to do
   such research. When the new market is very sizable, the leader conducts
   research and knows the new market's location while the follower
   free-rides. We then examine a simultaneous-move setup, in which one
   retailer might decide against acquiring new market information even when
   the cost of doing so is low. We further observe that differentiation
   (e.g., in terms of products or store locations) is greater in the
   simultaneous-move setup than in the sequential setup. (C) 2017 New York

AB This project provides insights into how multitasking impacts consumer
   decision-making. The effect of multitasking on shopping task performance
   is investigated across three studies. Authors propose that the effect of
   multitasking on consumers' shopping task performance (e.g., to purchase
   low calorie snacks for a get together) is moderated by whether the
   consumer is in a how (implementation) or why (deliberation) mindset. To
   the benefit of consumers, results from two lab studies and a field
   experiment in a retail context suggest that shoppers in how-mindsets can
   multitask without any negative impact on shopping task performance.
   However, consumers in a why (deliberation) mindset are negatively
   affected by multitasking and this effect is mediated by task-induced
   stress. Results demonstrate that intervention to reduce the stress level
   eliminates the negative impact of multitasking on consumers in
   why-mindsets. Taken together, the results suggest that interventions to
   channel consumers to an implementation mindset or strategies to
   alleviate the stress levels can help consumers avoid negative impact of
   multitasking on shopping decisions. (C) 2016 New York University.

AB Retailers typically use the strategy of providing a discount to induce
   the sale of a new product at a pre-order stage. Despite the prevalence
   of this strategy, providing discounts might not be effective for all
   consumers. The present research shows that the positive effect of a
   discount depends on consumer temporal orientation. Results from four
   experimental studies reveal that a large discount positively affects
   present-oriented, but not future-oriented, consumers. The findings
   suggest that perceived financial risk and perceived product quality
   sequentially mediate the effect of discount size on value toward the
   deal and purchase intention. A third-party product quality rating boosts
   quality perceptions, which in turn reduces perceived financial risk and
   positively enhances value toward the deal along with purchase intention.
   Our findings demonstrate that when the brand itself acts as a reliable
   signal of quality, a discount has its intended effect for both present-
   and future-oriented consumers. Overall, the findings of this research
   suggest that a retailer can use quality cues along with a discount,
   especially for a new brand, to appeal to the broadest group, as it will
   attract both future- and present-oriented consumers. (C) 2016 New York

AB Atmospheric in-store stimuli have been the subject of considerable
   empirical investigation for over 30 years. This research presents a meta
   analysis of 66 studies and 135 effects (N = 15,621) calibrating the
   atmospheric effects of music, scent, and color on shopping outcomes. At
   an aggregate level, the results reveal that environments in which music
   or scent are present yield higher pleasure, satisfaction, and behavioral
   intention ratings when compared with environments in which such
   conditions are absent. Warm colors produce higher levels of arousal than
   cool colors, while cool colors produce higher levels of satisfaction
   than warm colors. The estimated average strength of these relationships
   ranged from small to medium. Effect sizes exhibited significant
   between-study variance, which can be partly explained by the moderators
   investigated. For instance, larger effect sizes were observed for the
   relationship between scent and pleasure in those samples with a higher
   (vs. lower) proportion of females. Data also indicated a tendency toward
   stronger music and scent effects in service settings as compared to
   retail settings. The results of this analysis, based on data aggregated
   across the research stream, offer retailers a guide to enhance
   customers' shopping experience through judicious use of in-store
   atmospheric stimuli. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Popular digital platforms, such as Netflix and GrubHub, purposefully
   aggregate offerings, according to the premise that customers value
   products chosen from plentiful assortments. Yet academic literature
   provides little clarity about when, for whom, or how larger online
   retail assortments affect the value of the products. To provide new
   insights, the current article aims to address ambiguous extant findings
   about the effects of larger product assortments. Specifically, this
   research tests whether customers with high, as opposed to low,
   assessment orientation value products more when they have chosen them
   from larger, as opposed to smaller, assortments. Four experiments affirm
   this idea, such that customers with a high assessment orientation value
   products more when they have chosen them from platforms with relatively
   larger assortments. Sequential mediation of the effect occurs through
   increased choice engagement and attitude certainty. For managers,
   customer segmentation along the assessment dimension offers benefits,
   while assessment type marketing communications can increase the
   likelihood of product selection, like in our field study, where we find
   an increase of 27%. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB Low transportation costs online allow shoppers to visit multiple
   e-commerce sites for a purchase decision. This research investigates
   online shoppers' visit and purchase behaviors across competing websites.
   To consider that shoppers' longitudinal cross-site visit data may
   consist of several unobserved shopping episodes, we propose a modeling
   approach to probabilistically clustering and relating online visits to
   latent shopping episodes, based on the temporal patterns of the visit
   events. The inferences are then used to examine shoppers'
   visit-to-purchase behavior across websites. Using Internet clickstream
   data on individual-level browsing and transaction records at major air
   travel sites, we find that online shoppers' cross-site visit patterns
   tend to be clustered and the purchase propensity is significantly higher
   at later visits within a visit cluster, compared to earlier visits. As
   our results suggest the possibility that visit clusters can serve as a
   reasonable proxy for shopping episodes, we look further into shoppers'
   website choice and purchase behaviors within a cluster. We discuss how
   the cluster-based analysis can help managers tailor online marketing and
   advertising strategies based on shoppers' cross-site visit and purchase
   patterns. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB A conceptual model is developed to predict how consumers respond to
   in-store displays as a function of the extent to which a product's
   brightness level (i.e., its perceived light-emitting quality) contrasts
   with that of its background environment and the product's level of
   disarray. We show that products whose brightness levels contrast more
   with those of the retail environment are more preferred because they
   visually "pop out" (e.g., a dark product in a brightly lit store
   environment). However, this preference reverses when the products that
   pop out appear in disarray (i.e., are perceived to have been previously
   touched by other shoppers). Because most stores are bright environments,
   darker (vs. lighter) products in disarray are more likely to be
   perceived as contaminated and less pleasant, leading to avoidance
   behaviors, evident in reduced sales and preference. Theoretical and

AB The received wisdom, reflected in popular marketing textbooks, is that
   featuring deeply discounted items will generate additional store traffic
   for retailers that in turn will lead to increased sales and profits.
   However, there is surprisingly little systematic evidence about the
   impact of these deep discounts on aggregate store traffic, sales, and
   profits. In this paper, we study the effects of promotional discounts
   and their characteristics on various store performance metrics employing
   a store level dataset pooled over 55 weeks and 24 stores. Many findings
   of our study lend credence to the continued popularity of such
   promotions by retailers. We find that feature promotions build store
   traffic, especially when the categories being featured are high
   penetration, high frequency. Also, promotions of branded items are found
   to be more effective than promotions of unbranded items. Discounting on
   more items in a category leads to lower store margins suggesting that
   the cost of discounting a large proportion of items in a category may
   not be justified by the profits generated by the sale. Using the
   coefficients from our model estimates, various counterfactuals provide
   insights into strategic change in level of discounts across categories.
   We discuss several implications of our findings for retailers. (C) 2017

AB A manufacturer using a partially integrated channel (PIC) dispatches its
   own salesforce to the retailers that it sells through. The manufacturer
   salesforce in a PIC is simultaneously subject to controls by the
   manufacturer and the retailer, which we call dual control. Despite its
   increasing prevalence, how dual control influences salesforce
   performance remains understudied. We develop a discriminating alignment
   framework through two steps to answer this question. The first step
   examines the influence of a controller on the efficacy of a control
   mechanism. The efficacy of a control mechanism varies with the party
   that exerts control. The second step expands this logic to dual control.
   The performance effect of dual control is equivocal: It may have a
   positive, negative, or no influence on salesforce performance depending
   on discriminating alignment. To improve salesforce performance, a
   manufacturer's control and a retailer's control must compensate for each
   other's weaknesses. Empirical tests based on matched dyadic data of dual
   control of salesforce by apparel manufacturers and retailers support our
   predictions with considerable theoretical and managerial implications.

AB As one of the most common business practices in retailing, exclusive
   dealing (ED) restrictions are of great importance for business
   participants, academics and policy makers. Despite the rich theoretical
   analysis of this type of vertical restraint, evidence on the rationales
   of ED remains scarce. This paper uses a simple model to survey the vast
   theoretical literature on ED, and identifies two opposing motivations
   for ED contracts: anti-competitive versus efficiency-enhancing
   motivations. The theoretical predictions are subject to empirical
   investigation using unique French cross-sectional data encompassing
   diverse retail sectors. Our estimations provide evidence for both types
   of motivations for ED contracts, manifesting in different contexts. In
   particular, we find that the efficiency-enhancing motivation is more
   likely to explain the choice of ED when suppliers are less concentrated,
   whereas the anti -competitive motivation is present in highly
   standardized product markets. Moreover, our results reveal a positive
   linkage of ED and different types of investments, as part of branding
   strategy, with important retailing and marketing-related implications.
   In particular, we show that retailers have to be meticulous regarding
   the conditions of the retail contract before accepting the ED
   restriction, which may dampen their business efficiency in the long run.

AB This research fills a gap in the retailing literature regarding the
   impact of shoppers' perceptions of being watched while shopping for
   embarrassing products. Four studies consistently show that an employee
   watching a shopper can cause the shopper to either permanently or
   temporarily leave the shopping area as purchase intentions decrease.
   Reactance theory explains this relationship, which is mediated by
   consumers' feelings of control over their own privacy. Essentially, when
   shoppers believe an employee is watching them, they feel less in control
   of their privacy, resulting in negative consequences for the retailer.
   This relationship is especially important for products that consumers
   may already feel some level of embarrassment over purchasing in the
   first place. The results have important theoretical implications for
   reactance theory by demonstrating that a consumer can regain control
   even when the original threat to behavior still exists. Additionally,
   increasing options that allow a consumer to regain control will reduce
   the overall reactance to the threat to privacy and will improve retailer
   outcomes. Practitioner recommendations present several techniques that
   allow the consumer to regain privacy control in spite of the sometimes
   necessary practice of watching in-store consumers. (C) 2017 New York

AB Franchisors seek to maximize firm value by managing investments both in
   tangible and intangible assets and in the mix of company and franchised
   outlets, yet little is known about how investors respond to shifts in
   these strategic decisions. Our goal is to assess the impact of these
   decisions on shareholder value within franchise systems through
   panel-data models. Specifically, we provide evidence on how investors in
   publicly traded franchises evaluate both the ownership structure and the
   strategic investment emphasis between intangible assets (e.g., brand)
   and tangible assets (e.g., plant and property). We find that an increase
   in the proportion of franchised units is negatively associated both with
   stock returns and idiosyncratic risk. In contrast, an increase in the
   emphasis on strategic investments in intangible assets is positively
   associated both with stock returns and idiosyncratic risk. Moreover,
   strategic investment emphasis moderates the strength of the effect of
   franchise ownership structure when firms franchise internationally.
   Overall, this research provides a novel empirical examination of
   franchising economics and has managerial implications for franchised
   channel structure. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB As offline retailers struggle to compete with online ones, the
   importance of a consumer's ability to touch a product prior to purchase
   becomes important to study. Prior research has found inconsistent
   results on whether product touch facilitates consumers' product-related
   decision making. Some studies report a positive effect, whereas others
   do not. The current research reconciles this inconsistency and draws
   retailing implications. Across three experiments, we show that the
   effect of product touch on consumers' purchase intentions and
   willingness to pay for a product being evaluated is evident when
   consumers' mental representation of the product is concrete, but not
   when abstract. We further show that perceived risk and perceived
   ownership simultaneously mediate this moderating effect of mental
   representation. Implications are drawn for both offline and online
   retailers. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Customers can sometimes learn unanticipated or hidden use value of a
   firm's product whereas the non-customers remain uninformed about that
   extra value. A monopolist will increase its profit by informing the
   non-customers of its product's hidden value. However, our analysis
   reveals that this may not be true when the firm faces competition in the
   market the firm may actually make a higher profit if it keeps its hidden
   value secret from its competitor's customers even if advertising to
   inform those customers is costless. This is because no advertising leads
   to information heterogeneity among consumers about the existence of the
   firm's hidden value, which gives an incentive for both firms to continue
   targeting their own existing customers rather than poaching each other's
   customers, alleviating price competition and increasing firms' profits.
   This beneficial strategic effect of keeping some product value secret
   from the competitor's customers can persist even when the firms
   anticipate the hidden value and compete more aggressively for customers
   in the early period. Our research suggests that firms can benefit from
   an "under-promise and over deliver" strategy if they refrain from
   communicating their extra value to the competitor's customers. Moreover,
   positive word of mouth about a firm's product will not necessarily
   benefit the firm and can in fact make all firms worse off. (C) 2017 New

AB This research investigates how retailers can benefit from identifying
   the sales growth potential of in-store salespeople in every product
   category. The proposed novel approach helps retailers develop an
   equitable evaluation of their sales force, using both observable and
   unobservable factors that affect sales. By extending stochastic frontier
   regression to a multivariate case, the resulting factor-analytic
   frontier formulation leverages the correlation pattern of sales across
   product categories and salespeople over time. A unique data set, from a
   franchise chain with 481 salespeople, operating in 35 stores and selling
   11 related product categories, identifies a gap between observed
   category profits and an estimated profit frontier for each salesperson
   and category. This novel model also can benchmark each salesperson
   against all others across product categories while accounting for
   observable and unobservable factors. This approach has practical value,
   in that retailers can identify both top-performing salespeople and
   underperformers, who then might be matched to establish a positive
   learning environment that aligns top performers with proven sales
   expertise in a product category with peers who struggle with that
   category. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB The conventional wisdom, grounded in deontological ethics, is that
   retailers should extinguish unethical customer behavior. However, there
   exists an opposing teleological view that unethical behavior may be
   tolerated if its ultimate consequences are beneficial for all
   stakeholders. This is supported by a survey of retail managers conducted
   by the authors that revealed over 80% of the respondents are inclined to
   tolerate unethical customers whose actions have beneficial effects. The
   primary goal of this research is to investigate the boundaries of this
   teleological perspective, that is, whether ethical transgressions that
   appear to have negative short-term consequences for the retailer and
   other ethical customers can have beneficial longer-term consequences for
   all parties. We examine this question empirically with a longitudinal
   dataset, covering seventy weeks and over 48,000 accounts, from a popular
   Swiss online retailer. We focus on increased revenues and customer
   engagement as the benefit for the retailer. Our results show that
   customers registering multiple accounts in violation of the retailer's
   policy comprise fewer than 11.5% of accounts, yet generate more than
   27.6% of the retailer's revenue. Specifically, their behavior leads to
   higher retailer revenues and greater engagement by other customers in
   the long-run. We discuss the implications of this insight for retailing
   managers as well as scholars. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by

AB While store remodeling can increase customer sales, not all remodeling
   efforts are successful. In this study, two treatment stores from a large
   national retailer are matched with control stores in a field experiment.
   Even though the cost of remodeling the treatment stores was the same,
   and the remodeled stores had identical layout, color, furnishing and
   interior design, one store had a 12% lift in sales while the other had
   only 1%. We show that a key determinant of remodeling success is the
   perceived magnitude of change between the initial and final condition of
   the store. Indeed, customer psychological and sales responses are
   greater when the perceived magnitude of change between the condition of
   the store prior to remodeling and the store after remodeling is larger.
   Importantly, these positive effects continue for as long as 12 months
   after remodeling. We further find that the profile of customers drawn to
   the remodeled stores differs based on the perceived magnitude of change,
   as do the environmental attributes that contribute to customer
   perceptions of the remodel. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc. on

   More importantly, what creates such latent loyalty? We attempt to answer

   conviction, which represents the inherent strength/uncertainty in a

   conative loyalty), the findings suggest that customer satisfaction
   creates loyalty held without conviction. In contrast, customer-company
   identification creates loyalty held with conviction. Importantly,
   attitudinal loyalty without conviction loses its ability to predict

   loyalty with conviction maintains a predictive relationship with
   behavior despite the same barriers. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf

AB In-store product sampling is a commonly used promotional technique
   designed to give prospective consumers an opportunity to experience a
   product prior to purchase. While prior research has documented a
   positive relationship between short-term sales and perceptual measures
   of the customer shopping experience, little is known about the long-term
   impact of sampling or factors that moderate its success. In this paper,
   we develop an empirical approach that allows us to study the short-term
   and long-term effects of in-store sampling on both own and competitive
   products. We apply our approach to six store-level scanner data sets
   across four different product categories and show that in-store sampling
   has both an immediate (short-term) and sustained (long-term) impact on
   sales. We also show that the impact of sampling on sales is moderated by
   the characteristics of the store conducting the event, and that repeated
   sampling for a single product leads to a multiplicative increase in its
   long-term sales performance. We find that, unlike many types of in-store
   promotion, sampling results in a category expansion effect as opposed to
   a pure substitution effect. We contrast the immediate and long-term
   sales patterns for in-store sampling to, those of product displays and
   discuss managerially relevant differences. Finally, we demonstrate
   incremental profit implications and store selection scenarios for
   different incremental costs of conducting the in-store events using
   constrained optimizations. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by

AB Have you ever purchased an item only to notice a short while later that
   its price was reduced? Many retailers offer to refund customers the full
   price difference as long as the discount occurred within a short period
   of time after the original purchase. Such policy looks attractive to
   consumers as it shields them from future price fluctuations. But can
   this policy be advantageous for the retailer?
   In this paper we investigate the price difference refund policy
   (commonly referred to as price adjustment) and demonstrate how it can
   result in a higher profit even if all consumers request and receive a
   price adjustment.
   Further, the existing literature and practice both assume that if a
   price adjustment policy is employed, the consumers should get the full
   price difference refunded. In this paper we endogenize the refund
   amount, allowing the retailer to determine the optimal percentage of the
   price difference to be returned to consumers. We fully characterize the
   conditions under which it is optimal to offer a partial or greater than
   full price adjustment to customers as well as the optimal refund
   percentage. Additionally, we demonstrate that the practice of limiting
   the price adjustment option to a short period after the purchase
   incident is not necessarily in the best interest of retailers. (C) 2017

AB This study analyzes a retailer's store brand quality decision in
   vertically differentiated product categories. We analyze a game
   theoretic model composed of one or two national brand manufacturers and
   a retailer, who strategically chooses the quality level(s) of its store
   brand(s) relative to the well-established national brand position(s) to
   maximize its category profit. Our analysis reveals that the nature of a
   retailer's store brand quality positioning is quite different from the
   manufacturer's national brand positioning decision, and that the best
   position for a store brand is not "as close to a national brand as
   possible" as previous studies suggest. Instead, the optimal quality
   position of each store brand is remarkably sensitive to the distribution
   of consumers' willingness-to-pay. In particular, the relative
   proportions of quality sensitive consumers and price sensitive consumers
   determine the balance of three key strategic forces - the market
   expansion force, the retail margin force, and the consumer profitability
   force, leading to different optimal product line designs for store
   brands across different category environments. Interestingly, against
   multiple incumbent national brands, the retailer's optimal product line
   design includes a store brand positioned at the highest quality level in
   the category only if most consumers are moderately quality conscious. We
   also analyze the implications of national brands' brand equity for
   retailers' store brand strategy. (C) 2017 New York University. Published

AB Research suggests that in-store crowding can lower customers' spending,
   thus limiting overall benefits of high store frequentation. Here, we
   propose that this negative effect can be mitigated by adjusting store
   ambiance, specifically by using certain types of in-store music. To test
   this idea, we conducted a longitudinal field experiment in which we
   manipulated in-store music tempo and measured social density in six
   European retail stores. Analyzing over 40,000 individual shopping
   baskets, we found that social density had an inverted u-shape effect on
   customer spending. This effect was moderated by in-store music tempo,
   such that fast music strongly increased spending under high-density
   conditions. The increase in shopping basket value was driven by
   customers buying more items rather than buying items that were more
   expensive. Fast music thus alleviated negative effects of social
   density. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and
   describe how practitioners can use in-store music to counter negative
   effects of high customer density. (C) 2017 New York University.

AB As an alternative to promotional price cuts, retailers and manufacturers
   often rely on non-price promotion techniques, such as premium
   promotions, where consumers receive a free gift with the purchase of a
   product. We compare the effectiveness of premiums to that of price cuts,
   and study moderators of this comparative premium effectiveness. We use
   data from a large online shopping simulation study with more than 2,000
   participants to model consumers' purchase decisions in response to
   premiums and price cuts. Results indicate that the impact of premiums on
   purchase behavior is systematically lower than that of equivalent price
   cuts. However, a premium's smaller sales impact may be offset by a cost
   advantage. This is especially true for private label brands where the
   premium's purchase effects do not differ too much from those of a price
   cut. We calculate how large the cost advantage has to be for a premium
   to be more profitable than a price cut, and show that premiums entail
   risks as well as opportunities, for both manufacturers and retailers.

AB Many online retailers make sales and stock level information live
   available to customers on their websites and offline retailers also
   increasingly can display this information. Yet it is unclear how
   consumers perceive such information and how it influences consumer
   choice. High sales and low stock may both signal popularity and quality,
   which will stimulate further sales. We however argue that sales level is
   more diagnostic than stock level as a cue and hence the effect of sales
   level on consumer choice will be stronger than that of stock level.
   Also, when both cues are available, the effect of sales level is
   expected to dominate. In addition, brand familiarity is expected to
   moderate these effects. These hypotheses are tested in two
   scenario-based online experiments in which participants choose between
   competing products for which information about either sales levels,
   stock levels, or both sales and stock levels is displayed. Results
   support the hypotheses and also show that sales level is indeed a more
   diagnostic cue than stock level. Analyses further reveal how perceptions
   of the popularity and quality of a product mediate the effects of sales
   and stock levels on consumer choice. The findings imply that retailers
   can successfully use sales and stock level information to induce quality
   perceptions and influence consumer choices. (C) 2017 New York

AB Much has been written about myth and the marketplace. Consumer research
   has added immeasurably to academics' appreciation of the myths that
   inhere in fabulous flagship stores and experiential retailing more
   generally. Studies of consumer mythopoeia, however, have tended to
   muffle the martial side of retailing, the heroic struggles that some
   customers undergo in-store. This article argues that the epic offers
   valuable insights into martial matters, and more. Although epic and myth
   overlap, they are far from identical. The former is characterized by
   conventions that can help illuminate consumers' quests, not least their
   disturbing journeys through the underworld. These are considered in
   relation to Hollister (HCo), a phenomenally successful retail chain
   that's renowned for its antithetical atmospherics and inky interior
   design. A qualitative study of Hollister lovers and haters casts light
   on the epic in action and adds to scholars' understanding of immersive
   retailing experiences. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by

AB Novel, unique, or otherwise disfluent fonts are often used to draw
   consumer attention. However, disfluent fonts may also create
   metacognitive processing challenges. Therefore, consumers may devote
   more cognitive resources to process disfluent price fonts and will
   consequently be more likely to accurately recall and anchor on disfluent
   price displays when forming their future price expectations. Three
   experiments demonstrate that disfluent sale prices can reduce future
   price expectations, while disfluent manufacturer-suggested retail prices
   (MSRPs) can increase future price expectations. Additionally, price
   recall accuracy mediates the effect. Moderation analysis demonstrates
   that disfluent MSRP displays are more likely to affect price-conscious
   and less-involved consumers. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by

AB Restaurants with 20 or more locations will soon be required to disclose
   calorie information on menus and menu boards. Retailers not included in
   this mandate can choose to voluntarily provide calorie information. To
   better understand the implications of this major policy change for food
   retailers, this research examines how consumers' retailer-related
   responses are affected by menu calorie labeling. A framework based on
   the attribution theory and the health halo literatures is developed, and
   three primary studies, including a field experiment, are used to test
   the proposed direct, moderating, and mediating effects derived from this
   conceptualization. Findings across the studies show that menu calorie
   labeling has a positive direct effect on perceptions of the restaurant's
   concern for customers' well-being and positive indirect effects on
   attitudes toward the restaurant and patronage intentions. However, these
   direct and indirect effects are attenuated when the restaurant is
   perceived to be more (vs. less) healthful and when menu calorie labeling
   is mandatory (vs. voluntary). The implications of these findings for
   retail and restaurant management are discussed. (C) 2017 New York

   information on their menus as part of the Patient Protection and
   Affordable Care Act. In the present research, we examine the efficacy of
   this legislation in reducing restaurant based food calorie consumption.
   Specifically, we explore the likely effect of the new policy on both the
   supply and demand side, that is, consumer and retailer behaviors. To
   achieve this, two studies are included in this research: a meta-analysis
   of 186 studies investigating the effect of calorie disclosure on
   calories selected, and a meta-analysis of 41 studies examining the
   effect of calorie disclosure on calories offered by retailers. Across
   these two studies we reveal a significant and unequivocal calorie
   disclosure effect for menu labels; disclosure results in both fewer
   calories selected (-27 Calories) and fewer calories offered by retailers
   (-15 Calories). Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc. on

AB In this study, we conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of
   store brand introductions on the price leadership relations in a
   distribution channel between a retailer and national brand
   manufacturers. We analyze a multi-product category retail database from
   a major grocery chain, which captures both a period before and a period
   after the introduction of a store brand in each product category. By
   applying the time series approach to this data set, we show that store
   brand introductions frequently lead to price leadership changes,
   generally in a more favorable direction for the retailer than for the
   national brand manufacturer, evidenced by either the decay of the
   manufacturers' price leadership or the rise of the retailer's price
   leadership. However, such a change is not universal but tends to be
   concentrated among a certain quality tier of national brands, which is
   not always the low-tier, but sometimes the top-tier despite the
   low-price low-quality position of the store brand. The patterns detected
   in the data suggest that these changes are likely to reflect the
   retailer's strategic effort to reshape the price leadership environment
   in a product category aided by the enhanced bargaining power and
   managerial sophistication that accompanied the store brand
   introductions. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, we study whether a hotel should cooperate with an
   independent online travel agency (OTA) to sell rooms, and, if yes, using
   what business model-the Merchant model or the Agency model. In the
   Merchant model, the OTA purchases rooms at a discount wholesale price
   and sells them at a profit, but takes on the risk of having unsold
   inventory. In the Agency model, the OTA passes reservations booked by
   its customers to the hotel and receives an agreed commission fee on each
   transaction. We demonstrate that there is no one strategy tailored to
   all situations: the choices of channel and business model are closely
   tied to certain conditions, like the hotel's room capacity, consumer
   acceptance of the OTA channel, the increase in market size with the OTA
   channel and the commission rate charged by the OTA. The hotel's
   equilibrium strategy indicates that adding the OTA channel does not
   increase the hotel's profit if the hotel's capacity, the increase in
   market size with the OTA channel, and consumer acceptance of the OTA
   channel are relatively small. Regarding the selection of business model,
   in general, larger hotels offered a larger increase in market size with
   the OTA channel, and where the commission rate is low, will prefer the
   Agency model; otherwise hotels will prefer the Merchant model.
   Managerial guidance regarding channel and business model selection is

AB When physically similar products, of similar quality, are offered by
   retailers both online and offline, we often observe that the dispersion
   in prices of these products online is greater than the price dispersion
   offline. This observation runs counter to early theories that suggested
   price dispersion online would be smaller than that offline due to the
   ease of search and information availability online. This paper
   investigates and provides an explanation for this puzzling phenomenon by
   examining the impact of two important drivers of price dispersion:
   retailer type and consumers' shopping risk. Retailer type refers to
   whether a retailer is a pure offline, pure online, or dual channel
   retailer. Shopping risk is defined as the product of consumers'
   perceived risk of shopping and the transaction uncertainty related to
   shopping at different types of retailers.
   A game-theoretic approach is adopted to model consumers' price search
   and product purchase, as well as price competition within and across
   retailer types in online and offline markets. Equilibrium pricing
   strategies are derived for different retailer types competing for
   different consumer segments with different levels of perceived shopping
   risk. The impact of retailer type and shopping risk on online versus
   offline price dispersion are quantified, and conditions when price
   dispersion is greater online than offline are identified.
   Results indicate that price dispersion is greater online when the number
   of pure online retailers is sufficiently large and is increasing in the
   number of pure online retailers. In addition, a reduction in online
   shopping risk may actually increase online price dispersion. Results
   further suggest that even without any online sales, dual channel
   retailers should maintain their online presence for the purpose of
   information dissemination, which justifies the importance for pure
   offline retailer to incorporate webrooming strategies, where consumers
   can search for prices online but purchase offline. (C) 2018 New York

AB Although prior scholarship has demonstrated important effects of visual
   complexity on product perceptions, the relationship between the visual
   complexity of a product's environment and that product's perceived size
   remains unexplored. Because size is such an important product
   characteristic in many consumer contexts, the lack of exploration of
   this relationship leaves a significant gap in the literature on size
   perceptions, especially in relation to the retailing domain. The present
   investigation seeks to document the relationship between environmental
   visual complexity and the perceived size of a product. Namely, five
   studies show that high visual complexity decreases consumer size
   perceptions of a focal product through a serial mediation process in
   which high complexity pulls consumer attention away from the focal
   product. This shifted attention decreases processing fluency and leads
   consumers to perceptually minimize size to avoid information overload in
   the processing of a display. Even after ruling out potential influences
   of referent information (study 5) and alternative explanations of
   affective processing and perceived depth (study 4), these effects hold.
   The findings have implications for both theory and practice, shedding
   light on the relationship between size perceptions of a focal object and
   its environment. (C) 2018 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB While most research suggests using ostentatious packaging as a strategy
   to increase sales, using such packaging for embarrassing products can
   actually decrease purchase intentions. Five studies explore two
   components of packaging that influence product anonymity and the
   relationship between anonymity, embarrassment, and purchase intentions.
   The studies use a variety of methods including one field study, three
   scenario-based experiments, and one virtual reality video study with a
   behavioral component. This research contributes to retailing literature
   by examining the effect of packaging dimensions on product anonymity and
   the subsequent impact on embarrassment and purchase intentions. We
   consistently show more anonymously packaged products are perceived as
   less embarrassing and are more likely to be purchased than less
   anonymously packaged products. Consumers are able to circumvent
   undesirable stigmas associated with embarrassing products by selecting
   products that are more anonymously packaged and positioned in the store.
   Additionally, increased sales due to product packaging differences are
   more likely when an embarrassing product is positioned in an aisle
   versus on an endcap. Promotional incentives, such as coupons, in-store
   discounts, or bonus buys, can mitigate the negative effect of
   embarrassment onto purchase intentions. These findings have important
   implications to our understanding of shopper behavior when threatened
   with embarrassment. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of New

AB While a rich body of research has examined the psychological costs and
   benefits of queuing, this research focuses on the customer currently
   using a retail service and examines how this customer is affected by
   lines forming at his or her back. Drawing on Social Impact Theory, we
   postulate that customers feel pressured by people waiting behind them
   and that this feeling of social pressure leads to more negative
   affective experiences, poorer participation in co-creation settings, and
   lower perceptions of service quality. Five field and controlled
   experimental studies tested these predictions and also explored how
   retailers can reduce the adverse impact of queues. Studies 1A and 1B
   show that the customer's experience deteriorates as queue length
   increases and that perceptions of social pressure mediate this effect.
   Studies 2A and 2B show that this effect is moderated by customers' own
   waiting time such that customers are more affected by queues forming at
   their backs when their own waiting time decreases. Finally, study 3
   identifies two strategies to attenuate the negative effects of waiting
   lines, namely explicitly reassuring the focal customer that she need not
   feel pressured to be efficient and removing the waiting customers from
   the line of vision of the focal customer. (C) 2018 New York University.

AB Retailers have always worked to establish close relationships with
   customers through the retail marketing mix. Thus, the literature has a
   long tradition of testing the effects of various instruments on retail
   patronage. This meta-study synthesizes prior research into one
   comprehensive framework. We use 14,895 effect sizes reported by more
   than 239,000 shoppers from 41 countries extracted from 350 independent
   samples, to test the impact of 24 marketing-mix instruments on retail
   patronage. Specifically, we investigate the direct and indirect effects
   of these instruments on store satisfaction, word of mouth, patronage
   intention, and behavior. Product and brand management related
   instruments display the strongest effects on most outcome variables,
   whereas price, communication, service and incentive management
   instruments affect only selected outcomes. Distribution management turns
   out to be of secondary importance. However, the effectiveness of these
   instruments depends on the specific shopping context (food/non-food,
   shopping frequency, single store/agglomeration, hedonic/utilitarian),
   the retail environment (gross domestic product, country innovativeness,
   retail sales share, retail employment, Internet era), and the employed
   method (participant type, study design, data source). Specifically, we
   reveal most differences for hedonic shopping environments and developed
   countries. Also, the store's advertising and atmosphere have gained
   importance in the Internet era, while purchase incentives, in-store
   orientation, and store location have lost relevance. This study
   contributes to a synoptic understanding of the comparable effectiveness
   of retail marketing instruments on retail patronage. It offers insights
   into the effectiveness of marketing-mix instruments and provides
   guidance on whether and when to invest in them. It also presents an
   agenda for future research on marketing-mix instruments. (C) 2018 The

AB Consumers often find themselves challenged by the conflicting desires to
   seek uniqueness versus conformity, and thus seek some degree of balance.
   In a series of six studies we show that presenting each options'
   product-related information in a unique color, as opposed to all product
   related information presented in black-on-white, partially satiates the
   desire for uniqueness, thus amplifying the compromise effect. Consumers
   facing color presentation formats choose the middle, conforming option
   more often, yet perceive their choice as more unique. This color effect
   is not realized if each option's attributes are presented in different
   colors, but all options use a consistent color scheme, as is often the
   case in on-line retailing sites such as Amazon.com. Having to justify
   one's choice moderates the color effect. The practical take-away is that
   consumers' choices can be influenced by using unique colors to present
   option-related product information, a variable that is entirely
   independent of the options' performance characteristics. Two field
   studies confirm this finding, one using a plain background versus a
   colored background in a product display and the other using product
   containers that are either in plain white or wrapped in unique colors.

AB Over the past three decades, franchisee performance has attracted the
   attention of scholars in both retailing and entrepreneurship. However,
   to date, research has not investigated whether the type of franchisee
   ownership influences franchisee financial performance. Family ownership,
   the most dominant form of firm organization worldwide, ingrains greater
   focus on noneconomic goals that could, in turn, reduce the financial
   performance of a family-owned franchisee. Drawing on the tenets of
   agency theory undergirding the franchising and family business
   literature, we examine whether family-owned franchisees have lower
   financial performance than nonfamily-owned franchisees. Using data from
   the 2007 Small Business Owner survey and propensity score matching, we
   observed that family franchisees generated at least 6.7% lower sales per
   employee than nonfamily franchisees. The inferences are consistent
   across two additional samples and robust to additional performance
   outcomes and specifications. Overall, this research provides a novel
   empirical examination of the influence of family ownership on franchisee
   financial performance and has managerial implications for both
   franchisors and franchisees. (C) 2017 New York University. Published by

AB This study examines the performance consequences of web personalization
   (WP), a type of personalization in which web content is personalized and
   recommendations are offered based on customer preferences. Despite the
   growing popularity of personalization, there is a dearth of research at
   the firm level on whether and how web personalization creates
   shareholder value. We develop and test a conceptual model that proposes
   that the impact of WP on shareholder value is mediated by (1) cash flow
   volatility and (2) premium price. The hypotheses are tested based on 603
   firm-quarter observations spanning 80 firms over six years in the online
   financial services industry. The results suggest that while WP lowers
   the volatility of cash flows, it only enables firms to charge premium
   prices when online trust is high. Additional tests reveal that the
   reduction in cash flow volatility is because of lower churn as opposed
   to acquiring new customers or greater cross -buying. Finally, online
   trust positively moderates the relationships between WP and cash flow
   volatility and price premia. Practical implications of the findings are
   discussed. (C) 2018 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Most online shopping platform firms generate revenue from three sources:
   pay-per-click search advertising, pay-per-impression display
   advertising, and membership fees. The strategies that influence these
   revenue sources typically are studied individually, rather than in a
   holistic fashion. In response, this study uses time-series data with 18
   million buyers and sellers from 2010 to 2011 and undertakes a
   quasi-experiment to analyze how the distinct effects of buyer-and
   seller-side strategies on revenues (1) vary across all three revenue
   sources and (2) depend differentially on a platform's upmarket
   repositioning strategy. The results show that buyers that purchase
   through direct traffic (e.g., typing in the site address) yield more
   display advertising and membership fee revenues than those gained
   through organic traffic (e.g., landing from a search engine). Engagement
   strategies that appeal to established sellers (i.e., value-added
   services) yield more search advertising and membership revenue than
   those that appeal to new sellers (i.e., social forums). An upmarket
   repositioning strategy (i.e., eliminating low quality sellers) enhances
   the revenue effects of buyer traffic generation and seller engagement
   strategies. Post hoc analyses suggest that a 1% increase in direct
   traffic generates an additional $151,506 in display advertising revenue
   after (vs. before) the repositioning. (C) 2018 New York University.

AB This paper advances our understanding of consumer responses to retail
   product displays by examining the interplay between the vertical shelf
   position of choice options and consumers' personal sense of power in
   determining their preference for indulgent options. Six experiments show
   that when consumers choose from assortments placed on a low shelf
   position, requiring them to lower their heads, those higher (vs. lower)
   in personal power are more likely to choose an indulgent option over its
   prudent counterpart. In contrast, when choosing from assortments placed
   on a high shelf position, requiring consumers to raise their heads,
   those lower (vs. higher) in personal power are more likely to choose an
   indulgent option. This effect hinges on a mismatch (vs. match) between
   consumers' personal sense of power and that triggered by the products'
   retail shelf position, increasing affective discomfort and guiding
   consumers, thus, towards indulgent choices. (C) 2018 New York

AB A controversial trend in grocery is the practice by retailers to quickly
   copy innovative national brands (NBs) launched by manufacturers with
   their own private label (PL). In a sample of 1,100+ NB pioneers launched
   in The Netherlands between 2005 and 2009, 11.7% faced a PL copycat by at
   least one of the seven leading grocery retailers. These copycats
   obtained an impressive 5.8% category share at the retailer in the year
   after launch, thereby outperforming the NB pioneers they copy (2.1%) as
   well as non-copycat PLs launched in the same period (4.4%). Using a
   two-step selection model, we identify what motivates retailers to copy
   NB innovations, and what factors drive subsequent copycat performance,
   thereby taking into account retailers' innovation assortment decisions.
   As expected, retailers are more likely to copy successful NB
   innovations, and these copycats indeed perform well in their stores.
   However, retailers do not only take into account financial
   considerations. They are especially hesitant to copy heavily promoted NB
   innovations and those launched by manufacturers with a strong
   reputation. To enhance copycat performance, retailers should keep prices
   of the copycat sufficiently below those of the NB pioneer and limit its
   promotions. Apart from guiding retailers in their copycat decisions,
   also NB manufacturers can learn from this study how to discourage
   retailers from imitating their innovations. (C) 2018 New York

   uncover a novel phenomenon in the domains of physical attractiveness and
   taste perception: attractiveness does indeed impact taste perception,

   consumed. When the server is attractive, good food tastes better but bad
   food tastes worse. Six studies demonstrate this effect and, importantly,

AB Supermarket retailers typically operate with relatively low margins,
   suggesting a highly competitive retail environment. However, despite the
   fact that consumers purchase an entire shopping basket at a time from
   supermarkets, this evidence is largely based on models of retail
   competition with single-category purchases. In this paper, we develop
   and test an empirical model of retail price competition that explicitly
   accounts for the effect of demand complementarity among items in
   consumer shopping baskets. Relative to the case where consumers purchase
   products with independent demands, we demonstrate that equilibrium
   prices are higher for all items when retailers take
   demand-complementarity into account. Our findings indicate that
   non-price strategies intended to encourage complementarity, such as
   co-merchandising, strategic shelf-positioning, or featuring
   complementary goods tend to soften price competition, and lead to higher
   equilibrium prices. (C) 2018 New York University. Published by Elsevier

   rewarded for retailers' mobile channel additions. Results from an event
   study on 115 announcements relating to mobile app additions of publicly

   market responds generally positively to mobile app additions, but
   specifically to the two mobile app addition types. Stock market
   responses to search-related and purchase-related app additions are
   moderated by firm size, product category, and target customer age. For
   announcements of search-related apps, the market responds more
   positively to product retailers than to service retailers, and to small
   firms than large ones. For announcements of purchase-related apps, the
   market responds less positively to firms that target younger customers
   than firms who do not especially target them. (C) 2018 New York

AB Cause-Marketing (CM) has gained momentum in recent years, both in
   marketing research and practice. However, while CM aims to influence
   consumers on an emotional or affective level, research into the
   emotional and affective response to CM campaigns is scarce. The current
   research fills this void by showing that a CM campaign is a win win win
   strategy. Though the tangible benefits of CM campaigns go to the firm
   and the philanthropic cause, our perspective is novel by arguing that
   the consumer benefits as well, albeit intangibly; CM campaigns provide
   an opportunity to do good, and hence induce feelings of gratitude in
   consumers. However, this effect depends on several contingencies. In
   particular, consumers perceive greater effort by small firms, relative
   to large firms, that engage in CM campaigns, leading them to assess the
   underlying motives as more sincere and then experience stronger feelings
   of gratitude for the opportunity to donate. Four experiments confirm
   this greater CM effectiveness for small compared with large firms. In
   turn, this study offers substantive contributions for both marketing
   research and practice: It proposes a cost-effective strategy for
   enhancing CM effectiveness, and specifies concrete strategies for both
   small and large companies. (C) 2018 New York University. Published by

AB Gift cards account for a $200 billion market in the US, yet little is

   cards. We examine how average US consumers feel about exchanging luxury
   brand gift cards (LGCs) versus non-luxury brand gift cards (NLGCs).
   Using secondary data analyses, surveys, and experiments, we demonstrate
   two asymmetries: between valuations of LGCs versus NLGCs and between
   valuations of gift cards by givers versus recipients. We show that LGCs
   are valued less than NLGCs with identical price tags. LGCs are more
   likely to be swapped or sold. Resellers demand and buyers pay lower
   prices for LGCs. These effects are mediated by the perceived utility of
   the gift cards as gifts and moderated by a person's role in the gifting
   process. Gift givers value and prefer to give LGCs more, whereas
   recipients prefer and value NLGCs more. (C) 2018 New York University.

AB Although retailers know that brand names are important conveyors of
   product benefits, little is known about how subtle characteristics of
   brand names affect consumer attitudes and purchase intentions. This
   research proposes and shows that the letter case of brand names affects
   product attitudes and purchase intentions but that these effects depend
   on congruity between brand case and the gender of consumption benefits.
   Studies 1 and 2 show that lowercase brand names are associated with
   feminine characteristics while uppercase brand names are associated with
   masculine characteristics, as measured through judgments of name gender,
   gendered brand personality traits, and overall brand gender perceptions.
   Three additional studies demonstrate that greater congruity between
   brand case and the gender of consumption benefits increases product
   evaluations and purchase intentions. Study 3 demonstrates that greater
   congruity between brand case and the gender of a female consumer's
   consumption goal leads her to have more favorable product attitudes.
   Study 4 replicates these effects by manipulating the gender of product
   benefits, shows that effects on purchase intentions are moderated by the
   consumer's biological sex, and identifies processing fluency as the
   underlying mechanism. Study 5 demonstrates that brand case, rather than
   letter shape, drives these results. This work advances understanding of
   how seemingly subtle brand name characteristics affect gender
   perceptions and consumer behavior, with implications for brand design
   and positioning in the retailing industry. (C) 2018 Published by

AB A number of consumer and business reports suggest that slightly lower
   quality (or feature) versions of products are being sold through
   dominant retailers, while higher quality versions continue to be sold
   through weaker retailers and, customers are uninformed about such subtle
   differences. We study two intriguing questions based on this phenomenon
   namely (1.) why are lower quality-lower priced versions sold primarily
   through dominant retailers and not the weaker retailers? (2.) Why do
   sometimes the weaker retailers not inform customers about these quality
   differences? Using a game theoretic model, we find that when quality is
   noncontractible an increase in retail dominance leads to a decrease in
   quality offered by the dominant retailer vis-a-vis the weaker retailer.
   However, we show that the weaker retailer does not have an incentive to
   advertise its higher quality if quality differences are not too high.
   This situation arises endogenously when the dominant retailer is not too
   powerful as compared to the weaker retailer or when retail
   differentiation is high. The motivation for this result is traced to the
   threat of increased competition in the event of such advertising. (C)

TI Antecedents and Consequences of Customer Satisfaction: Do They Differ

AB Retailers seek to utilize both online and offline purchase channels
   strategically to satisfy customers and thrive in the marketplace.
   Unfortunately, current multichannel research is deficient in answering
   what drives customers' satisfaction, and consequently their loyalty,
   differently when customers purchase online versus at a physical store.
   This gap in knowledge can be a significant concern for retailers due to
   the negative impact of having dissatisfied customers on their bottom
   lines. Using a version of the American Customer Satisfaction Index
   (ACSI) model, we demonstrate several important purchase-channel
   differences in the antecedents of customer satisfaction and its
   subsequent effect on customer loyalty. Specifically, we show that when
   retail customers buy electronic goods online they view purchase value as
   a significant attribute in rating satisfaction, and are more
   satisfaction-sensitive when making repurchase decisions than when they
   purchase offline. On the other hand, the overall quality of the purchase
   experience and customer expectations are stronger drivers of customer
   satisfaction in the offline purchases. We provide evidence that these
   differences between the channels generally persist across customer
   demographics (gender, age, and education) and broader product
   categories, and we also discuss the specific contexts where they do not.
   Our work offers actionable guidance to retailers seeking to enhance
   customer satisfaction and loyalty across both the online and offline
   channels. (C) 2018 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Recommender systems on marketers' websites are typically designed to
   facilitate purchase decisions by helping customers easily identify
   products that match their tastes and needs. However, such product
   recommendations can not only support but also influence decision-making
   and outcomes. Expanding on previous research on the persuasiveness of
   product recommendations, this paper demonstrates that recommender
   systems can affect online decision-making through an anchoring effect
   such that consumers' decision-making processes and, ultimately, choices
   are biased toward numerical attributes of (even random) product
   recommendations; we refer to this phenomenon as attribute-level
   anchoring effect. The findings of the current research reveal that this
   effect occurs because consumers tend to pay more attention to
   alternatives that are similar to a recommended option. From a practical
   perspective, these results indicate the potential to shape consumer
   interests and choices through recommender systems and highlight possible
   customer protection issues in online shopping environments. (C) 2018 New

AB Two-way asymmetric information frequently hampers performances of
   manufacturer-retailer distribution channel members. Typically, the
   manufacturer is better informed about the quality of his product than
   the retailer while the latter knows more about her consumers' preference
   for product quality than the manufacturer. Bridging these information
   gaps can enable more profitable channel (wholesale and retail) pricing
   decisions. Specifically, once the manufacturer knows his product
   quality, he can at some cost advertise it to the downstream retailer and
   her consumers. Similarly, the retailer can decide to conduct market
   research at some cost to more precisely determine her consumers'
   preference for product quality and share her finding with the
   manufacturer. In this paper, the authors examine the strategic impacts
   of two alternative timings of these information gap-filling decisions:
   In the "Upfront Market Research" (UMR) scenario, the retailer moves
   first with her market research decision and then the manufacturer makes
   his product quality advertising decision. Alternatively, in the "Upfront
   Quality Advertising" (UQA) scenario, the manufacturer first decides
   about product quality advertising and then the retailer proceeds with
   her market research decision. This paper analytically investigates and
   compares the strategic impacts of the UMR and UQA scenarios on the
   firms' equilibrium information strategies and payoffs in a two-way
   asymmetric information setting for the first time. The authors find that
   the retailer is always better off in the UQA than the UMR scenario while
   the manufacturer can find either UMR or UQA decision sequence more
   beneficial depending on the relative costs of market research and
   product quality advertising. The analyses offer new insights and
   guidelines for more efficient and profitable information acquisition and
   coordination in bilateral manufacturer-retailer channels. (C) 2019 New

AB This paper explores the couponing strategies when a national brand
   competes with a store brand by discussing three different kinds of
   coupons: manufacturers' coupons, retailers' national brand coupons, and
   retailers' private label coupons. We show that the positioning of the
   private label product in terms of quality and feature differentiation
   from the national brand play an important role in determining the face
   value of the manufacturer's coupon and retailer's national brand coupon.
   In particular, a larger degree of feature differentiation drives the
   manufacturer to increase its coupon value, and the retailer responds by
   decreasing the value of its own coupon for the brand name product. In
   contrast, with an increase in private label quality, the couponing
   strategies taken by the manufacturer and the retailer depend on which
   segment of consumers is in the market for the private label product.
   Additionally, the retailer's private label coupon value is only impacted
   by the difference in consumers' willingness to pay but not by private
   label positioning. Empirical results on the effect of feature
   differentiation on national brand and private label coupon values are
   consistent with our theoretical predictions. (C) 2018 New York

AB As retailers are increasingly turning to museum and art gallery inspired
   techniques for displaying luxury products (museological display
   formats), we investigate whether such staging elicits more favorable
   product evaluations. Providing an extension to Hagtvedt and Patrick's
   (2008) classic art infusion effect, we propose that artistic essence is
   transferred to displayed merchandise via a second-order spillover
   effect, enhancing its perceived luxury to consumers. Across three
   experiments, the museological display format outperformed a more
   conventional, non-museological product display. Consumers reported
   higher purchase intentions, via a process whereby the merchandise was
   first perceived as being more luxurious and then less risk inducing.
   Explanations for why the museological display heightened perceptions of
   product luxury relating to service expectations, contamination, and
   visual appeal were also tested, but support for the extended art
   infusion effect remained undiminished. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published

AB The rapid development of augmented reality (AR) is reshaping retail
   frontline operations by enhancing the offline and online customer
   experience. Drawing on mental imagery theory, this paper develops a
   conceptual framework to reflect how AR emulates customer's cognitive
   processes offloading those to the technology. Consequently, the
   AR-enabled frontline improves decision comfort, motivates positive WOM
   and facilitates choice of higher value products. The underlying
   mechanism is a sequential mediation via improved processing fluency and
   decision comfort. The findings also demonstrate boundary conditions of
   customers' visual processing styles and product contextuality.
   Object-visualisers benefit more from AR induced imagery processes, and
   the effect of processing fluency on customer decision comfort is
   moderated by product contextuality. The results are verified with repeat
   studies to control for novelty of AR, and a field study that highlights
   the impact of AR on customers' choice and spending. We discuss
   implications for theory and practice of AR-enabled frontline retailing.

AB Extant marketing research holds that customers prefer frontline
   personnel to speak the customers' first language. Furthermore, current
   managerial practices instruct frontline employees to either use the
   customers' first language or, in international settings, to use English.
   Through five studies in different retail and service contexts, we
   identify situations where the opposite is true. The results of the first
   two studies suggest that if customers initiate contact in a second
   language, the frontline employee's switch to the customer's first
   language constitutes an identity threat leading customers to feel less
   satisfied; an effect we term the language backfire effect. Our third
   study extends these results to a domestic context to test for the impact
   of linguistic acculturation on how immigrant customers perceive
   frontline employees' language switch. The fourth study replicates the
   findings in a real-life retail context. These results present a paradox
   for marketing research: although frontline employees switch to
   customers' first language to accommodate them, these actions might not
   have the desired consequences. Having identified and described the
   problem of the language backfire effect, our final study introduces and
   verifies a managerially actionable solution: combining the language
   switch with a language proficiency compliment offsets the language
   backfire effect. (C) 2019 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB The organizational frontline in retail represents the frontline for an
   entire supply chain. This channel structure distances the branded
   supplier from the end consumer and makes the supplier dependent on a
   retail frontline salesperson that (1) it does not control and (2) also
   represents competing brands. This study reveals mechanisms that the
   supplier may use to influence retail frontline salespeople. We
   demonstrate the importance of consumer marketing programs and supplier
   representatives in building brand identification between the
   manufacturer's brand and the retail frontline employee that translates
   into increased brand sales, while also revealing the role of rewards
   programs in stimulating brand-specific extra role behaviors.
   Interestingly, retail frontline customer orientation, built by the
   retailer, diminishes the effect of brand extra-role behaviors toward the
   focal brand on the focal brand's sales, providing an informal control
   mechanism for retailers to protect its objectives. The results of this
   study have powerful ramifications for both retailers and suppliers in
   achieving both their mutual, and sometimes differing, objectives related
   to the retail frontline. (C) 2019 New York University. Published by

AB Despite the critical role that store managers play in linking top
   management teams and service/retail employees, as well as in fulfilling
   corporate strategy within chain store environments, service management
   research infrequently addresses the factors that may promote store
   managers' effective exchange relationships within the firm and
   subsequent effects on store operations and profitability. This study
   focuses on how store managers' performance orientation, trust of a
   regional manager's capabilities, and organizational commitment affect a
   manager's relationships relative to regional managers and frontline
   employees. The direct effect of store managers' relationship capacity on
   store performance is also examined. The results, based on survey data
   from managers of stores of a retail and service chain and company
   financial reports, generally support the suggested hypotheses.
   Specifically, a store manager's relationship with his/her supervisor has
   a strong influence on how the manager views the supervisor's leadership
   support and leadership style, which ultimately influence store
   performance (primary goods/service sales and store profits). (C) 2019

AB The proliferation of new touchpoints empowers today's customers to
   design their own journey from search to purchase. To address this new
   complexity, we segment customers by their use of specific touchpoints in
   the customer journey, investigate the association of several covariates
   with segment membership, consider the rise of mobile devices as
   potential "game changers" of existing segments, and explore how the
   relationships among product satisfaction, journey satisfaction, customer
   inspiration, and customer loyalty differ across segments. Based on
   anticipated utility theory and using latent class analyses on
   large-scale data from two samples of 2,443 and 2,649 journeys, we
   identify five time-consistent segments-store-focused shoppers, pragmatic
   online shoppers, extensive online shoppers, multiple touchpoint
   shoppers, and online-to-offline shoppers-that differ considerably in
   their touchpoint and mobile device usage, their segment-specific
   covariates, and their search and purchase patterns. The five segments
   remain unchanged in the two data sets even though the usage of mobile
   devices has increased substantially. Furthermore, we find that the
   relationships between various loyalty antecedents and customer loyalty
   differ between the segments. The insights from this paper help retailers
   develop segment-specific customer journey strategies. (C) 2019 Published

AB Global retailers often face an important decision about the extent to
   which they should standardize or adapt their retail banners, a choice
   that the authors refer to as retail banner standardization (RBS).
   Drawing on the international marketing and retailing literatures, this
   study investigates how RBS affects the performance of global retailers
   in a longitudinal sample of 69 global retailers from multiple countries
   and sectors, across ten years. Findings indicate that the role of banner
   standardization in the successful performance of global retailers
   depends on retailer and market-level characteristics. Specifically, the
   results demonstrate that RBS improves retailer profitability as
   retailers increase their global penetration and emphasize status-based
   differentiation. Findings also suggest that banner standardization has
   stronger effects on profitability as retailers increase their focus on
   emerging markets and e-commerce. However, the authors also find that
   while RBS increases profits at low levels of global diversity, this
   effect becomes non-significant as retailers expand to highly diverse

AB Mystery shopping (MS) is a widely used tool to monitor the quality of
   service and personal selling. In consultative retail settings,
   assessments of mystery shoppers are supposed to capture the most
   relevant aspects of salespeople's service and sales behavior. Given the
   important conclusions drawn by managers from MS results, the standard
   assumption seems to be that assessments of mystery shoppers are strongly
   related to customer satisfaction and sales performance. However,
   surprisingly scant empirical evidence supports this assumption. We test
   the relationship between MS assessments and customer evaluations and
   sales performance with large-scale data from three service retail
   chains. Surprisingly, we do not find a substantial correlation. The
   results show that mystery shoppers are not good proxies for real
   customers. While MS assessments are not related to sales, our findings
   confirm the established correlation between customer satisfaction
   measurements and sales results. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by

AB The current research compares sole-identity versus dualidentity
   consumers in their responses to different retail persuasion attempts
   that occur in situations with low versus high ulterior motives. We
   examine different consumer responses (e.g., interaction time, perceived
   friendliness, future interaction intentions, and actual purchase
   behavior). We find that dual-identity consumers (those individuals with
   sales experience who have both a consumer and agent identity available)
   tend to automatically activate their agent identity which makes them
   more likely to take the perspective of the sales agent as compared to
   sole-identity consumers (individuals without sales experience who only
   have a consumer identity available). Dual-identity consumers show
   greater sensitivity to ulterior motives as exhibited by more accurate
   responses when persuasion cues suggest that ulterior motives are low,
   but not high. In contrast, sole-identity consumers are insensitive to
   differing levels of ulterior motives. The current research further
   demonstrates that perspective-taking can mitigate sole-identity
   consumers' defensive reactions which can increase their responses to
   sales agents' persuasion attempts with low ulterior motives. (C) 2019

AB Although consumers often encounter brand extensions for the first time
   during a store visit, most research on brand extensions does not take
   into consideration how product display in retail environments might
   affect evaluation of a brand extension. We explore the effect of two
   distinct display formats on brand extension evaluations: by-brand
   display, where a brand extension is presented in the context of other
   products made by the same parent brand (e.g., Nike razors displayed with
   Nike sneakers, Nike sportswear, etc.), and by-category display, where a
   brand extension is presented in the context of competing brands within
   the extension category (e.g., Nike razors displayed with Philips razors,
   Gillette razors, etc.). Three studies demonstrate that low fit
   extensions of high quality brands are evaluated more favorably when
   displayed by-category than by-brand, whereas high fit extensions of low
   quality brands are evaluated more favorably when displayed by-brand than
   by-category. In support of the proposed underlying mechanism, we show
   that display format influences consumers' evaluations of brand
   extensions by changing the weight of importance given to parent brand
   quality and brand-extension fit information. Finally, we demonstrate
   that display format not only influences evaluation of the extension, but
   also has downstream consequences for the consumption experience with the
   extension. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of New York

AB Many online retailers use seemingly innocuous visual boundaries when
   presenting choice sets to consumers. In contrast to previously studied
   aspects of information presentation, visual boundaries do not alter
   underlying information structure. The authors argue that, beyond their
   aesthetic role, visual boundaries can systematically increase or
   decrease perceived choice variety but the impact of visual boundaries on
   variety perceptions depends on consumer cognitive load. Study 1 finds
   that, by-attribute (vs. alternative) boundaries increase (decrease)
   perceived variety under high but not low cognitive load. Study 2 further
   demonstrates that retailer intent moderates the interaction between
   visual boundaries and cognitive load such that, when cognitive load is
   high, effects of visual boundaries on perceived variety are strengthened
   when consumers believe that retailers use boundaries to aid consumer
   navigation but reversed when they believe retailers use boundaries to
   persuade consumers to make purchases. Finally, Study 3 rules out
   attribute order and number of attribute levels as alternative accounts
   for the effect and enhances generalizability through a different
   manipulation of cognitive load. This work advances understanding of how
   simple environmental cues affect consumer behavior, with implications
   for retail strategy. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of New York

AB Some retailers offer price match guarantees, whereas others offer
   guarantees making the same promise but labeling these low-price
   guarantees. Do consumers respond differently to these different price
   guarantee labels? To address this research question, this paper
   leverages insights from pricing, signaling, and regulatory focus
   theories to demonstrate - across multiple studies - that consumers
   perceive price match versus low price guarantees differently. In turn,
   contingent on consumers' regulatory focus, this difference in
   perceptions feeds forward and influences consumers' purchase intentions
   and post purchase (e.g., repurchase) intentions. This paper contributes
   to theory, not only by showing differences across price match versus low
   price guarantees, but also by being the first to jointly examine
   purchase and post purchase intentions relating to price guarantees. This
   paper also speaks to practice, noting contingencies that determine
   whether the price match or the low-price guarantee label should be used.

AB Sensory elements are an important aspect of both offline and online
   retail stores and can non-consciously influence consumer judgments and
   purchase behavior. In offline settings, ambient factors like scent,
   lighting, and music have been shown to influence customers' shopping
   experiences and their buying behaviors. For online retail outlets,
   sensory factors related to color, display patterns, and layouts can have
   significant effects on consumer behavior. Sensory elements have strong
   managerial relevance since they can non-consciously influence behaviors
   and because they are relatively easy to change; for example, it requires
   minimal effort to change the lighting or the music at a physical retail
   store or the display pattern for an online store. The eight papers in
   this special issue address theoretical and practical issues related to
   how different sensory elements can strongly influence retail practices.
   These papers focus on underexplored topic areas and also on emerging
   technologies, which stimulate thoughts for further research in these

   four experiments, that retail-store deals which communicate stronger

   item free"), thereby impacting consumer evaluations. We use literature
   on imagery, sensory perception, and information processing, specifically
   relational and item-specific processing, to build our hypotheses. We
   also provide evidence for how working memory capacity limitations

AB Retail spaces contain copious sensory information that can affect
   consumers' shopping behavior. This research investigates a novel, yet
   ubiquitous, retail atmospheric variable: airflow direction. We examine
   how the sensory experience of frontal (vs. dorsal) airflow energizes
   consumers in retail spaces and influences creative engagement. Five
   studies demonstrate that frontal airflow (air blowing on the front of
   the body) boosts energetic activation and fuels enhanced performance on
   creative tasks, compared to dorsal airflow (air blowing on the back of
   the body). Study 1 establishes the link between frontal (vs. dorsal)
   airflow and energetic activation in a laboratory setting. Study 2 tests
   the full model in a laboratory setting to provide initial evidence that
   frontal (vs. dorsal) airflow enhances creativity and that energetic
   activation drives this effect. Using a visualization task and an online
   setting, study 3 conceptually replicates airflow direction's effect on
   creativity and the mediating role of energetic activation, while study 4
   shows evidence of the mediating role of energetic activation via a
   moderation design. Study 5, an outdoor field study, provides further
   support for the predicted relationship between airflow direction and
   creative engagement. The theoretical and practical implications of these
   findings for retailing are also discussed. Published by Elsevier Inc. on

AB Haptic softness is a central product attribute for many fabric-related
   retailers. Can those retailers use music-an easy to implement in-store
   atmospheric cue-to influence consumers' perception of this central
   product attribute? Across four studies, this research shows that high
   (vs. low) music softness enhances consumers' haptic softness
   perceptions. We argue that this cross-modal effect occurs owing to a
   transfer of softness-related associations from the auditory to the
   haptic modality. To better inform retail practice, we examine three
   managerially relevant boundary conditions at the product and store
   levels. Specifically, high music softness increases haptic softness
   perceptions when (a) the product's haptic quality allows for the
   sufficient detection of softness, (b) hard flooring is present in the
   retail environment, and (c) consumers are unaware of music's influence.
   In terms of practically relevant consequences, we find that enhanced
   haptic softness perceptions ultimately result in more positive product
   evaluations like willingness to pay. (C) 2019 New York University.

AB This research investigates situations in which frontline employees
   deliberately restrict customers' access to touch products on display
   (active interpersonal haptic blocking), and how this understudied form
   of sensory blocking may increase customers' downstream purchasing. While
   previous research examines the benefits of increased product touch, we
   temporarily block touch for specific products in display areas and then
   investigate the subsequent impact on customer behavior. Through four
   studies, including a retail field experiment, we find that when an
   employee asks a customer not to touch a product on display, this
   initiates a serial mediation process which: (1) engenders feelings of
   psychological reactance that result in (2) increased compensatory
   touching of subsequently encountered products to counterbalance a loss
   of sensory freedom, and (3) increased spending and purchasing once the
   customer leaves the reactance-inducing encounter. Effects are moderated
   by socioeconomic status (SES) and need for touch (NFT) whereby
   psychological reactance was significantly stronger for high SES
   customers with a moderate or high NFT when actively blocked. Results
   also demonstrate that active interpersonal haptic blocking does not
   result in more negative attitudes toward retailers, thus retailers might
   consider implementing this counterintuitive practice to encourage
   downstream sales. (C) 2019 New York University. Published by Elsevier

AB Mental intangibility during product evaluation remains one of the

   theory, this article proposes a conceptual framework to assess how
   sensory control and feedback modalities affect consumer value judgements
   by reducing mental intangibility. We show how touch control, compared to
   voice control, positively affects consumers' willingness-to-pay. The
   underlying mechanism is a sequential process of reduced mental
   intangibility and increased feeling of decision comfort. In addition, we
   highlight a positive moderating effect of congruent auditory feedback on
   decision comfort. We also demonstrate a novel consumer boundary
   condition. Consumers high in assessment orientation experience a
   stronger reduction in mental intangibility. The results are consistently
   replicated across three experiments implying theoretical and managerial
   contributions for m-AR in the context of online retailing. (C) 2019 New

   for consumers who apply self-control in their food consumption (high
   self-control consumers) touching food directly with hands enhances the
   sensory experience and increases hedonic evaluations of the food.
   Importantly, direct touch increases the consumption volume for high
   self-control consumers. These findings contribute to understanding of
   how touch as a proximal sensory factor affects food evaluation and
   consumption, and thus offer retailing implications in the context of

AB Visual elements of packaging design serve as a powerful, cost-efficient
   tool for manufacturers and retailers alike to communicate sensory
   features of the product to consumers and influence their consumption
   behaviors. Based on studies of packaging design, cross-modal
   correspondences, and food science, this research establishes a
   "packaging visual-gustatory correspondence effect" whereby the image of
   a food product placed at the bottom (vs. top) of the package facade
   enhances consumers' expectations (Study 1A) and actual perceptions
   (Study 1B) of the food's flavor heaviness. Further, this effect carries
   over to help consumers make healthier eating decisions such as eating
   less of the food (Study 2) and subsequently choosing a healthier snack
   (Study 3). This research also shows that the packaging visual-gustatory
   correspondence effect is moderated by consumers' processing style such
   that those who engage in holistic (vs. analytic) processing are more
   affected by the location of the food image on the package facade (Study
   4). Our theoretically novel findings are also conducive to addressing
   the self-control dilemma: The location of the food image on the package
   facade can serve to increase flavor perception but decrease consumption
   quantity. (C) 2019 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Technologies are becoming increasingly autonomous, able to make
   decisions and complete tasks on behalf of consumers. Virtual assistants
   already take care of grocery shopping by replenishing used up
   ingredients while cooking machines prepare these ingredients and
   implement recipes. In the future, consumers will be able to delegate
   substantial parts of the shopping process to autonomous shopping
   systems. Where as the functional benefits of these systems are evident,
   they challenge psychological consumption motives and ingrained
   human-machine relationships due to the delegation of decisions and tasks
   to technology. The authors take a cross-disciplinary approach drawing
   from research in marketing, psychology, and human-computer interaction
   to examine barriers to adoption of autonomous shopping systems. They
   identify different types of psychological and cultural barriers, and
   suggest ways to craft the online and bricks-and-mortar retail
   environment to overcome these barriers along the consumer journey. The
   article finishes with implications for policy makers and a future
   research agenda for researchers examining autonomous technologies. (C)

AB At each stage in customers' journeys, they encounter different types of
   numeric information that they process using different judgment
   strategies. Relevant numbers might include budgets, price, product
   attributes, product counts, product ratings, numbers in brand names,
   health and nutrition information, financial information, time-related
   information, and others. This manuscript provides a review of the vast
   array of numerical information presented to consumers at different
   stages of the customer journey. It also identifies several different
   types of judgment strategies that consumers use to evaluate numeric
   information. It includes a discussion of how consumers use these
   judgment strategies during the pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase
   stages of the customer journey, highlighting unanswered questions that
   identify new research opportunities. Implications for practice and

AB Consumer journeys offers a powerful metaphor that has inspired diverse
   strategic frameworks to aid retailers in managing and designing customer
   experiences. Absent from existing frameworks, however, is a clear
   understanding of the journeys consumers perform as a collective that is
   bound by a shared identity and communal goals. Yet, whether taking
   vacations, going out to dinner, facing a health crisis, or setting up a
   household, much of consumers' lives are spent journeying together. With
   families as our focal collective, we adopt a social practice theory lens
   and integrate prior consumer research related to collective practice
   dynamics (identity goal interplay, connectedness, and corporeality) to
   articulate what retailers should consider when designing collective
   journeys. Using this theoretical foundation, we build a conceptual
   framework that identifies three roles retailers play in collective
   journeys: central, mediated, and dispersed. We differentiate each role
   by the core value retailers provide to consumer practices as well as the
   collective dynamic challenges implicated. Our framework highlights the
   need for retailers to structure their offerings to match the dynamics of
   families' collective journeys. To explore this matching process more
   fully, we introduce the idea of 'fields of alignment' as the social
   spaces where retailers and consumers actively negotiate, improvise, and
   experiment to align around common frames for action. We use the concept
   of fields of alignment to generate implications for retailers, propose
   guidelines for managerial action, and present avenues for futurere
   search. (C) 2019 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB The consumer journey metaphor emphasizes the steps that individuals take
   in their path toward relationships with brands or satisfying shopping
   experiences. However, in many non-Western cultures, these steps are less
   likely to be shaped by individual preferences and priorities. Instead,
   they emerge from a collectivistic motivation to adapt to prevailing
   norms and others' expectations, and are shaped by a holistic thinking
   style that emphasizes context and relationships. As a result, the
   meaning of each step in the consumer journey is likely to be normatively
   infused and contextually embedded. This paper will review research
   showing cross-cultural differences in responses to prices, ads, store
   displays, retailer reputations, coupons, and other characteristics
   important to the retail context. Our focus is on contrasting the
   consumer journey in individualistic contexts versus collectivistic ones,
   but we also address emerging findings on other key cultural differences,
   such as power distance belief. Taken together, these findings suggest
   that the patterns and drivers of consumers' pre-purchase activities,
   purchase decisions, and post-purchase commitment may differ
   significantly across cultures. In describing these culturally distinct
   processes, we illustrate how a deep consideration of cultural
   differences can enhance our understanding of the consumer journey.

AB Technological advances, originating in the time of the industrial
   revolution and accelerating today, have alienated workers from
   consumers, and vice versa. We argue that this alienation and
   accompanying feelings of being objectified as a mere interchangeable
   source of profit are aversive to workers and consumers. These feelings
   reduce the meaningfulness and satisfaction workers find in their work
   and make products less attractive and consumption less meaningful to
   consumers. We propose simple and inexpensive interventions that can be
   used to make business more personal, with powerful effects on workers'
   job satisfaction, product quality, and product attractiveness to
   consumers. Paradoxically, these interventions often rely on the same
   technological advances that otherwise facilitate the alienation. We
   specifically highlight how disclosing personal information (e.g., name,
   personal background) about workers and consumers can impact the
   motivation and performance of workers. We also highlight how disclosing
   personal information about workers and consumers can impact consumers'
   satisfaction, preferences, and willingness-to-pay. We argue hat
   providing personal information about workers to consumers and vice versa
   will often yield a win-win-win effect. As more satisfied customers buy
   more at higher prices, more satisfied workers do a better job, and
   personal information can be disclosed cheaply using information
   technology, companies benefit from increased sales at higher prices and
   at very little extra cost. (C) 2020 New York University. Published by

AB The present research investigates how differences in payment mechanisms,

   pricing behavior. Extant finance literature predicts that cash payments
   prompt price discounts, yet the present research demonstrates that
   compared with e-payments, cash payments facilitate mental imagery
   processes, which increase people's desire for money and induce higher
   sales prices. In a series of five experiments, we establish a basic
   effect of payment mechanisms on pricing (Studies 1a and 1b), then
   provide evidence that mental imagery and desire for money underlie the
   effects (Studies 2 and 3). Yet these effects emerge only when consumers
   focus cognitively on the prospective financial gain, not when they focus
   on the forgone object (Study 4). We in turn offers both theoretical
   insights and managerial implications. (C) 2019 New York University.

AB In recent years, criticism of online marketplaces has been incessant
   because of the widespread presence of counterfeit goods. This study
   develops an analytical framework to investigate the interactions among
   an online marketplace, an authentic brand seller, and a counterfeiter of
   the brand. Both sellers exert efforts to attract sales for the brand,
   and the online platform determines its effort level in combating
   counterfeiters. Our analysis reveals several interesting insights.
   First, our analysis shows that the platform's combating effort has a
   non-monotonic impact on both sellers' profits. Second, the platform's
   optimal combating effort level relies on the production cost of the
   authentic firm. The platform finds it optimal to exert maximum possible
   effort to combat counterfeiters when the unit cost of the authentic
   product is very low, and not to combat when the unit cost is very high.
   Third, interestingly, the authentic seller can be better off with a
   higher production cost due to the strategic reaction of the platform
   whose revenue derives from both types of sellers. The intuition and
   managerial implications of these insights are discussed. (C) 2019 New

AB To distribute their products, luxury managers are dependent on single-
   and multi-brand stores; each of them generating approximately half of
   luxury personal goods revenues. However, both types of stores have
   specificities that require customized marketing strategies. The purpose
   of this research is to explore what differentiates single-brand from
   multi-brand settings. More specifically, we compare consumer
   decision-making processes in each type of store. We show that
   multi-brand stores offer less hedonic shopping experiences than
   single-brand stores, which raises consumers' desire to engage in
   exhaustive brand comparisons when purchasing luxury items. We find that
   activating hedonic goals reduces brand comparisons in multi-brand (but
   not in single-brand) settings. The effect of hedonic goals on brand
   comparisons is mediated by consumers' thinking style and moderated by
   the salience of consumers' status goals. These insights have important
   implications for luxury marketing managers when crafting differentiated
   strategies for single- and multi-brand environments. (C) 2019 New York

AB How does market power affect consumer perceptions and purchase behavior?
   In the theoretically and pragmatically important context of price
   increases, we theorize that (i) consumer price fairness perceptions
   decline with market power when a price increase is due to costs; and
   (ii) this fairness difference arises due to greater perceptions of
   controllability and, in turn, exploitation by firms with higher market
   power. Consistent with our theorizing, we further argue that market
   power does not affect fairness (iii) when prices rise due to demand
   (which is perceived as equally exploitative and unfair regardless of
   firm power) or (iv) when price increases are clearly beyond the firm's
   control (and perceived as equally fair for firms with high and low
   market power). We provide empirical support for these predictions in a
   series of behavioral experiments combined with an analysis of retail
   scanner data. Together, our findings shed light on how market power and
   pricing actions jointly drive consumer perceptions of unfairness, with
   implications for firms' pricing strategies, competition in the retail
   marketplace, and the principle of dual entitlement as a community
   standard of fairness in pricing. (C) 2019 New York University. Published

AB Building on the persuasion knowledge model, the present research
   suggests that price discounts have divergent effects on consumer
   response to fairtrade products depending on the level of personal
   relevance to fairtrade (i.e., cause involvement). More- (vs. less-)
   involved consumers are engaged in more effortful processing of
   information to evaluate fairtrade products. For this reason, in response
   to a price discount, more-involved consumers access persuasion knowledge
   that entails suspicion of the brand's ulterior motive for offering the
   discount and its fairtrade claim. Thus, they are likely to perceive the
   brand as less credible and show decreased purchase intention and brand
   attitude. Conversely, less-involved consumers are likely to infer the
   brand's persuasion motive by trusting the brand and believing its claim.
   By accessing persuasion knowledge that involves trust and belief,
   less-involved consumers perceive the brand as more credible, exhibiting
   a favorable response to fairtrade products on price promotion. The
   present research also discusses how to mitigate the negative effects of
   price discounts for more-involved consumers: When a justifiable reason
   for a promotion is provided, the negative effect of the price discount
   disappears among more-involved consumers. (C) 2019 New York University.

AB The present research investigates how purchase motives (hedonic vs.
   utilitarian) influence the effectiveness of partitioned versus combined
   pricing. Across four studies, we find that compared to combined pricing,
   partitioned pricing increases hedonic purchases, but not utilitarian
   purchases. We find this happens because consumers considering a hedonic
   purchase tend to feel anticipated guilt associated with their hedonic
   spending, and partitioned pricing is used as a guilt-mitigating
   justification for the spending. Specifically, consumers with a hedonic
   purchase motive underprocess a surcharge, which enables them to perceive
   the price of the product as lower than the actual, combined price. This
   lower price perception helps consumers justify their hedonic purchase as
   an act of saving money, and as a result, alleviates guilt. These effects
   are magnified among consumers who have high disposition to feel
   consumption guilt. When a price discount is offered, it attenuates the
   effectiveness of partitioned pricing because the price discount serves
   as a more effective justification by offering actual saving, not just
   the perception of saving. Our findings contribute to the pricing
   literature by uncovering a motivational factor influencing the
   effectiveness of partitioned (vs. combined) pricing, and offer a useful
   pricing guideline to product managers based on the product-pricing fit
   revealed in our research. (C) 2019 New York University. Published by

AB Ten studies examine package shape as a cue for brand status
   categorization. The authors show that products in tall, slender packages
   are more likely to be categorized as high-end products (high brand
   status) than those in short, wide packages (low brand status; studies 1
   a&b). This effect is driven by a Shape-SES lay theory (a person's body
   shape is associated with his or her socioeconomic status) that consumers
   apply to categorize products as high versus low in brand status (studies
   2a c), and this application process occurs spontaneously (studies 3a b).
   The authors showcase the retailing implications of this work in two
   contexts when consumers get free-sample products (study 4a) and when
   they engage in conspicuous consumption (study 4b). The theoretical
   contributions, retailing implications, and directions for future
   research are discussed. (C) 2019 New York University. Published by

AB Retailers seek effective ways to communicate promotions to increase
   store traffic and drive purchases. We propose that right-slanted fonts
   which imply forward movement in their design may influence how consumers
   perceive and respond to advertised promotional events. Five controlled
   experiments demonstrate that promotions advertised with right-slanted
   fonts can increase consumers' retailer visit and purchase intentions. A
   field experiment demonstrates that right-slanted fonts can increase
   consumers' click through rate in email promotions. Right-slanted fonts
   are found to evoke dynamic mental imagery of the promotion moving
   forward in time and ending soon. Right-slanted fonts are shown to
   disproportionally influence the behavioral intentions of deal prone
   consumers who are more likely to experience anticipated inaction regret
   related to missing an advertised promotional offer. Relatedly,
   right-slanted fonts only appear to influence consumer behavioral
   intentions in the context of advertisements containing a promotional
   offer. (C) 2019 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB The world of retailing is changing rapidly, and much of that change has
   been enabled by customer-interfacing retail technologies. This
   commentary offers a framework for classifying technologies, based on
   their primary influence on a customer's purchase journey - in the
   pre-purchase stage, needs management and search engagement technologies;
   in purchase stage, purchase transaction and physical acquisition
   technologies; and in the post-purchase stage, follow-up service and
   loyalty management technologies. We then discuss and classify forty
   recent retail technologies according to this framework. Finally, we
   identify areas that offer great potential for further research on retail
   technology. (C) 2020 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Today's retail promotional environment is driven by channel
   proliferation, customer channel preferences, and managers' efforts to
   create a unified "omnichannel" customer experience. This paper
   identifies the omnichannel deal prone segments that emerge in this
   environment, that is, segments that employ multiple channels to procure
   and use promotions. We describe these segments, measure the motivations,
   opportunities, and abilities (MOA) associated with segment membership,
   and quantify how these segments respond differently to promotions. We
   apply latent class cluster analysis to a database of over 1,000
   respondents in three product categories. We find a rich array of
   omnichannel deal prone segments. Interestingly, 82% of consumers have
   bifurcated into online- or offline-focused deal prone segments. That is,
   most consumers use multiple channels to procure and use promotions, but
   they focus on either online or offline channels. Only seventeen percent
   of consumers strongly utilize both online and offline channels. We find
   that opportunity factors such as access to physical stores, and ability
   factors such as online shopping experience, explain this finding. We
   discuss how our results enable managers to target the right promotion
   designs to the right customers through the appropriate channels. (C)

AB Many online retailers, such as Amazon, use automated product recommender
   systems to encourage customer loyalty and cross-sell products. Despite
   significant improvements to the predictive accuracy of contemporary
   recommender system algorithms, they remain prone to errors. Erroneous
   recommendations pose potential threats to online retailers in
   particular, because they diminish customers' trust in, acceptance of,
   satisfaction with, and loyalty to a recommender system. Explanations of
   the reasoning that lead to recommendations might mitigate these negative
   effects. That is, a recommendation algorithm ideally would provide both
   accurate recommendations and explanations of the reasoning for those
   recommendations. This article proposes a novel method to balance these
   concurrent objectives. The application of this method, using a
   combination of content-based and collaborative filtering, to two
   real-world data sets with more than 100 million product ratings reveals
   that the proposed method outperforms established recommender approaches
   in terms of predictive accuracy (more than five percent better than the
   Netflix Prize winner algorithm according to normalized root mean squared
   error) and its ability to provide actionable explanations, which is also
   an ethical requirement of artificial intelligence systems. (C) 2020 New
