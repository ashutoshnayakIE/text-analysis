TI Looking in through outdoor: a socio-cultural and historical perspective
   on the evolution of advertising humour
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines the evolving acceptance and use of humour in advertising over the past century. Sociologists point to humour as an expression of the macro-societal mood. Consistent with this thesis, we analyse two data sets of outdoor advertisements that span over 100 years. We use a socio-cultural and historical perspective to understand the underlying drivers and changes in humour use at both the macro-cultural level and at the micro-industry level in the US. The results reveal the contextual interplay that led to changes in the acceptance of humorous advertisements as well as the evolution of humour styles and elements.

TI Effects of underdog (vs. top dog) positioning advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The study investigates individual differences in attitudes towards brands being positioned as underdogs in advertising from an emotional perspective. We argue that the personality trait of empathic concern moderates the underdog effect on brand attitude and that the moderating effect is mediated by empathic response to the advertisement. We conducted three experiments with ads using top-dog and underdog appeals. Those who have stronger empathic concern showed more favourable attitudes towards the brand advertised through underdog positioning, and the effect of empathic concern was mediated by the empathic response to the underdog positioning advertisement. For managers, targeting consumers who have high levels of empathic concern could result in more favourable attitudes towards underdog businesses when using underdog appeals.

TI Making ads less complex, yet more creative and persuasive: the effects
   of conventional metaphors and irony in print advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Rhetorical tropes like metaphors and irony are widely used in print advertising. Current advertising literature assumes that these different tropes (metaphor, irony) are persuasive when they are sufficiently novel and complex to increase advertising elaboration. However, we propose that, in some cases, tropes can also be persuasive when they present conventional and concrete images of abstract product qualities. To test if conventionality can explain the persuasiveness of various tropes (metaphor, irony), we conducted a 2 (conventional metaphor vs. no metaphor) x 2 (conventional irony vs. no irony) multiple-message experiment. Results demonstrate that conventional metaphors are persuasive by reducing complexity and increasing creativity and ad appreciation. Conventional irony, in contrast, has little effect on persuasiveness. Thus, differentiating between various tropes (metaphor, irony) is important in predicting persuasion effects: advertisers should refrain from using conventional irony, but including conventional metaphors about abstract product qualities in print advertising is advisable.

TI Fear advertisements: influencing consumers to make better health
   decisions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB From a goal-theoretic framework, this paper proposes that fear-based framing of health messages can lead to positive decision intentions, thus helping consumers make better future health-related choices. Across two experiments, findings demonstrate that the type of advertisement (fear versus hope) and food prime (indulgent versus non-indulgent) interact to determine goal-related choice focus - such as subsequent indulgence intention or intention to implement an exercise health goal. Research implications include the suggestion that if marketers properly execute fear-primed promotional messages with non-indulgent food offerings, they can satisfy the notion that 'One good health decision can lead to another.'

TI Trends in the use of statistics in major advertising journals over four
   decades
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The use of statistical techniques in data-based articles appearing in the International Journal of Advertising, Journal of Advertising, Journal of Advertising Research and Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising was analysed over four decade intervals (i. e., 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s) and by journal. Among the trends, the study found: (1) nearly seven of every 10 journal articles reported statistical analyses (68.8% or 541 of 786); (2) the trend for statistically based articles was remarkably consistent over the time intervals and held true for the different advertising journals with one exception; (3) the use of different statistical techniques changed over time, with statistical techniques becoming more diverse and sophisticated through the years, but more so in some advertising journals than in others; (4) statistics were correctly applied in the majority of the research reports relative to 'study purpose'; (5) the use of different statistical techniques varied by method of data collection generally and within articles appearing in three of the four journals; and (6) the presence or absence of hypotheses and/or research questions in the advertising studies was differentially associated with the application of different statistics. The inquiry serves to move advertising research forward in two ways: first, it documents how statistical analyses have changed over time and, second, it provides insight into where the field might be headed regarding the use of statistical techniques.

TI It's no longer mine: the role of brand ownership and advertising in
   cross-border brand acquisitions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Although cross-border brand acquisitions are increasingly common in the global marketplace, research on how consumers respond to them is limited. Building on social identity and psychological ownership theories, we introduce the concept of brand ownership to the advertising literature, and show its negative effects on consumer reactions to a brand acquisition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that consumers' disidentification (i.e., an oppositional motivation) with an acquiring country moderates the negative effect of consumers' brand ownership on consumer attitudes after a brand acquisition. The results reveal that consumers with high levels of brand ownership develop more negative post-acquisition brand attitudes when a brand is acquired by a country with which consumers strongly disidentify (i.e. dissociative vs. out-group). Furthermore, our research introduces the concept of a brand ownership appeal in advertising, and demonstrates that it is an effective advertising strategy in enhancing post-acquisition brand attitudes for consumers with high levels of brand ownership. Important theoretical and managerial advertising implications conclude this research.

TI How audience and disclosure characteristics influence memory of
   sponsorship disclosures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The proliferation of sponsored content (e.g., product placement) in television programmes has been a cause of concern as it may violate the right of consumers to know that a message is sponsored. Therefore, new regulations obligate broadcasters to disclose sponsored content. To achieve its goal of informing the consumer, a sponsorship disclosure must be effectively communicated. This study explores how audience and disclosure characteristics influence memory of sponsorship disclosures. Results show that a disclosure at the beginning of a programme results in less disclosure memory compared to a disclosure in the middle or at the end of a programme. The duration of the disclosure does not directly influence disclosure memory, but a disclosure is best remembered when it is displayed longer and viewers are familiar with the programme. Additionally, viewers' programme and disclosure familiarity increase the chance that a disclosure is remembered, while programme involvement decreases disclosure memory. These results contribute to advertising theory and may be useful in the development of effective sponsorship disclosures, as they indicate several conditions under which disclosures are more likely to be remembered.

TI Hope across the seas: the role of emotions and risk propensity in
   medical tourism advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Rising US medical costs as well as more competition in the health care industry have led many Americans to pursue health care in foreign destinations. As a result, leading countries in medical tourism have begun launching international advertising campaigns. A growing trend in much of this advertising is the use of emotional appeals. The purpose of this research is to examine whether the use of emotional appeals by non-domestic health care providers contributes to more favourable evaluations of the target health care provider than rational appeals. Specifically, two experimental studies investigate the efficacy of advertisements that induce the emotion of hope to determine whether these advertisements increase trust perceptions and reduce perceived risk, given an individual's level of risk propensity. Implications for public policy makers and marketing managers who work in health care are discussed.

TI Beer, wine, or spirits? Advertising's impact on four decades of category
   sales
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This article provides an analysis of the relationship between annual advertising expenditures and sales, using a time series regression procedure, for beer, wine, and liquor sold in the United States from 1971 to 2012. Information from these four decades provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationships of numerous variables with aggregate alcohol category sales. Even though per capita alcohol consumption has not changed much throughout this period, alcohol advertising media expenditures for all alcohol beverages have increased almost 400% since 1971. This study has provided evidence of consumption changes across categories of alcohol beverages over the past 40-plus years with the preponderance of those changes significantly correlated to fluctuations in demography, taxation and income levels - not advertising. Despite other macro-level studies with consistent findings, the perception that advertising increases consumption exists. The findings here indicate that there is either no relationship or a weak one between advertising and aggregate category sales. Therefore, advertising restrictions or bans with the purpose of reducing consumption may not have the desired effect. Implications on policy decisions regarding advertising controls are addressed.

   sponsorship in social-media impacts brand consumer's congruity and
   relationship quality
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines the effects of brand's sports sponsorship in social media on brand consumer's congruity and brand relationship quality. The study included a survey of targeting consumers whose ages range between early twenties and late forties; data from 322 respondents were collected. The results are as follows. First, brand's sports sponsorship in social-media activities relating to sports brands has significant effects on brand consumer's congruity. Second, this congruity significantly influences brand relationship quality. Third, male consumers, who have previously purchased products and services associated with a sports brand, perceive the sponsor's brand image more positively when they are exposed to the sponsor's brand's sports sponsorship in social-media activities, compared to those consumers having no previous purchases of the sponsored brand. Lastly, consumers in their forties with prior experience consuming the sponsor's brand products are most affected by the level of self-congruity with the sports brand compared to younger or older consumers.

TI Discovering prominent themes in integrated marketing communication
   research from 1991 to 2012: a co-word analytic approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper analyses integrated marketing communications (IMC) research from its inception in 1991, up to 2012 (included). A bibliometric approach has been applied for the first time to detect and visualize conceptual sub-domains and identify the most salient themes within IMC research via combining co-word analysis and science mapping. The quantitative analysis of a corpus of IMC manuscripts contributes to complement the previous qualitative reviews by using the Wakita and Tsurumi agglomeration algorithm and two-dimensional graphs. The results enable the authors to provide a structure for the conceptual sub-domains, classification of the themes showing internal associations into four groups, and identification of the main research trends. This paper seeks to respond to the calls for greater theoretical clarification of the IMC discipline providing a snapshot of the thematic evolution of IMC research over time enabling researchers to better understand the current state of the art and suggesting future research directions.

TI Standardization vs. adaptation: consumer reaction to TV ads containing
   subtitled or English dubbed ads
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The aim of this study is to gain a better insight into the effect of using linguistically standardized (in English) TV adverts as opposed to two types of linguistically adapted commercials (dubbed in the local language or subtitled in the local language) on attitude-towards-the-ad and attitude-towards-the-brand. We ran a between-subjects experiment in three countries (Italy, Germany, and Spain) with three different versions of commercials (English only, dubbed in the local language, and subtitled in the local language) and assessed the effect of three different versions of the ads on attitude-towards-the-ad and on attitude-towards-the-brand. Results indicate that English-only adverts were less preferred than the alternatives and led to lower brand attitudes as well. This result was consistent for three advertised products (mobile phone, canned drink, and automobile) and replicated in all three countries, showing that this effect is robust.

TI Good guy vs. bad guy: the influence of parasocial interactions with
   media characters on brand placement effects
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Although brand placements are frequently associated with media characters within movies or TV series, and viewers are well known to relate to such characters, previous research has scarcely dealt with media characters' influence on brand placement effects. Addressing this, two studies investigate the influence of parasocial interactions with media characters on perceptions of brands related to media characters. The first study applied a 1 x 2 between-subjects design, assuming that positively represented characters elicit greater parasocial interaction and, subsequently, more favourable brand attitudes compared with negatively represented characters. The results confirm the assumed indirect effect. A second study was able to replicate the first study's findings in a different setting and to introduce brand familiarity as an important moderator of the mediation found in the first and second study (moderated mediation). The underlying mechanism and implications are discussed.

TI Dissociating explicit and implicit effects of cross-media advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Knowledge of cross-media advertising effects is mainly based on explicit psychological measures, such as self-reports. To fully understand the mechanisms responsible for the success of cross-media advertising, it is important to also use implicit measures. We used both types of measures to assess whether exposure to different media combinations affects the cognitive and evaluative impact of advertising. Results show that participants performed better on all explicit and implicit measures of memory and brand preference after exposure (versus no exposure) to target ads, which validated the use of these measures. Comparison of cross-media versus single medium exposure showed differences on the explicit level, but not on the implicit level. This suggests (1) that cross-media advantages may be driven by explicit rather than implicit memory mechanisms, and (2) that implicit advertising effects may require more drastic manipulations than context changes, such as varying the combination of media used for exposure to advertising.

TI Factors to consider in improving prescription drug pharmacy leaflets
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Today, when consumers receive prescription drug pharmacy leaflets (also known as consumer medication information' or CMI), they often appear in small font size, with cluttered layouts, and distracting information. This problem has attracted the attention of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in advocating for more comprehendible, accurate, and easy-to-access CMI formats. Our study of four different CMI prototypes shows that an expanded Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Facts prototype is the best for improving comprehension accuracy, and is especially effective for those with lower health literacy and health motivation. A simpler OTC prototype did not aid accuracy scores due in part to its lack of complexity; whereas the most complex prototype (the revised medication guide - similar to most CMI today) reduced leaflet likability and usage intentions. Finally, continued leaflet availability improved accuracy scores for lower health literacy and health motivation respondents. Implications for marketing and public health policy are offered.

TI Brand popularity as an advertising cue affecting consumer evaluation on
   sustainable brands: a comparison study of Korea, China, and Russia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines how brand popularity in conjunction with consumers' varied styles of decision-making, as well as other consumer characteristics, can influence the overall evaluation of a sustainable brand. The results of our empirical analysis show that the effect of brand popularity varies widely according to which countries one considers. Here we examined Korea, China, and Russia, and found in each country that popularity significantly influenced consumers' evaluations of sustainable brands, yet in very different aspects. In Korea, when the brand popularity cue was presented, a significant positive influence on consumer evaluation resulted. However, China showed a significant negative influence, while Russia showed neutral, insignificant results. In addition, we found also that both a brand's fashion leadership and its connection with sustainable, conscientious causes can work as moderators. Finally, we found that consumer decision-making style varies not only according to fashion leadership and sustainability involvement, but that each country had a different opinion on sustainability in general. Thus, several important implications for international marketing are here presented.

TI Incivility in political advertisements: a look at the 2012 US
   presidential election
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The 2012 presidential election reached new heights in dollars spent and the rancorous nature of advertisements emanating from candidates and other interested parties. While going negative' has become a well-known tactic in political campaigns, several observers believe that the level of acrimony crossed the line between civil discourse essential to democratic societies and uncivil haranguing that has little to do with election issues. To explore the nuances of this topic, we open with a discussion of limited cross-disciplinary research on incivility in political discourse so that its essential nature is exposed, differentiating it from more common uses of negativity. Our empirical work examined about 350 television advertisements that were shown between the presidential debates of 2012 and the November elections. Levels of civility and incivility are noted and implications for the future of political advertising are provided.

TI Doing good matters to consumers: the effectiveness of humane-oriented
   CSR appeals in cross-cultural standardized advertising campaigns
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This investigation contributes to the advancement of international advertising theory by developing a model of cross-cultural consumer responses to humane-oriented corporate social responsibility (CSR) appeals in advertising and by testing it using structural equation modelling with data from six countries (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, USA, and Chile). The model includes ad-, advertiser-, product-, and behaviour-related variables.
   Based on survey data from 924 subjects, the model received support in all six countries which suggests that humane orientation is a favourable cultural dimension for advertising purposes, even in countries in which humane orientation is less highly valued. The higher the perceived degree of humane orientation in an advertisement, the more positive was the evaluation of the ad, and the more likely subjects were to evaluate the advertiser as being socially responsible. These two variables positively influenced attitudes towards the product and, consequently, behavioural intentions. Some support was found for a moderating influence of country on the relationship between perception of humane orientation in the ad and the evaluation of that ad and on the relationship between perception of humane orientation in the ad and perceived degree of social responsibility of the advertiser. Implications for the use of humane-oriented CSR appeals in international advertising are discussed. Results suggest that international advertisers may pursue a standardized campaign in multiple markets when incorporating humane-oriented CSR appeals. Limitations and directions for further research are addressed.

TI Gender stereotypes in advertising: a review of current research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The purpose of this paper is to highlight the historical context of gender stereotypes in advertising and then examine the scholarship related to gender stereotypes. Gender portrayals in advertising have been examined extensively in the last five decades and still remain an important topic. Changing role structure in the family and in the labor force has brought significant variation in both male and female roles and subsequently how it is reflected in advertising. It has been noted that there is a culture lag. Sexes for a long period of time were depicted in advertising in more traditional roles. Women were presented in an inferior manner relative to their potential and capabilities, while at the same the data indicated a shift towards more positive role portrayals. The changing role of men is the area that has seen the greatest interest in the past few years. Men are depicted in advertising in softer' roles, while interacting with their children. Men are also shown in more egalitarian roles. The paper finally attempts to outline the future research direction of gender portrayals in advertising. First, research should focus on examining gender portrayals in online platforms, and find ways to modify current coding schemes to digital formats. Second, companies and the media are beginning to pay attention to a once largely ignored segment the lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender (LGBT) consumer. Third, recent advertising has focused on the empowered' women called femvertising.

TI Go green: how to influence the perceived effectiveness of a green
   product?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Across two studies, this research elucidates on which green messages in advertising are most effective in influencing the perceived effectiveness of green products by examining the moderating role of environmental consciousness. This study further considers a mechanism underlying the interaction between green messages and environmental consciousness on brand attitude with the perceived effectiveness of green products. The results show that when environmentally conscious individuals are exposed to abstract and distant temporal messages, they will report greater perceptions of a green product's effectiveness and brand attitude than for concrete and proximal temporal messages. In contrast, less environmentally conscious respondents will not have different responses to the abstract/concrete and distant/proximal temporal messages. Furthermore, the perceived effectiveness of a green product mediates the interaction between green messages and environmental consciousness for predicting brand attitudes. With an understanding of how environmentally conscious individuals evaluate green advertising, marketers can better understand how to promote their green products more effectively.

TI Time heals many wounds - explaining the immediate and delayed effects of
   message sidedness
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigates the immediate and delayed effects of advertising messages including both positive and negative information. A two-sided message has a negative effect on message attitudes due to two mediating variables with trade-off effects: valence and balance. These two variables are also responsible for the alignment of the effect of sidedness on message attitudes and purchase intentions over time: the negative effects of two-sided messages are neutralized over time because negative information is reevaluated, improving the valence of the message. The results explain the negative effects of message sidedness that have been found in prior research and they show that a two-sided message in advertising is not necessarily inferior to a one-sided message despite unfavorable short-term effects.

TI The influence of gender on the effectiveness of probability markers in
   advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The results of two studies reveal that gender plays a moderating role on the effects that the use of probability markers (hedges - e.g., possibly, could help; and pledges - e.g., definitely, without a doubt) in advertising copy has on consumers' attitudes towards the brand advertised and purchase intentions. Women, as comprehensive processors, are not particularly sensitive to probability markers, which function as heuristic cues. Men, on the other hand, display higher levels of sensitivity towards probability marker usage; more precisely, their responses show preference towards the use of hedges over both pledges and no probability markers in advertising copy. Interactions with product category involvement, buying motivation (hedonic or utilitarian), and familiarity with the brand advertised are also explored.

TI Development and validation of an emic scale to measure ad-evoked
   nostalgia in France
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The practice of imbuing marketing communications with nostalgic reverie is prevalent in numerous countries. However, scholarly research investigating consumer response to such communication across cultures is lacking. This inquiry follows an emic approach examining and measuring ad-evoked personal nostalgia in France. Findings from five studies (N = 699) reveal significant differences in consumer reactions in France, as compared to earlier research based on American samples. Among the French, nostalgic advertising evokes personal memories and cultural nostalgia, contrasted to reports of past imagery, physiological and positive and negative emotional reactions in the United States. Furthermore, while cultural nostalgia is an important component of the French personal nostalgic experience, it is the personal memories that are the key to the creation of positive impressions about the ad and brand (brand heritage, brand bonds, and attitudes), and driving behavioral intentions. The emic French scale was found to be superior to an etic ad-nostalgia measure, in terms of fit and variance explained of the endogenous variables. The findings contribute to cross-cultural advertising and marketing research, and can be instructive for advertisers targeting the French market.

TI Attitudes toward ads portraying women in decorative roles and female
   competition: an evolutionary psychology perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The portrayal of women in advertising is a prolific research topic and extant studies have emphasized the negative attitudes of female consumers toward stereotypic depictions of women in advertising in general. However, empirical evidence regarding female consumers' responses to specific ads depicting women in decorative roles is scarce and conflicting. Drawing on the principles of evolutionary psychology, the present paper proposes that women's attitudes toward such ads are underlied by the evolved context-sensitive mechanism of intrasexual competition. Relevant hypotheses are tested through two experimental studies. The findings indicate that decorative portrayals in advertising elicit more favorable attitudes when female consumers compete through a self-promotion strategy with regard to a competitor derogation one. Additionally, the temporal orientation of self-referencing during ad processing emerges as a moderator of the influence of the motivational state elicited by the medium context on attitudes.

The current study tested social norm effects in conjunction with benefit information and the moderating role of attention to social comparison information (ATSCI) when responding to public service advertisements (PSAs) promoting savings behavior. Results from two experiments, testing positive and negative social norm information, respectively, support the argument that lower ATSCI individuals exhibit greater intellectual autonomy and discernment of information, especially regarding norm information, while higher ATSCI individuals generally demonstrate greater social compliance tendencies. Implications for theory development and enhancing savings campaigns are discussed.

   Investigating the influence of feminist attitudes on reactions to sexual
   appeals
SO International Journal of Advertising
AB To test the belief that feminism and sexualization of women in advertising stand in opposition, this study employed a large US national sample (N = 1298) to examine how consumers' feminist attitudes differentiate and predict their ethical judgment and ad-related evaluations of sexual images of women in advertisements. The results indicate that (1) consumers with higher feminist attitudes evaluated sexual ads more favorably than those having lower feminist attitudes, and (2) consumers' feminist attitudes positively predict ad-related evaluations with full mediation of ethical judgment. These findings, which diverge from previous research, may indicate that contemporary feminists view sexual images of women differently than in previous decades. Theoretical and practical implications are described.

TI Influence of gender stereotypes on advertising offensiveness and
   attitude toward advertising in general
SO International Journal of Advertising
AB Although considerable research has examined attitude toward advertising in general (AG), little is known about AG's determinants. This study investigates gender stereotype-related constructs whose relationship with AG is understudied and unclear. Structural equation modeling demonstrates that attitude toward sex/nudity in advertising predicts AG indirectly through the perceived offensiveness of advertising. Also, the more consumers believe that advertising portrays gender stereotypes, the less favorable their AG. Multi-group analyses, however, demonstrate that offensiveness harms AG for men, but not women. Also, gender-stereotype attitudes harm AG for female and younger consumers, but do not harm AG for male or older consumers. These results have important implications for advertisers in message targeting and advertisement execution strategies. Also, because unfavorable AG increases demands for governmental oversight and interference, the advertising industry should strengthen self-regulation. This self-regulation should proscribe traditional gender stereotypes and excessively erotic ads that may offend consumers, even if those consumers are outside an advertiser's target market.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB There is a long and diverse literature on gender stereotypes in advertising; however, US practitioners' perspectives on the role and function of stereotypes in advertising remain unknown. Understanding professionals' views on whether and how stereotypes communicate is important for anyone who believes it beneficial to reduce future stereotypical representations. Using qualitative interviews with 42 practitioners, this study detailed seven themes concerning professionals' perceptions of the role and function of stereotypes in advertising, including beliefs that stereotypes are based in truth, are attractive to audiences, communicate quickly, simplify processing, prevent distraction, prevent thinking, and are the obvious solution. Practitioners felt stereotypes were used most appropriately when they were subverted or challenged in advertising messages. Stereotypes were most inappropriate when they reinforced negative perceptions. Four factors believed to drive the use of stereotypes in advertising are discussed.

The study also explored how cognitive and affective advertising literacy further attenuate advertising effects by investigating the mediation impact of cognitive and affective advertising literacy on the relation between the ad's format and the purchase request. Third, the study investigated how an advertising literacy training session moderates these effects.
   The results of this experimental study showed that advergames lead to a higher purchase request rate among children than television commercials. However, only affective but not cognitive advertising literacy mediated the effect of the advertising format on purchase request. In addition, a training session was shown to accelerate children's cognitive (but not their affective) advertising literacy for advergames, but not for television commercials.

An AFP is a television program which is fully sponsored by and built around a sponsoring brand. We test how the perceived program-sponsor brand fit moderates the effect of program liking one week and one month after the program finale. Program liking positively impacts brand attitude for the sponsor, and this effect becomes weaker over time. Program-sponsor brand fit reinforces the positive effect of program liking on brand attitude, especially in the longer term. In the longer term, program liking of an AFP also positively impacts viewers' attitude toward the main competitor of the sponsor.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The number of websites containing persuasive serious games and advergames has increased over the past several years, but their immediate and delayed effects on behavior are still not well understood. The present field experiment (n = 388, varied socio-professional groups) demonstrates that interactivity linked to this type of website provokes positive effects on immediate behavior (purchases of energy-saving light bulbs, ESLBs) in a 'real setting.' It further affected the behavior (installation of ESLBs at home), the memorization of the website's arguments, gains in knowledge, attitude, and other judgments regarding ESLBs, when measured two weeks later. The digital signature of a commitment to perform an expected behavior via a web page also provokes positive behavioral effects. This can accumulate through the effects of interactivity. We close with a discussion of the possible psychological processes involved, theoretical and practical implications and limitations as well as new perspectives for advertising and advergames research.

Results of an experiment demonstrate that consumers perceive in-ad gender role portrayals of males as caregivers as atypical of the current advertising environment. Consumers who, in particular, hold a non-traditional (egalitarian) gender role ideology report a more positive attitude towards advertising that challenges traditional gender role ideologies (i.e., advertising that depicts males as caregivers). We suggest that non-traditional advertising that challenges traditional gender roles provides advertisers with an opportunity to stand out; however, advertisers must ensure that their key product-related message components are not overshadowed.

TI Gender portrayals revisited: searching for explicit and implicit
   stereotypes in Cypriot magazine advertisements
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The study pursues a line of inquiry into contemporary gender stereotypes drawn from print advertisements in Cyprus. The investigation of implicit modes of stereotyping suggested by Goffman across explicit gender roles yield novel and interesting insights that broaden existing knowledge on male and female advertising depictions. Through a content analysis of 3.729 characters, the study reveals the existence of gender cliches in Cypriot magazine advertisements. Neither male nor female evolving roles are adequately reflected in advertisements, as men tend to be portrayed in traditional masculine stereotypes while women lean towards decorative portrayals. Implicit stereotyping is more likely to suggest the subordination and lower status of women compared to men. The study indicates that advertising in Cyprus reinforces the diffusion of hostile sexism by the underrepresentation of professional women and their commonplace portrayal in body revealing attires. At the same time, the high proportion of women's implicit subordination signifies benevolent sexism. The distorted representation of both genders raises key public policy concerns, as diminishing portrayals hold sway upon men's and women's psychological well-being and professional development.

AB A lack of women in creative departments has been documented in previous research. These departments are seen as a male fraternity subculture in advertising agencies, where women experience many difficulties in their career progress. One of these drawbacks is gender bias in the selection of ideas' process. Male creative directors are believed to promote ideas created by men within a homosocial environment. This female perception emerged from previous qualitative research is studied experimentally for the first time. Almost 90 advertising creative directors and higher level positions assessed ads created by students in an advertising university course. In the current study, we explore the effects of ad gender authorship. Results revealed an absence of gender bias based on ad name cues, neither the gender of the ad creators nor the creatives affected the evaluations. The findings are discussed and future research is proposed.

We distinguish consumer knowledge into three categories (knowledge related to the environment, available action, and its effectiveness) and test them as moderating variables. A survey of 256 US consumers revealed that less knowledgeable consumers were driven primarily by their perceived behavioral control, while highly knowledgeable consumers exhibited a distinct influence from positive anticipated emotions on their desire. This distinction was brought upon only within low/high action/effectiveness knowledge groups, but not within low/high environment knowledge. Our findings highlight the importance of raising consumer's system, action-related, and effective knowledge, as well as the need for targeted advertising strategies for consumers with differing knowledge levels in green consumption.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT 2014 Global Marketing Conference
CY JUL 15-18, 2014
CL Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB This study examines the impact of various degrees of fear appeals of climate change on an individual's intention to engage in pro-environmental behavior, and how possible factors that influence an individual's intention to engage in pro-environmental behavior vary in different degrees of fear appeals of climate change. The results indicate that the participants who read the low-fear appeal text exhibit more evoked fearful emotion and have more intentions to engage in pro-environmental behavior than do those who read the high-fear appeal text. In addition, an individual's moral obligations play a crucial role in determining his or her intention to engage in pro-environmental behavior under both low-fear and high-fear appeal conditions. However, under high-fear appeal conditions, an individual's perception of collective efficacy plays a crucial role in determining his or her intention of engaging in pro-environmental behavior. The results of this study contribute to enhancing the intercultural validation of research on fear appeals applied to people's pro-environmental behavior in a collective Chinese cultural social context in response to global warming. In addition, the findings provide implications for applying fear appeals to encourage pro-environmental behavior.

TI The effect of non-stereotypical gender role advertising on consumer
   evaluation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT 2014 Global Marketing Conference
CY JUL 15-18, 2014
CL Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB Non-stereotypical gender role (NSGR) representations have been increasing gradually over time in advertising, where male celebrities endorse traditionally or stereotypically female-oriented products and vice versa. This research proposes that the overall effect of NSGR advertising on consumer evaluation is composed of two opposing effects. This study investigates the conditions in which either the positive or the negative effects are likely to prevail. Specifically, this study identifies dual mediation, a positive effect via novelty perception and a negative effect via cognitive resistance. We conduct five experiments that indicate that the sign of the overall effect of NSGR advertising depends on the self-construal and the need-for-uniqueness. The positive effect via novelty perception exists only for consumers with independent self-construal and a high need-for-uniqueness. The negative effect via cognitive resistance only appears when consumers have interdependent self-construal and a low need-for-uniqueness. This research establishes an important link between gender-incongruity and personal traits, subsequently demonstrating when marketers should use the NSGR advertising.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT 2014 Global Marketing Conference
CY JUL 15-18, 2014
CL Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB This paper examines individuals' (promotion versus prevention) regulatory focus effects on a variety of environmentally responsible reactions. Results of two studies show that chronic promotion focus is associated with environmental concern, favorable attitudes towards pro-environment advertising recommendations, intentions to do what the ad recommends, and positive affect directed at the self upon adhering to ad recommendations. Conversely, chronic prevention focus while not significantly associated with environmental concern, attitudes, intentions, or positive affect - has a marginally positive association with negative affect toward the self and others who do not follow pro-environmental ad recommendations. Furthermore, priming promotion focus strengthens attitudes toward recommended behavior, intentions to follow through, and other-directed positive (and negative) affect. Priming prevention focus also strengthens other-directed negative (and positive) affect. No fit effects between individuals' regulatory focus and pro-environmental ads framed with recycle, reduce, or recycle and reduce orientations is found. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

AB In this research, we examine the relationship between advertising expenditures and perceptions regarding popular brands as held by children and mothers in the United States. Our findings show that traditional media advertising expenditures positively relate with brand affinity for children and mothers, while product placement relates positively with children's brand affinity but not with mothers' brand affinity. A closer examination of advertising budgets reveals that marketers for the top children's brands devote most of their advertising to TV and magazine advertisements, indicating that they still believe that traditional media play a key role in reaching the youth market. Additionally, the advertisers spend disproportionately higher amounts to reach Hispanic and African American populations.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING

CL Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB Recent years have seen some US municipalities implementing restrictions on lighted on-premise signs, often based on environmental arguments. At the same time, sign companies and sign users argue that restrictions are harmful to businesses. To date there has not been any research on the degree to which restrictions on illuminated signs are harmful to businesses. To this end, this study reports the results of a nationally representative sample of on-premise sign users which explores the degree to which sign users: (1) rely on the signs to help them perform key marketing functions; and (2) report that these signs impact their bottom line. Findings indicate that respondents strongly agree that lighted on-premise signs perform key marketing functions for them and a majority of respondents believe that restrictions on lighting harm their profitability.

AB The authors of this article compare American and Korean reactions to the persuasiveness of environmental advertising campaigns that are preceded by environmental pledges. Findings indicate that environmental advertising effectiveness depends on how much effort recipients put into making environmental pledges prior to viewing the advertisements. Study 1 demonstrates that when environmental pledges requesting more effort precede ad messages, Americans are more persuaded but Koreans are less persuaded. Study 2 extends the findings and rules out an alternative explanation - mere-effort effect - by showing that the results are replicated only with an issue-relevant pledge, but not with an issue-irrelevant pledge.

TI In distrust of merits: the negative effects of astroturfs on people's
   prosocial behaviors
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT 2014 Global Marketing Conference
CY JUL 15-18, 2014
CL Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB Astroturf organizations are fake grassroots organizations that hide their true identity by using deceptive and fraudulent tactics as propaganda, but try to convince the public that they are authentic. In this study, we focus on the potential influences of astroturf organizations within the context of prosocial behaviors. Building on the notion that deceptive advertisements engender distrust and undermine the trustworthiness of subsequent advertising, we suggest that people who read messages from astroturf organizations will become more distrustful toward nonprofit organizations and will display lower willingness to engage in prosocial behaviors than people who read messages from grassroots organizations. Results from studies 1 and 2 indicate that messages from astroturf organizations can engender people's distrust toward nonprofit organizations, thereby lowering their willingness to engage in prosocial behaviors. In addition, the negative effect of astroturf organizations is moderated by skepticism toward advertising. Given that the insidious use of astroturf organizations is growing in popularity, we provide meaningful insights into the influence of fake grassroots organizations, with the possibility to forewarn the public about their undesirable effects on the community.

AB Despite the emerging trend of adopting co-creative approaches in public and non-profit advertising, research has overlooked participatory approaches in non-commercial settings. This research extends current knowledge on consumer-generated advertising to communications fostering positive social change. The results of an experimental study show that the disclosure of consumer participation in the ad creation process results in positive ad evaluations and reduces positive attitudes towards unhealthy eating. The main effect of source disclosure on ad evaluations is mediated by sympathy towards the ad creator. In addition, floodlight analyses show that the main effect of source disclosure on ad evaluations and attitudes is amplified when the audience is highly involved with the advertised issue. Implications for theory, practice and public policy are discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examined factors (e.g., ad values and social networking advertising characteristics) influencing consumers' attitudes and behavioural intention towards three types of social networking advertising (SNA) on Facebook - home page ad, social impression ad, and organic impression ad. Findings demonstrate that peer influence had the most significant impacts on attitude and behavioural intention across all types of SNA. The significant interaction term of invasiveness and privacy concern indicates that both attitude and behavioural intention were diminished, particularly when perceived invasiveness and privacy concern were high simultaneously. In addition, results suggest that attitudes towards the ad played a mediating role between SNA characteristics and behavioural intention. Lastly, among the types of SNA, consumers preferred organic impression ads that featured friends' names on their newsfeed more than paid ads located on the sidebar of their Facebook pages.

TI Social context and advertising effectiveness: a dynamic study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Consumers of movies, videos, and television programmes enjoy sharing the experience with groups of family and friends. Group consumption or co-viewing of audiovisual entertainment helps make co-exposure to advertisements fairly common across media vehicles and technologies. Research in marketing and psychology has consistently shown that the presence of, and/or the interactions with, others affects cognition. Therefore, co-exposure should sway advertising effects. Still, most media planning assumes that the value of reach and frequency for advertisers does not change over social contexts. The present study investigates co-exposure to programme 'promos' as an antecedent of individual consumption of the advertised programmes on people meter panel data. Our findings support and extend those reported in the sparse experimental literature, provide the basis for a theoretical model of social context of exposure, and point to possible research directions for practitioners and academics.

AB This research introduces attitude towards the endorsement as a mediating variable in the relationships between celebrity source and endorsement factors and brand attitude. It also includes perceived celebrity motive, a variable rarely studied in the previous literature, as an endorsement factor. In a survey study, respondents evaluated four celebrity endorsement campaigns. Mediation analyses show that attitude towards the endorsement mediates the effects of three variables on brand attitude; these variables are celebrity expertise, celebrity-brand fit, and perceived celebrity motive. Moreover, results show that if consumers perceive that the celebrity was motivated to do the endorsement not only by money but also by product quality, this has a significant positive effect on attitude towards the brand.

An experimental study exposed participants to the video clip 'Telephone' by Lady Gaga; the product placement frequency of the brand Polaroid (zero, moderate, high) and the presence of placement disclosures were varied experimentally. The results demonstrated that placement disclosures lead to an increase in brand memory for moderately frequently and frequently depicted placements. Disclosures also activate persuasion knowledge independent of placement frequency. However, persuasion knowledge did not lead to more negative brand attitudes. The paper concludes with the implications for researchers and marketers.

TI IMC in an emerging economy: the Chinese perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Integrated marketing communications (IMC) planning and implementation vary greatly by market and country. This study, based on the survey data compiled from 135 Chinese marketing executives, focuses on IMC in China's emerging economy, with the goal of providing an outlook of IMC's current development in China while uncovering factors in the country's socioeconomic and business infrastructures that may cause IMC to deviate from the traditional Western model. The study also explores Chinese responses to the rising proliferation of digital media and its implications for IMC development.
   The study concludes that despite uneven business development and a current lack of training in IMC-related skills, IMC appears to be the inevitable course or the future of Chinese marketing communications. Due to factors unique to the Chinese business landscape, such as government-owned business structures, political nuances in marketing channel relationships, and uneven development of consumer culture, IMC in China will likely evolve differently than in the US. Survey respondents reveal that IMC is progressing much faster in local, privately owned firms than in their state-owned counterparts. The rise of digital media will also disrupt traditional media outlets, providing challenges to the Chinese marketer.

TI Causes and consequences of trust in direct-to-consumer prescription drug
   advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising (DTCA) is believed to empower consumers, but national surveys indicate declining trust in DTCA. Given the unique characteristics of this category, it is unclear what the likely consequences are of reduced trust in these ads. Furthermore, previous research is inadequate to discern the basis of trust in DTCA. To address this issue, a model of the antecedent and consequent factors connected to trust in DTCA was developed based on prior empirical findings and relevant theory. This paper presents survey findings testing the model. Results show trust is predicted by perceptions of mediated health information sources, advertising in general, pharmaceutical companies, and the perceived value and informativeness of prescription drug ads. Regarding outcomes, results were mixed for the relationship of trust with attention, attitudes, and behavioural intent. Overall, findings suggest trust plays a complex role in shaping consumer reactions to prescription drug ads.

First, the before-after appeals can prompt performance-based effect processes, which enhance perceptions of product performance and encourage improved behavioural intentions. Second, they can trigger emotion-based effect processes, which arouse anticipated happiness and anticipatory hope, as well as lead to favourable brand attitudes. Studies 1 and 2 confirm the proposed model; Study 3 shows that consumers' low product involvement triggers a performance-based effect process, whereas their high product involvement triggers emotion-based effect processes.

TI Intergenerational appeal in advertising: impacts of brand-gender
   extension and brand history
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB An intergenerational (IG) appeal in an advertising campaign usually presents a nostalgic image with family portraits, emphasizing the traditions that have been passed on from generation to generation or harkening back to the 'good old days' between father and son, or mother and daughter. The IG appeal can effectively enhance a brand's image and induce that all-important consumer purchase. This paper takes gender differences (father/son or mother/daughter) into consideration while examining two moderators related to branding: (in)congruent brand-gender extension and brand history. Results indicate that a well-established brand history enhances the effects of the IG appeal. In addition, a congruent brand-gender extension increases the effects of the IG appeal. More interestingly, IG appeals can be effective in presenting a less established brand which has an incongruent brand-gender extension.

TI Attitudes and related perceptions about product placement: a comparison
   of Finland, Italy and the United States
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The primary goal of our study is to explore cross-national differences in attitudes and perceptions about product placements, after investigating measurement invariance. Our cross-national focus includes three countries that have not been compared previously: Finland, Italy and the USA, which differ significantly in terms of the evolution/maturity of product placement markets, regulatory structures and cultural contexts. Motivated by earlier studies, we investigate the cross-national measurement invariance of scales to measure four research constructs related to the product placement domain (attitude toward credibility of advertising, attitude toward advertising-in-general, attitude toward placement-in-general and attitude toward regulation of placements). Our research also extends earlier work focused on similar constructs from a cross-national perspective. Results from multi-group analyses using a structural equation modeling approach indicate important and statistically significant differences in latent means between the three countries for all four constructs of research interest. Substantive explanations of these differences and their implications for future practice and research are discussed.

TI Drivers of brand image improvement in sports-event sponsorship
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This stock-taking article re-examines 20years of research on conditions that influence the magnitude of brand image improvement through sports-event sponsorship. The study suggests a procedure to adequately measure sponsor image change in field sponsorships and investigates potential factors related to the sponsored property, the sponsorship relationship, the sponsor, and the individual sports spectator that may affect the magnitude of sponsor image improvement. An empirical analysis in the context of a large sponsored sports event shows that some drivers influence sponsor image improvement directly in a multiple regression analysis (spectators' perceived event image, event-sponsor fit, sponsor familiarity, and product category importance), while other drivers are related to sponsor image in bivariate analyses only (spectators' event interest, sport interest, event exposure, and demographic characteristics). Reasons for these findings (e.g., interrelationship between drivers of sponsor image improvement), managerial implications, and consequences for the development of a comprehensive model of sponsor image formation are discussed.

TI Does poor fit always lead to negative evaluations? Extension advertising
   and perceived brand quality
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This article investigates the moderating roles of advertising strategy (relational vs. elaborational) and perceived parent brand quality on the influence that parent brand-extension fit exerts on consumer evaluations of both extensions and the parent brand. Two studies manipulate fit in terms of either brand concept consistency or product feature similarity. Lower fit results in negative consumer responses, yet an elaborational advertising strategy mitigates the negative effects of lower fit on extension evaluations. This mitigating effect is stronger for high quality than for average quality brands. The results also indicate extension feedback effects for the parent brand, suggesting that elaborational advertising strategies may reduce the impact of fit on parent brand feedback effects. This latter link is not moderated by parent brand quality.

TI Comedic violence in advertising: the role of normative beliefs and
   intensity of violence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Interest in the use of comedic violence in advertising has risen, but the research on this topic has been limited. Past studies have found positive effects of comedic violence in ads, with higher levels of violence increasing positive responses. However, given that the violence depicted in these ads is a violation of social norms, following the Social Norms Theory, it is proposed that individual norm beliefs about violence in advertising could be a significant factor in influencing ad outcome. Using an online panel of general consumers across two experiments, this study revealed that norm beliefs had a positive influence on comedic violence ad responses. In addition, when violence intensities of the ads were varied, individuals with lower norm beliefs responded more positively to low violence ads than high violence ads, whereas individuals with higher norm beliefs did not exhibit different responses to the two violence intensities. Mediation analyses were conducted to test for the underlying mechanisms. As comedic violence advertising may offend audiences, the findings provide targeting and design implications for advertisers interested in this strategy.

TI The influence of self-construal and materialism on social media
   intensity: a study of China and the United States
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigated the potential influence of self-construal and materialism on intensity of usage for three social media platforms: social networking sites (SNSs), microblogging sites (MBSs), and video sharing sites (VSSs). Data were collected from China and the United States - two countries with the highest advertising expenditures and Internet populations. Drawing from the social comparison theory (SCT) and the framework of independent and interdependent self-construal, results of the hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that both independent and interdependent self-construal were positively related to SNS intensity among Chinese and American users. However, interdependent self-construal had a significant, negative relationship with the intensity of MBS use among users in the two countries. Materialism was found to positively relate to SNS intensity, MBS intensity, and VSS intensity among Chinese and American users. These results provide evidence that self-construal and materialism contribute to social media use independent of nationality. Theoretical and managerial implications for international advertising strategies are discussed.

   self-construal influence nostalgic appeal selection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research compares historical and personal nostalgic appeals with potential influences of consumption context and consumer self-construal. Results from two experiments indicate that, regardless of nostalgia type, a nostalgic ad is more effective than a non-nostalgic ad with similar visuals. Personal nostalgia is more effective than historical nostalgia in ads for private consumption contexts. In contrast, historical nostalgia is more effective than personal nostalgia for public consumption contexts. The above-mentioned results hold for those whose self-construal is interdependent self-construal, not for those with independent self-construal. Based on the findings, managerial implications for advertising practitioners are provided.

TI Following brands on Twitter: an extension of theory of planned behavior
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Due to its immediacy and efficiency, Twitter has recently emerged as a form of marketing communication tool that offers unique advantages for two-way communication between marketers and consumers. This study examines brand-following behavior on Twitter using the Ajzen's model of theory of planned behavior (TPB). Results show that attitude toward brand following, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and brand attachment are positively associated with intention to follow brands on Twitter. Consumers' intention to create (i.e., intention to tweet at brands) and disseminate (i.e., intention to retweet the links of brands) brand-related information, as well as purchase intention, are the outcomes of intention to follow brands on Twitter. Overall findings suggest that TPB model can be used to predict Twitter users' brand-following behavior. More importantly, our finding that brand attachment drives consumer intention to follow brands on Twitter extends the TPB framework. This study provides both theoretical and managerial implications.

Data are garnered from interviews with adult men who regularly read fashion magazines and buy fashion clothing. Findings reveal that men process fashion advertisements through the same five modes as women. The current study also demonstrates that men's responses to fashion advertisements can be categorized through the Fashion Engagement Grid which examines men's characterizations of and motivations for fashion behavior. This study expands theoretical understandings of gender in advertising research and recommends advertising elements to attract male consumers.

TI Celebrity endorsements, self-brand connection and relationship quality
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The extant literature on celebrity endorsement effects largely focuses on the endorsement effects on consumer evaluations of the endorsed brand. The current study extends the literature by assessing the impact of endorser credibility on two consumer-brand relationship-oriented outcomes - brand relationship quality and consumer self-brand connections. Additionally, the self-brand connection is positioned as a partial mediator of the effect of endorser credibility on relationship quality. A conceptual model is developed and estimated on a sample of 535 Generation Y (youth) consumers from India. The hypotheses are supported and the model demonstrates acceptable fit to the data. Overall, the present study introduces a relationship-building perspective to the celebrity endorsement literature. The results suggest that celebrity endorsers possess the ability to provide meaningful self-definitional benefits to consumers as well as cultivate enhanced relationship quality with the endorsed brands, thus contributing novel insights into celebrity endorsement dynamics.

TI Effects of background music endings on consumer memory in advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Background music is widely used in advertising to attract audiences' attention. However, no research to date has considered the effect of background music endings on consumer memory for advertised products and messages. Across two experiments, the present research shows that background music that ends abruptly (i.e., truncated ending) distracts consumers' attention, reducing memory for both products and messages, compared to background music that ends with a note in the chord of the dominant tonality (i.e., regular ending) or that concludes with a fading-out ending.

TI Creativity identity in Colombia: the advertising creatives' perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This exploratory paper analyses the way in which context influences advertising creativity practices. To establish the role of context, this paper utilized both Social Identity theory and Systems Model of Creativity. Twenty four in-depth interviews with top creative directors of the main advertising agencies in Colombia (Latin America) were collected. Findings suggest the Colombian creative identity is under construction. This identity is influenced by the broader Colombian social context including the unique business characteristics of the country's communications industry, the level of economic hardship experienced by the population, and the actual social conflict lived situation. These findings extend the Systems Model of Creativity to include social hardships and industry level characteristics. Several practical implications not only in relation to Colombia, but also the broader global advertising industry are presented.

TI Identifying the factors that influence eWOM in SNSs: the case of Chile
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The factors that influence electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in social networking sites (SNSs) in Latin American countries still need to be understood. This paper looks at factors included by prior research, as well as two new factors that have the power to influence eWOM in SNSs in the region. The study is conducted in Chile, a country which already has high Internet and SNSs penetration rates and Hofstede's scores close to the average for Latin America. The results show that tie strength, normative influence, informational influence, self-presentation, and voluntary self-disclosure are all positively directly associated with eWOM in SNSs. The results also show that homophily exerts a positive indirect influence on eWOM through the mediators of tie strength, normative influence, informational influence, and self-presentation. Additionally, the results show that trust exerts a positive indirect influence on eWOM through the mediators of tie strength, normative influence, and voluntary self-disclosure.

TI Comparing advertising effectiveness in South-American and North-American
   contexts: testing Hofstede's and Inglehart's cultural dimensions in the
   higher education sector
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research compares the effectiveness of advertising and relational marketing in two countries characterized by varying levels of both Hofstede's and Inglehart's cultural dimensions - Peru (high-power distance, high collectivism, survival and traditional values) and Canada (low-power distance, high individualism, self-expression and secular-rational values). Survey data from a high credence service sector (higher education) in both countries is used for the analysis. The results indicate that advertising and relational marketing have direct effects on choice in Peru, but do not have significant direct effects on choice in Canada. Advertising does, however, affect positively perceptual outcome measures (perceived marketing effectiveness) in Canada. Additionally, we find that advertising and relational marketing have an indirect impact on choice and perceived marketing effectiveness through the mediation of perceived informativeness and influencers in both countries. These results point to the need to account for mechanisms and mediating variables when building theoretical frameworks in cross-country studies.

We complement the extant work by analysing a sample of 449 online toy advertisements targeting children in Brazil, a largely unregulated market. Results show that multinational corporations are more likely to include disclaimers in their online ads than local Brazilian companies. Further analyses reveal, however, that advertising disclaimers used by multinational subsidiaries have more distractors that reduce viewer comprehension. Our research contributes to the fields of advertising and institutional theory by being the first to document whether and how multinational subsidiaries use disclaimers in online ads targeting an unregulated market.

TI Getting the sustainability message across: an endorsed Colombian

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Many ecosystems are facing environmental threats. Some of the main concerns are now focused in developing countries. Strong environmental messages by numerous stakeholders have led to varied responses on environmental issues. Companies, governmental agencies and NGOs are responding to such issues by developing campaigns to promote sustainable practices amongst key stakeholders. Green advertising is one important form of communications employed to elicit environmentally friendly attitudes and consequently promote behavioural change. This study analyses the effect of a sponsored cinematographic green advertising strategy by a NGO and a major supermarket chain in a Latin American country. Based on in-depth interviews with Colombian movie audiences, this investigation demonstrates how (1) a movie focused on nationalistic identification can effectively provoke positive attitude change toward environmental sustainable practices, (2) the movie's media format can heighten audience interest about adopting environmental sustainable practices and (3) these results benefit positively the two movie sponsors through association and affect transfer.

This paper examines the explicit (verbal) and implicit (cued) understanding of advertising and placement in a sample of 9-, 12- and 15-year-old children from Chile. The results showed a more sophisticated comprehension of advertising in comparison with product placement. They also revealed that age is positively correlated with a more sophisticated understanding of both placement and advertising. Finally, significant differences were observed when comparing the use of verbal and cued methods. The results are discussed in terms of prior literature and their practical implications.

   appeals in Brazil
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Given the pharmaceutical industry's immense global importance, drug manufacturers are currently spending approximately one third of sales revenues on marketing their products. A neglected area of inquiry is pharmaceutical marketing's contribution to consumer empowerment. The present investigation proposes an Advertising-Empowerment-Model which was tested in Brazil, the most important pharmaceutical drug market in Latin America. The model includes ad, product- and health-related variables. Based on survey data from 241 Brazilian subjects (non-student sample), the model received support for four different ad appeals (informative, emotional, mixed and CSR). Results indicate that the mixed appeal ad led to the highest degree of empowerment in all three empowerment categories (message empowerment, self-medication empowerment, and health empowerment) and was followed by the informative and emotional ad appeals. The CSR appeal obtained the overall lowest scores. Implications regarding the relevance of empowerment in international advertising are discussed. Additionally, limitations and directions for further research are addressed.

TI Should I say it in English? Exploring language effects on print
   advertising among Latin American bilinguals
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Despite the extensive research conducted on language standardization in advertising across several countries, little attention has been given to the use of English versus Spanish and code-switching when advertising to Latin American bilingual consumers. We propose that stereotypes about English speakers and code-switching have potential to help determine which language is most effective in print advertising. The results of experiments conducted in Chile, Ecuador, and Mexico show that the effects of language-related stereotypes on the persuasiveness of English ads vary across different countries. In the case of Chile, English may be persuasively superior, depending on the favourableness of the stereotype of individuals that code-switch. Differently, print ads in English are functionally equivalent, in terms of ad attitudes, to Spanish and code-switching ads in Mexico, and superior in Ecuador, regardless of the favourability of the language-related stereotypes. Suggestions for advertising practice and future research are offered.

AB Although advertising is a global discipline, several of the world's regions remain under-represented in the leading advertising journals, with North American dominance of review boards and authorship in these journals. Introducing this special issue of the International Conference on Research in Advertising (ICORIA), this paper assesses the international diversity of authorship in advertising research by looking at the nationalities of author teams of articles published in the leading advertising journals over the last 10years. Among advertising journals, international diversity of authorship is clearly greatest in the International Journal of Advertising (IJA), and the even greater international diversity of this ICORIA special issue highlights the Journal's international orientation. The fact that diversity of authorship also relates to article citations and therefore to research performance further emphasizes the need for more international diversity of authorship in advertising research.

AB This study investigates the effects of advergame customization features and trust in the brand advertised in the advergame on players' brand attitude and personal information disclosure. Moreover, we examine to what extent players' privacy concerns moderate these effects. Drawing on self-determination theory and uncertainty reduction theory, we developed and tested a game with varying levels of customization features and brand trust. Results show that customization possibilities and brand trust may have a positive influence on advergame persuasion outcomes, but this influence is strongly conditioned by consumers' privacy concerns. When privacy concerns are low, a game containing customization features leads to a more positive brand attitude. However, when privacy concerns are high, the effect becomes negative. Additionally, we find that different levels of privacy concerns do not affect players' responses toward high trust brands, but toward low trust brands. For low trust brands, players with high privacy concerns show more negative game responses than players with low concerns. These findings set the boundaries for several theoretical and practical implications regarding advergame effectiveness.

AB Risk warning or disclosure information in advertising is only effective in correcting consumers' judgments if enough cognitive capacity is available to process that information. Hence, comprehension of verbal warnings in TV commercials may suffer if accompanied by positive visual elements. This research addresses this concern about cross-modality interference in the context of direct-to-consumer (DTC) pharmaceutical commercials in the United States by experimentally testing whether positive facial expressions reduce consumers' understanding of the mandated health warning. A content analysis of a sample of DTC commercials reveals that positive facial expressions are more prevalent during the verbal warning act of the commercials than during the other acts. An eye-tracking experiment conducted with specially produced DTC commercials, which vary the valence of characters' facial expressions during the health warning, provides evidence that happy faces reduce objective comprehension of the warning.

AB Recent research increasingly highlights that consumers engage in online brand endorsements (e.g. Facebook likes) to signal their identity, but has failed to explain why different consumers use this type of signaling to differing degrees. This paper addresses this gap by looking at a culturally constructed individual difference variable, namely self-construal. Self-construal, which can be independent or interdependent, refers to the extent that people define themselves in terms of the relations they have with others. In four studies, this research shows that consumers' self-construal is related to their intention to endorse brands online. In particular, high levels of interdependent self-construal positively affect consumers' intention to endorse brands online (Studies 1A & 1B). This effect is mediated by an increased perception of brands' symbolic value (Study 2). Moreover, this positivity bias toward symbolic brand cues is conditional upon consumers' brand attitude (Study 3). These findings demonstrate that consumers' identity plays a central role in their brand perception and brand-related social media use.

AB The conceptualization of integrated marketing communication (IMC) has evolved from the marketing communications-centered approach (in the early 1990s) to a broader, firm-wide organizational perspective. The latter is adopted in this research to define IMC as a multidimensional concept. This study was conducted to develop a measurement instrument to assess IMC and examine the role of organizational culture in IMC implementation. Data were gathered via an online survey conducted among CEOs and other senior managers. The findings provide evidence of the reliability and validity of the proposed IMC scale and demonstrate that the dominance of an adhocracy (vs. market) culture contributes to building a more IMC-friendly organizational environment.

AB Online consumer reviews are broadly believed to be a necessary and powerful marketing tool, and as such they have attracted considerable attention from both marketers and academics. However, previous research has not sufficiently focused on the effects of various review features on sales but rather used proxy measures such as consumers' purchase intention or perceived helpfulness of reviews. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of review valence and volume on actual sales. We use data from three different e-commerce websites and study light bulbs, women's athletic shoes, natural hair care products, and herbal vitamins. The results show that, contrary to popular belief, more positive ratings do not simply result in higher sales. We find that the effect can be nonlinear, where the probability of purchase increases with rating to about 4.2-4.5 stars, but then decreases. Also, although the majority of extant research suggests that larger numbers of reviews bring more positive outcomes, we show that it is not always the case.

AB The effects of portrayals of ethnic endorsers in advertising are ambiguous. These portrayals strengthen the ethnic identity of ethnic minority groups, thus leading to positive responses toward the ad. They can lead to negative responses, because these portrayals can be perceived as stereotyped. Humor is a tool that can increase positive effects of identity-building and reduce negative effects of stereotyping. In this study, we investigate how humor moderates the effects of ethnic advertising on consumers from ethnic minority and majority groups. We find that humor supports the effects of traditional portrayals for both groups. Moreover, the effect of traditional portrayals combined with humor is strongest for the minority group. These findings provide evidence for the positive effects of humor in ethnic advertising and thus provide new insights to the stereotyping, ethnic advertising, and humor literature. The findings have practical implications for advertising using ethnic endorsers, humor, or targeted at ethnic minority groups.

TI IMC - an integrative review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper reviews and integrates extant work in the integrated marketing communication (IMC) literature. With this in mind, three alternative and widely disseminated conceptual frameworks proposed in the IMC literature are employed as a starting point. The review locates important points of theoretical intersection among these three frameworks, and drawing on the wider literature, develops and cross-fertilizes them into IMC constructs. The review then combines the constructs into an integrative framework by proposing theory-driven relationships and formalizing them using testable propositions. The final outcome offers a clearer synthesis and re-conceptualization of IMC.

TI The impact of consumer confusion from eco-labels on negative WOM,
   distrust, and dissatisfaction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB For decades companies have added eco-labels to products to gain a competitive advantage and inform consumers about the environmental impact of products. Although benefits of eco-labels have been investigated previously, negative outcomes related to the proliferation of these labels have not been studied until this point. This study investigates the impact of eco-labels on a variety of forms of consumer confusion, specifically studying whether this confusion has a direct or indirect effect on negative word-of-mouth, distrust, and dissatisfaction, as mediated by negative emotion. The results from a quasi-experimental field study that employs a between-subject design from the food and detergent industries show that similarity, overload, and ambiguity confusion lead to negative emotion, negative word-of-mouth, distrust, and dissatisfaction. This study also shows that negative emotion mediates the effect of three confusion constructs on dependent variables, such as negative word-of-mouth, distrust, and dissatisfaction. This study presents theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and future research avenues in the areas of consumer confusion and eco-labeling.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB We investigate the moderating role of national openness to foreign markets on consumer responses (attitude to ad, brand and purchase intention) to different degrees of advertising adaptation in Belgium, Iran and India. We operationalize three levels of advertising adaptation (standardization, glocalization and adaptation) by manipulating the model (international versus local celebrity) and advertising copy (international versus local advertising copy). The results show that societies with a low openness to foreign markets respond more positively to fully adapted ads than to glocalized and standardized ads. The differences in responses decrease with national openness.

AB This study explored movie transportation's role in the relationship between movie watching and tourism. Based on the transportation theory, the results indicated that movie transportation (i.e., movie immersion) had a significant impact on the viewers' affective place images, cognitive place images, and visitation interest. Regardless of movie content, the more the movie viewers were transported, the more favorable impressions they had for the featured tourism sites and consequently the more interested they were in traveling to the target place. Moreover, the results also demonstrated that movie transportation did weaken violent movie content's influence. Particularly, for the highly transported audience, there were no significant differences between the movie groups in terms of their perceptions of place images. However, significant differences were found among the audience that was not well transported. Finally, this study found that both affective place image and cognitive place image could enhance the viewers' visitation interest.

TI The effectiveness of movie trailer advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Prior to a movie release in theaters, trailer advertising provides valuable information that can help viewers and investors form expectations about the movie's future success. While previous research has looked at the financial implications of movie advertising budgets, the effects of trailers' creative characteristics on abnormal returns have not yet been investigated. Using a sample of movie trailers, results from our event study and cross-sectional analysis show that the appeal of the movie plot revealed in the trailer, the number of scene cuts and the inclusion of violent, sexual, or humorous scenes influence the movie's abnormal returns. However, the use of special effects in the movie trailer does not impact investors. Results also suggest that investors react more strongly to first than to follow-up trailers released for the movie, and that early release of the first positively impacts the movie's returns.

TI Schema strength, processing opportunity, and the rewarding nature of
   incongruity resolution in advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Extant literature calls for more research to identify the boundary conditions as well as the process underlying the effects of ad messages that violate specific brand beliefs. This paper examines different levels of ad brand incongruity, considering brand schema strength and processing opportunity as factors that influence the perception and the resolution of incongruity. Moreover, it provides empirical evidence for the process mediating attitudinal responses to ad brand incongruity. Experiment 1 shows superiority for moderately incongruent ads over congruent and extremely incongruent ads which is eliminated when participants have a weak, as opposed to a strong, brand schema. Experiment 2 replicates the nonmonotonic pattern for strong, real brands but further shows that low processing opportunity favors congruent ads. Mediation analysis reveals that the psychological satisfaction experienced during the ad interpretation process has an asymmetric mediating effect, such that moderate levels of ad brand incongruity generate highest levels of satisfaction which then leads to more positive responses.

AIE has been discussed by advertising scholars and used in some schools in South Korea since its inception approximately 10 years ago; yet, empirical research to prove its effect on education is rare. A field experiment using a pilot AIE program was implemented with third and fourth graders at two local elementary schools for 12 weeks. To measure the degree and significance of improvement in students' creative ability and creative personality, a series of pretests and posttests were administered using creativity measuring instruments. Results indicate that the AIE program has been effective in enhancing both creative ability and creative personality of elementary school students. Based on these results, several important implications were discussed and some directions for further research were suggested.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertisements often display ideal female bodies which create unattainable standards of beauty, generating body anxiety and disorders in female viewers. Accordingly, public health concerns would encourage the use of natural, unedited models in advertisements. However, the advertising performance of natural models remains contentious. We argue that previous inconsistent findings about this performance may result from a complex causal framework in which natural models impact performance through two affective mediators (body anxiety, and repulsion toward the model), while allowing moderation by the viewer's own body mass index (BMI). Data collected in a nationally representative sample of 400 young women largely (but not entirely) validate this causal framework. Natural models triggered repulsion in viewers with higher BMI, which hurt advertising performance. Body anxiety, however, was positively correlated with advertising performance, and did not mediate any effect of natural models.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Using two languages within an advertisement is increasing across many markets, throughout the world. By investigating code-switching effects between the Korean and English languages, this study is the first to directly test the Markedness Model perspective in the Korean marketplace. Furthermore, this study introduces a new type of code-switching (transliterated code-switching) between two alphabetic languages and assesses the impact of code-switching on advertising effectiveness across the different types. The results of Study 1 indicate that Korean-English (KE) code-switching and transliterated Korean-English (TL-KE) code-switching were significantly higher in attitude toward the slogan and product evaluation than English-Korean (EK) code-switching. However, there was no significant difference in the dependent variables between TL-KE and KE slogans. Study 2 tested the role of the perceived difficulty of the English words as a moderating variable. It was found that the KE slogan was more effective than the TL-KE slogan when difficult English words were embedded in the slogans, whereas no difference was found between the two slogans when the English words were perceived as easy. Implications for advertisers are presented and future research areas are discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Using a sample of over 5300 tweets from top global brands, this study investigated how different types of users can influence brand content diffusion via retweets. Twitter users who influenced followers to retweet brand content were categorized as (1) influentials, because of their above average ability to influence others to retweet their tweets (in general), (2) information brokers, because of their position connecting groups of users or (3) having strong ties, because of their high percentage of friends in common and a mutual friend follower relationship with the influenced follower. The results indicate that influentials and information brokers are associated with larger number of retweets for brand content. In addition, although information brokers have a larger overall influence on retweeting, they are more prone to do so when influentials are mentioned in the brand tweet, providing support for the strategy that aims to associate the brand with influential users.

TI Children and advergames: the role of product involvement, prior brand
   attitude, persuasion knowledge and game attitude in purchase intentions
   and changing attitudes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The central aim of this study is to build upon previous research by investigating the role of product involvement, prior brand attitude, persuasion knowledge and game attitude in the brand attitude changes and purchase intentions of children after playing an advergame. In all, 279 respondents between the ages of 10 and 12 years participated in the study. First, they were asked to complete a pre-test survey addressing product involvement and prior brand attitude towards several products and brands. Two weeks later, the respondents were asked to play an advergame and complete a survey addressing brand attitude, purchase intention, persuasion knowledge and attitude towards the game. Our analysis reveals that a positive attitude change is more likely when the game player has already evaluated the brand positively. Furthermore, game attitude is positively related to attitude changes towards the advertised brands, consistent with affect transfer theory. Counterintuitively, a higher level of persuasion knowledge is associated with a higher intention to buy the advertised product. Finally, children who had a more positive attitude towards the game were more likely to report higher purchase intentions, indicating that games which provide good experiences positively influence behavioural intentions. We conclude the paper by discussing the study's limitations and suggestions for future research.

TI Is advertising helpful for organic businesses? Differential effects of
   packaging claims
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB What claims should companies use to improve consumer perceptions of their certified organic products and help consumers differentiate them from conventional products? This study focuses on advertising specifically, on packaging claims that differ in their degree of explicitness and message topic. A laboratory experiment shows that a single claim positively influences perceptions of organic products, though additional claims can cancel out this positive effect. Different claims have distinct impacts on consumer perceptions. This study, thereby, reveals an effect of thematic scope: messages related to the environment have greater scope than those related to health, and they influence both environmental and health perceptions strongly.

TI Understanding responses to comedic advertising aggression: the role of
   vividness and gender identity
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB As the use of comedic aggression in advertising has become more frequent, questions about the boundary conditions of its effectiveness become more important. Issues related to the vividness of the aggression, unique audience responses, and legitimacy of the aggression are examined here as potential influences on the impact of comedic advertising aggression. Two experiments are reported that explore how reactions to comedic advertising aggression are influenced by components of vividness (concreteness - aggressive intensity, emotional interest - psychological distance), the audience's gender identity, and whether the aggression was provoked and justified. Feminine identity individuals in close psychological situations react quite negatively to advertising using the highest level of comedic aggression while masculine identity individuals actually prefer the most vivid aggression in some conditions. The response patterns become different for feminine and masculine identity individuals when the aggression is unprovoked and therefore less justified. The results provide guidance about the limits of using comedic advertising aggression.

TI Creating an effective code-switched ad for monolinguals: the influence
   of brand origin and foreign language familiarity
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigates the influence of brand origin and foreign language familiarity in code-switched (CS) ad effectiveness for monolingual consumers. CS ads refer to ads containing foreign words or phrases in an advertising copy (e.g., headline and slogan), resulting in a mixture of native and foreign languages. In this research, we conducted a pilot study to show the increasing trend of using code-switching in ads, regardless of whether the brands are local or foreign, in a monolingual market. We further examine if the effectiveness of CS ads is contingent on the brand origin among monolinguals. Study 1 showed that non-CS ads were perceived more favorably than CS ads for advertising a local brand. However, not all of the CS ads were perceived more favorably than non-CS ads when a foreign brand was advertized. The results of Study 2 showed that when a foreign brand was advertized, CS ads using a high-exposure foreign language were evaluated more favorably than CS ads using a low-exposure foreign language. Foreign language familiarity played a mediating role in the observed effects. We provide evidence that the research findings on CS ads among bilinguals cannot be applied to monolinguals. We discuss implications for international marketing and suggest advertising strategies for practitioners.

TI Celebrity trait transference: when brands pick up endorsers' personality
   traits
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research adds celebrity trait transference (CTT) to the psychological processes that can account for non-evaluative image transfer in celebrity endorsement. CTT was studied in three experiments. The first experiment found transfer of personality traits associated with three celebrities to nonfamiliar brands. Two additional experiments explored boundary conditions by using familiar instead of nonfamiliar brands. Results from the latter two experiments suggest that CTT can reinforce existing trait associations in familiar brands but is less likely to change or create trait associations. Unlike previous process studies of non-evaluative celebrity image transfer, the present research demonstrates transfer exclusively of the target personality trait with no effect on other traits. As the present study used a different methodology compared to previous research (single exposures to one celebrity-brand pairing vs. multiple exposures to several celebrity-brand pairings) the results were interpreted to mean that different processes account for celebrity image transfer under different circumstances.

TI How money priming affects consumers in an advertising context: the role
   of product conspicuousness and consumers' signalling needs
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Effects of money priming on basic psychological processes are well established in the literature. However, research that investigates money priming in an advertising context is scarce. This article presents two empirical studies examining consumer reactions after being primed with money and exposed to advertisements presenting either conspicuous or non-conspicuous products. Consumer reactions were investigated with respect to their attitude towards the ad, product evaluation and signalling needs. The findings indicate that the evaluation of a conspicuous product, and the respective ad promoting it, benefit from money priming while the evaluation of a non-conspicuous product is not affected. Moreover, money priming elicits signalling needs in situations where consumers are confronted with conspicuous products. Our moderated mediation models show that these signalling needs mediate the positive effects of money priming in conspicuous situations.

TI Transferring game attitudes to the brand: persuasion from age 6 to 14
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper aims to replicate previous findings regarding the differential impact of TV advertising and advergames on children's brand attitudes and pester intentions. Using a large data-set (N = 940, M-age = 9.8, SD = 2.4), with children ranging between 6 and 14years old, the influence of passive exposure to TV advertising is compared to active exposure to an advergame. In addition, the potential moderating effect of age is explored. In a between-participants experiment, Flemish children were randomly assigned to watch a TV ad, play an advergame, or a no marketing control condition. Results revealed that children who had played the advergame reported significantly more positive brand attitudes compared to children who had watched the TV ad and children in the no advertising exposure control group. Children's pester intent was significantly higher for the advergame compared to the TV ad, but not compared to the no advertising exposure control group. The findings further showed that children's attitudes towards the ad format mediate the impact of the advertising format on pester intent. The advergame was indirectly more persuasive than the TV ad since children reported more positive attitudes towards the advergame compared to the TV advertisement. Moreover, this mediation effect did not differ by children's age. Persuasion knowledge did not mediate the influence of the advertising format on pester intent since children's persuasion knowledge was not significantly related to pester intentions regardless of children's age.

AB This study investigates the effect of the type of logo used to promote co-products. In the case of an added logo, the logos of the constituent brands are lined up next to each other. An integrative logo is composed of the elements of both original brand logos. A novel logo does not contain any elements of the original brand logos. We found that the use of an integrative logo results in more favourable perceptions of brand cooperation, higher perceptions of co-product quality, more positive feelings and a more favourable attitude towards the co-product compared to the use of an added or novel logo. For a novel logo of co-products, consumers reported feelings of irritation and frustration and a less favourable attitude compared to an added logo.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Despite the vast literature on celebrity endorsements in advertising, research to date has not assessed whether and how celebrity-brand associations created via traditional endorsements or product placements compare to more natural associations that emerge from real-life celebrity images through social media. This experiment systematically compares the impact of different brand-celebrity associations on consumer perceptions of the celebrity's credibility and their responses to a new brand associated with that celebrity. The results reveal that, unlike more commercial brand associations, natural brand-celebrity associations can yield strong brand effects without eroding the celebrity's credibility. The findings are especially insightful given increasing numbers of natural brand-celebrity associations in social media.

TI Insight into everyday media use with multiple screens
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Multiscreening has been shown to affect consumers' brand attitudes and their memory of advertisements. However, little is known about the prevalence of using multiple screens simultaneously. The aim of this study is to provide insight into multiscreening by examining its prevalence, the composition of screens, and who is likely to multiscreen. A diary study with a representative sample of the Dutch population (n = 2,399) was conducted. First, the results showed that almost 60% of the participants multiscreened at least once. They multiscreened on average three days a week, mostly on Sundays, and on average more than 80 minutes per day. Second, the most prevalent screen combinations were TV-smartphone, TV-laptop, and TV-tablet. Third, multiscreeners were on average 41 years old, predominantly female, have a higher than average education, and own on average more than four screens. Finally, it was found that, in general, younger participants multiscreened longer than older participants.

AB What does it take to become a top advertising scholar in productivity? What drives impact in advertising research? This article sets out to answer these two questions by assessing the productivity and impact among scholars and their work in advertising since the millennium. As a two-part study, we begin by benchmarking and profiling the top 1% scholars in the field based on their research publications in the three top advertising journals (Journal of Advertising, Journal of Advertising Research, and International Journal of Advertising). Next, we employ a three-perspective conceptual model to identify the salient drivers of impact in advertising research. By content analyzing 1443 articles in the three journals published between 2000 and 2014, we show that certain universalistic and particularistic factors (to a lesser extent) significantly predict paper citations. Our findings reveal how advertising academia is advancing and showing signs of internationalization in the new millennium, which provides implications for the field's advancement and scholarship.

Participants in an experiment read the full text of a real short-story, which featured the target brand. Brand name repetition and brand familiarity were systematically manipulated. The results show that brand name repetition affects attitude towards an unfamiliar brand and readers' narrative transportation and NFC moderate this effect: Attitude towards the brand improves with repetition only when both transportation and NFC are relatively high. No effects were found for the familiar brand.

AB This study contributes to the growing body of literature investigating how and why consumers form connections to brands by applying an attachment theoretical framework. According to the attachment theory, children develop internal working models of the reliability of others in the interaction with the primary caregiver(s). It can be assumed that this attachment style, which is conceptualized along two dimensions (secure-anxious and dependent-independent), not only influences intimate relationships in the long run, but may also play an important role in customer relationships. The author investigates the influence of attachment style along the brand attachment - brand trust and brand loyalty chain. The sample consists of 216 adolescents. The results derived from structural equation modeling (SEM) by proposing a non-recursive model show that the dependent-independent dimension of parental attachment style positively influences the corresponding dimension of brand attachment predisposition and is important for all of the constructs along the brand attachment - brand trust and brand loyalty chain. However, this is not the case with the secure-anxious dimension of parental attachment style. The secure-anxious dimension of brand attachment predisposition does, on the other hand, have a significant impact at least on brand trust. The results are discussed from an attachment theoretical point of view and corroborate the suppositions of Rindfleisch, Burroughs, and Wong (2009), who grounded their findings on terror management theory. Several possible implications of these results for the theory and practice of brand management and advertising, especially in the light of the gamification of advertising, are discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines how people cope with the user-generated product reviews (UGPRs) found on various websites where anonymous web users post and share their personal product usage experiences. Based on information processing model of communication, we postulate that there are source, message, media, and receiver factors to influence individuals' psychological processing of the UGPR messages, and its subsequent behavioral outcomes. A survey was administered by a professional market research firm to 262 randomly selected US residents from 18 to 55years old. Consistent with the predictions, the results of the structural equation modeling analysis showed that the perceived source expertise, message objectivity, website credibility, and receiver-source similarity had positive and direct impacts on the perceptions of UGPR usefulness, which, in turn, positively influenced individuals' willingness to share product reviews with others. A series of causal model invariance tests also confirmed that the findings were statistically invariant across different subgroups divided by such factors as product categories, websites, subjective product class knowledge, past UGPR experience, and the susceptibility to informational influence.

It is suggested that consumers' attitudes toward the brand advertised through global positioning are influenced by their ideal selves and cosmopolitan orientations and these influences are moderated by one's self-esteem level. Study 1 shows that attitudes toward the globally positioned brand are more positive for those with ideal selves that are more congruent with personal traits associated with globally positioned brands, but only for those with high self-esteem. Interview results from study 2 suggest that low self-esteem informants make use of the global brands associated with Western' as a means of signaling their social selves in order to obtain social approval and that high self-esteem informants attend to ad content, whether the ad employs global or local positioning.

TI Cause-related marketing ads in the eye tracker: it depends on how you
   present, who sees the ad, and what you promote
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB We compare the effectiveness of three visual types of cause-related marketing ads (product-oriented vs. cause-focused with an image of the beneficiary's face- vs. cause-focused with an image of the social cause), along with two moderators: product type and gender differences. In Study 1, the results of an eye-tracking experiment show that a product-oriented ad leads to a longer fixation duration than does a cause-focused ad. Females process the ads faster than do males, regardless of visual type. A cause-focused ad for a hedonic product results in a shorter fixation duration when an image of the beneficiary's face is used than when an image of the social cause is used. The opposite results are observed for a utilitarian product. Gender differences enhance such differences in ad processing. Study 2 is conducted to validate the arguments for the hypotheses proposed in Study 1. We find that using a cause-focused image vs. a product-oriented image impacts the effectiveness of the ad since consumers process these different visual types of ads differently.

TI Disentangling location-based advertising: the effects of location
   congruency and medium type on consumers' ad attention and brand choice
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Research on location-based advertising (LBA) suggests that the merits of LBA lie in the fact that consumers can be targeted with location-congruent ads on their personal mobile devices. However, LBA consists of two underlying constructs: a mobile (vs. point-of-sales) advertising medium and location congruency (vs. location incongruency). This study aims to disentangle these underlying constructs by showing that they differentially affect the efficacy of an ad. Using a virtual reality lab experiment, this study shows that location-congruent ads result in increased choice for the target brand as compared to location-incongruent ads, independent of medium type. However, in location-incongruent situations, mobile ads attracted more attention than point-of-sales display ads. The advantages of LBA thus do not seem to emanate from medium type, but rather from the congruency between the ad and product location. When the ad is received at a different location than the product, the mobile medium is able to enhance consumers' ad attention.

TI Processes and effects of targeted online advertising among children
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Increasingly, information from children's profile pages on social network sites is being used to target online advertising, a phenomenon known as profile targeting. This practice has raised concerns in society and academia; however, its effects among children remain unstudied. Therefore, we investigated the effects of profile targeting on children's brand responses (i.e., brand attitude and purchase intention). We examined two types of targeting: targeting of product and of form (i.e., color). In addition, we tested three underlying mechanisms: liking the advertisement, perceived personal relevance of the advertisement, and recognizing the targeting aspect of the advertisement (targeting recognition). A between-subjects experiment among 231 children aged 9-13 years showed that targeting the product leads to more positive brand attitudes and purchase intentions. In addition, the effects were explained by ad liking and not by perceived personal relevance or targeting recognition. These findings suggest that, unlike adults, children do not process profile targeting on an elaborate critical level. Rather, the processing seems to be less elaborate.

TI How long does celebrity meaning transfer last? Delayed effects and the
   moderating roles of brand experience, celebrity liking, and age
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Extending previous research on celebrity endorsements, the study investigates whether the meaning of celebrities is transferred to endorsed brands and how transfer effects develop over time. Additionally, the moderating roles of brand experience, celebrity liking, and consumers' age are investigated. The hypothesized effects are modeled using a propositional learning approach with an experimental repeated-measures design (panel data). Results confirm the assumed meaning transfer effect. In addition, the effects appear to be substantially stronger after about a week indicating some type of sleeper effect. Furthermore, the effects increase with increasing brand experience and celebrity liking. Adolescent consumers are not differently affected when compared to adults and controlled for the differing levels of brand experience. Results are discussed in light of propositional learning theory. Future areas of research are proposed.

TI Exploring how consumers cope with online behavioral advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study explores how consumers cope with a computer technology-driven persuasion tactic called online behavioral advertising (OBA). By tracking consumers' online behaviors, OBA delivers highly tailored advertising messages to individual consumers, giving rise to serious privacy concerns due to their covert nature. Integrating the persuasion knowledge model and the protection motivation theory, we employed a survey method (N = 442) to examine how consumers cope with OBA based on their persuasion knowledge, cognitive appraisal, and cognitive processing variables. The results reveal that persuasion knowledge was indirectly associated with coping behavior of ad avoidance throughout cognitive appraisal process (perceived risks; perceived benefits; self-efficacy). Privacy concerns partially mediated such associations with ad avoidance. Interestingly, cognitive processing variables (reactance; perceived personalization) were significantly associated with ad avoidance without being related to persuasion knowledge. The implications for theoretical, managerial, and social contributions are discussed.

TI Brand placement in text: the short- and long-term effects of placement
   modality and need for cognition
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The present research explores how placing a brand name in the dialogue versus the narration of a fictional text (i.e. placement modality) affects brand attitude and purchase intention. Moreover, it studies the moderating role of need for cognition (NFC) and measures brand responses both immediately after exposure and two weeks later. As predicted, encountering a brand name in the dialogue as compared to in the narration of a story is associated with lower brand attitudes for readers with high NFC at both measurement points. Purchase intentions are similarly affected, but the effects are only significant at a delay. In contrast, brand evaluations of readers with low NFC are largely unaffected by placement modality.

TI Marketing through Instagram influencers: the impact of number of
   followers and product divergence on brand attitude
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Findings of two experimental studies show that Instagram influencers with high numbers of followers are found more likeable, partly because they are considered more popular. Important, only in limited cases, perceptions of popularity induced by the influencer's number of followers increase the influencer's perceived opinion leadership. However, if the influencer follows very few accounts him-/herself, this can negatively impact popular influencers' likeability. Also, cooperating with influencers with high numbers of followers might not be the best marketing choice for promoting divergent products, as this decreases the brand's perceived uniqueness and consequently brand attitudes.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The dissemination and utilization of personal mobile social network services (SNS) have created new trends. The effects of the increase in the use of the hashtag are especially significant for brands that seek to use electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) in the rapidly changing environment of SNS marketing strategies, as it supplements their quick merchandise turnover rates. This study aims to examine the advertising effects of marketing activities (product, place, promotion, and price) and the hashtag used in the SNS advertising of SPA brands. The research collects words related to SPA brands through the analysis of the data of SNS utilized over six months. To test the hypothesis, an experimental design of 4 (product/place/promotion/price) x 2 (hashtag/no hashtag) was carried out. The results showed that the differences for various types of SNS fashion marketing, broadening the scope of existing research studies that focus on the impact of SNS in the marketing environment.

TI When brand-related UGC induces effectiveness on social media: the role
   of content sponsorship and content type
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB With the growing power of brand-related user-generated content (UGC) on social media, marketers have begun incorporating UGC into the marketing mix as part of word-of-mouth marketing. Drawing upon the Persuasion Knowledge Model, this study examines how content sponsorship interacts with content type to influence consumer responses toward brand-related UGC (inferences of manipulative intent, brand attitude, and intention to click on a URL). The results of an experiment with an online panel in the United States show that when the content is organic (i.e. unpaid), experience-centric content is more likely to induce favourable consumer responses than promotional content. When the content is sponsored (i.e. paid), however, promotional content yields more effective results than experience-centric content. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that consumer inferences of manipulative intent serve as a mediator for the interaction effects between content sponsorship and content types on consumer responses.

TI The interconnected role of strength of brand and interpersonal
   relationships and user comment valence on brand video sharing behaviour
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study addresses gaps in our understanding of viral advertising by examining the following questions: (1) how do brand relationships, interpersonal relationships, and user comment valence influence decisions to accept referrals of and re-share online video ads, and (2) how do the roles of each intertwine to influence those decisions. A national sample (N = 405) of 18- to 34-year-old Facebook users participated in a 2 (stronger/weaker brand relationship strength) x 2 (stronger/weaker interpersonal relationship strength) x 2 (positive/negative user comments) experiment. The results show that interpersonal relationships, brand relationships, and valence of user comments play different, but intertwining roles in social networking site users' acceptance of viral video ads and decisions to re-share. Interpersonal relationships most strongly influenced ad referral acceptance while brand relationships and comment valence drove re-sharing. A three-way interaction, however, revealed that positive user comments greatly strengthen the brand's impact on referral acceptance; negative comments strongly negate brand influence.

AB Researchers have often attempted to answer the question, Does sex sell?' In this article, we present a meta-analysis of studies that used an experiment to test the effect of sexual appeals in ads on memory, attitude, and purchase intention. Our analysis revealed a significant positive effect for sexual appeals on ad recognition and recall (weighted Cohen's d = .38, p < .001), but the effect on brand recognition and recall was not significant (d = .09, p = .30). We also found that the effect of sexual appeals on attitude towards the ad was not significant (d = -0.07, p = .26); however, additional analysis showed that males (d = .27, p < .01) evaluate ads with sexual appeals significantly more positively than females (d = -.38, p < .001). Finally, we found a small significant negative effect on brand attitude (d = -.22, p < .05), but no effect on purchase intention (d = .01, p = .94).

TI Trust in online recommendations: an evolutionary psychology perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) is playing an increasingly important role in influencing consumer behavior, and it represents another opportunity for marketers to build support for their brands. This study explores how the gender of the reader influences how eWOM is perceived. An experiment grounded in evolutionary psychology examines how males and females differ in their perceived trust of eWOM of positive, negative, or mixed valence. The results indicate that females place greater trust than males in eWOM messages. But both genders find eWOM of mixed valence more trustworthy than entirely positive or negative eWOM. A follow-up phenomenological study of male and female consumers who had experienced eWOM shed more light on the experimental findings and offers additional support for their evolutionary basis. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed as well as recommendations for further research.

TI Temporal duration and attribution process of cause-related marketing:
   moderating roles of self-construal and product involvement
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Applying the self-construal (SC) temporal match effect to a cause marketing context, this study investigated the conditions under which cause-related marketing campaigns generate stronger altruistic attributions of sponsor motives and subsequently purchase intention. As major factors, temporal duration (long-term vs. short-term), SC (independent vs. interdependent), and product involvement (high vs. low) were incorporated in the integrative model and the three-way interaction effect on altruistic attributions was assessed. With the use of online experimental data from 323 college students, the matching effect of temporal duration and SC was found, such that independent individuals were influenced by the message that was framed with the distant, long-term duration. Our findings further found that this matching effect was more pronounced for the high-involvement product, but not for the low-involvement product. In addition, this study discovered that altruistic attributions mediated the effect of temporal duration on purchase intention in the low-involvement product condition, but not in the high-involvement condition. Theoretical and managerial implications were discussed for researchers and practitioners.

TI Children's attitudinal and behavioral reactions to product placements:
   investigating the role of placement frequency, placement integration,
   and parental mediation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The role of placement characteristics such as brand integration and placement frequency for brand outcomes on children has largely been ignored in extant research. We also lack insights about parental mediation as a potential moderator in this context. The present paper describes an experimental study in which children were exposed to different versions of a cartoon movie which included a moderately or frequently placed chips brand. The brand was either presented as a screen- or as a plot-placement. Children's attitudinal and behavioral outcomes were matched with surveys completed by their parents who answered questions about their mediation strategies. Compared to screen-placements, moderately and frequently presented plot-placements lead to an increase in children's product choice. Parents' advertising mediation strategies were not able to prevent this behavioral outcome. Our findings offer insights into children's susceptibility to product placement effects relevant to parents, educators, and policy regulators.

The results showed that the net generation and the newspaper generation, but not the TV generation, were clearly distinct in the frequency of their media use in all six countries. For advertising attitudes, generational patterns were visible, however, neither for all media nor in all countries. When generational differences did occur, the net generation was on the positive end, whereas the newspaper generation was usually the most negative. For advertising avoidance, generational patterns were less present and consistent. The findings point out interesting directions for future research. Practical implications for advertisers and media planners are discussed.

TI Right metaphor, right place: choosing a visual metaphor based on product
   type and consumer differences
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research examines the effectiveness of different metaphor types (juxtaposition vs. replacement vs. fusion) while taking into account the potential impacts of product type, consumer gender differences, and consumer cognitive capacity. The experimental results indicate that ads with metaphors are more effective than those without, regardless of the type of metaphor being used. For females, a replacement metaphor is more effective in ads for search products', while a juxtaposition metaphor is more effective in ads for experience products'. Juxtaposition metaphors are more effective for males, regardless of product type. When the focus is narrowed to the cognitive capacity of female participants, metaphor type and product type are found to have an interactive effect on females with high cognitive capacity. Fusion metaphors have the advantage when promoting a search product to high cognitive capacity females. The results suggest that practitioners can more effectively promote their products by choosing the right type of metaphor.

In addition, we investigate the moderating role of review readers' product category involvement and susceptibility to interpersonal influence on the effect of the three review components. The influence of review text valence on evaluative responses is stronger for more highly involved people and for people who are more susceptible to interpersonal influence. The influence of rated review usefulness on review impression is marginally stronger for people who are more susceptible to interpersonal influence. Star ratings do not influence evaluative responses, and their effect is not moderated by either involvement or susceptibility.

TI On electronic word-of-mouth diffusion in social networks: curiosity and

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The rapid proliferation of social networking sites (SNSs) provides marketers with ample opportunities to explore advertising strategies based on electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). With that in mind, this study aims to understand the influence of the eWOM diffusion process on SNSs. We propose a theoretical framework to investigate the roles of curiosity and influence in SNS users' decisions to adopt eWOM and to pass it along to their contact groups. Two forms of curiosity, specific and diversive, are proposed to initiate specific exploration (consistency checking and knowledge-based validation) and diversive exploration (referral visit behavior), and eventually, adoption and pass-along behavior. In addition, SNS influence, formed by maven, persuasiveness, and connectivity, is proposed as a moderator affecting information diffusion. The proposed framework is empirically validated using the data collected from online surveys of 590 Facebook users. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising situated in environments where people congregate or pass through on their way to somewhere else benefit from being placed in such high traffic areas. However, these strategically placed ads also suffer from conditions of human crowding that prevents them from being noticed and processed. We undertake a study of place-based advertising in a shopping mall using facial recognition software to determine the effect of human density on the attention directed to advertising. We find that as human density increases, attention to advertising decreases, but only to a point where it begins to increase again. Our research also finds that human density plays a moderating role on the motivation to process advertising.

TI The multidimensionality of anthropomorphism in advertising: the
   moderating roles of cognitive busyness and assertive language
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Anthropomorphized brands or products in advertisements are known to affect consumers' attitudes in a positive direction. However, most research treats anthropomorphized stimuli as the same in both its design and effects. We explore the multidimensional nature of anthropomorphism in advertising by investigating two degrees of humanization (i.e. subtle vs. overt) that generate different outcomes in terms of advertising performance. For example, we find that consumers prefer ads that use overt humanization (compared to subtle and no humanization) when an ad uses assertive language (i.e. Buy NOW!); however, they prefer ads that use subtle humanization when coupled with ads that do not include assertive language. We find a similar pattern when consumers are cognitively busy. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed.

TI Television advertising television: measuring the ability of television
   promos to deliver ratings for new programs using single-source data
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The entertainment industry relies heavily on advertising to attract audiences. This article demonstrates a method to measure the effect of on-air television promotions, or promos, on viewing behaviour, based on a well-established single-source method for determining the causal impact of advertising on sales. We illustrate this method on 18 new prime-time programs, showing that promos have a positive impact on viewing behaviour. Exposed viewers are substantially more likely to view the premiere episode of a new series, across a wide range of different television-viewing weights, frequency of promo exposures and program types. The research also shows evidence of reach-based scheduling strategies being generally more efficacious than frequency-based strategies. These findings provide guidance to help networks implement their promo strategy more effectively, as well as a method for future research into the effectiveness of television promos as this approach can be utilized in any country with a television ratings panel.

TI Family-based treatment for obesity in tweens: a three-year longitudinal
   follow-up study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Children's increasing obesity worldwide is creating negative health and socioeconomic drawbacks. To find the determinants of obesity, this research looked at the influence of (1) media usage; (2) advertising messages/brand recognition; and (3) communication or lack of communication between parents and their children on obesity and food-related Purchase Influence Attempts (PIAs) of tweens. A 3-year longitudinal follow-up study was conducted with 68 families whose children were either obese or at risk of becoming obese. The subjects were divided into the following four groups: (1) media amount was controlled; (2) brand recognition was controlled; (3) communication channel of family members was controlled; and (4) all three conditions were controlled. Our results showed significant weight-loss and reduction in PIAs in all groups except in group 2 (brand recognition controlled). This work shows the importance of changing habits using behavioural treatment and the importance of communication among family members on obesity prevention.

TI Studying the impact of religious symbols on domestic violence prevention
   in India: applying the theory of reasoned action to bystanders'
   reporting intentions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Using the theory of reasoned action (TRA), the study examines the process of religious beliefs, social norms and attitudes toward women to predict people's intentions to intervene when confronted with domestic violence. Drawing from a nationwide sample in India and the religion of Hinduism, the structural equation modeling (SEM) findings show support for the hypothesized models. The religious symbol primed one's level of religiosity, generating positive ad attitudes and intentions to report domestic violence. For both ads, beliefs in gender equality and social norms about helping were critical to reporting intentions. More importantly, the study extends the TRA by showing religion's relevance in public service persuasion. The study provides both theoretical and managerial implications as well as avenues for future research.

TI The use of sampling methods in advertising research: a gap between
   theory and practice
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In this research note, we reflect critically on the use of sampling techniques in advertising research. Our review of 1028 studies published between 2008 and 2016 in the four leading advertising journals shows that while current academic literature advocates probability sampling procedures, their actual usage is quite scarce. Most studies either lack information on the sampling method used, or engage in non-probability sampling without making adjustments to compensate for unequal selection probabilities, non-coverage, and sampling fluctuations. Based on our results, we call on researchers to revisit the fundamental aspects of sampling to increase their research results' rigour and relevance.

TI The current state of knowledge on electronic word-of-mouth in
   advertising research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB With the development of new and digital media, consumers are increasingly giving, seeking, and sharing their brand-related experiences via online channels that lead to electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication. Undoubtedly, eWOM has a powerful impact on advertising decisions, and the practice of eWOM advertising has received much attention from advertisers, policy-makers, and the academic community. It is clear as well that, eWOM is believed to influence and shape the future of advertising. Therefore, the purpose of this article is threefold. First, this article provides an overview on the current state of eWOM research, with a focus on how this research has evolved in the advertising literature. Second, we identify and characterize four important trends in the eWOM advertising literature: eWOM and viral advertising, effects of eWOM, drivers of eWOM, and new technologies and eWOM platforms. Third, we develop a research agenda by providing directions for future research as well as implications for advertisers and policy-makers.

TI #Me and brands: understanding brand-selfie posters on social media
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Marketing scholars and consumer psychologists are turning their attention to the increasing proliferation of selfies. This study investigates a new type of electronic word-of-mouth, namely, selfies with brands/products (brand-selfies'), on social networking sites, and considers three factors as predictive of brand-selfie posting behaviour: narcissism, materialism, and beliefs that social networking sites are sources of brand information. Data from an online survey were analysed using discriminant analysis to identify characteristics of consumers that do or do not post brand-selfies. The results found that narcissism, materialism, and the belief that social networking sites were brand/product information sources meaningfully related to social networking sites' users' brand-selfie posting behaviour and that they differentiated between brand-selfie posters and non-brand-selfie posters. Consumers' perceptions of social networking sites as sources of brand/product information were most strongly predicted by their brand-selfie posting behaviours. Areas for future research are discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The role of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) has been recognized by marketers and academics, but little research has examined the impact of eWOM on purchase behavior. Building on dual-process models of persuasion, this study aims to disentangle the effect of different online review features (i.e. argument quality, review valence, review helpfulness, message sidedness, source credibility and reviewer recommendation). Using product reviews and purchase data from an online retailer website, we investigate the financial impact of online product reviews on purchase decisions. The results demonstrate the persuasive power of different review features that are derived from dual-process models of information processing. Managerial implications on how advertisers and companies should design and manage online product reviews are offered.

TI Preannouncement messages: impetus for electronic word-of-mouth
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB To enhance public opinion, firms must establish effective communication strategies before introducing new products to the market. One of the most popular strategies is to make new product preannouncements (NPPs) to attract consumer attention and create positive buzz. The authors of this paper offer theoretical insights into the relationship between NPPs and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). They conduct three experiments to investigate the effects of NPP message clarity and brand characteristics on eWOM. In Study 1, they find that consumers are more likely to disseminate eWOM when NPPs have high rather than low clarity. In Study 2, they show that brand familiarity moderates the effects of NPP message clarity. In Study 3, they show that brand preference moderates the effects. Marketers can use the findings to establish more effective NPP communication strategies that signal brand information. Theoretical implications are discussed.

TI Do we always adopt Facebook friends' eWOM postings? The role of social
   identity and threat
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In this research, we explore the role of social identity and threats to social identity on consumers' judgment and behavioural intention about electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on Facebook. Study 1 shows that sharing social identity with a Facebook friend increases perceptions of usefulness and behavioural intention to adopt eWOM. However, when a threat to social identity is posed, these positive effects are eliminated. Study 2 reveals an opposite condition wherein a threat to social identity results in associative responses to eWOM. When the social identity is perceived as impermeable (vs. permeable), threats that are posed toward the social identity increase perceived eWOM usefulness and adoption intention. eWOM source identification is revealed as an underlying mechanism explaining this relationship. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.

Results from a 2 (Brand Feedback: Present/Absent) x 2 (Causal Attribution: Brand/Reviewer) x 2 (Products: Laptop/TV) between-subjects online experiment suggest that brand feedback had a simultaneous positive and negative effect on purchase intentions, whereby brand trust mediated the positive effect. Attribution of the product's problem did not significantly change this effect. Findings help to clarify the literature by describing mechanisms through which brand feedback occurs to influence brand outcomes.

TI Positive uncertainty: the benefit of the doubt in advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Positive uncertainty refers to uncertainty surrounding an anticipated positive outcome. It provides consumers with the opportunity to imagine and speculate on a product's or experience's potentially positive characteristics. Research has shown that when uncertainty is associated with something positive, consumers may prefer uncertainty to certainty. In a between-subjects experimental design with a large US (n = 446) and Japanese sample (n = 453), the present study demonstrates that positive uncertainty increases consumers' positive feelings when they evaluate a product, particularly for high-involvement products that allow consumers to imagine and speculate about potentially positive product benefits. Unexpectedly, the study findings are consistent across the two different markets, which vary substantially in terms of consumers' level of uncertainty avoidance. Specifically, results show that future-framed advertisements are effective in generating positive uncertainty and that positive uncertainty generates positive attitudes, both in countries scoring high (Japan) and low (USA) on uncertainty avoidance.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The present research examined how individuals' cultural orientations influenced the relationship between their construal level and temporal distance. There were two studies in this research. In study 1, the relationship between culture and construal level was examined through the Behavior Identification Form. In addition, the influence of culture on temporal distance and individuals' construal level was investigated by analyzing participants' descriptions of their lives. In study 2, the three-way interaction between culture, temporal distance, and construal level frame of persuasive messages (desirability vs feasibility focused message) was investigated. A total of 503 (study 1 - 279 and study 2 - 224) students from two different countries (Korea and the United States) participated in the study. The findings revealed that individuals' cultural orientations influenced their construal level and perceived temporal distance. Consistent results were found in an advertising context. When individuals from a collectivistic culture were in a proximal temporal condition, they tend to show a more favorable attitude toward the ad emphasizing the feasibility features of the product. The reverse was true for individuals from an individualistic culture.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A multi-method study was conducted to examine different advertising claims in current food advertising and to determine the effectiveness of different advertising claims on females' evaluative judgments of food advertisements. Content analysis results of 678 women's magazine food ads indicated functional food ads appeared to adopt nutrition appeals without taste claims and a combined use of nutrition appeals and taste claims, whereas hedonic food ads tended to use taste claims without nutrition appeals. Nevertheless, these food advertising practices were called into question by the results of two experiments, showing the combined use of nutrition appeals and taste claims was the most effective strategy for both hedonic and functional foods. However, for hedonic foods, advertisers need to include more congruent than extremely incongruent claims. Implications for food advertisers and policy-makers were discussed.

TI Disclosing brand placement to young children
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In spite of the EU's prohibition on brand placement in children's programmes, it is argued that children may still be exposed to this advertising format in many occasions. Consequently, and as children may have even more difficulties than adults to distinguish the commercial content from the editorial media content in which it is embedded, an advertising disclosure may be necessary to enable them to cope with brand placement. Entailing two one-factorial between-subjects experiments, the current article examined how different types of brand placement warning cues influenced cognitive advertising literacy and the attitude toward the placed brand, among children between 8 and 10years old.
   In a first study, it was investigated how these outcomes were influenced by warning cues with different perceptual modalities (no vs. auditory vs. visual cue, N = 98). The results showed that a visual warning cue was more effective than an auditory warning cue (vs. no warning cue) in addressing cognitive advertising literacy. However, this higher cognitive advertising literacy could not account for the effect of the visual warning cue on brand attitude.
   In a second study, it was examined whether the effectiveness of this visual warning cue was influenced by the timing of disclosure (cue prior to vs. during media containing brand placement, N = 142). Additionally, it was tested whether the effect of the cue on brand attitude could be explained by cognitive advertising literacy if children's sceptical attitude toward the brand placement format was taken into account. The results showed that cognitive advertising literacy was higher when the cue was shown prior to than during the media content. This cue-influenced cognitive advertising literacy resulted in a more positive brand attitude, but only among children who were less sceptical toward brand placement. This positive relation disappeared among moderately and highly sceptical children.
   These findings have significant theoretical, practical and social implications.

TI Explaining the use and effects of humour in advertising: an evolutionary
   perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Prior reviews have outlined the state of research of humour in advertising and showed that some findings deserve further explanations. This paper makes the point that evolutionary psychologists' explanations of the functions of humour can provide new or alternative explanations for these findings and suggest new research avenues. The evolutionary functions of humour have been widely discussed in the literature, but advertising researchers have neglected biological nature and biological evolution as additional or alternative explanations for humour in advertising. The paper contributes to the advertising literature and broadens perspectives for research on humour in advertising by reviewing research on the evolutionary functions of humour, by showing how these functions can explain the use, effects, and moderators of humour in advertising beyond the explanations provided in prior literature, and by suggesting new propositions for future research on humour in advertising.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB New technologies enable practitioners to communicate scents in advertisements on various media. The current research examines the importance of matching scent cues to the advertised product, and the joint effect of scent and other cues such as colour on consumer responses to advertising. A 4 x 2 experimental design was conducted, where participants (N = 603) were presented with scented colour print advertisements. Three hierarchical responses were measured: emotional response, attitude, and purchase intention. Findings reveal that higher congruence between scent and the advertised product heightens positive consumer response. Furthermore, this research stresses the significant joint effect of scent and colour cues, and supports the incongruence approach, suggesting that combining scents that are poorly congruent with other sensory cues enhance consumer response. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

TI An investigation of the influence of cinema environment on advertising
   effectiveness
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Many advertisers are looking to cinema advertising as a nontraditional medium to reach consumers. Although several scholars have examined the effectiveness of this advertising vehicle, there is a dearth of empirically grounded research on how to improve such effectiveness. This study, based on the reactance and the equity theories, is probably the first academic project investigating how to manipulate an advertising environment in a real movie theatre to maximize advertising effectiveness. Results indicated that audiences in a distractive environment held a more positive attitude toward cinema advertising in general, but those in a restrictive environment were more likely to remember the advertised brands. In addition, the provision of ticket price information improved audiences' acceptance of cinema advertising, but did not enhance recall. Moreover, the influence of ambient scent emitted into the atmosphere in a cinema room on ad recall dissipated when movie viewers became accustomed to such stimuli. Based on these findings, theoretical discussions and recommendations for practising managers were made.

TI Development of the Persuasion Knowledge Scales of Sponsored Content

CY 2017
CL Ghent, BELGIUM
AB Despite the popularity of the Persuasion Knowledge Model, and its persistent relevance given the omnipresence of sponsored content (e.g. brand placement in TV programmes and video games, or paid product reviews in blogs), the way scholars measure persuasion knowledge varies widely. This study aims to develop valid and reliable scales for standardized measurement of consumers' persuasion knowledge of sponsored content. In three phases, we developed the Persuasion Knowledge Scales of Sponsored Content (PKS-SC) that measures nine components: (1) recognition of sponsored content, (2) understanding of selling and persuasive intent, (3) recognition of the commercial source of sponsored content, (4) understanding of persuasive tactics, (5) understanding of the economic model, (6) self-reflective awareness of the effectiveness of sponsored content, (7) skepticism toward sponsored content, (8) appropriateness of sponsored content, and (9) liking of sponsored content. All scales have good to appropriate validity and reliability. Recommendations for future research are discussed.

TI Look at that body! How anthropomorphic package shapes systematically
   appeal to consumers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT International Conference on Research in Advertising (ICORIA)
CY 2017
CL Ghent, BELGIUM
AB The manuscript identifies how anthropomorphized packages elicit aesthetic appeal. Specifically, we shed light on the effectiveness of applying evolutionary relevant shapes, which are figures of attractive female (i.e. hourglass-shaped) and male (i.e. V-shaped) bodies, to consumer goods' package design. Results of two lexical decision tasks (Study 1a and 1b) show that when consumers observe a package shaped after an ideal body figure, the mental schema of the human body spontaneously becomes activated. In turn, accessible knowledge of the activated schema influences consumer responses. Two studies (Studies 2a and 2b) demonstrate that packages of gender-neutral consumer goods shaped after an ideal body figure generate aesthetic appeal and favourable product evaluations. A final study (Study 3) reveals that when the package of a gender-specific consumer good is being anthropomorphized, a gender-schema congruity effect occurs: aesthetic appeal is elicited when the package shape is congruent with the target user's ideal body figure.

   three levels: an international study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT International Conference on Research in Advertising (ICORIA)
CY 2017
CL Ghent, BELGIUM
AB Given the increasing relevance of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs to individuals' health and well-being, this study explores whether selected health variables, as well as consumers' attitudes and skepticism towards advertising in general, influence their attitudes and skepticism towards pharmaceutical advertising. It extends previous research by building on the theory of inter-attitudinal consistency, examining how three different levels of attitudes and skepticism are interrelated. A field study was conducted on three continents (727 subjects; non-student sample). Results reveal that consumer attitudes and skepticism towards advertising in general, influence attitudes and skepticism towards pharmaceutical advertising in particular, which positively impact the attitudes and skepticism towards four different ad appeal types. The study extends the theory of inter-attitudinal consistency to inter-skepticism consistency. Results further indicate that attitudes and skepticism towards advertising in general can be considered as key antecedents, but that several additional health-related factors also influence consumers' attitudes and skepticism towards pharmaceutical advertising. Moreover, attitudes and skepticism towards advertising in general, towards pharmaceutical advertising, as well as towards specific pharmaceutical ads, are negatively related. Reasons explaining these results are addressed, as are study limitations and implications for future research.

   field experiments
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT International Conference on Research in Advertising (ICORIA)
CY 2017
CL Ghent, BELGIUM
AB Creative media (CM) advertising is an advertising strategy wherein a non-traditional medium is creatively used for advertising purposes. This novel advertising strategy is gaining marketers' interest; however, little is known about its persuasive effects on consumers' cognitive, affective and behavioural responses and the processes that underlie them. Therefore, to convey a genuine experience to consumers, two field experiments with a one-factor (advertising type: creative vs. traditional) between-subjects design were conducted within a supermarket context. Results showed that creative (vs. traditional) media ads not only improve consumers' affective and behavioural responses but also consumers' cognitive responses. Even though no mediations were found through perceived surprise or perceived persuasive intent, results do provide evidence for the notion that perceived humor and perceived value are the underlying mechanisms through which affective and behavioural responses to creative media advertising can be explained.

AB Television is undergoing tremendous technological developments, which will enable marketers to direct commercial messages to more specific audiences at the individual and/or household level. Traditional ways of buying TV advertising are being challenged by the programmatic approach, which originated with search and display ads, and uses data and technology and real-time auctions to automate transactions between buyers and sellers. We discuss the changes to TV that enable the rise of programmatic models and propose that its future success depends on the coordination and availability of three factors, abbreviated DAD: distribution, ad inventory and data. We also elaborate on the effects of media context and how the TV program environment matters for advertising effectiveness. Finally, we discuss the future of TV advertising and related research needs.

CY 2017
CL Ghent, BELGIUM
AB Research investigating the drivers of consumers' engagement with brands on social media is proliferating. However, little is known about how advertising outside social media drives engagement with brands on social media. This study aims to explore the relation between advertising spend in different offline media (TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, out of home), and reach of and engagement with brand pages on Facebook. The study uses a unique real-life data-set containing information about the Facebook pages of 45 brands for approximately three years combined with Nielsen Advertising Spend data. Results showed that while advertising in offline media influenced organic and viral reach, the number of page likes was directly influenced by advertising on Facebook only. It can be concluded that offline advertising is relevant in driving consumers' online brand engagement; however, there is a unique set of drivers for organic reach, viral reach and likes.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT International Conference on Research in Advertising (ICORIA)
CY 2017
CL Ghent, BELGIUM
AB This study tests a theoretical framework to explain the persuasive impact of interactive magazine ads on consumers' ad and brand attitudes. To obtain realistic (unforced) responses, a field experiment was conducted with a one-factor (interactive vs. non-interactive magazine ad) between-subjects design (N = 98). Results showed that, although they rarely used it, participants positively evaluated the presence of an interactive feature in a digital magazine ad. Furthermore, parallel-mediation analyses revealed that the interactive magazine ad was perceived as more interactive and more surprising than the non-interactive ad, which ultimately positively impacted consumers' attitudes towards the magazine. A second real-life setting experiment (N = 121) confirmed and extended these findings by revealing that the mediation effects were even stronger when consumers had used the interactive feature (vs. only seen). In addition, the relationship between interactive magazine ads and consumers' attitudinal responses was explained slightly better by 'perceived surprise' than by 'perceived interactivity.'

TI Let's Get Real (Time)! The potential of real-time marketing to catalyze
   the sharing of brand messages
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT International Conference on Research in Advertising (ICORIA)
CY 2017
CL Ghent, BELGIUM
AB Social media are increasingly populated with brand messages that are linked to timely events, a practice that is also known as real-time marketing (RTM). In this study, we examine whether RTM is an effective strategy to boost sharing behaviour, and if so, what moment-and content-related characteristics contribute to its effectiveness. A content analysis of brand tweets from Nielsen's top-100 advertisers (n = 1500) shows that RTM positively affects word of mouth. RTM is especially a more effective strategy when brand messages are linked with unpredictable events (vs. predictable). This can be explained by the meaningfulness dimension of creativity; brands make a more meaningful connection to timely moments in unpredictable RTM than in predictable RTM. Furthermore, we found support for the beneficial effects of moment-driven visuals; RTM messages are shared more when public events are visually integrated with those messages. No such effect was found for moment-driven hashtags.

TI Placing snacks in children's movies: cognitive, evaluative, and conative
   effects of product placements with character product interaction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Type of placement integration has been shown to influence placement effects in adults. However, no studies have explored the role of character product interaction (CPI) for product placement effects on children. We also lack knowledge about the moderating role of age in this context. We therefore exposed N = 363 children aged 6-15 years to a movie containing no placement, a static placement, or a CPI placement. The presence of placements affected cognitive and conative brand outcomes. However, children's product memory and consumption were higher for CPI placements compared to static placements. As a relevant implication for product placement research, we found that brand outcomes were independent of the children's ages and prior movie familiarity. This suggests that children's developmental stage concerning age does not mitigate product placement effects. Implications for educators and consumer advocates are discussed.

TI Caring for her: the influence of presumed influence on female consumers'
   attitudes towards advertising featuring gender-stereotyped portrayals
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigates how presumed influence on others affects women's evaluations of advertising featuring gender stereotypes. Previous research has largely overlooked the social context of the reactions to gender stereotypes. Addressing that gap, this study draws on the influence of presumed influence model to proposed that female consumers believe that other women are negatively affected by advertising that contains gender-stereotyped portrayals. This perception is hypothesized to influence ad and brand attitudes as consumers 'punish' the brand for hurting others. The results of two experimental studies featuring stereotyped and non-stereotyped advertising portrayals indicate that the hypothesis holds for two types of stereotype components (physical characteristics and role behaviour). This new theoretical perspective to the literature on gender stereotypes in advertising, one that helps to explain why many women dislike gender stereotypes in advertising even though those stereotypes often have limited impact on them personally.

AB The present study aims to explore the moderating effect of culture-related values on responses to male and female gender role stereotyping in advertising. Based on an experiment in Sweden (n = 507) and Germany (n = 506), we test the impact of respondents' masculinity, power distance, assertiveness values and feminine role orientation on ad attitudes and brand attitudes. The results show that, in general, perceived stereotyping contributes positively to ad and brand attitude, and this effect is enhanced for more masculine, more power distant, more assertive and less feminine-role oriented individuals. In addition, consumers respond more negatively to perceived female stereotyping compared to male stereotyping, and this is especially true for more power distant and more assertive individuals.

TI Using humour to increase effectiveness of shameful health issue
   advertising: testing the effects of health worry level
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Communicating shame-inducing health issue information is a challenging task as the feelings of shame might elicit withdrawal and avoidance coping, leading to delay in health screening and treatment. With the cognitive and emotional buffering benefits, using humour as a message strategy might help increase approach coping. Real-world ad campaigns dealing with these health issues have been using humour as an advertising tool, and with the lack of humour effects research in health communication, this is a pending topic to pursue. Given that past studies have found health worry to be a significant contributing factor in health behaviours, the audience factor of the individual's general health worry level is investigated. Three experimental studies provide evidence to humour benefitting low health-worry-level individuals in lower shame contexts and high health-worry-level individuals in higher shame contexts. Theoretical and practical implications provide the significance of the findings.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study employs an interpretive historical analysis of the themes presented in the leaflets produced by South and North Korea during the Korean War. The themes are analysed into four categories: appeals of ideology, personal gratification, communal values, and information dissemination. The most prominent themes of the ideology appeal are those of toadyism, social system criticism, and attacks on the leader of the opponents. Of the personal gratification appeal, themes include persuading opponents to surrender for personal safety, health, and to gain a sense of belonging. Communal value appeal emphasized the Korea's unique characteristics of one blood, one nation, and one ethnicity mentality to promote the authenticity of each side. Information dissemination contained warnings of bomb attacks, claims of superiority in firepower, and assertions intended to disguise the real situation of the war.

TI Modelling the dimensionality effects on brand placement effectiveness in
   stereoscopic 3-D versus 2-D sports games
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This current study explores how stereoscopic three-dimensional (3-D) dimensionality affects the process by which viewers' memory of brand names embedded in a soccer game is formed compared to the memory process in traditional 2-D display. To this end, we conduct two studies: a qualitative observation using an eye tracker; and an experiment to identify the difference and similarity of the viewing process across these two display technologies. Statistical test results reveal that sports involvement enhances viewers' attention to a sports game, which is moderated by game enjoyment and negative viewing experience generated from the media features. Most importantly, it is found that as viewers pay more attention to a sports game in stereoscopic 3-D display, they are less likely to remember the brands embedded in the stadium, while the opposite is found in 2-D display. More findings and implications are discussed in the discussion section.

AB Product placement research tends to show how product placements impact consumer behaviour but less research examines the nature of product placement execution. This is the first study to examine product placement execution in Asia focusing on Hong Kong prime-time television programmes. Specifically it explores the prevalence of brand appearances, characteristics of programmes linked to brand appearances, features of placed brands and products, modality of brand appearances, character interaction with placed products and the placement context. It was found that integrating brands in television programmes in Hong Kong seems to be well supported by advertisers, with one brand appearing in every 11 minutes of programming. Less than half of brand appearances were disclosed at the end of the programmes, while none were disclosed prior to the programme which raises questions about regulation of the practice. Results of the analysis provide useful insights into the practice of product placement in this fast growth context and its (dis)connection with existing product placement literature.

The aim of the study was to review CRM persuasion research and to integrate the findings into a theoretical framework that could direct future research efforts in the area. Drawing on Bergkvist and Taylor's model of Leveraged Marketing Communications (LMC), a dual-path model of CRM persuasion effects was developed. According to the model, CRM affects brand evaluations along two paths: the indirect transfer path which is mediated by attribution of motives and the direct transfer path in which attitude towards the cause is transferred to the brand. The model incorporates results from extant research and provides guidance for future studies.

   on Chinese travellers' eWOM
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB 'Friends' circles' on WeChat have helped make eWOM more easily accessible and influential than ever. Drawing from the social identity theory, literature on consumer engagement and eWOM, this study presents the first research that examines the influence of two personality traits, sense of belonging and need for self-enhancement, on consumer engagement and in turn leads to eWOM intention. The results suggest that the need for self-enhancement positively influences Chinese travellers' engagement with WeChat. In addition, a partial positive relationship between consumer engagement and eWOM intention was identified: only dedication towards WeChat is directly related to travellers' intention to engage in eWOM on WeChat. Dedication was found to mediate the influence of need for self-enhancement on eWOM intentions. Sense of belonging, however, does not have a significant impact on consumer engagement. These mixed results demonstrate changing cultural values of contemporary Chinese society. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Online streaming and DVRs have spurred the use of products placed within the storyline of a show to be an opportunity for advertisers to offer a message to their consumer about a brand even with the possibility of entirely avoiding commercial pods. This study examines wishful identification as a concept that mediates the relationship between favourite fictional character attributes, and buying behaviours and brand trust of products/brands used by a favourite character in a television show. Results indicate that wishful identification does, in fact, persist beyond the viewing experience. Additionally, the attribute of admiration and a combination of attributes we label the 'Ideal Character' is most predictive of wishful identification and our purchase intention dependent variables.

TI Aspects of visual metaphor: an operational typology of visual rhetoric
   for research in advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Metaphor is routinely expressed through pictures in contemporary advertising. Earlier work on visual rhetoric in advertising sought direct analogues for the tropes and schemes specific to verbal rhetoric. More recently, theory has developed out of characteristics particular to pictures, culminating in a typology of visual rhetoric by Phillips and McQuarrie. Subsequent work by Sorm and Steen considers processing stages in metaphorical interpretation. Phillips and McQuarrie's typology is adapted and expanded here in order to better describe the variation found in ads that utilize visual metaphor and its allies, thus identifying a range of examples that confound the original. A new processing model that directly addresses visual features described in the expanded typology is outlined, which builds on ideas from Sorm and Steen, but represents a distinct framework. Additional variables are identified that advertising researchers should either investigate or control in experimental studies of visual metaphor.

TI An empirical investigation on the antecedents of consumers' cognitions
   of and attitudes towards digital signage advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper investigates the antecedent factors of consumers' perceived values and attitudes towards digital signage advertising in a structural model. The results of this study revealed that four key antecedents (i.e. informativeness, involvement, entertainment and targeting) affect consumers' attention to digital signage advertising and perception of advertising values. This study shows that attitudes towards digital signage and perceived interactivity with it also affect consumers' attitudes towards digital signage advertising. This, in turn, influences positive attitudes towards a brand and higher purchase intentions.

   context of CSR advertising in an East Asian market
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The study examines how, across generations, Korean consumers perceive corporate social responsibility (CSR) ads when various ad appeals (help-self vs. help-other) are employed. The findings show that younger consumers have bicultural orientations compared to older consumers who have collectivistic cultural orientations. The findings showed that younger consumers were more likely to form favourable attitudes toward CSR ads and products when they viewed help-other ad appeals over help-self ad appeals compared to older consumers. Furthermore, the study revealed that variability in biculturalism plays a significant role in viewing CSR ads with help-self ad appeals. Further managerial implications and future study ideas are discussed.

TI 'How do you feel about a disease?' The effect of psychological distance
   towards a disease on health communication
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Based on construal level theory, this research addresses the moderating role of an individual's psychological distance towards a disease in the effectiveness of advertising messages framed by two distinctive construal level terms (high-level and low-level). In Experiment 1, two different disease types (bronchitis/distant disease vs. influenza/proximal disease) were featured, with the result that an advertisement with high-level construal terms was more persuasive for a psychologically distant disease (bronchitis) than for a psychologically proximal disease (flu). The reverse was true for an ad framed with low-level construal terms. To replicate Experiment 1 and further test the hypothesis, in Experiment 2, the perceived distance individuals have towards one disease (cancer) was measured and used as independent variable. Consistent with the results from Experiment 1, the low-level construal messages were more effective under the psychologically close condition than the psychologically distant condition. Reverse was true for the high-level construal messages.

TI Using eye-tracking to understand the impact of multitasking on memory
   for banner ads: the role of attention to the ad
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Media multitasking is on the rise due to the adoption of new technologies such as smartphones and tablets. In this article, we study how visual attention affects the impact that media multitasking has on brand recognition. We theorize that media multitasking will have a different impact on brand recognition depending on whether consumers pay attention to the ad. We tested our hypothesis by creating a laboratory experiment that simulates consumers' internet browsing experience. We exposed participants to two conditions - executing one task (no multitasking condition) and executing two simultaneous tasks (multitasking condition) - and identified when participants paid attention to the banner ad using an eye-tracking device. In line with our theory, our results indicate that multitasking decreases brand memory but only when participants do not pay attention to the banner ad. The implications of this finding for researchers and advertisers are discussed.

TI Advertising targeting young children: an overview of 10 years of
   research (2006-2016)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A review of 138 published academic articles was conducted to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of academic research of the past decade (2006-2016) on advertising directed to young children up to 12 years old. The research overview resulted in a conceptual framework comprising five research domains that were found to be most prominent. For each of these five domains, an overview, discussion and future research agenda is presented. We conclude that much of the research of the past decade included food advertising and its effects. Progress has been made in the domain of children's advertising processing, specifically with regard to advertising literacy. Despite the growing importance of embedded advertising, many of the new ad formats remain neglected (e.g. native and mobile advertising). Additionally, only a few studies investigated which executional factors (e.g. humour) are effective in advertisements to target children and social influences are also less often considered.

TI Consumers' responses to native vs. banner advertising: moderation of
   persuasion knowledge on interaction effects of ad type and placement
   type
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Applying advertising contextual theory, we examined the conditions under which native advertising embedded in a news website was more effective. With the use of college students (n = 189), a 2 (type of ad: native vs. banner) x 2 (type of ad placement: solo vs. duo) x 2 (persuasion knowledge: high vs. low) online experimental design was employed. In the solo condition, native advertising was evaluated more favorably than banner advertising in perceived fit, ad credibility, brand attitudes and click intention. Significant interaction effects between ad type and placement type were found on all dependent variables, with native advertising showing a significant decrease in duo (vs. solo) placement. These interaction effects appeared to be more pronounced for consumers with high persuasion knowledge, confirming its moderating role. Theoretical and managerial implications were discussed regarding the strategic placement of native advertising in news websites.

TI How brands appear in children's movies. A systematic content analysis of
   the past 25 Years
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Based on a theoretical framework of product placement characteristics, we present the most comprehensive content analysis of children's movies to date. We analyzed the integration of brands in 250 movies from 1991 to 2015. We found that 64.4% of all movies contained at least one brand placement. Comedies and movies produced in the US contained a higher number of brand placements compared to other genres and non-US movies. Animated movies and movies presenting a nature-, or fantasy-scenery contained a comparatively low number of placements. Brands were inserted mostly visually, and placed in the centre of the screen without explicit evaluation. Placements frequently presented a physical or verbal interaction with a main character. This practice was found to increase over time even though the sole number of brand placements remained stable over the past 25 years. Implications for parents, consumer-advocacy-groups, and advertising researchers are discussed.

TI Measures of aesthetic dimensions and reactions in advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising increasingly uses discrepant imagery featuring unsettling portrayals rather than traditional imagery featuring aspirational models, products, and settings. Thus, the need for more valid and reliable measures has limited much research investigating advertising aesthetics to conceptual or qualitative approaches. To meet this need, the current research applies art and aesthetic theory in developing scales that measure aesthetic dimensions and reactions of advertising visuals. First, it develops and validates measures for the aesthetic dimensions of ideal beauty and the antithetical aesthetic as well as aesthetic reactions of transgression and artistic quality. Then, it demonstrates predictive validity by testing each dimension's influence on aesthetic reactions, attention, and attitudes toward the ad and brand.

TI Factors affecting family firms' communication behaviour: a
   cross-cultural study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study explores heterogeneity in family firms' communication behaviour across cultures. The authors propose that variations in the background of family firms, including culture, industry, public or private status, and age, influence their propensity to reference their family identity on their corporate web communications. Websites have become an increasingly important medium of marketing communications in today's interconnected world. Yet, limited research has been done to understand firms' web communication behaviour. Based on a study of 432 family firms from 41 countries across the world, this research empirically demonstrates that family firms which are from collectivist cultures and publicly traded are significantly less likely to reference their family identity in online marketing communications compared to their counterparts. In addition, the research shows that there is an inverted-U curvilinear relationship between a family firm's age and the likelihood of referencing their family background. Contributions and implications of the research and findings are discussed.

TI Exploring the impact of affect on the effectiveness of comparative
   versus non-comparative advertisements
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Affect is important in advertising, but it has not attracted sufficient attention in the research of comparative advertising. Two studies were conducted to explore how affect influences the effectiveness of comparative versus non-comparative advertisements. Study 1 focused on context-induced affect and showed that participants with positive affect expressed more favourable attitudes toward a comparative advertisement than a non-comparative advertisement. Study 2 addressed the coexistence of context- and ad-induced affects. Results showed that in the condition of positive context-induced affect, participants liked a comparative advertisement more than a non-comparative advertisement when ad-induced affect was positive. However, they evaluated both types of advertisement similarly in a negative manner when ad-induced affect was negative. In the condition of negative context-induced affect, participants expressed more favourable attitudes toward the advertisement eliciting positive affect than the one eliciting negative affect (regardless of ad type). These studies provided theoretical and practical implications, as well as directions for future research.

TI The impact of regulatory focus on adolescents' evaluation of targeted

AB This article examines whether individual differences in chronic regulatory focus (prevention vs. promotion focus) among adolescents influences the way they evaluate targeted advertising on social networking sites. Study 1 (survey) reveals that adolescents with a promotion focus (who are oriented toward achieving positive outcomes) have a more positive attitude and a higher purchase intention toward targeted advertising, as compared to prevention-focused adolescents (who are dispositioned toward avoiding negative outcomes). Study 2 (experiment) investigates how adolescents' chronic regulatory focus can alter their attitude and purchase intention on a mock social networking site that includes a targeted advertisement. Results show that a low personalized targeted ad is better evaluated (in terms of a more positive attitude and higher purchase intention) among prevention-focused adolescents, whereas a high personalized targeted ad results in better advertising outcomes among promotion-focused adolescents. Contributions to theory and implications for advertising practice are discussed.

AB This research examines how the commonality or difference in ethnicity between consumer and celebrity endorser affects the attractiveness and trustworthiness consumers ascribe to recognizable brand spokespersons. Three studies reveal two potential routes through which such effects arise. When the message was limited to simple endorser identification or when priming focused the consumer's processing on his or her own felt ethnicity, common ethnicity facilitated favourable perceptions across both attractiveness and trustworthiness. In a more complete ad-processing environment, without specific priming of the consumer's personal ethnic identification, more complex and variable attractiveness and trustworthiness judgments arose.

TI Lose like a man: body image and celebrity endorsement effects of weight

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Recent research suggests men are increasingly concerned with their body size, which has led to a corresponding increase in marketing efforts for weight loss products geared toward them. In many cases, these ads include athlete endorsers of the product. Drawing from the match-up hypothesis and social comparison theory, this study employed structural equation modeling to explore relationships between men's body image, endorser credibility, advertisement believability, and purchase intentions for weight loss products using two advertisements featuring former professional athlete endorsers. Results indicate an inverse relationship between consumer body image and athlete endorser credibility, such that individuals with lower body image perceived the endorsers as more credible. Further, athlete endorser credibility was positively associated with advertisement believability, which itself was associated with purchase intentions. These findings suggest that athlete endorsers are an effective tool in marketing weight loss products to men, particularly those with negative body image. Further implications and directions for future research are discussed.

TI Does humour travel? Advertising practices and audience effects in the
   United States and People's Republic of China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Humour in advertising is long-established, but whether such appeals travel across cultures is debatable. Two studies investigated the impact of country and individual-level cultural differences on the use and effectiveness of humorous advertising in the United States (USA) and People's Republic of China (PRC). The first study examines current practice and replicates previous findings that certain humour mechanisms (incongruency-resolution contrasts) are universal across cultures. The second study examines audience effects for a specific humour type (aggressive). At the national level findings are contrary to expected with Chinese showing higher perceived humour for aggressive themes than did Americans. At the individual level, cultural values best explain the varying effectiveness of aggressive humour appeals. Interestingly, the findings of both studies show that what advertisers practice is not always in line with audience expectations. Implications on how humour can transfer successfully across cultures is discussed, and directions for future research offered.

TI Can premium private labels compete with luxury brands: the impact of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Increasingly, high-end retailers in various parts of the world are marketing premium private label products. This study examines the degree to which advertising can lead premium private labels to be perceived as luxurious and the factors that enhance this perception. Using a theoretical framework based on cue utilization theory and categorization theory, a model is proposed to describe the key factors driving perceived luxuriousness. The findings generally support the model and suggest that premium private labels should be advertised in a way that maximizes the image difference in comparison to regular private labels and equates them to a leading national brand. Additionally, advertising that emphasizes the superiority of the label's quality relative to competitors and strong image congruity between the store and the brand can improve consumer perceptions of private label luxury brands. It is also found that store type (department store vs. hypermarket) influences the perceptual factors that drive perceived luxuriousness.

TI Asymmetric negative influence of cynicism and skepticism: a study of
   preventative communication
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB It has been known that skepticism and cynicism are similar with each other as part of a continuum from trust to distrust in the message and that both skeptics and cynics are typified by beliefs that they could be misled by the marketing communication. However, skepticism and cynicism differ from each other in the distrust in communication contents versus communication motives. Skeptics tend to search information to discern truth of the communication content while cynics who tend to infer a selfish motive behind the communication when they are pressured by others in authority. The present study emphasizes the difference between skeptics and cynics in responding to public and commercial communications, by focusing on the compliance with preventative communications. In general, literature finds that the increase in threat or fear level contributes to the persuasion of preventative communication. However, past studies also suggested that increasing the level of threat or fear may backfire. Given the controversy over the positive and negative effects of increases in the level of threat or fear, the present study compares the effect of threat-appeal communication on attenuating and accentuating the negative effects of skepticism and cynicism. Study one shows that, exposed to a public communication that lacks threat, cognitive elaboration on the message has a positive effect on compliance with the communication, only for skeptics. Study two shows that, in the context of public communication, increases in threat level attenuate the negative effect of skepticism on persuasion while they accentuate the negative effect of cynicism. Study three replicates study two in the context of commercial advertising. Extending the failure of threat appeal to persuade cynics, study four shows that the preventative communication employing a humor appeal on the threatening issue is effective in persuading cynics but not skeptics.

We further investigated the moderating role of recipients' narcissism in the effect of personalization. Results show that individuals higher in narcissism paid greater and more frequent attention to ads personalized on an individual level than to those personalized on a group level, while individuals low in narcissism showed no such differences. Regarding attitudinal response, consumers with a high level of narcissism tended to have a more favourable attitude towards the individual-level personalized ad compared to those with a low level of narcissism, while consumers with a low level of narcissism tended to have a more favourable attitude towards the group-level personalized ad compared to those with a high level of narcissism. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

TI Adolescents' responses to social media newsfeed advertising: the
   interplay of persuasion knowledge, benefit-risk assessment, and ad
   scepticism in explaining information disclosure
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Integrating the persuasion knowledge model (PKM) and privacy calculus model (PCM), this study examines how adolescents' persuasion knowledge and benefit-risk assessment of social media newsfeed advertising (SMNA) influences their coping responses. An online survey of 305 Facebook users aged 13 or older in the U.S. shows that adolescents' persuasion knowledge of SMNA has a positive impact on their benefit assessment (message relevance), but not on risk assessment (privacy risk). Furthermore, adolescents' benefit-risk assessment has an effect on their scepticism toward SMNA, which in turn leads to information disclosure on Facebook. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings and directions for future research are discussed.

TI Personalized charity advertising. Can personalized prosocial messages
   promote empathy, attitude change, and helping intentions toward
   stigmatized social groups?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines the role of personalized charity advertising in promoting empathy, attitude change, and helping intentions toward stigmatized social groups. Based on theories of message involvement, empathy, and reactance, we predicted that higher levels of involvement elicited by a personalized charity advertisement would reinforce empathy and prosocial outcomes. An online experiment was conducted using a personalized and a nonpersonalized version of a charity advertisement for a campaign soliciting donations of winter coats for homeless people. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed a positive indirect effect of personalization on prosocial outcomes (attitudes and behavioural intentions toward homeless people, and willingness to donate to the campaign) that was mediated by involvement and empathy. However, in addition to promoting involvement and empathy, personalization also led to heightened reactance, which detracted from the positive effects. Theoretical as well as practical implications of the findings for personalized charity advertising are discussed.

TI How sponsorship transparency mitigates negative effects of advertising
   recognition
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The proliferation of covert online advertising formats such as advergames has raised concerns about consumers' ability to recognize such content as advertising and about how recognition affects evaluative outcomes. The present research utilized an online experiment (N = 179) to examine differences between covertness of advertising format (advergame vs. online video commercials) on advertising recognition, and whether sponsorship transparency mediates - and mitigates - the negative effects of advertising recognition on attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the brand, and purchase intent. The results show that covertness of advertising format, recognition, and sponsorship transparency all shape consumers' responses to online ads. Specifically, the predicted negative indirect effect of covertness of advertising format on attitudes and behavioral intention via advertising recognition reversed valance when sponsorship transparency was included in the serial mediation model.

TI Gender differences in arousal priming effects on humor advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Numerous studies have observed arousal and mood effects on ad processing, but no study has examined the ways in which the core arousal effect in humor advertising, which could make or break humor advertising effectiveness, could be boosted or hindered. To address this gap, we investigated arousal priming effects and its influence on humor ad responses, using gender as a moderating variable. Two experimental studies tested the interaction between (a) low and high arousal priming effects and (b) gender on consumer responses to a subsequent humor ad. The results show that men and women responded differently to humor ads presented after low vs. high arousal level primes. A moderated mediation analysis revealed that felt arousal during humor ad exposure was an underlying mechanism. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

TI The impact of self-construal and message frame valence on reactance: a
   cross-cultural study in charity advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In the context of charity advertising, this two-study design project aims to contribute at the intersection of three literatures: psychological reactance theory (PRT), messaging framing, and self-construal theory. Using a survey with student samples from the US and China, Study 1 demonstrated that self-construal affected reactance, such that independent self-construal was more associated with reactance. Further, it outperformed cultural background in predicting reactance. People with predominantly interdependent self-construals showed higher intention to purchase a product with social causes. Study 2 was a 2 (framing: gain vs. loss) x 2 (self-construal: independent vs. interdependent) between-subjects experiment using a non-student sample in the US results on the associations between self-construal and reactance and the intent to donate were consistent with findings of Study 1. Study 2 also indicated that compared to gain-framed appeals, using loss-framed appeals in charity advertising generated more reactance, the gap was more pronounced among individuals with relatively higher interdependent self-construals (i.e. moderate and high levels of interdependent-independent self-construal). This project offers important theoretical and applied implications and provides a robust avenue for future research. Limitations were also outlined.

TI IMC in digitally-empowering contexts: the emerging role of negotiated
   brands
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In current digitally-empowering contexts, the Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) paradigm may have lost its 'original' customer-centric focus. Drawing on service-dominant logic, the paper examines the changes to IMC when multiple sources of consumer power emerge as central in the value creation process. This change in the focus of IMC likely enables the emergence of negotiated brands, i.e. brands that focus on a marketplace where traditional marketer-created brand value may be replaced by buyer and seller co-created value. The paper argues that this novel type of brand structure represents an appropriate managerial response to multidimensional IMC approaches. As that occurs, four key issues (community-centric orientation, emergent strategy, hybrid communication mix, reciprocity-based assessment) emerge which lead to a number of research questions in the planning and execution of marketing communications in today's digitally-empowered contexts. All these issues clearly highlight the consumers' contributions to brand value co-creation, by reaffirming the 'original' outside-in perspective of IMC.

TI Eat, drink, and create content: a multi-method exploration of visual
   social media marketing content
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB As visual social media marketing (VSMM) content continues to increase in popularity, it is imperative for marketers to understand the elements of such marketing efforts that capture consumers attention. Across three empirical studies, the researchers use eye tracking technology and a scenario-based experimental design to explore the impacts of the use of figurative language (i.e., antithesis and alliteration) and Snapchat's drawing feature on consumers attention to the verbal element (i.e., caption) of company-generated and consumer-generated VSMM content (i.e., snap), specifically, on Snapchat. Results demonstrate the positive impact of the use of figurative language on consumers attention to the caption in VSMM content. Furthermore, consumers attention to the caption in company-generated (consumer-generated) VSMM content is greater when the caption uses antithesis (alliteration). Finally, the presence of pictorial information (i.e., drawings) in VSMM content may impact the relationship between the use of figurative language (i.e., alliteration) and consumers attention to the caption in consumer-generated VSMM content. Implications for marketing and advertising theory and practice are discussed.

AB The present research examines how quantitative and qualitative aspects - volume and valence - of eWOM on various social media platforms in the movie industry, along with other forms of marketing communications (e.g. advertising expenditure), predict box office and DVD sales for pre- and post-periods of movie releases. The analysis of aggregated big data from multiple sources - 65,665,859 social media postings from blogs, forums, news, and Twitter, Nielsen's ad expenditure data, and Rotten Tomatoes ratings for 170 movies-revealed that the explanatory power of the model for box office revenue and DVD sales mostly comes from the volume, rather than valence, of eWOM.

TI The effect of price fluency and duration framing in price advertisements
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB We examined how the perceptual fluency of prices would interact with the time framing of discount durations and, thereby, affect consumer responses to price advertisements. We propose that consumers would perceive a fit or unfit from the relation between fluency and time framing because both concepts relate to consumer construal and consumer mindsets. Our two experiments supported the positive impact of fit on consumers, showing that when the discount duration was presented either in a small unit (i.e. days) or in an expansive time frame (i.e. anytime), participants showed a higher intention to buy the product if prices were fluent (vs. disfluent) to process. In contrast, when the duration was expressed in a large unit (i.e. week) or in a restrictive time frame (i.e. only), participants' purchase intention was higher if prices were disfluent (vs. fluent). Moreover, in Experiment 2, participants experienced more positive emotions when a fit (vs. unfit) existed between price fluency and duration framing, leading them to perceive the product to be of greater value.

TI Imagination matters: do consumers' imagery processing and
   self-regulatory goals affect the persuasiveness of metaphor in
   advertising?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In this paper, we show that individuals' self-regulatory focus and imagery processing affect the persuasiveness of metaphorical advertisements. Study 1 show that metaphorical advertisements enhance persuasion only among individuals who are promotion focussed. They attenuate brand evaluation among prevention-focussed individuals. In Study 2, a regulatory fit between message frame and regulatory focus results in more favourable brand evaluations only among promotion-focussed individuals when a promotion-framed metaphorical advertisement is presented. In Study 3, the level of imagery processing mediates the interaction effect of metaphorical advertisements and regulatory focus on brand evaluation. Study 4 reveals that brand evaluation is enhanced when promotion-focussed consumers view a metaphorical advertisement without interpretative cues. However, the brand evaluation of prevention-focussed consumers is enhanced when they view a metaphorical advertisement with interpretative cues.

TI Naming strategies as a tool for communication: application to movie
   titles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Product naming is regarded as one of the most important communication decisions for firms to deliver information on their new products, particularly in the case of products with unobservable attributes, such as motion pictures, music, books, and games. Despite its importance, there has been little research on "how to name a product" as a communication decision. Hence, we propose a conceptual framework to describe naming decisions as two-stage strategic decisions. The first-stage decision involves "what kind of information to be communicated via product names," which we call the "information choice" strategy. The second-stage decision is how to express this information through product names, which we call the "expression" strategy. We applied a two-level hierarchical Bayesian model to a data set consisting of opening weekend box-office sales, names, and release dates for 393 movies released in seven countries. Our empirical study provides useful findings on movie naming. First, the information choice for movie titles significantly impacts movies' viewership. Second, the effects of "what to choose" depend on "how to express". Third, significant interaction effects occur between information choice strategies and product characteristics, which implies that naming strategies depend on the product's characteristics. One particularly noteworthy finding in this study is that although it is common sense to avoid negative wording in product names in most industries, negative content in movie titles positively impacts box-office sales.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Present research builds upon native advertising research by examining the roles of advertising message relevance, consumer-brand relationship strength, and authorship. Two national experiments were conducted among active Twitter users ages 18-34. In Study 1 (N = 147), a 2 (disclosure: tweet/promoted tweet) X 2 (high-/low-ad message relevance) experiment showed that while disclosure had no effect on advertising outcomes, strong message relevance effects were present. Study 2 (N = 363), a 2 (weaker/stronger brand relationship strength) X 2 (disclosure: tweet/promoted tweet) X 3 (authorship: brand/influencer/peer) design, found that consumer-brand relationship strength also directly and positively influences attitude towards the brand, purchase intention and sharing intention; while significantly enhancing the positive message relevance impact on sharing intention, relevance's impact on purchase intention was lessened. Greater consumer-brand relationship strength influence on attitude towards the brand and purchase intention was present when native ads were authored by peers rather than brands or influencers.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Celebrity endorsement has been prevalent as an advertising strategy, and many advertisers invest enormous amounts of money into celebrity endorsements. While previous studies have found that the success and failure of celebrity endorsements are related to their attractiveness, expertise, and trustworthiness, it is not known how and which sources of celebrity endorsements can explain firm value, which is a very important factor for firm sustainability. By text mining and sentiment analysis, this research found that increasing the positive source of the celebrity's attractiveness and expertise has a positive impact on firm value, whereas the loss of the celebrity's trustworthiness severely deteriorates firm value. Once a celebrity has lost his/her trustworthiness, the negative impact is almost never recovered, given that the negative interaction effect between the positive impact of celebrity expertise and the loss of his/her trustworthiness is over seven times greater than the positive effects from his/her expertise.

TI When are personalized promotions effective? The role of consumer control
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The development of technology-mediated media has enabled marketers and advertisers to use personalization when interacting with customers. In this article, we explore two boundary conditions (i.e. task difficulty and relevancy) and two consumer controls (i.e. behavioral control and cognitive control) that affect the effectiveness of personalized promotions. In Experiment 1, we find that consumers working with difficult tasks exhibit higher behavioral control and higher patronage behaviors when they receive personalized than non-personalized promotions. In Experiment 2, we show that when consumers receive any promotion with irrelevant items, they exhibit higher cognitive control and higher patronage behavior with non-personalized (with many irrelevant items) than personalized (with one item) promotions. An additional test validates that behavioral and cognitive control play significant mediating roles in the relationship between contexts (i.e. task difficulty and relevancy) and patronage behaviors. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications for the development and management of personalized promotions and consumer control in new media-oriented environments.

TI Online shopper engagement in price negotiation: the roles of culture,
   involvement and eWOM
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The strategy of inviting online shoppers to negotiate product prices has been employed by numerous online sellers due to its benefits for buyers and sellers. Social media facilitates sharing information regarding such economic benefits among shoppers, thereby generating eWOM, which boosts online social commerce. Yet not all buyers choose to embrace sellers' offers to negotiate product price. In the current paper, we employ consumer culture theory and the elaboration likelihood model to theorize the effects of culture and involvement on consumer engagement in price negotiation. Two studies were designed to test the proposed conceptual framework. Based on eBay transaction data (N = 498), Study 1 supported the hypothesized positive main effects of collectivism and involvement on shoppers' engagement in price negotiation. Study 2 demonstrated, in a controlled laboratory setting (N = 468), the moderating effect of eWOM on these relationships. When other buyers shared information regarding price negotiation, the positive effect of collectivism on negotiation was mitigated, and the effect of involvement was strengthened. These findings have significant theoretical, practical, and social implications.

TI Talking about CSR matters: employees' perception of and reaction to
   their company's CSR communication in four different CSR domains
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Drawing on signaling and social identity theories, we analyze how liking of the company's CSR advertisements, message credibility, and cause-company fit influence employees' evaluation of their organization's CSR engagement and how this relates to employees' job satisfaction, organizational pride, and word-of-mouth about CSR. CSR is analyzed in four different domains: customer-oriented, employee-oriented, environment-oriented, and philanthropy-oriented CSR. Results of a study with the employees (n = 432) of a large European energy provider reveal that the cause-company fit of CSR engagement has the highest impact on evaluation of the CSR engagement in all CSR domains. Message credibility is important for the evaluation of CSR in the customer-oriented, environment-oriented, and philanthropy-oriented domains, while, noticeably, ad liking only shows an impact in the employee-oriented domain. CSR evaluation influences job satisfaction, organizational pride, and word-of-mouth in all four CSR domains, with some domain-related differences. Implications for CSR advertising, directions for future research and limitations are discussed.

TI Indirect, so it is persuasive. But not for me: the role of
   metaphoricthinking tendency
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT International Conference of Asian-Marketing-Association (ICAMA)
CY 2018
CL Bangkok, THAILAND
SP Asian Mkt Assoc, Korean Mkt Assoc
AB We examine the persuasiveness of advertising messages based on individuals' tendency towards metaphoric thinking measured by metaphor usage measure (MUM) and construal level. Two on-line studies show that individuals' metaphoric thinking tendency moderates the perceived persuasiveness of advertising messages (metaphor vs. non-metaphor) and that construal level mediates this effect. Study 1 shows that MUM moderates the effect of message type demonstrating that individuals with high MUM evaluate a metaphoric message more persuasive. Study 2 demonstrates that this interaction is mediated by construal level. Analysis using PROCESS macro revealed that construal level decreases after being exposed to a metaphoric message which is opposite to what was expected. Additional analysis was performed to probe a possible cause for this unexpected finding. Although it is premature to conclude, it appears that shift-in-emotion in high-level construal may need further investigation. In addition, findings suggest that metaphor may be effective only to those who are in a high tendency towards metaphoric thinking.

AB The present study provides an experimental extension for and empirical investigation of the rival-benefiting effect of advertising, which refers to the positive effect of a brand advertisement on the attitude towards or even actual sales of a rival brand. First, the authors experimentally present that the rival-benefiting effect of advertising is more likely when the rival brand is a major one. Second, for external validity, they present a methodological framework for the estimation of the rival-benefiting effect and empirically investigate the effect by applying the presented framework to real market data. Consistent with the experimental finding, the empirical investigation found that the rival-benefiting effect was stronger when the rival brand of the advertiser was a major brand. Finally, the study concludes with a summary on the limitations of the approach, along with future research opportunities.

TI Gendering conversational humor in advertising: an evolutionary
   explanation of the effects of spontaneous versus canned humor
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In this paper, we rely on evolutionary psychology to examine how the use of spontaneous versus canned humor affects response to advertising among male and female consumers. The results of three experimental studies indicate that response to advertising varies as a function of the type of humor employed and the gender of the message recipient: women's responses to spontaneous humor are more positive than to canned humor, while men's responses are unaffected by humor type. The interactive effect is mediated by the perceived humorousness of the ad, and the message recipient's interest in pursuing romantic activities increases the effect on perceived humorousness. These results contribute to advertising research by providing an evolutionary explanation for gender-specific responses to humorous advertising.

TI Construct heterogeneity and proliferation in advertising research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper presents results from a study of measurement practice in leading advertising journals. The focus is on heterogeneity in measurement operationalizations of the same construct and construct proliferation (i.e. when constructs have different names but overlapping content). These issues were addressed by analyzing the measurement operationalizations in all articles published in three leading advertising journals between 2012 and 2014. Results show considerable heterogeneity in the operationalizations of three common advertising constructs (ad credibility, ad irritation and perceived humour) for which almost every study used a unique operationalization. Results also show considerable construct proliferation as different names were used for the same constructs and there was overlap in the operationalizations of several advertising constructs. The paper offers a discussion of implications for advertising research and suggests steps that can be taken towards improving measurement practice.

TI How consumers attend to online reviews: an eye-tracking and network
   analysis approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Online reviews can play a significant role in consumer decision-making processes. Previous research has focused on investigating the effects of different review elements, such as valence or volume, on sales rank and perceived helpfulness. However, very little is known about how consumers actually attend to and process reviews. Moreover, reviews exist in the context of other elements on product pages, but previous studies have not investigated the combined effects of the different product page elements. This study uses eye tracking to investigate how consumers attend to product pages. Participants (N = 74) were asked to review product pages of five different brands of either a search or an experience product. The results show that although product-related information is most important for consumers, consumers also spend time on review-related information, particularly the review text and reviewer information. Also, we observe differences in attention paid to different page elements for search versus experience products.

TI Good for the feelings, bad for the memory: the impact of 3D versus 2D
   movies on persuasion knowledge and brand placement effectiveness
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Brand placements have been a popular advertising strategy for several decades, yet the effects of technological factors have been largely neglected in brand placement research. Consequently, this study analyzes the impact of a popular media technology, namely stereoscopy, on brand placement effectiveness, using the limited capacity model of mediated message processing and the persuasion knowledge model to predict and explain the effects. The main study (N = 120) confirmed that compared with 3D movies, in 2D movies the participants were more likely to remember the brands placed and to critically reflect the persuasive intentions behind the placements. The additional structural elements in stereoscopic movies appear to require more cognitive resources. The consequent lack of cognitive capacity diminishes persuasion knowledge, which, in turn, positively affects brand evaluations and behavioral intentions. A post-hoc study (N = 54) validated the assumption that media users watching 3D movies experience a higher cognitive load than those watching 2D movies.

TI Being funny is not enough: the influence of perceived humor and negative
   emotional reactions on brand attitudes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Humor is a common goal of marketing communications, yet humorous advertisements do not always improve consumer attitudes towards the advertised brand. By investigating a potential downside of attempting to be humorous, our inquiry helps explain why humorous ads can fail to improve and potentially even hurt, brand attitudes. We show that advertisements intended to be humorous also risk causing negative emotions independent of humor appreciation. We investigate the link between humor appreciation, negative emotional reactions and brand attitudes using four samples of advertisements. We find that attitudes towards an advertised brand depend less on the degree to which the ad seems funny and more on the degree to which the ad triggers negative emotional reactions. Consequently, whether an advertisement helps or hurts brand attitudes depends on whether the ad decreases or increases consumers' negative feelings independent of perceived humor.

TI Does sexual humor work on mars, but not on Venus? An exploration of
   consumer acceptance of sexually humorous advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In this article, three studies demonstrate that the sexually humorous advertising's efficacy is more complicated than conventional wisdom's 'works for males, but not for females'. Our findings suggest that in an advertising setting, males and females don't exhibit significant differences in nonsexist sexual humor evaluation. However, utilizing sexual humor is more likely (less likely) to generate positive advertising attitudinal outcomes for a male-targeted brand versus a female-targeted one, especially in a product category with a low level of fit with sexual themes. However, more positive advertising outcomes can be achieved with a female audience by combining sexual humor with a higher-fit brand positioning, offering brand managers and advertising executives a potentially interesting, unconventional opportunity in advertising to a female audience.

TI Celebrity vs. Influencer endorsements in advertising: the role of
   identification, credibility, and Product-Endorser fit
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In their marketing efforts, companies increasingly abandon traditional celebrity endorsers in favor of social media influencers, such as vloggers and Instafamous personalities. The effectiveness of using influencer endorsements as compared to traditional celebrity endorsements is not well understood. Therefore, the present research investigated the impact of celebrity vs. influencer endorsements on advertising effectiveness (attitudes toward the advertisement and product, and purchase intention), moderated by product-endorser fit. Moreover, this research investigated two potential mediators underlying this relationship: identification (perceived similarity and wishful identification) and credibility (trustworthiness and expertise). Two experiments (N = 131, N = 446) investigated celebrity vs. influencer endorsers with good vs. poor fit with a beauty and a fitness product (Study 1), or a food and a fashion product (Study 2). Overall, our results showed that participants identify more with influencers than celebrities, feel more similar to influencers than celebrities, and trust influencers more than celebrities. In terms of advertising effectiveness, similarity, wishful identification, and trust mediate the relationship between type of endorser and advertising effectiveness. Product-endorser did not explain the relationship between type of endorser and any of the mediating and dependent variables. In all, our results show the added value of using influencer endorsers over celebrity endorsers and the importance of similarity, identification and trust in this process.

TI Muslim millennials' attitudes towards fashion advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Recognizing the rapid growth of fashion marketing efforts in Muslim consumer markets, this article aims to investigate attitudes towards fashion advertising between Muslim millennials from two countries of diverse advertising environments. The conceptual framework used for investigation was adapted from an existing framework for attitudes towards advertising. A sample of young millennials (n = 1,691) responded to a questionnaire-based survey measuring items related to beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors towards fashion advertising, in addition to religiosity and fashion consciousness. Analysis of hypothesis testing was performed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Findings revealed that beliefs towards fashion advertising may be grouped into positive and negative factors which influence attitudes towards fashion advertising. Additionally, fashion consciousness also influences Muslim millennials' attitudes towards fashion advertising. This article also examined the diversity of Muslim millennials in terms of religiosity, gender, and advertising environment on beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors towards fashion advertising. Analysis of group comparisons was done after establishing measurement invariance in Multi-group Confirmatory Analysis (CFA). Differences in attitudes towards fashion advertising across religiosity, gender, and cross-national groups illustrate the diversity within Muslim millennials. These differences are explained in terms of differences in antecedent positive and negative beliefs. This article contributes to the literature of attitudes towards advertising by illustrating the influence of gender, religiosity, and advertising environment on attitudes towards fashion advertising in diverse Muslim markets.

TI The effects of eWOM characteristics on consumer ratings: evidence from
   TripAdvisor.com
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Given the rise of online review communities, the management of consumer ratings has gained much attention in the recent years. In this study, we use data from Tripadvisor.com and examine the number of stars that a review receives. Specifically, we address how a star rating is determined by the components in the focal review as well as the preceding reviews of other consumers. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses provide interesting findings as follows. A star rating has a positive relationship with the focal review's valence. That is, the more positive a review is, the greater number of stars a review receives. The reviews of other consumers also play a role in determining a star rating of the focal review suggesting social influence among consumers. Interestingly, a review with lengthy content leads to a lower star rating only when using smartphones. We conclude with theoretical and managerial implications.

Domestic violence against women is a global issue and there is a dire need for effective bystander intervention campaigns. This two-part study delved into how narratives could be employed to elicit favourable ad attitudes and encourage bystanders to report instances of domestic abuse in their neighbourhood. Study 1 focused on testing the effectiveness of narratives in two culturally diverse countries - India and the United States. In general, findings showed that narratives (vs. non-narratives) were more persuasive in both countries. As the next step, using culture (interdependence vs. independence) and social distance (parents vs. neighbours), Study 2 found narratives with a socially proximal entity (parents) to be more persuasive in India while no differences between countries were observed for the socially distant entity (neighbours). Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

TI The characteristics and business impact of children's electronic word of
   mouth in marketing communications
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Leading digital technology companies have shown a strong interest in enabling children to send electronic word of mouth (eWOM). Recasting children from passive to active participants in marketing communications, this shift expands children's marketing practices from how companies influence children via traditional marketing communications, to how children influence companies' marketing practices through eWOM. We apply the value-capacity-vulnerability framework for children's expressive rights to the context of children's eWOM. Using a dataset of Amazon customer reviews written by children under the age of 13, we examine the characteristics and business impact of children's eWOM. We find that the volume and variance of children's eWOM are smaller than that of adults'. Children's eWOM increase the overall diversity of opinions. Although receivers perceive children's eWOM as less helpful, children's eWOM valence (i.e. average rating) correlates with that of adults'. Children's eWOM volume has a product-category-dependent association with product sales: positively in children's product categories, while negatively in general categories. Children's eWOM valence and variance are positively associated with product sales in both product categories. Receivers are less likely to criticize children's eWOM compared to that of adults', suggesting an underlying protective behaviour towards children among eWOM receivers. These results show that children have the capacity to engage in eWOM of social and business value, with receivers typically mindful of children's vulnerability in social interactions.

TI React to the future: political visualization, emotional reactions and
   political behavior
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study explores the mediating role political visualization - the process of imagining future political scenarios - plays in determining how political advertising affects voting behaviour. Specifically, we theorize that when partisans are exposed to political ads that are narrative (compared to non-narrative) in nature, they will engage in more political visualization. Partisans will then experience emotional reactions to these imagined futures - specifically, enthusiasm for the in-group candidate and anger towards the out-group candidate. These emotional reactions, in turn, will make a partisan more likely to vote for the in-group candidate and less likely to vote for the out-group candidate. We test this model by employing an experimental design where American partisans were presented a political ad (in the form of an email) that is either narrative or non-narrative. Results provide support for most of our expectations and suggest that visualization may play an important role in determining the influence of a political ad.

We investigated attachment to brands on Twitter by computing personalities through a machine-learned computational analysis of Twitter postings rather than traditional personality tests. By studying three different brands, results revealed that on average, brand followers have personalities that are more congruent with the personality of brands they follow compared to users that do not follow those brands. Taking these findings into consideration, we discuss some considerations for advertising researchers and practitioners, as well as provide a new tool, the Brand Analytics Environment (BAE), to allow individuals without computer programming backgrounds to conduct this method themselves.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study explores how young millennials understand and respond to newsfeed native advertising on Facebook, rooting our focus on its covert nature of the ad format. Drawing insight from two persuasion-related theories, we conducted focus group interviews and in-depth interviews with Facebook users aged 19-29. The study revealed three major themes regarding their interactions with newsfeed ads: persuasion knowledge, positive and negative experiences and avoidant coping responses. Participants showed a high level of persuasion knowledge of how Facebook newsfeed ads work and ambivalent attitudes toward newsfeed native ads. Despite some benefits, newsfeed native ads presented strong negative responses, which were often accompanied by reactance and ad avoidance. Multiple themes regarding negative experiences emerged: ad intrusiveness, ad clutter, a lack of relevance, too personal, privacy concern, goal impediment and covertness. Participants also voiced less autonomy in controlling their exposure to newsfeed ads. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and a model for future research is provided.

When comparing the effects on viewers of pre-roll ads shown on VOD via IPTV with those served in the mobile TV context, this study found that pre-roll ads shown on IPTV VOD were more credible and useful than ads viewed on mobile devices, and viewers had better recall of ads when they had watched them through IPTV. In addition, mobile viewers tended to find pre-roll ads on mobile devices more intrusive than those on IPTV VOD as a result of the extensive differences in viewing conditions between mobile devices and IPTV. This study suggests that contextual factors, viewing habits and conditions determined by the characteristics of a certain medium could be essential factors affecting advertising effectiveness.

TI Mini-film advertising and digital brand engagement: the moderating
   effects of drama and lecture
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Mini-film advertising (MA) uses narratives to deliver hidden brand messages in 3- to 10-min online videos. It addresses online users to gain their attention and to build brand exposure on the internet. The current study investigates experimentally the effects of MA on consumer digital engagement. The findings demonstrate that digital engagement increases when the narrative (drama) and factual (lecture) qualities of content are high. The results indicate that factual information can be successfully communicated, if it is integrated into a dramatic storyline. These effects can be explained by the similarity-identification process: Lecture content in MA has a greater effect on digital engagement when involvement with characters increases. The findings contribute to the understanding of branded entertainment and digital engagement. They also have implications for advertisers.

TI Curiosity-inducing advertising: how positive emotions and expectations
   drive the effect of curiosity on consumer evaluations of products
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB First, this research investigates the curiosity-evoking potential of different curiosity triggers (information gaps, ambiguity, and novelty) that are both described by the fundamental literature on curiosity and frequently applied in marketing practice. Second, it aims to shed light on affective and cognitive processes that are elicited by curiosity. The authors present two experimental studies and show that not all commonly used triggers stimulate curiosity. Moreover, the results reveal that the effect of curiosity on attitude towards the advertised product is mediated by heightened positive expectations, and under some circumstances, also by increased positive affect. This suggests that a rather uncritical expectation-driven evaluation and a misattribution of process-induced positive emotions are responsible for the positive effect.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines whether and how consumers with different mindsets (i.e. fixed versus growth) have different motives for and patterns of using Instagram. The findings indicate that growth-mindset individuals are more likely to engage in a variety of Instagram activities and to have various motives for using Instagram (i.e. identity expression, social interaction, relationship management, and information seeking). In terms of brand-related motives for using Instagram, interestingly, growth-mindset individuals place relatively greater emphasis on brand identification. Further implications are also discussed.

TI Tomorrow never dies: preadvertised sequels boost movie satisfaction and
   WOM
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The movie industry benefits financially from creating sequels with links to previous movies. Sequels build on the success of the original movie and generally attain high box office revenues and generate positive word-of-mouth. In the current study, however, the converse effect is investigated; namely how preadvertising a sequel may lead to bigger success for the current (original) movie. Three studies demonstrate that a preadvertised sequel makes the original movie seem more interesting and produces higher levels of satisfaction and word of mouth. Results suggest that entertainment brands likely benefit from preannouncing sequels and follow-up concepts already at the time of launch of the original movie.

TI Overlay ads in humorous online videos: it's a matter of timing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Humorous video genres (e.g. comedy/skits, pranks, or humorous vlogs and gaming videos) are among the most popular on online platforms like YouTube. The most common way for brands to advertise in these videos is by means of overlay ads. The current paper investigates the effectiveness of such in-video ads. Based on prior studies on multi-modal information processing, we propose that the timing of showing the brand vs. the humorous build-up may be crucial. In two 4-condition (showing the brand at the joke's start, immediately before, simultaneous to, and immediately after the punch line) between-subjects experiments (N = 109; N = 394), participants assessed brand recall, brand-logo recognition, brand attitudes, and purchase intentions after exposure to an overlay ad of a soda brand during a humorous (stand-up) video. Results show the importance of timing: confirming our expectations, showing the brand simultaneous to the punch line reduced recall (Study 1) and logo recognition (Studies 1 and 2). In contrast, showing the brand simultaneous to (Study 1) or immediately before (Study 2) the punch line improved brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Results indicate that the optimal timing of an overlay ad during a humorous video depends on the advertiser's goals: increasing brand awareness or improving brand attitudes.

TI Portraying product or cause in charity advertising: how execution style
   and appeal type affects prosocial attitudes by enhancing perceived
   personal roles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Across two studies, the purposes of this research are two-fold: (1) to examine the moderating role of appeal types on charity campaign attitudes, including temporal distance and spatial distance in the sub-dimension of psychological distance; and (2) to test the mechanism on these effects of the perception of personal roles in helping a cause. The results show that when charities are far from accomplishing their goals or are targeting international recipients, charity campaign attitudes will be higher when the images featured in their advertising are cause-focused rather than product-focused. In contrast, when charities are close to reaching their goals or are targeting local recipients, charity campaign attitudes will be higher when the images featured in their advertising are product-focused rather than cause-focused. Furthermore, perceived personal roles partially mediate the interaction between execution style and appeal type for predicting charity campaign attitudes. A match (vs. mismatch) between the execution style and appeal type leads to persuasion effectiveness of charity advertising. This research provides guidance to marketers for nonprofit organizations which are interested in communicating with donors and persuading them to take an interest in their campaigns.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB New digital technologies have dramatically changed the way firms communicate and interact with consumers via digital media. In this digital era, what does the future of advertising look like? How can scholars enhance research on digital advertising? And how can firms and agencies maximize their return on advertising? This article defines digital advertising by examining what it is-and will be. We identify key trends relevant to digital advertising, such as a move toward data-driven marketing communication, the impact of artificial intelligence on advertisement production, and the effect of big data on advertisement execution. In the context of these trends, six propositions are posited concerning the management of future digital advertising and the methods and systems for delivering targeted advertisements to consumers. Several topics that can be widely applied to digital advertising are proposed for future research.

AB This study examines how parents, peers, and media use affect adolescents' attitudinal and behavioral responses to app-based mobile advertising. A survey conducted with 603 smartphone users aged between 12 and 19 in Singapore suggests that parental factors, particularly control-based restrictive parental mediation, are more influential on younger adolescents than older ones. Findings also demonstrate that adolescents' susceptibility to normative peer influence makes them less critical about app-based mobile advertising, regardless of their age. Regarding the role of media use, adolescents' responses to app-based mobile advertising are more a function of perceived smartphone competency than the amount of time spent on smartphones.

TI Again and again: exploring the influence of disclosure repetition on
   children's cognitive processing of product placement
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In order to help viewers recognize the persuasive attempts of product placement (PP), broadcasters are obligated to present disclosures and, in most countries, those disclosures must be presented repeatedly. The repeated inclusion of disclosures is especially important when it comes to children who are less equipped to detect persuasive messages compared to adults. To date, however, the role of disclosure repetition for children's cognitive processing is unclear. Hence, we conducted an eye-tracking study with 105 children to shed light on the effect of disclosure repetition on children's implicit cognitive processing of PP (i.e., attention toward the placement). Results demonstrated that disclosure repetition led to less attention toward the subsequently presented embedded brand compared to no and a one-time disclosure. Additionally, more attention triggered the explicit activation of persuasion knowledge. Age did not moderate this effect. Overall, the findings underline the importance of disclosure repetition to shield children against persuasive influence.

TI The effects of sensory fit on consumer evaluations of co-branding
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB While previous co-branding research sheds light on the effects of perceived fit between partner brands, the findings have been limited to only two types of perceived fit: product category and brand image fit. This research suggests the importance of sensory fit and examines how it affects evaluations of co-branding. Three experiments were conducted to reveal the effects of sensory fit on consumer evaluations of co-branding. The findings demonstrate that sensory fit significantly influences the evaluation of co-branding (Experiments 1, 2, and 3). In addition, it shows stronger effects when the co-branded product is a low- (vs. high-) involvement product (Experiment 2). Further, the findings suggest that the sensory fit effect is stronger for high-involvement and hedonic products (Experiment 3). These findings provide additional empirical evidence for the theoretical explanations of the fit effect in the branding literature and managerial insights into the design of effective collaboration between brands.

TI Social embeddedness of persuasion: effects of cognitive social
   structures on information credibility assessment and sharing in social
   media
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Implicit in prior research has been the assumption that any judgment about the credibility and value of information is made in an individualistic and socially isolated fashion. This assumption is no longer tenable in a social media environment wherein people are exposed to a great deal of information selectively fed to them by others with whom they have relationships. The current study examines the moderating effects of cognitive social structures manifested in the minds of social media users. The findings reveal that consideration of individuals regarding source expertise for credibility assessment and information-sharing decisions varies depending on their particular online social circumstances and how the individuals perceive these circumstances. This suggests that the manner in which people assess and share information in the social media environment is partly a function of how they make sense of their local social worlds.

TI Advertising nativeness as a function of content and design congruence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Despite high interest in native advertising, the definition and effectiveness of native advertising remain subjects of debate. To address this problem, we explored the nature of perceived advertising nativeness as experienced by media users, developed a scale to measure this perception, and examined how it influenced advertising outcomes. Using survey data about 32 ad stimuli from three studies, we examined the nature and role of perceived advertising nativeness. The 6-item ad nativeness scale, consisting of two congruence dimensions (i.e. content nativeness and design nativeness), was reliable and valid, and the construct significantly influenced attitude towards the advertisement (Aad), attitude towards the brand (Ab), and purchase intention (PI). Content and design nativeness had different effects on these advertising outcomes at different levels (high vs. low) of consumer involvement. This study contributes to the theoretical knowledge of native advertising and offers an empirical method for optimizing the performance of native advertising.

TI User generated content presenting brands on social media increases young
   adults' purchase intention
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB On Facebook, companies not only actively spread branded content themselves, they also encourage users to do so. Hence, persuasive messages blend into the stream of content, making it increasingly difficult for users to identify and cope with this covert advertising content. In an experimental study, we confronted users to disclosed advertisements; brand; and user-generated posts allowing us to discern effects on persuasion knowledge, affective reaction and, in turn, purchase intention. Furthermore, we manipulated viewer's attention to the posts. In line with the Persuasion Knowledge Model, we found that user-generated content did not trigger persuasion knowledge and a subsequent negative affect. Thus, user-generated content led to higher purchase intention compared to disclosed advertisement and brand posts. Surprisingly, participants' heightened attention decreased their negative affective reaction towards the advertisement post compared to the brand post. We conclude that policy makers should consider employing advertising disclosures for user-generated content.

TI Female role portrayals in Brazilian advertising: are outdated cultural
   stereotypes preventing change?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The use of female stereotypes in advertising is damaging to women and society. In this study we examine how creative practitioners construct stereotypes within creative decision-making. In an era of brand social responsibility, it is important that advertising supports gender equality by using positive portrayals rather than harmful stereotypes. The study considers the influence of local cultural norms on stereotypes and finds that in Brazil, traditional conceptions of the role of women dominate creative decision-making. Through qualitative semi-structured interviews with advertising creative practitioners, the research reveals their mental models of female stereotypes. Six distinct stereotypes are elucidated: Housewife, Trophy, Sexual Object, Sexually Powerful, Professional and Object of Beauty. These stereotypes shape how females are depicted in Brazilian advertising. The identification of Trophy and Sexually Powerful stereotypes are novel within extant literature. We recommend Brazilian creative practitioners connect better with their female audiences in future by representing them more equitably.

TI When partners divorce: understanding consumers' reactions to partnership
   termination in cause-related marketing programs
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Cause-related marketing (CRM) is a pervasive, global marketing tactic used to aid consumer persuasion. While considerable academic research has been directed to understanding this practice and its impact on consumers, virtually nothing is known about the effect on consumers' attitudes and purchase intentions when a sponsoring firm terminates a CRM partnership. To address this knowledge gap, two experiments with samples of adult North American consumers were conducted. Study 1's findings suggest that the termination of a CRM partnership has a negative, direct effect on both brand perceptions and purchase intentions. Results also suggest that the impact is lessened (but not overcome) if the sponsoring firm switches its support to a new cause, regardless of the levels of fit between the brand and cause. In Study 2, when an altruistic reason was used to motivate the termination, consumers responded more positively when the decision was made solely by the sponsoring firm than when it was made mutually by the sponsoring firm and the cause. However, when the decision to terminate the partnership was motivated by an operational reason, consumers responded better when the decision was made mutually.

TI Communicating the fair trade message: the roles of reputation and fit
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines the extent to which a company's fair trade reputation, and the fit between this reputation and the company's communicated fair trade message, influences consumer scepticism and positive electronic word-of-mouth. The results of two experiments show that a previous fair trade reputation has a direct and indirect effect, via consumer brand identification, on consumer scepticism. Moreover, the fit between the reputation and the communicated message seems to affect scepticism only when the communicated message is perceived as realistic. In industries with poor fair trade reputations (Study 1), the fit does not seem to have an effect on scepticism, while the fit influences scepticism in industries with a certain reputation history for fair trade (Study 2). Scepticism and consumer brand identification play an important mediating role in the relation among reputation, fit and consumers' electronic word-of-mouth intentions. Therefore, we conclude that communicating fair trade initiatives not only can be a rewarding effort but also seems to be a delicate matter.

TI Advertising on the edge: appeal effectiveness when advertising in
   extreme sports
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Extreme sports are a solid international industry enjoyed by millions of people, and many brands use extreme sports as contexts for advertising in the US and EU. Interpreting extreme sports through different psychological theories, in two experiments the authors compare the effects on persuasiveness, product attraction and behavioural intention of challenge- and difficulty-focused messages in extreme and traditional sports contexts, for high- and low-involvement brands. They find those appeals to affect ad persuasiveness, product attractiveness, purchase intention and willingness-to-pay positively in extreme sports, but negatively in traditional sports. Qualitative interviews highlight that extreme and traditional sports are perceived as different worlds. Results hold regardless of consumers' participation type or preferred sport type and are based on hundreds of respondents across the US and different EU countries.

TI All we have is words: applying rhetoric to examine how social media
   marketing activities strengthen the connection between the brand and the
   self
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Social media are increasingly leveraged on for the establishment of strong consumer-brand relationships, however the causal relationships leading to them have yet to be clarified. The underlying theory suggested to contribute to this gap is rhetoric, indicating the available means of persuasion to achieve one's goal. This paper builds on Aristotle's view, that effective rhetoric is based on the combination of Logos, Pathos and Ethos and examines how social media marketing activities help strengthen the connection between the consumer's self and the brand. The proposed framework is tested in 183 consumers, which follow a brand on Facebook. The findings indicate that social media marketing activities positively affect brand attachment, through the mediating role of self-brand connections. Furthermore, brand engagement in self-concept moderates the effect of self-brand connections on brand attachment. Significant implications both from a theoretical and managerial perspective are discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper proposes three criteria for evaluating advertising measurement practice: item validity, scale validity, and comparability. A review of the measurement literature is combined with an overview of research practice in order to identify harmful measurement practice. Applying the proposed criteria, the paper identifies four harmful measurement practices that should be eliminated: (1) the use of inappropriate numerical response scales; (2) mixing unipolar and bipolar response scales; (3) the use of antecedent and outcome items; (4) the inconsistent use of response scale endpoint qualifiers. By eliminating these flawed measurement practices the field would significantly improve advertising measurement practice.

TI The Covert Advertising Recognition and Effects (CARE) model: Processes
   of persuasion in native advertising and other masked formats
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Covert advertisements, or those that utilize the guise and delivery mechanisms of familiar non-advertising formats, differ from other more direct forms of advertising in several ways that are important for understanding users' psychological responses. Research across various covert advertising formats including various forms of sponsored editorial content, other native advertising formats, and product placement has shown that variation consumers' persuasive responses to such messages is largely driven by whether they recognize that such messages are advertising at all. After reviewing the findings of empirical research into covert advertising effects, we present a model of covert advertising recognition effects (CARE) that outlines potential antecedents and processes underlying the recognition of covert advertising, and maps several pathways to persuasive outcomes that are contingent on advertising recognition and perceptions related to the information in and perceived presentation of the advertisement itself.

TI Distracted mind: the effects of multitasking and mind wandering on
   consumer memory for ad content
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB People frequently do not pay full attention to advertising messages to which they are exposed. While external distraction such as active avoidance (e.g., multitasking while ads play) or background noise have been identified as causes, in many situations, consumers may also be distracted by an internal cause- mind wandering. While external distractions are thought to lead to worse ad outcomes, this research examines the potential benefits of multiple tasks (multitasking) in the context of mind wandering and how they affect memory for ad content. Through a series of three experiments, we show that even when no external alternative activity is occurring, memory for ad content may still be negatively impact by the increased presence of mind wandering. However, multitasking with a low-level perceptual task can actually increase memory about ads while decreasing mind wandering.

TI When social media influencers endorse brands: the effects of
   self-influencer congruence, parasocial identification, and perceived
   endorser motive
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Given the prevalence of social media usage among consumers in China and the rise of social media endorsements, it is important to understand the effects of social media influencers and their product endorsements on consumers. The present study explores the effects of self-influencer congruence on brand attitude, brand engagement, and purchase intention in China?s dynamic social media context. The perceived motive of social media influencer?s endorsement behavior, parasocial identification with social media influencers, and their roles in the endorsement process were examined. The results of this study suggest that a high degree of congruence between the image of a social media influencer and the consumer?s ideal self-image leads to effective endorsement outcomes. Parasocial identification was found to mediate the relationship between self-influencer congruence and endorsement outcomes while perceived endorser motive was found to moderate the effects of self-influencer congruence on such outcomes through parasocial identification.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The authors study how marketers can best leverage brand alliances in branded entertainment. The study shows that alliance exclusivity and presentation style influence how consumers make brand-to-brand associations and ultimately evaluate a focal brand. When an unfamiliar focal brand is paired with a single well-known ally brand, consumers tend to evaluate the focal brand more favorably when the two brands are simultaneously presented (i.e., massed presentation). On the other hand, when the focal brand is paired with multiple ally brands, the spaced presentation evokes a more favorable evaluation of the focal brand. Brand credibility plays a mediating role underlying the interactions. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

TI Hyperboles in advertising: a serial mediation of incongruity and humour
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Visual hyperbole is a widely used yet understudied rhetorical figure in advertising. This experimental study examined the effectiveness of visual hyperbole over non-hyperbolic visual and verbal hyperbole. A significant serial mediation is found in that visual hyperbole is considered more incongruous than literal visual, and the increased perceived incongruity exerts a positive influence through perceived humour on ad attitude. A similar serial mediation is found when visual hyperbole is compared with verbal hyperbole. In addition, visual hyperbole ads generated stronger product belief than non-hyperbolic visual and verbal hyperbole ads. The advantage of visual hyperbole is attributed to both argument style and mode of delivery. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

TI Location does matter: the effect of display locations of regular price
   and sale price on consumers' responses in comparative price advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research investigates how the display locations of regular and sale prices in comparative price advertising impact perceived quality, deal attractiveness, and purchase intention. Based on the time representation associated with horizontal location, we suggest a congruency effect between time-laden prices (i.e., regular price, sale price) and horizontal location (left vs. right), namely, regular price-left and sale price-right, through three studies. The first study confirms that time-laden words or prices are associated with the horizontal location. More importantly, the second and third studies examine whether consumers exhibit a more favorable evaluation toward price promotions when the time-laden prices are compatibly (vs. incompatibly) displayed with their spatial representation of time. We also propose and confirm a dual mediation model as a psychological mechanism. Specifically, the effect of regular and sale price locations on purchase intentions is simultaneously mediated by the perceived quality of the promoted product and the attractiveness of the deal. The theoretical and managerial implications of this study are also discussed.

TI Consumers as time travellers: the moderating effects of risk perception
   and construal level on consumers? responses to temporal framing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigated the conditions under which temporal framing is more effective in explaining consumers? responses to ads. Two experiments were conducted with a 2 (temporal framing: near-future vs. distant-future benefits) ? 2 (perceived risk: high vs. low) ? 2 (construal level: high vs. low) between-subjects factorial design. In Experiment 1, the two-way interaction effect of temporal framing and perceived risk on ad attitudes and purchase intention was found, such that the near-future benefit frame generated more favourable responses to the ad under the high-risk condition. Incorporating construal level theory, the three-way interaction effect was found, with the temporal framing???perceived risk interaction appearing more pronounced for low construal consumers only. Experiment 1 also discovered that information diagnosticity mediated the interaction effect of temporal framing and perceived risk on ad attitudes and purchase intention and this mediating process appeared stronger for low construal consumers. Experiment 2 replicated the two-way and three-way interaction effects on purchase intention, providing evidence of the validity of the findings. Theoretical and managerial implications were discussed for researchers and practitioners.

TI eWOM across channels: comparing the impact of self-enhancement,
   positivity bias and vengeance on Facebook and Twitter
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB When sharing personal details, versus talking about others, consumers tend to accentuate the positive experiences they have with brands in order to self-enhance amongst friends. Consumers also take vengeance on brands in public venues. Turning to social network sites (SNSs), it is unclear which is dominant. Here historical Facebook and Twitter eWOM (n = 47,907) is analyzed for a static group of 783 active US consumers. Self-enhancement is found on both SNSs. The majority of eWOM is positive Vengeance was rare, occurring only in 10.3% of all eWOM. eWOM appears to mirror a consumer's non-eWOM sentiment valence across SNSs. In this cross-platform comparison we suggest that SNS affordances alter eWOM creation Facebook has privacy expectations and limits direct brand interactions. Twitter is a public platform with less privacy expectations and a larger customer service component. Here eWOM is more prevalent on Twitter but contrary to our expectations is more positive.

TI How brand-cause fit shapes real world advertising messages: a
   qualitative exploration of ?femvertising?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Brand-cause fit, the concept that a brand and a social issue ?pair? together conceptually, has been a topic of great interest yet it is not fully understood due to inconsistent findings and limited theoretical development. In this study, we take a different approach to understanding brand-cause fit to explore how and in what ways ?fit? shapes advertising message strategies. A growing trend in advertising is ?brand responsibility?, wherein a brand aligns itself with a social issue. A prominent focus of these messages is gender equality, namely, female empowerment. Advertisers utilize ?femvertisements? to emphasize their support of women. The motive behind this work is often called into question, given brands? inherent desire to sell products. Advertisers should consider how brands ?fit? with specific social issues. Through a qualitative analysis of advertisements that received an award for femvertising, this study sheds light on the differences in message themes between brands with high versus low brand-cause fit, specifically target audience brand-cause fit, in an effort to further this literature and advertising practice. Five key messaging themes are elucidated among high-fit brands (overt femininity, fixing the self, being a girl is a hardship, actors on set, and let?s talk about it) and four themes among low-fit brands (low femininity, breaking stereotypes, reminders that women and men do the same activities, and getting men on board); which shape how women are depicted, the overall brand message, and the overall social issue message. Indeed, fit should be considered beyond simple high/low congruence. Implications for advertising practitioners and researchers are discussed.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In the present two-study mixed-method research, we aimed to explore how different ad representation dimensions influence the recognition of new advertising formats. Furthermore, we also investigated the effect of ad recognition on ad and brand liking. In line with the past applications of schema theory to advertising (Evans and Park 2015), as well as categorization theories, we found in both studies that ad representation dimensions influence ad recognition of new advertising formats, especially when the relevant feature is present in the ad. Ad representation dimensions such as branded, biased or selling facilitated ad recognition, while informative had a negative effect on ad recognition. The sponsored journal article represented an exception as both branded and biased representations hindered ad recognition. Furthermore, the effect of ad recognition on ad and brand liking varied across the tested messages. Theoretical and practical implications have been formulated. Future research might consider to further explore the effect of ad schemas on advertising and brand attitudes.

TI Moving Towards Transparency for Native Advertisements on News Websites:
   A Test of More Detailed Disclosures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB As readers often do not recognize the commercial nature of native advertising on news websites, clear disclosures are required to prevent deception. The present study therefore tests whether and how providing disclosures with more detailed information about both the authorship of native ads and the importance of advertising revenue for news media's business models can increase readers' recognition and understanding of native advertising. Once readers are aware that they are viewing native advertising, the study assesses whether perceptions of transparency can positively influence readers' evaluations of the credibility of native advertising, advertisers and news media in general. Results of the online experiment that tested four disclosure types (N = 453) show that, compared to using standard disclosures such as 'partner content' and 'sponsored by [brand]', providing more detailed disclosures leads to higher perceived sponsorship transparency, which in turn increases credibility of native advertising, advertisers and news media in general.

TI Disclosing sponsored Instagram posts: the role of material connection
   with the brand and message-sidedness when disclosing covert advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Regulation prescribes that sponsored social media posts should clearly disclose their material connection with brands. However, research on the impact of such disclosures is limited. This study used an experimental 4 x 2 between-subjects design (N = 414), reflecting different types of material connections between the influencer and the brand and two kinds of message sidedness, to investigate how the sponsorship disclosure affects consumers' responses to sponsored Instagram posts. Findings show that including a sponsorship disclosure (compared to no disclosure) negatively affects brand attitude through enhanced ad recognition, which activates ad skepticism, which, in turn, negatively affects the influencer's credibility. Further, results show a significant moderated mediation effect in that source's credibility and, consequently, brand attitude was only negatively affected when the influencer used a one-sided message and not when the message was two-sided. Also, influencers who post genuine product recommendations and thus have no commercial relationship with the brand, do well by explicitly mentioning this. Iincluding a statement that a post is not sponsored, rather than leaving thisit unclear whether their post is sponsored, may generate more positive brand responses through lowered ad recognition and skepticism.

Two experiments utilizing different samples provide converging evidence that negatively valanced reviews tend to supersede star ratings, with the number of reviews serving as a proxy for argument strength. When a review was positive, participants trusted the star ranking system, perceiving a high star ranking to be most credible. However, when a review is negative, an alternate heuristic leads to reduced credibility for star ratings, and participants instead placed greater importance on a high number of reviewers, trusting the eWOM "recommendation" of the reviewer. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

TI Charity advertising: congruence between political orientation and cause
   of need
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Philanthropic appeals are more persuasive if messages match the processing styles of potential donors. To help marketers design more congruent charity appeals, the authors conduct two experiments testing a new type of congruence: political orientations that determine donor reactions to charity appeals for alleviating poverty. Korean student samples are used in a 2 (political orientation: conservatives and liberals) X 2 (causes of need: internal/dispositional and external/social) between-subjects design. Findings show that liberal donors respond more favourably to appeals that use external attributions blaming social causes, and conservative donors respond more favourably to appeals that use internal attributions blaming individual failings. The authors further use moderated mediation analysis to demonstrate that two distinct paths explain the effect: causes of need and resulting perceived controllability influence empathy for liberals and outcome efficacy for conservatives. The findings will help charity marketers better understand how donor segments will react to charity appeals.

TI Sports sponsorship and the risks of ambush marketing: the moderating
   role of corporate reputation in the effects of disclosure of ambush
   marketers on attitudes and beliefs towards corporations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines the possibility that ambush marketers may run the risk of image corruption if consumers correctly discern the true sponsors from the ambush marketers. Further investigated in this study is whether the risks associated with ambush marketing vary by consumer perceptions of corporate reputation. Two experiments, a 2-by-2 and a 2-by-2-by-2 mixed factorial experiments, were conducted to test two sets of hypotheses. A total of 78 and 120 college students were randomly assigned to one of the manipulation conditions in a respective experiment. Dependent variables were attitudes toward the company and the corporate beliefs. Findings indicate that exposure to information on a company's pseudo sponsorship (i.e., ambush marketing) activities led to more favorable perceptions of the company when a disclosure revealing the true status of the company as an ambush marketer was not available, but the same pseudo sponsorship information led to negative perceptions of the company when such disclosure was available. Furthermore, a highly reputable company, as compared to a less reputable company, was found to encounter greater risks of the corporate perceptions worsening by the company being correctly recognized as an ambush marketer. Overall, the findings suggest that ambush marketers can incur serious damage to the consumer perceptions of the company when consumers correctly recognize the ambush marketer status, and that the magnitude of the damage tends to be greater for companies with high reputations than low reputations. This study contributes to the sponsorship literature by establishing conditions under which ambush marketing is detrimental for a company, and how corporate reputation plays a moderating role. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

TI Leveraging secondary associations to build brand equity: theoretical
   perspectives and practical applications
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB One potentially valuable strategy for companies to build brand equity for their products and services is to actually link their brands to other people, places and things. By linking their brands to these other entities, consumers may change how they think, feel or act towards the company's brands. To help understand how these secondary associations can transform brand knowledge, a comprehensive, cohesive model of brand building - the brand resonance model - is reviewed and applied. Theoretical insights are generated and practical issues are identified and discussed to aid brand planning and measurement.

TI You reap where you sow: a trust-based approach to initial seeding for
   viral advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines the role of source trust in viral ad diffusion, specifically the impact of source trust on the reach and speed of ad diffusion. It tests the feasibility of using computer-algorithm-generated social media metrics, indicating the degree to which each person is trusted by others within a social network, for trust-based viral ad seeding strategy, and future research on viral advertising. Applying trust theory and the computational trust research approach using real-life viral ad cases, this study found that only a small proportion of social media users exposed to viral ads tend to contribute to ad diffusion, and those with higher trust scores make significantly stronger contributions to spreading viral ads faster and more broadly. Additionally, individuals' source trust scores have stronger impact on the extent and speed of viral ad diffusion, especially in the situation where the ads contained socially-controversial messages. Theoretical and methodological contributions and practical implications are offered.

TI A macro-level assessment of introducing children food advertising
   restrictions on children's unhealthy food cognitions and behaviors
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Numerous studies have highlighted the undesirable effects of food advertising on children across the world. However, very few researchers have looked at the impact of food advertising restrictions on the targeted outcomes of these policies. This paper presents three studies that assessed the impact of child food advertising restrictions in Singapore. The studies include (1) a content analysis of television advertisements, (2) a door-to-door household pantry survey of families, and (3) a large-scale survey of school children. Results indicate that the amount of unhealthy food advertising has declined since the policy implementation, children's cognition about fast- food have shifted desirably, household stocks of a number of unhealthy foods have decreased slightly, and children's self-reported consumption of unhealthy foods has decreased slightly. Age and gender effects were found, where older children, and girls, show larger differences. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.

TI Is the Effect of Luxury Advertising on Consumer Evaluations of Fashion
   Brands Positive or Negative?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB According to previous research, consumers with low self-esteem are likely to evaluate clothing items lowly when they try them on and find that they are inferior to the attractive advertising endorser wearing the same items. However, advertisements with attractive endorsers are generally used with an expectation to have a positive product evaluation from customers. Assuming that there are two types of self-esteem, body esteem and status esteem, we hypothesized that consumers who are low in status esteem evaluate a status-related product more positively than consumers who are high in status esteem when their consumption aligns (vs. when it does not align) with an attractive endorser even though they are low in body esteem. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a laboratory experiment. The result of multiple regression analyses showed that our hypothesis was supported. The findings have important implications for marketers in terms of product evaluation.

TI Click, click, ad: the proportion of relevant (vs. irrelevant) ads
   matters when advertising within paginated online content
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Applying the ad-context congruence framework, priming theory, and associative network of memory model, two experimental studies (N-1 = 445; N-2 = 449) investigated the effects of displaying different proportions of thematically relevant and irrelevant ads in online paginated stories on brand recognition memory (sensitivity and criterion bias), ad and brand evaluations, ad clicking intentions, and brand purchase intentions. Studies 1 and 2 found that the brands advertised in context-irrelevant ads were recognized better than the brands advertised in context-relevant ads. Encoding of irrelevant ads was associated with a conservative criterion bias, especially when these ads were presented in the condition with the high proportion of relevant ads. Ratio of relevant to irrelevant ads affected recognition of these ad types differently. Attitudes and behavioral intentions toward relevant ads were more positive than toward irrelevant ads. Theoretical implications of the study are connected to the advancement of the two-dimensional construct of thematic ad-context congruence. Practical implications are discussed in relation to paginated web formats, contextual advertising, and programmatic buying.

TI Healthy, sweet, brightly colored, and full of vitamins: cognitive and
   affective persuasive cues of food placements and children's healthy
   eating behavior
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Research on persuasive cues of food placements in entertainment media targeted at children is still scarce. We investigated whether healthy food placements (i.e., fruit) connected to different persuasive cues (i.e., cognitive, affective, and combined) can enhance children's (age 6-11 years old) healthy food choice. A pretest (N = 154) confirmed that the stimulus was understandable and appropriate for children. We then conducted our main experiment (N = 191), measuring children's awareness for positive cognitive and affective cues regarding fruit, fruit evaluation, and fruit choice in response to an audiovisual cartoon. A moderated mediation-analysis revealed that the use of affective cues (i.e., in the affective and the combined condition) increased children's awareness for the positive affective attributes of fruit, which then led to a more positive evaluation. Furthermore, the moderating role of children's body mass index and age were investigated. The effectiveness of cognitive cues regarding cue awareness depended on children's BMI and children's age. The effectiveness of cognitive cues on fruit choice was also moderated by children's age. Implications and avenues for promoting healthy products to children are discussed.

TI The ambivalence story: using refutation to counter the negative effects
   of ambivalence in two-sided messages
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research establishes attitude ambivalence as an explanation for previous inconsistent results concerning two-sided messages' effectiveness. The results of a regression study show that the more ambivalence a two-sided message evokes, the less effective it is in terms of attitudes and intentions (study 1a). In a second study (study 1b), we validate this effect in a between-subjects factorial design, and confirm that when a two-sided message evokes high (vs. low) ambivalence, message effectiveness deteriorates. Study 2 shows that these dire effects of high ambivalence in two-sided messages can be resolved by explicitly refuting the negative attributes in the message. Refutational messages overcome the negative effects of high ambivalence on attitudes and intentions. This research advances and deepens literature on message sidedness and refutational messages, while also offering practical recommendations on how to remedy cases of high ambivalence in two-sided messages.

TI Measure proliferation in advertising research: are standard measures the
   solution?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Recent research has found considerable measure proliferation (i.e., the same construct is measured in multiple different ways) in advertising research. Measure proliferation increases the risk of using invalid measures, may render research results incommensurable across studies, opens up for 'p-hacking', and causes practical problems for researchers. Standard measures of advertising constructs would solve many of these issues but raises other issues such as what criteria to rely on when developing and evaluating measures. This paper discusses problems associated with measurement proliferation, challenges when introducing standard measures, and outlines a way forward for advertising research. It is suggested that advertising research can progress towards standard measures by gradually introducing three new journal publication requirements over an extended period of time: 1) full disclosure of measurement information, 2) all measures should be formally validated, and 3) standard measures should be used in all studies (with justifiable exceptions). In addition, the paper discusses further research that would support the introduction of the new publication requirements.

TI Preregistration as a way to limit questionable research practice in
   advertising research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper discusses two phenomena that threaten the credibility of scientific research and suggests an approach to limiting the extent of their use in advertising research. HARKing (hypothesizing after the results are known) refers to when hypotheses are formulated or modified after the results of a study are known. P-hacking refers to various practices (e.g., adding respondents, introducing control variables) that increase the likelihood of obtaining statistically significant results from a study. Both of these practices increase the risk of false positives (Type I errors) in research results and it is in the interest of the advertising research field that they are limited. Voluntary preregistration, where researchers commit to and register their research design and analytical approach before conducting the study, is put forward as a means to limiting both HARKing and p-hacking.

TI "Touching with heart, reasoning by truth"! The impact of Brand cues on
   mini-film advertising effect
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB With the rapid development of online advertising, mini-film advertising (MA) built on short plotlines has received substantial attention from enterprises. Despite their trending popularity, enterprises must consider how to achieve their advertising goals without compromising the independence and completeness of the MA narrative structure. In accordance with narrative transportation theory, 151 university students were divided into groups to explore the effect of brand cues (temporal and content cues) in MA for this study. The results indicated that a significant difference was observed among various groups regarding the influence of brand cues on advertising effect, the interaction effect of temporal cues (the beginning versus end of advertising), and content cues (brand name versus brand name with interpretative words), and the way transportation mediated the influence of brand cues on advertising effectiveness. Loneliness was used as a moderator for the relationship between brand cues and advertising effect. For people with a high level of loneliness, the brand name and interpretative words appearing at the beginning of the advertisement activated a positive advertising effect. These results can serve as a reference to help enterprises develop MA strategies.

TI Going it alone or together: the role of space between products on
   consumer perceptions of price promotions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research demonstrates that the existence (vs. nonexistence) of space between products on a retail shelf has a significant impact on the effectiveness of multiple vs. single unit price promotions. In particular, we establish the novel relationships between space and consumers' distinctiveness motivations. As a result, we demonstrate that the existence of space reduces the effectiveness of multiple (vs. single) unit price promotions. We further uncover the relationships between no space and consumers' relational thinking and show that no space enhances the effectiveness of multiple (vs. single) unit price promotions on consumer purchase intentions. Furthermore, we demonstrate important boundary conditions of the core interactive effect between space and multiple (vs. single) unit price promotions. That is, building on the notion that product variety decreases consumers' distinctiveness motivations, we show that in the space context, the negative effect of multiple (vs. single) unit price promotion on purchase intentions is attenuated by product variety. We also demonstrate that product popularity diminishes the positive impact of no space on the effectiveness of multiple (vs. single) unit price promotion on purchase intentions.

TI Sales or reviews, which matters more to consumer preference and online
   advertising? - evidence from eye-tracking and self-reporting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Sales volume and the percentage of positive reviews are viewed as learning sources in online shopping. This paper examines the relative effect of these two attributes and determines the underlying mechanism that can be applied to online advertising. We verify the existence of negativity bias in online reviews through an eye-tracking experiment. Consumers underestimate the rating of products with high sales volume relative to products with low sales volume due to negativity bias. However, presenting a percentage of positive reviews cue can eliminate the rating difference. Furthermore, when both the percentage of positive reviews and sales volume are high, consumers prefer products with lower sales volume but higher percentages of positive reviews rather than products with higher sales volume but lower percentages of positive reviews. The percentage of positive reviews is more diagnostic than sales volume, which can be used as endorsements in online advertisement to positively affect consumers' preferences.

TI Broadcasting and narrowcasting: the impact of affective and cognitive
   message framing on message persuasiveness
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Consumer-generated messaging through narrowcasting and broadcasting platforms has become more accessible and influential. Previous studies have examined why consumers generate messages on different social media platforms from the sender's perspective. This study presents how affective and cognitive message framing influence message persuasiveness from the receiver's perspective. The findings of Study 1 confirm that cognitive messaging is more persuasive on a broadcasting platform while affective framing is more persuasive on a narrowcasting platform. The mechanism that underlies this effect is identified in Study 2, suggesting that the interaction between message framing and medium platform ultimately affects the consumers' attitude by influencing their perception of message-platform fit. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

TI The effect of social exclusion on persuasiveness of feelings versus
   reasons in advertisements: the moderating role of culture
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Previous research has suggested that social exclusion could strengthen consumers' reliance on feelings versus reasons to evaluate a product. This research concentrates on the moderating effect of culture on consumers' responses to social exclusion. Results show that under individualism (collectivism) culture, social exclusion leads to a greater choice preference for advertisement with superior feelings- (reasons-) based product attributes, compared with social inclusion. Moreover, we find that the interplay between culture and social exclusion is discrepant under two types of social exclusion (i.e., being socially ignored-feeling invisible, and being socially rejected-feeling isolated). This research provides a new cultural perspective on the impact of social exclusion on advertisement persuasion and offers actionable implications for managers to strategically design advertisements to enhance the persuasiveness.

TI Intellectual structure and publication pattern in International Journal
   of Advertising: a bibliometric analysis during 1982-2019
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB International Journal of Advertising (IJA) publishes research on marketing communications. The journal is international in scope, presenting perspectives from academics, practitioners, and public policy makers. In the past 38 years of publishing, IJA has amassed a rich repository of management tenets pertaining to advertising. With the application of quantitative techniques, we analyze the evolution and growth of the journal and highlight its publication trend, citation structure, and authorship pattern. Furthermore, we acknowledge IJA's prominent topics and its prolific contributors and their affiliations and track the evolution of advertising research in the journal. This study groups IJA articles into seven bibliographic clusters. In addition, by text mining in R, we compare the thematic layout of IJA's clusters of articles. The study is primarily a retrospection of IJA's 38 years but also shows the way forward for the journal.

TI Seller creative selling in social commerce
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Social commerce has gained substantial attention from both academics and practitioners. Many studies aim to understand consumer behavior in social commerce. However, little attempt has been made to investigate the social commerce phenomenon from the seller's perspective. Focusing on sellers, this study explores the drivers of seller creative selling and empirically tests the effect of seller creative selling on seller business performance in social commerce settings. Using multi-sourced data, including primary survey data and secondary trade volume data from a large social commerce marketplace, the authors find that seller creative selling significantly enhances seller business performance. Further, community information support from other users on the marketplace, and business support from the marketplace platform, contribute to sellers' creative selling behavior. In addition, seller tenure with the marketplace weakens the positive relationship between community information support and seller creative selling. These findings highlight the key role of seller creative selling for successful social commerce platforms and provide guidance for nurturing seller creative selling by managers of such websites.

TI To gain face or not to lose face: the effect of face message frame on
   response to public service advertisements
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The current research examines the effect of face message frame on consumers' response to public service advertisements (PSAs). Results of three experiments show that not-to-lose-face messages are more persuasive than to-gain-face messages in the contexts of both anti-drunk-driving PSAs (Experiment 1 and Experiment 3) and anti-drug PSAs (Experiment 2). Moreover, the framing effect is more pronounced for individuals whose interdependent self-construal is more accessible, but not for individuals whose independent self-construal is more accessible (Experiments 1, 2, and 3). The moderating effect of self-construal is significant when it is primed both through a task that is independent of the PSA (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2) and through the appeal type (Experiment 3). Further, the findings suggest that a congruency between a not-to-lose-face message and an interdependent appeal leads to more persuasiveness than other available conditions (Experiment 3). We also discuss contributions to theory and implications for advertising practice.

TI When consumers learn to spot deception in advertising: testing a
   literacy intervention to combat greenwashing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Greenwashing is a major advertising issue that has negative implications for consumers, the green product market, and the environment. Consumers cannot distinguish between acceptable and deceptive environmental claims, a belief that the findings of this research confirms. This underscores the need to educate consumers about environmental claims. Findings from five studies demonstrate that a literacy intervention combining textual and visual elements that distinguish acceptable from deceptive green claims helps consumers spot deception. In turn, consumers use this knowledge when responding to product messages. Implications for theory, policy makers, advertisers, and consumers are discussed.

TI Uses and gratifications of smart speakers: modelling the effectiveness
   of smart speaker advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The purpose of this study is to identify users' motives for using smart speakers from a 'uses and gratification' perspective and to examine the relationship between these motives and the effectiveness of smart speaker advertising. This study has identified four motives for using smart speakers (virtual interaction for escaping from reality, informational learning, play and relaxation, and pursuit of practicability). Postulating four advert types for smart speakers-namely contextual, non-contextual, voice-search recommendation, and voice-search listing adverts-this study shows that non-contextual adverts lead to less favourable attitudes than the other three types. Among the four motives for using smart speakers, virtual interaction for escaping from reality and play and relaxation significantly influence attitudes towards smart speaker advertising and brands through the mediation of parasocial relationships. Consumer innovativeness moderates the effect of parasocial relationships on the attitudes towards these adverts and brands. The theoretical and practical implications of smart speaker advertising are discussed.

TI Slow versus fast: how speed-induced construal affects perceptions of
   advertising messages
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Marketing communications often feature objects that move slowly or rapidly, or images appearing in slow or rapid succession. This article provides a report of results of four studies investigating consumer perceptions and construal arising from the pace of commercials, which then affects consumer decision making. Studies 1 and 2 provide empirical evidence showing that TV commercials featuring slow-moving (fast-moving) objects will prompt high level (low-level) construal, and cause consumer preferences for desirability (feasibility) advertising appeals that emphasize product benefits (attributes). Studies 3 and 4 alters the running speed of TV commercials and demonstrate the same results with quality (price) advertising appeals: that is, when TV commercials are run slowly (rapidly), consumers prefer desirability (feasibility) advertising appeals that emphasize quality (price). Theoretical and practical implications for the effects of speed perceptions in the marketplace are discussed.

TI Celebrity endorsements for luxury brands: followers vs. non-followers on
   social media
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigated luxury brand celebrity endorsements on social media by focusing on the relationships among three pairs of image congruence (i.e., brand-celebrity, self-brand, and self-celebrity), three constructs of consumer evaluations (i.e., ad attitudes, brand attitudes, and self-brand connections), and two facets of behavioral intentions (i.e., engagement and purchase). This study also examined whether celebrity endorsements' effectiveness differs between brand followers and non-followers. This results showed that image congruence in the self-brand pair positively influenced all three constructs of consumer evaluations. In addition, self-brand connections were significant in predicting both engagement and purchase intentions. There were differences between followers and non-followers concerning the congruence-consumer evaluation-behavioral intention relationship. This study extends the existing literature on celebrity endorsements and provides luxury brands with valuable insights regarding celebrity endorsements on social media.

TI Legitimacy and sincerity as leveraging factors in social sponsorship: an
   experimental investigation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The research presented in this manuscript examines how social sponsorship can be made more commercially effective. To this end, the effects of two leveraging factors are explored by means of an experiment: the extent to which the social sponsorship is seen by consumers as legitimate, and that to which the sponsor is perceived as sincere. The results show that these two factors have a positive and statistically significant impact on consumers' intentions to purchase the sponsor's products. In addition, they show that the sponsor's perceived sincerity increases when the sponsorship is combined with philanthropic investments, either in sequence (i.e. philanthropy followed by sponsorship) or simultaneously, and that the legitimacy of a sponsorship is enhanced when the cause and its sponsor are congruent. These results are discussed in the context of the literature on social sponsorship, and managerial implications for firms that contemplate using social sponsorship as a marketing communication strategy are derived.

TI When good becomes bad: the role of corporate crisis and issue congruence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigates how different types of corporate crises and issue congruence interplay in determining the effects of a previous corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative in a company facing a crisis. The findings suggest that a previous CSR initiative can more effectively protect a company's image when the company has a competence-related rather than a morality-related crisis. In addition, when the social cause of the CSR initiative is congruent with the issue of the negative event, consumers will respond more negatively than when there is no issue congruence between CSR and the negative event. Moreover, there is an interaction effect between issue congruence and the type of crisis. That is, when a firm has a moral crisis that is associated with the social cause supported in a previous CSR initiative, consumers perceive the firm's CSR initiative to have been less sincere than if the firm were facing a competence-related crisis.

TI Warmth effect in advertising: the effect of male endorsers' warmth on
   brand attitude
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Prior literature in advertising tends to view warmth as an emotion arises from relationships between two or more characters in a commercial (e.g. lovers or family members), while little attention has been paid to endorsers as a potential source of warmth. In this article, we propose that the warmth of endorsers can serve as a way to elicit feelings of warmth in consumers and affect the effectiveness of the advertisement. Across three studies, we reveal a warmth effect in brand endorsement such that consumers perceive a greater psychological connection between the brand and the self when the brand is endorsed by a male endorser with high warmth, which, in turn, leads to a more favourable brand attitude. This warmth effect occurs only for male endorsers, but not for female endorsers. We further identify two boundary conditions and show that the effect is more prominent when consumers are of interdependent self-construal (vs. independent self-construal) and when the endorsed brand is a functional brand (vs. a prestigious brand). The findings contribute to the literature of brand endorsement, warmth and gender stereotype in advertising, and provide managerial insights for selecting brand endorsers.

TI The cause effect: the impact of corporate social responsibility
   advertising on cause consumer engagement behavior after brand
   affiliation ceases
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Brands often engage in cause involvement out of a sense of social responsibility. While these associations with causes can positively impact brand equity, brand loyalty, and brand-favorable consumer choice, it is less understood whether corporate cause involvement has the ability to create cause associations in consumers that transcend the brand's involvement and lead to enduring cause-oriented behaviors. This study uses social media analytics and hierarchical linear regression to investigate the Twitter activity of a random sample of 3,090 individuals who engaged directly with the anti-bullying cause in direct response to Secret's 'Mean Stinks' CSR advertising campaign. This research identifies the influence that those individuals' campaign-specific consumer engagement behavior (i.e. volume of activity and length of participation time) in the brand's cause campaign, as well as their engagement with the broader anti-bullying cause had on the persistence of their cause-related activity following the end of Secret's active advertising of the cause. This is done in an effort to identify whether cause affiliations that are inspired and influenced by a brand can endure beyond the brand's campaign, and ultimately comment on the longitudinal social influence of brand involvement in social causes.

TI Redefining advertising in research and practice

AB With advertising practice and research changing significantly in the last decade, it is likely that the definition of advertising also needs some transformation. Rather than broadening the definition to eliminate key dimensions, this study seeks to redefine advertising by replicating Richards and Curran (2002) study, which suggested the current US-based definition. Using Delphi methodology, consensus is reached among a global panel of advertising experts. The relevance of five key dimensions of advertising - paid, mediated, identifiable-source, persuasion and action - is investigated in relation to its current practice, research and teaching. The resulting definition is compared to previous iterations and differences between academics, practitioners and geography, developing important implications for theory and practice.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Various studies have examined the short-term effects of brand placement disclosures. This study aims to (1) replicate previously identified short-term effects of brand placement disclosures on persuasion knowledge and brand responses, and, more importantly, (2) examine whether these effects persist, diminish, or grow in the long-term. We conducted an online experiment (N = 208) in which we compared the effects of including a disclosure (vs. no disclosure) in two waves (short-term, measured directly after watching the programme vs. long-term, measured two to three weeks later). Our results show that a disclosure increases ad recognition (i.e. conceptual persuasion knowledge) immediately after exposure, and that this effect persists even a few weeks after watching the programme. Moreover, a disclosure enhances brand memory via ad recognition, in both the short- and the long-term. However, resistance effects on skepticism (attitudinal persuasion knowledge), brand attitude and purchase intention are neither replicated in the short-term nor found in the long-term.

TI How morality judgments influence humor perceptions of prankvertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Prankvertising, an innovative form of branded entertainment, has not attracted much research attention yet. This article proposes a morality-centered theoretical framework to explain how and when prankvertising triggers humor and evokes positive brand attitudes. By integrating benign violation theory and morality literature, this study presents a mediated moderation model to explain humor perceptions of prankvertising. A defining aspect of prankvertising-shocking unsuspecting people-represents a transgression of social norms that can activate viewers' moral censoring. The proposed model builds on the proposition that victims' expressions of surprise indicate the degree of this transgression, which can induce humor perceptions and result in positive brand attitude changes among viewers if it is morally justified. In the proposed model, the mediating effect of victims' surprise on brand attitudes, through morality judgments and humor perceptions, varies with two main cues: victims' expressions of fear and the meaningfulness of the pranks. Four studies test and confirm the proposed mediated moderation model.

TI The impact of visual sexual appeals on attention allocation within
   advertisements: an eye-tracking study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB To address a longstanding gap in the literature examining distraction effects resulting from the use of sexual appeals, a mixed-factors eye-tracking experiment (N = 108) was conducted to gauge how the use of sexual appeals in the form of partially clad, decorative female models impacts visual attention to competing ad components: model, product, advertising copy and the logo or brand. Findings suggest a visual distraction effect for ads containing models to operationalize sexual appeals. Although sexual appeals did not increase overall attention to the ad, gaze data reveal that for both men and women, visual attention directed specifically to models in ads with sexual appeals was greater than attention to models in non-sexual appeals. Moreover, this was more pronounced for men versus women. In addition, attention to ad copy and the brand suffered when sexual appeals were employed. These results provide greater specificity with respect to how sexual appeals impact consumer response and suggest that advertisers who wish to achieve strategic messaging goals through advertising copy should use visual sexual appeals with caution.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper defines brandjacking as an anti-commercial parody of an ad that sabotages and re-appropriates that ad's message out of its original context to unravel important truths and concerns about the brand. This is the first scholarly research that conceptualizes and coins the term brandjacking. It examines the effects of truth, mockery and offensiveness in brandjacking on attitudes toward the brand, skepticism, and intentions toward such brandjacked stimuli. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrate that even though consumers pardon a brand from its mockery in a brandjacked stimulus, the perceived dimensions of offensiveness and truth about the brand damage the brand so as to adversely impact brand attitudes. While truth about the brand in the brandjacked stimulus hurts the brand because it attempts to demystify and debunk brand claims, it helps the audience elicit a favorable attitude toward the stimulus itself and intentions to pass it along to others.

TI A first step in unraveling synced advertising effectiveness
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Technological developments and the rise of mobile devices have made it possible to deliver personalized messages to consumers based on their concurrent media usages in real time; this is known as synced advertising. Synced advertising is argued to be an effective personalized advertising strategy in a multi-media environment that will result in more positive brand attitudes compared to those arising from exposure to non-synced advertising. The aim of this research was to examine the effect of synced advertising on brand attitudes. An online experiment (N = 119) and a lab experiment (N = 107) showed that synced advertising resulted in more positive brand attitudes than when users had no exposure to the brand. However, we did not find any differences in brand attitudes depending on having a tablet ad shown before, simultaneous to, or after a TV commercial for the same brand. Thus, the results show that synchronizing ads with a short delay is as effective as synchronizing ads in real time.

TI Disclosing product placement in audiovisual media services: a practical
   and scientific perspective on the implementation of disclosures across
   the European Union
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB According to the law of the European Union (EU), broadcasters are obligated to inform consumers about the presence of product placements (PP) through disclosures. To ascertain whether disclosures are able to improve consumers' understanding of persuasive intent, researchers have examined the impact of multiple disclosure presentations. This can be attributed to the fact that all EU Member States currently apply a variety of different disclosures. No study so far, however, has assessed how PP disclosures are implemented across the EU and whether PP disclosures investigated in advertising research relate to disclosures used in practice. In the present study, we thus conducted both a systematic assessment of practical disclosures of leading EU broadcasters and a comparison of the current practical disclosure presentations with the empirically tested versions. Results revealed that especially brand-unspecific and repetitive disclosures are under-investigated forms of disclosures although commonly used in practice. Implications for both science and policy, and future research are discussed.

   in advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The present research investigates how visual metaphors (that differ in terms of complexity) and verbal messages (that vary in terms of explicitness of explaining the visual metaphors) interactively impact on consumers' pleasure and ad appreciation. Across two studies, findings demonstrate that consumers experience a higher sense of pleasure and appreciation when explicit (vs. implicit) verbal messages are presented with extremely complex visual metaphors (i.e., replacement ads), whereas implicit (vs. explicit) verbal messages are more effective with moderately complex visual metaphors (i.e., fusion ads). However, the two types of verbal messages do not differently affect pleasure and ad appreciation in minimally complex visual metaphors (i.e., juxtaposition ads). The resource-matching hypothesis is employed as a theoretical framework explaining the relationship between visual metaphors and verbal messages. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed and ideas for future research offered.

TI Something social, something entertaining? How digital content marketing
   augments consumer experience and brand loyalty
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Branded content marketing serves as an ongoing conversation between brands and consumers. Creating value-rich information that breaks through the noise and that can accelerate brand building has been a standing challenge for many brands. Informed by extant literature on content marketing, this study proposed a comprehensive theoretical framework that explicates the mechanism of branded content marketing in brand loyalty across both high- and low-product involvement brands. This study applied the classification of consumption values to the context of content marketing, hypothesized, and identified consumers' experiential evaluation as an underlying mechanism of content marketing accounting for brand loyalty. Specifically, for a high-product involvement brand (i.e.,Lenovo), consumers' perceived informative and entertainment value of branded content, as well as the perceived functional value of the brand's YouTube channel, positively shape their experiential evaluation of the brand, which in turn, leads to greater brand loyalty. For a low-product involvement brand (i.e.,Nescafe), consumers' derived entertainment and social value of branded content, as well as the functional value of its YouTube channel, jointly affect consumers' experiential evaluation, which subsequently contributes to elevated brand loyalty.

TI Water conservation campaigns in an emerging economy: how effective are
   they?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The mounting pressure on fresh water resources encourages many government and commercial organizations to implement strategic water conservation communications campaigns globally, especially in emerging markets. However, empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of these campaigns is limited. In the current research, I address this research opportunity by developing and empirically testing selected important individual differences and social characteristics as influences on water conservation campaign effectiveness. I randomly obtained survey data from 408 South African consumers. I rigorously assessed scale measurement properties using confirmatory factor analysis, and systematically assessed the theorized relations using structural equation modeling. The results show that conservation campaigns affect consumers' planned and habitual water conservation behavior, and contribute to our understanding of factors affecting water conservation social marketing communications effectiveness in emerging markets.

TI Distance matters: the effects of self-brand connections and construal
   levels on ad responses
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research examined the relationship between consumers' self-brand connections (SBCs) and psychological distance toward a brand (Study 1) and empirically tested the matching principle in which construal levels of ad messages (high vs. low) should be congruent with a target market's SBCs to maximize ad effectiveness (Studies 2 and 3). Study 1 found when consumers had stronger SBCs, they felt a closer psychological distance toward the brand. Meanwhile, Studies 2 and 3 revealed that participants in the weak SBCs condition responded to high-level construals (or abstractly-framed ads) more favorably than to low-level construals (or concretely-framed ads). However, no difference by the ad construals was found for the strong SBCs condition, indicating that a brand with relatively weak SBCs is more conducive to the matching principle than one with strong SBCs is.

TI It is just a spoof: spoof placements and their impact on conceptual
   persuasion knowledge, brand memory, and brand evaluation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Brand placements are a widely used advertising technique in entertainment media such as movies or TV shows. Yet, the presented brand placements do not always portray real brands. In media content like comedies, brand placements are occasionally spoof brands, which humorously mimic the real brand in their name and logo. Yet, how spoof brand placements might spill over to the referenced real brand and how viewers process spoof brand placements has never been tested. We recruited 200 participants between the ages of 16 to 66 to take part in an empirical examination. With a one-factorial experimental design (no brand references vs. real brand placement vs. spoof placement), we examined the effects of spoof placements on brand recall, activation of conceptual persuasion knowledge, and brand evaluation. We found that spoof brands significantly affect explicit brand memory of the referenced, real brand; however, they do not activate conceptual persuasion knowledge to the same extent as real brand placements do. We did not find an effect of our three conditions on brand evaluation of the real brand.

TI Privacy concerns about personalized advertising across multiple social
   media platforms in Japan: the relationship with information control and
   persuasion knowledge
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines the relationship between persuasion knowledge and personalized advertising-related outcomes, such as ad avoidance and attitudes toward personalized advertising. The persuasion knowledge model is used to investigate privacy concerns and information control as a mediator and moderator in this relationship, respectively. The study also examines the degrees of these personalized advertising outcomes and their variances across social media platforms. An online survey of 600 Japanese participants indicates that privacy concerns mediate the relationship between consumers' information control and ad avoidance and between consumers' information control and the perceived intrusiveness of personalized advertising. In contrast, information control moderates the relationship between persuasion knowledge and privacy concerns. Moreover, participants are more concerned about their online privacy on Twitter and evaluate Twitter ads negatively. On the contrary, Instagram's effect on personalized advertising-related outcomes is less negative than that of other platforms.

TI How to easily facilitate consumers' mental simulation through
   advertising: the effectiveness of self-referencing image dynamics on
   purchase intention
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This current research consists of two studies that employ the psychological construct of self-referencing with the goal being to identify an optimal means by which ad viewers are able to generate mental simulation through advertising. In Study 1 we identify that the ad, when incorporating a self-referencing cue, enables consumers to easily generate mental simulation resulting in marginally greater purchase intention than that generated by the same ad but without the self-referencing cue. We also find that there is a significant moderating role of prior direct product experience on the relationship between self-referencing and mental simulation, but not on that between self-referencing and purchase intention. In Study 2 we confirm the superiority of dynamic self-referencing to static self-referencing from diverse consumer evaluation perspectives to reveal the underlying mechanism that explains the serial mediating role of arousal and mental simulation in generating intention to purchase. More findings and implications are discussed in the discussion section.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Many brands are now working on Instagram to promote, showcase their products and services, and benefit from the potentialities of Influencer Marketing. A detailed investigation of the effects of Instagram influencer advertising on the influencer-related outcomes is thus becoming urgent. The present study addresses a conceptual model in which the fit influencer-product congruence and the role of a more prominent disclosure are explored with respect to ad recognition, sponsorship transparency and influencer-related outcomes. Findings from a 2 (disclosure prominence: high vs. low) x 2 (influencer-product congruence: high vs. low) between participants experimental design first show a positive effect of influencer product fit on attitude, credibility and continuance intention to follow the influencer. Moreover, a prominent disclosure enhances users' perceived sponsorship transparency when the higher congruence makes it harder to discern a genuine endorsement from a sponsored one. Finally, we disentangle the mediating effects of ad recognition and sponsorship transparency between influencer-product congruence and the influencer-related outcomes.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Addressing the problem of increasing sponsored eWOM and diverse and confusing disclosure practices, this study examined the effects of different types of sponsorship disclosure messages on (1) consumers' trust in the sponsored product reviewer and (2) attitudes toward the reviewer and the sponsoring brand. An online experiment revealed several key effects of sponsorship disclosure and disclosure message types. Overall, sponsorship disclosure messages generated lower consumer trust in the reviewer and attitudinal responses. In terms of the effects of different types of disclosed commercial gain, reviews disclosing the receipt of a free product were perceived to be equally acceptable as reviews without sponsorship disclosure. Disclosure revealing that the reviewer received payment or a sales commission led to lower trust in a reviewer, and disclosure of a sales commission generated more negative attitude toward the sponsoring brand. The disclosure message type effects on attitude were mediated by trust.

AB The current research empirically documents grotesque imagery's positive effect on the persuasiveness of luxury brand advertising, and examines the perceived fit between grotesque imagery and luxury branding as the psychological mechanism underlying that effect. The results of two studies showed that grotesque imagery in advertisements for luxury products enhanced consumers' brand experiences and increased their purchase intentions by transporting them to the narratives portrayed in the ads. This process was driven by the perceived fit between grotesque imagery and luxury branding, which leads to fluent processing, thereby facilitating transportation to the ad. This research presents clear evidence that grotesque ads can effectively influence consumers when they are used to promote luxury brands.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT Global Fashion Management Conference (GFMC)
CY 2017
CL Vienna, AUSTRIA
AB This study focuses on the effectiveness of a glocalization strategy in China to investigate the ways in which language and ethnicity affect the consumer's perceptions of a brand's luxuriousness and consequently their intention to purchase. The findings of the study suggest that although a foreign brand name (i.e., one that is written in the Roman alphabet) is more effective than a Chinese brand name, the effects of bilingual brand naming (both foreign and Chinese brand names) are somewhat complicated. The findings show that in terms of the perception of a brand's luxuriousness, bilingual brand naming is as ineffective as a Chinese brand name is. Regarding purchase intention, however, the effect of bilingual brand naming is as effective as a foreign brand name is. The findings further demonstrate the interaction effect of brand naming strategy and the ethnicity of the endorser. The results reveal that bilingual brand naming generates a weaker perception of a brand's luxuriousness than a foreign brand name does when the endorser is a Western celebrity rather than a Chinese celebrity. Finally, the findings also indicate the moderated mediation of the perceptions of a brand's luxuriousness.

TI Using transit advertising to improve public engagement with social

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Out-of-home advertising has the potential to facilitate informal consumer learning about important societal issues. To test this idea, the authors developed an in-market, 14-month transit advertising campaign to educate commuters about climate change and influence attitudes and beliefs on the issue. A unique brand identity, fully functioning website, Facebook page, and Twitter account were created to increase the legitimacy of the campaign. Study results find that the campaign was successful in changing climate change beliefs, increasing optimism about climate change mitigation, and driving commuters to the website where additional information about climate change could be found. Beyond increasing our understanding of social advertising, the study also broadens our understanding of how out-of-home advertising works to increase brand and ad recognition and influence behavior over time and in a naturalistic environment. Ad design and execution strategies are offered to improve the persuasive impact of both out-of-home advertising and informal education through social advertising campaigns.

TI Beyond gender stereotypes: the missing women in print advertising
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study explores female representation in Brazilian print advertising to reveal who the missing women are (i.e. the least common portrayals) and how this lack of representation can hinder women's well-being. We undertook a content analysis of 1,387 portrayals in 1,207 advertisements covering 20 years of female representation in Brazil and involving four dimensions: the female role, age, body type, and skin color/race. By doing so, we provide both generalizable and specific evidence on the presence and portrayal of women over the years across magazine types and on intersectionality between the dimensions. Three new female roles (i.e. empowered, ornamental, and subaltern) emerged in the research process, thus extending the previous literature. Our results show that women portrayed as career-oriented, in nontraditional activities, or as being equal to men have been continuously ignored over the years. Women who are nonwhite, fat, and over 40 have also been very underrepresented, and their limited visual appearance becomes even more apparent when underrepresented features are combined (e.g. mature black women). The results indicate that the distribution of female representation in the advertisements is inconsistent with the distribution of the Brazilian female population. Theoretical and practical implications are provided so that advertising can move toward fostering and enhancing women's well-being instead of reinforcing biased female roles and beauty standards.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Although the company-cause fit has been considered the key to a successful corporate social responsibility (CSR) campaign, little is known about which communication strategies are effective in increasing the fit. Relying on the categorization theory, this research examines whether a relational communication strategy is effective in increasing company-cause fit when the functional similarity between a company and a cause is low. The findings of this study show that a relational ad message increases company-cause fit when the functional similarity is moderate, but not when the functional similarity is high or low. Also, based on the elaboration likelihood model, this research examines whether consumers' cause involvement moderates the effect of company-cause fit on attitude toward the CSR activity. The results show that the effect of company-cause fit on attitude toward the CSR activity is enhanced only for low involvement consumers. These findings imply that a relational ad message might be more effective for low involvement consumers than for high involvement ones in increasing positive attitude toward the CSR activity.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Parents of children (age 2-12) participated in this study examining the influence of children's television exposure on parent-reported child-initiated purchase requests and coercive behaviors and their subsequent effect on overall parental stress, a factor associated with reduced well-being. Using a general family systems framework, and Family Communication Patterns (FCP), we also examined how these consumer oriented communication patterns could help or harm family interactions and ultimately, parent stress. Results indicated that increased child television exposure was associated with increased child-purchase initiations and consumer related coercive behavior. Additionally, child coercive behavior and child purchase initiation was then associated with increased parental stress, which has a well-documented impact on both physical and emotional parent well-being. Lastly, increased collaborative communication had an exacerbating direct effect on parent stress; whereas, parents who engaged in more control oriented and advertising communication had children who were more likely to ask for more products and exhibit more coercive behaviors. Finally, the link between television exposure and coercive behavior was weaker in homes where parents engaged in more advertising focused communication. Thus, advertising can directly and indirectly influence parent stress; however, effects can be mitigated through constructive parental communication with children.

AB Should brands continue to espouse the traditional thin female models in advertisements or follow the trend towards using larger-sized models? Although the effects of model body size in advertising has been investigated in literature, much inconclusive evidence remains. This study re-examines this important topic from the perspectives of social comparison and self-congruity and investigates the impact of different model body sizes on consumer well-being measures and advertising effectiveness, specifically examining a salient mediating mechanism and boundary conditions to the effect. Across two studies using different brand categories (fast fashion and luxury), we find that, women generally assimilate to an average-sized model over a thin-sized or plus-sized model in advertising. This, however, did not affect their subsequent body satisfaction. Moreover, women's body mass index (BMI) moderated the mediating relationship between model size and purchase intentions via perceived similarity to the model. These findings implicate more support for realistic model portrayals in advertising.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of program-induced engagement on the amount of media multitasking (MM) and its subsequent impact on ad memory. It explored how brand familiarity attenuates or aggravates the detrimental effects of MM on cognitive evaluation of ads. Two lab-based experiments were conducted. The findings of the experiment were three-fold. First, the findings indicate that when the programs were affectively engaging, programs with a high level of cognitive engagement led to a lower level of overall media multitasking than programs with a low level of cognitive engagement. This occurred not only during the programs, but also during the commercial breaks. Second, the findings indicate that even in the same media multitasking situation, people who watched a program with high cognitive engagement reported a higher level of ad memory than people who watched a program with low cognitive engagement suggesting an attention spillover effect. Third, the findings suggest the possible moderating role of brand familiarity. Brands with a high level of familiarity seem to have reduced the memory deficit effect of media multitasking.

AB Advertising research is an applied discipline. It should use insights and theories from other disciplines to develop actionable recommendations for contemporary advertising practice, by explaining in a valid way how and why advertising works. I discuss some observations that indicate that part of the current academic advertising literature falls short of this expectation, using information in 330 articles that were published in the International Journal of Advertising (200) and the Journal of Advertising (130) in the period 2016-2019: Lack of realism, no or very little practical relevance, analytical stunt work to study relatively trivial topics, sloppy sampling methods, a lack of novel methods, hardly any research on real behavior, very little qualitative research, relatively little 'integration', and the obsessions and prejudices of the academic bubble. I also provide suggestions to improve academic advertising research, such as changing the gatekeeper role and habits of editors and reviewers, adapting guidelines for authors, fundamentally altering the review process, for instance by means of preregistration of studies, and changing the criteria to hire and evaluate advertising researchers and professors.

Overall, the results of panel regression analyses employing a feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) procedure and panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) estimates support the hypothesis predicting transference of engagement from Super Bowl ads tweets to the advertisers' official Twitter accounts. In particular, of the three engagement metrics, the number of retweets of and favorites on the Super Bowl ad tweets significantly increased the numbers of followers and favorites on the official Twitter accounts of the Super Bowl advertisers. The theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Portrayals of death in advertising for non-death related products are exceedingly rare, in sharp contrast to numerous death portrayals in other media sources such as movies and TV programs. Additionally, advertising increasingly depicts other controversial topics, such as sex and violence, but not death. Is death the last taboo in advertising? This qualitative study uses a grounded theory approach to explore death as a taboo topic in advertising through in-depth interviews with twenty consumers-purposively chosen so that half of the participants were aged in their 20 s and half were older than 65. Participants were shown six current, non-shocking ads containing death portrayals to understand how consumers think and feel about death portrayals in advertising. Differences in consumer interpretations based on age emerged. In addition, ad execution factors that helped consumers accept death portrayals included the use of humor, non-human characters, unrealistic situations, and evocative music.

TI The effect of emotionally-arousing ad appeals on memory: time and fit
   matter
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research studies the effect of emotional arousal communicated in ad appeals on consumers' memory of the ad. Isolating and studying the level of arousal - one dimension of affect communicated in the ad, as opposed to valence - we examine the moderating roles of two factors: retention time (i.e., immediate vs. delayed memory) and the fit between ad-arousal and the ad claim. The results of three experiments show that ad-arousal inhibits immediate memory but enhances delayed memory. These effects, however, occur only when the level of arousal communicated in the ad fits the ad claim; whereas when the level of arousal does not fit the claim, ad-arousal does not influence memory. Insights from this research shed light on the boundary conditions of the effect of ad emotional arousal on memory, contributing to the development of an integrative theory on such effects, which can serve as a guide to advertisers in developing effective message strategies in different circumstances.

TI An expert with whom i can identify: the role of narratives in influencer
   marketing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Based upon narrative persuasion literature, we argue that each influencer post (consisted of both textual and visual information) is an exemplar of narratives in which there are the main character(s) and a storyline. To reveal the content strategies used by social media influencers, we adopted a combined use of machine learning-based topic analysis and deep learning-based image analysis in order to examine the content of captions and photos contained in Instagram influencer posts. These 7,745 posts were uploaded by the top ten young adult beauty and fashion social media influencers. Moreover, we explored how the influencer narratives impair the effectiveness of sponsorship disclosure by analyzing the disclosure language in each post as well as the engagement performances (i.e., number of likes, number of comments) of the post. Results provided empirical information regarding influencers' usage of persuasive narratives. Implications and future research directions were provided.

TI Virtual reality advertising with brand experiences: the effects of media
   devices, virtual representation of the self, and self-presence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Virtual reality (VR) is gaining mainstream attention, but little is known about the effects of VR advertising (VR ad). This study examined 360-degree video-based advertising, which presented an entire view of the scene and allowed users to pan around the view interactively. In particular, the study sought to answer the following questions: (a) does the effect of VR ad vary when it is viewed with different media devices?; (b) what is the effect of virtual representation of the self (VRS) in VR ad?; and (c) does self-presence mediate the association between VRS and the user's experience with an advertised brand? An experiment (N = 203) was conducted using a 2 (VRS: present vs. absent) x 3 (media devices: smartphone vs. computer vs. head-mounted display) between-subjects design. Primary findings indicate that absence of VRS in VR ad had positive effects on users' liking the ad and favorable attitude toward the advertised brand. Self-presence was found to be a significant mediator that explains why absence of VRS led to favorable experiences. The study did not find any significant difference on VR ad experiences across media devices. Theoretical and practical implications of VR ad were discussed.

TI Comedic violence in advertising: cultural third-person effects among US,
   Korean, and Croatian consumers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Humour is a popular appeal used in global advertising and with the growing use of comedic violence ads in the U.S., it is a worthwhile endeavour to see whether comedic violence ads by U.S. brands could travel globally. This research conducted three studies in three countries, chosen for their distinctively different cultural tendencies and market potential: the U.S., Korea, and Croatia. Across the studies it was found that (1) individuals in the U.S. used aggressive humour in daily life more than Koreans or Croatians, (2) U.S. had higher perceived humour and ad attitudes towards the comedic violence ad than in Korea or Croatia, and (3) U.S. individuals found the comedic violence ad funnier for themselves than for others in different cultures while Koreans thought the ad was less funny for themselves than for others in different cultures. Croatians did not have response differences between self vs. others. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

TI Persuasive effects in social media: the case of envy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In the age of social media, consumers are constantly exposed to idealistic images of others arousing social-related emotions such as envy. Yet, very little is known about the effects of envy on purchase intention. Our pilot study and experiment investigated the effects of Facebook envy on purchase intent involving female Facebook users, aged 18-25 years. The pilot study and experiment manipulated the envy subtypes (benign and malicious). A serial mediation model via two mediators to purchase intent was then tested. It tested the persuasion pathway via attitude towards the brand user (human-related social effect) and via the brand (brand-related effect). Results indicated that the human-related social effect was stronger than the brand-related effect. Further analysis into product types (body-related vs non-body-related) found that not all products induce invidious reactions. The effects were only present for the body-related products.

TI The commercialization of social media stars: a literature review and
   conceptual framework on the strategic use of social media influencers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This review provides insight into the research on the strategic use of social media influencers. A search in the Scopus database yielded a total of 154 peer-reviewed academic publications focussing on influencer marketing, published mostly in the last three years (2018-2020). Most of these studies were empirical and used survey research, an experimental design, content analysis, or interview methodology. While a few studies examined how influencers can incite behavioural change or affect public opinion, the majority of studies focussed on the use of influencers as a commercial marketing tactic. Using Stern's Revised Communication Model for Advertising as a theoretical framework, the studies were classified according to three research characteristics: source, message, and audience. The first research stream focussed on the perspectives of influencers and communication professionals. The second stream was concerned with the content strategies used by influencers in their sponsored posts. The third research stream focussed on the appeal of influencers and the efficacy of their sponsored recommendations. Several studies in the third stream were concerned with the transparency of this covert marketing tactic. The paper concludes with a future research agenda and implications for marketing practice and public policy.

TI CEOs' self-disclosure on Instagram and consumer-brand relationships: the
   moderating effect of relationship norms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examined the effects of chief executive officers' (CEOs) self-disclosure on consumer-brand relationships and the moderating role of brand relationship norms. To test the proposed hypotheses, a 2 x 2 factorial design was implemented with self-disclosure (high vs. low) and relationship norms (exchange v. communal) as the between-subjects factors. The results showed the interplay between the level of CEOs' self-disclosure on Instagram and the type of relationship norms between consumers and brands and their effects on consumers' attitudinal and behavioral responses. For participants primed with the communal norm, high CEO self-disclosure induced more positive attitudes toward the CEO and the brand as well as higher consumer intentions for self-disclosure, than the low CEO self-disclosure; these results were reversed for participants in the exchange norm condition. This study advances the theoretical understanding of brands' social media engagement using CEOs and provides practical implications.

TI Deepfakes: perspectives on the future "reality" of advertising and
   branding
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Deepfakes are real videos with fake content. Leveraging artificial intelligence technologies to superimpose voices and likenesses, deepfakes can, quite literally, put someone's words in anyone else's mouth. Deepfakes are exploding across mass and social media, and these outlets are feverously trying to manage the proliferation of content with potentially deceitful authenticity on their platforms. This paper introduces what deepfakes are, how they work, and the potential for deepfakes' influence on advertising. We provide a conceptual model that explores the influence of deepfakes on advertising practice in a holistic context of consumer consumption and cultural influence to explore how deepfakes influence three perspective dimensions of advertising - not only the tangible ads themselves, but also how consumers perceive those ads and the greater sociocultural context in which the ads are created and consumed. Deepfakes present both threats to and opportunities for advertisers, and we leverage this conceptual model to highlight several critical areas of practice that warrant further investigation.

TI Temporal and social scarcities: effects on ad evaluations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Temporal scarcity appeals are a marketing technique in which marketers inform consumers that offers are valid for a limited time, such as "The offer ends today!" Social scarcity appeals inform consumers that offers are exclusive, such as "Members only!" In two studies, the authors study effects of temporal and social scarcity appeals for attracting consumers to promotional offers, depending on consumer perceptions of being socially included or excluded and their perceptions of the duration of temporal scarcity. The studies reveal that socially included (excluded) consumers perceive temporal scarcity appeals indicating a short (long) expiration date to be more persuasive. The research further identifies perceived value as a mediator of the effects.

TI Effect of short video ads on sales through social media: the role of
   advertisement content generators
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB With the rapid development of e-commerce and social media in China, user-generated short video ads through social media have become very popular. However, the unique elements and phenomena for user-generated short video ads through mobile platforms have not yet been investigated. Therefore, a theoretical framework is proposed to explain the effect of user-generated social media short video ads on product sales from the perspective of advertisement sociability and vividness attributes, especially considering the moderation effect of advertisement content generators, including influencers, sellers and buyers. An empirical study using data from the Douyin platform and the Taobao e-commerce platform was conducted using dynamic panel models. The results indicate that the number of comments as one of the advertisement sociability attributes and female vividness and music vividness as two of the advertisement vividness attributes have consistently positive effects on product sales. The moderating effects of the influencer and the seller are positive for the effect of sociability on product sales, whereas the moderating effect of the buyer is positive for the effect of vividness on product sales. Thus, the best strategy to promote products through user-generated short video ads on mobile short video sharing platforms is for buyers to publish short video ads with music and a female or both a male and a female together; moreover, having a large number of comments increases product sales.

TI Social media alcohol advertising among underage minors: effects of
   models' age
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Despite U.S. alcohol industry self-regulatory guidelines prohibiting the use of models under the age 25 in alcohol advertising, brands include younger-looking models in their ads. Using social cognitive theory and the limited capacity model of mediated motivated message processing (LC4MP), we investigated the effects of alcohol ads featuring younger- and older-looking models on underage youths' affective and cognitive processing and behavioral outcomes. Study 1 participants viewed YouTube ads where models looked either younger or older than 25. In addition to measuring advertising effectiveness self-report measure (e.g. attitudes, and behavioral intentions), participants' psychophysiological responses were recorded. Study 2 used Instagram ads and measured outcomes with a nationally representative participant sample. Both studies show that younger-looking models in alcohol ads increase drinking intentions. Findings are discussed in relation to alcohol regulatory and policy recommendations as well as advertising's role in hindering consumer well being.

TI Does company size matter in corporate social responsibility? An
   examination of the impact of company size and cause proximity fit on
   consumer response
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Two experimental studies were carried out to investigate the effect of company size and cause proximity on consumer response to CSR initiatives. Findings from Study 1 demonstrated that, for a large company, the national cause led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially responsible corporate image than the local cause. By comparison, for a small company, the local cause produced more positive attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially conscious corporate image than the national cause. Further delving into the cognitive mechanism of this fit effect, Study 2 investigated the mediating role of message credibility and explored how the mediation varied with consumers' level of cause involvement. A series of moderated mediation analyses showed that when company size and cause proximity were congruent, participants displayed higher message credibility, which led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company and a better corporate image than in an incongruent condition. This research suggests that company size does matter in consumer response to CSR engagement and offers initial explanations for it. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided.

TI Silent persuasion. Incidental use of promotional merchandise benefits
   unfamiliar brands
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Many brands distribute promotional merchandise like branded pens, flash drives or mugs in the hopes that it will improve consumers' reactions to the brand. Yet, consumers often use them purely incidentally, i.e. they casually use them and pay no attention to the brand, such as when borrowing a pen from a colleague. We query whether even such incidental use of promotional merchandise affects consumer response. Drawing on the specifics of merchandise use and a combination of prior insights on persuasion, we suggest that incidental use of promotional merchandise affects in particular unfamiliar brands. In two controlled lab experiments, we find that consumers react more positively to an unfamiliar brand after incidentally using its merchandise. The effect emerges even though consumers do not consciously notice the brand's logo but does not extend to a familiar brand. Equivalent incidental visual exposure to advertising stimuli, i.e., posters, was less effective than the haptic incidental use of promotional merchandise. Durable promotional merchandise may be a worthwhile investment, in particular for unfamiliar brands.

   and sensory appeals on memory for pronutritional messages promoting
   healthy foods
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Unhealthy foods advertisements often use motivationally-relevant appeals - i.e., stimuli with survival benefits, linked to hedonic consumption or social eating contexts. These stimuli automatically attract mental resources, resulting in memorable advertisements that can influence consumers' choices and well-being. Aiming to prevent obesity and encourage healthy lifestyles, we examined the usability of these appeals to promote healthy foods to young consumers. A mixed factorial experiment recorded memory in preteen children and teenagers who watched various depictions of social eating contexts and texts emphasizing hedonic versus utilitarian benefits. The free recall and recognition tests revealed that young people had better memory for food advertisements featuring social eating contexts. Depictions of large groups were remarkably lasting, contributing to 80% of the health messages being recognized and recalled. As hypothesized, these appeals were more effective for teenagers than preteen children. Motivationally-relevant social appeals make pronutritional media more memorable, influencing healthy choices in the long run.

TI The disclosure paradox: how persuasion knowledge mediates disclosure
   effects in sponsored media content
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Persuasion knowledge is an established construct in the explanation of recipients' coping with persuasive communication. It gains particular importance when persuasion attempts are covert. This is the case for sponsored content, as it closely adapts to its media environment. Hence, disclosures are employed to uncover such content as persuasion attempt. In the present study, we argue that disclosures activate different sub-dimensions of persuasion knowledge which can lead to paradoxical effects: On the one hand, disclosures increase recipients' activation of conceptual persuasion knowledge by highlighting the persuasive intent of sponsored content. On the other hand, disclosures decrease recipients' activation of attitudinal persuasion knowledge by making sponsored content appear less deceptive. This results in two opposing mediation effects where disclosures simultaneously increase and decrease anger through persuasion knowledge activation. The findings of two experimental studies show that these mediation effects occur consistently in the contexts of social media and blogs, while a third experiment reveals divergent findings in the context of journalistic media.

TI Lethal versus reproductive disease appeals in preventive health
   advertising: the moderating effect of life history strategy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study uses evolutionary psychology to examine how the use of disease appeals affects unhealthy behavioural intentions among consumers with different life-history strategies (LHS). Do they invest more resources in survival (slow strategists) or more resources in reproduction (fast strategists)? The results of two experimental studies indicate that behavioural intention to drink alcohol or to smoke varies as a function of the type of appeal used and the LHS of the consumer. Slow strategists' behavioural intention is lower when a reproductive disease appeal is used, while fast strategists' behavioural intention is lower when a lethal disease appeal is used. The interactive effect is moderated by message framing and appears only for negatively framed messages, but not for positively framed messages. These results contribute to advertising research by providing an evolutionary explanation for the effects of disease appeals in preventive health communication and implications for consumer well-being.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study adopts the consumer-centric perspective, through the lens of the consumer involvement theory and stakeholder theory, to examine the role of consumer involvement in shaping individuals' attitudinal and behavioural responses toward Nike's 30th Anniversary ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick. Specifically, a survey (N = 345) was conducted to examine how consumers' cognitive and affective involvement regarding the issue of NFL national anthem protests, their brand attachment, and brand attitude guide their attitudes and word-of-mouth intentions in response to Nike's corporate social advocacy practices. The findings of this study suggested that consumers' support for a company's CSA efforts could depend on their involvement in the social issue that a brand chose as well as their involvement in the brand. Moreover, the interaction of issue involvement and brand attachment factors can serve as a segmentation strategy to cement brand loyalty and strengthen the relationship with the existing stakeholders whose issue attitude was congruent with the corporation's stances. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Psychological reactance was further tested as a mediating factor influencing behavioural intention to receive the vaccine. An experimental study was conducted with 264 college students. The results showed that pre-existing attitude positively influenced participants' intention to obtain the flu vaccine through an increase (a decrease) in psychological reactance when there was inconsistency (consistency) between the pre-existing attitude and valence of comments. Collectively, the results demonstrate that psychological reactance is one possible theoretical mechanism through which social media users' health behaviours are influenced by user-generated comments.

TI The dance between darkness and light: a systematic review of
   advertising's role in consumer well-being (1980-2020)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising is oft described as the art of capitalism. This indispensable form of communication, in all its Technicolor glory, has the power to shape culture, conscience and commerce. Therein lies the (potential) rub. Advertising promotes consumption as the solution to all of life's problems. Consumers appear to benefit when conveyed information reduces ignorance and lowers transaction costs for legitimate needs. However, consumers may also be adversely affected when the persuasive influence on consumer behavior extends to the production of previously undiscovered wants or desires. The resultant veil of consumerism enables individuals to overlook the inevitable hollowness that underlies the pursuit of wellbeing through material goods and services. Academic research reinforcing the efficacy of advertising and highlighting its cautionary contours abounds across multiple disciplines. This begs the question, 'Does advertising, in fact, help or hinder consumer well-being (CWB)?' The authors conduct a systematic review of the literature between the years 1980 (the emergence of CWB as a formal construct in the marketing literature) and 2020 to establish the extent to which extant research has progressed in response to this broad question. Grounded theory supports a series of emergent themes, as well as inconspicuous gaps that require attention to move the field forward. A framework is developed, and research agenda proposed, to guide future study.

TI The influence of flow experience in the augmented reality context on
   psychological ownership
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Augmented Reality (AR) technology shows great potential for marketers and simultaneously puts forward a challenge for established marketing practice. This paper explores the driving factors of flow experience in the AR shopping environment, and how this relationship affects consumers' psychological ownership. The research also examines the moderating role of brand attachment in the relationship between flow experience and its antecedents. A Likert-type survey was used to explore 527 customers' experiences of using a virtual try-on AR application in Zara's physical stores in Beijing, Xi'an, Shanghai, Changsha, and Guangzhou. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the hypothesized relationships among all variables. The results illustrate that perceived informativeness, perceived aesthetics, perceived novelty, and parasocial relationship positively affect consumers' flow experience, which in turn positively influences psychological ownership. Flow experience partially mediates the relationships between consumer perceptions and psychological ownership. Brand attachment acts as a moderator on the relationships between consumer perceptions and flow experience. Moreover, brand attachment is proposed to interact with customer perceptions and psychological ownership through the mediation of flow experience.
