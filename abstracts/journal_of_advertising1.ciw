TI THE JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING - A 20 YEAR APPRAISAL
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB As the Journal of Advertising completes its twentieth year of publication, it seems appropriate to investigate its evolution to date.  The current paper looks at these first twenty years of the Journal by content analyzing the twenty-year index (among other sources).  The findings indicate that an important evolution has occurred, as the Journal has focussed on developing advertising theory.  The Journal has gradually become a forum for academics to present their research on societal, executional, and behavioral aspects of advertising.

TI THE EFFECTS OF VISUAL AND VERBAL ADVERTISING INFORMATION ON CONSUMERS
   INFERENCES
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research examines the effects of visual and verbal advertising content on consumers' inferences about missing product attributes.  While there is substantial evidence that consumers use verbal advertising claims to form inferences, little is known about the influence of pictures.  The results of a laboratory experiment indicate that consumers form both verbally- and visually-based inferences, although inferential beliefs derived from pictures appear to be weaker than those derived from copy.  The results also show that both types of inferences are influenced by assessments of covariation between missing and known attributes.  Finally, when advertising copy and pictures focus on different product attributes, the pictures disproportionately influence inferences.

TI CONTROLLING SEX AND DECENCY IN ADVERTISING AROUND THE WORLD
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Ads that are indecent, sexist, sexy, exhibit violence to women or treat them as mere objects present a constant and even growing problem in many countries. Both the law and voluntary guidelines find it difficult to handle such ads because of the heterogeneity and flux of the norms bearing on sex and decency in advertising. Advertising bodies and practitioners are improving their responses to this situation which threatens their autonomy but promises to increase their effectiveness. However, these responses also generate unwelcome implications and consequences for advertising's role and freedom.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Three different measures of cognitive age were administered to a sample of 355 older adults.  Cognitive age was found to be a potentially valuable concept for advertising targeting, creative decisions and media selection, when used in conjunction with chronological age.  Among the three different measures of cognitive age, the age-decade scale proved to be the best because, compared with the other two measures, it is easy to administer, analyze and interpret.

TI VIEWER PREFERENCE SEGMENTATION AND VIEWING CHOICE MODELS FOR NETWORK
   TELEVISION
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Individual viewing decisions have a direct impact on the media planning of television advertisers and, consequently, on the revenues of the major television networks. This paper represents an attempt to better understand these decisions. We use Nielsen people meter data to build a perceptual space for programs. That space is then used to develop models explaining viewers' decision to watch television and their choice of programming. The program-choice model is a clusterwise logit model which searches for segments with similar viewing preferences. A segment-level logit model is then used to model the on-off decision. These models can be used by advertisers and advertising agencies to understand the viewing audience better, and thus to help guide their advertising media placement decisions. The models can also help television networks design programs and program schedules that are more attractive to viewers (and thus advertisers).

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study presents a structural equation test of the interrelationships among ad-induced emotional and cognitive responses, attitude toward the ad (A(ad)), brand altitudes (A(b), and purchase intentions (PI). Consistent with past research, feelings affect A(b) directly and indirectly via A(ad). Differences between positively and negatively framed print appeals are also examined. Findings indicate that feelings' effects on A(b) offer a significant contribution regardless of the ad execution, but brand-related thoughts are more important in brand attitude formation when the message is negatively framed.

Results from an experiment using second-order classical conditioning procedures indicate that subjects who were originally exposed to music in an unpleasant context held less favorable attitudes toward the brand than did subjects who were not preexposed to the music but rather learned it only in context of conditioning trials. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

TI SEPARATE, BUT NOT EQUAL - RACIAL SEGMENTATION IN CIGARETTE ADVERTISING
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The ethnic segmentation of the cigarette market is currently controversial, but not a new phenomenon. A census of 540 cigarette ads from 1950-1965 Ebony magazines, compared to a matched sample from Life, reveals segmented and segregated advertising toward black consumers. The ads in Ebony eventually featured black models almost exclusively, primarily professional athletes. Despite endorsements from black athletes and musicians also famous to white audiences, none of these appeared in the Life ads. On average, the segregated advertising was two to three years tardy in offering filtered products to black consumers, suggesting that appeals to black pride were not without prejudice. Potential reasons for these historical results are discussed, as are current practices.

After reviewing characteristics of media decisions and existing analytical approaches, two approaches incorporating the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) are presented. The recommended approach utilizes AHP in conjunction with integer programming while an alternative approach uses goal programming coupled with the AHP. Those specific characteristics of AHP that make it particularly well suited to the media selection problem are discussed.

TI DISCRIMINATION VS AVOIDANCE - ZIPPING OF TELEVISION COMMERCIALS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB One of the more pressing problems facing television advertisers today is zipping: fast-forwarding by viewers through commercials when playing a pre-recorded or rented videotape. This paper presents the results of laboratory and field investigations to assess whether viewers evaluate commercials prior to zipping them. High levels of zipping were found, reducing the audience size for commercials well below that for the programs. Block zipping, in which two or more commercials were zipped at a time, was discovered to be a predominant mode of zipping behavior. Zipping rates were lowest for the first commercial in the first pod, and highest for the commercials in the last pod. The authors conclude that a majority of subjects zipped to indiscriminately avoid all commercials and that few attempted to evaluate commercials prior to zipping them.

   PROCESSING AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT ENDORSERS

Two experiments were conducted: one with 160 subjects set in a testimonial advertising context and one with 120 subjects set in a simulated word-of-mouth context. The results from these studies provide support for the contention that source similarity to the message recipient is an important determinant of the source's ability to shape attitudes and intentions for the higher preference heterogeneity services examined, including night clubs, restaurants, interior decorators and hair salons. On the other hand, the source's experience with a service is an important determinant of the source's ability to shape attitudes and intentions for the lower preference heterogeneity services examined, including plumbers, rug cleaners, auto mechanics and accountants.

TI DEPTH VERSUS BREADTH STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL BRAND IMAGE MANAGEMENT
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Developing and maintaining a brand image is vital to any successful marketing and communication campaign. An image that clearly communicates the needs satisfied by the brand contributes to brand equity and helps combat brand parity. The normative model of brand image management suggests that marketers should base their images on a single set of consumer needs (depth strategy), rather than multiple sets of needs (breadth strategy). The extent to which depth strategies outperformed breadth strategies (in terms of annual change in sales volume, profit margin, and market share) was investigated for U.S. consumer goods exported into international markets. These markets varied in terms of level of economic development, cultural context, and competition. While the results indicate that depth strategies do tend to perform best, there are conditions under which breadth strategies perform just as well.

TI THE ADAPTIVE INFORMATION-PROCESSING HYPOTHESIS - ACCOUNTING FOR THE
   V-SHAPED ADVERTISING RESPONSE FUNCTION
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Previous research at Anheuser-Busch reported that the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales can exhibit a V-shaped pattern, with greater sales at both increased and reduced levels of advertising expenditures. While the right-side of the V-effect is consistent with the traditional perspective on the advertising-sales relationship, the left-side is not. Though the existence of the V-effect has considerable implications for advertising efficiency, theory which accounts for its effects or the conditions under which it occurs is limited. This paper critically evaluates previously proposed segment-based explanations for the V-effect and proposes a new (Adaptive Information Processing) hypothesis to account for its effects. The hypothesis suggests interesting implications for advertising decisions.

The experimental evidence in support of these and related predictions is discussed. Suggestions for future research on the effectiveness of utilitarian versus value-expressive appeals are offered.

TI SOME OBSERVATIONS AND THOUGHTS ON THE FOUNDING AND EARLY YEARS OF THE
   JOURNAL-OF-ADVERTISING
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Attempts to fund a JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING began in the early 1960s, largely through the efforts of C.H. Sandage. Although not successful in getting foundation funds, Sandage was instrumental in publishing Occasional Papers in Advertising as a forerunner of a journal. Other individuals became involved with the quest for a journal, eventually securing sufficient funds to start, and Volume 1, Number 1 of the Journal of Advertising appeared in 1972. Governance of the Journal was in the hands of a self-perpetuating Board of Directors, with loose ties to the American Academy of Advertising. This arrangement was due to philosophical differences between those desirous of establishing a journal and the then Executive Committee of the Academy. Monetary problems and differences in viewpoint of journal content plagued those responsible for the Journal in its earlier years. By 1979, efforts were underway to merge the autonomous Journal Board of Directors into a Publications Committee within the Academy proper. The consolidation occurred in 1981 through the re-writing of Academy Bylaws.

TI SPECULATIONS ON THE FUTURE OF ADVERTISING RESEARCH
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The last decade has witnessed profound changes in advertising and the profession that supports it. These changes have important implications for research on advertising. This paper discusses the changes in advertising and the implications of these changes for research on advertising. It suggests that future research in advertising must address the following questions: 1) does advertising work, and, if so, when and why, 2) should advertising effects be determined with absolute or relative measures?; 3) how are the media related to advertising response?; 4) how is advertising related to the larger marketing mix of which it is a part?; and 5) how can research support advertising's inherent creative function? While these questions have been the focus of much of the advertising research to date, the paper concludes that the type of research that can answer these questions in the future may be quite different from research in the past in that it will need to focus more on advertising within context than on advertising in isolation from the larger environment of which it is a part.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines how attitude toward the ad, Aad, affects brand choice. We investigate the applicability of two contrasting perspectives-an independent or direct effects model and a mediated or indirect effects model. In a lab setting we manipulate (1) a brand's ad picture (good/bad) to affect its Aad and (2) when subjects give their Aad ratings (before/after choice). Choice is operationalized as selecting the best brand based on information contained in a set of ads. The results support the presence of an independent effect of Aad on brand choice. There were no significant timing effects, which suggests that subjects formed Aad during choice without prompting. Directions for future research and implications for advertisers are discussed.

Subjects read magazine articles interspersed with unfamiliar advertisements for common product types. Results showed that the more deeply the subjects were involved in the articles, the less they remembered about the accompanying advertisements. Articles about recipes were rated least interesting, enjoyable, and absorbing, and they elicited less attention and concentration from the readers than fiction and feature articles, but subjects who read the recipes remembered the advertisements best and subjects who read the fiction article remembered the advertisements worst.

TI ETHICAL JUDGMENTS ABOUT WARTIME ADS DEPICTING COMBAT
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Are all modem wartime ads that depict combat judged as ethical? The results of a study conducted during the recent Persian Gulf conflict suggest that the social marketing uses of such ads (e.g., to solicit blood donations) are judged as more ethical than the nonsocial uses of such ads (e.g., to increase news program viewership). Furthermore, greater moral conservativism, greater cultural localism, and stronger belief-in-a-just-world are associated with the belief that the use of such ads to promote network news programs is unethical, although stronger belief-in-a-just-world generally is associated with the belief that the use of such ads is ethical.

TI THE AMERICAN-ACADEMY-OF-ADVERTISING - THE EARLY YEARS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The first seven years of the American Academy of Advertising were crucial. It was the first and only organization ever formed specifically for advertising educators. In the beginning, many advertising educators did not see the need for such an organization and many others had a "wait and see" attitude. The Academy survived, and, at the end of the period, more than 300 teachers had joined. It also was recognized by the advertising profession. This article serves as a synopsis of those seven years.

TI ADVERTISING PRESSURES ON NEWSPAPERS - A SURVEY
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Although there are numerous anecdotal reports, there are few systematic studies of advertisers' attempts to influence news reports. The two empirical studies that examined advertising pressures on editors and writers at farm, business, and consumer magazines found that the pressure is much greater than suggested by academic writers. Another study of television found organizational pressures to approve deceptive program-length advertisements, i. e., infomercials. This study extended the empirical research about advertising pressures to newspapers. A survey of editors at daily newspapers found that just under ninety percent reported that advertisers attempted to influence the content of stories appearing in their papers; ninety percent had economic pressure applied on them by advertisers because of their reporting, and thirty-seven percent had capitulated to advertiser pressure. Despite these pressures, eighty-five percent of the editors reported that their papers carry stories that advertisers ''find critical or harmful.''

TI HISTORICAL AND PERSONAL NOSTALGIA IN ADVERTISING TEXT - THE
   FIN-DE-SIECLE EFFECT
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper uses literary criticism as the basis for stimulus-side analysis of nostalgia in advertising text.  It provides a historical context for modern nostalgia by discussing the phenomenon as a fin de siecle or ''end of century'' cultural effect. It presents a nostalgia taxonomy by distinguishing between two types of nostalgia - historical and personal - that determine advertising elements of plot, setting, characters, and values inherited from literary antecedents. It analyzes each type in commercial communications, using advertisements, are periodicals, and direct mail catalogues as examples. Personal and historical nostalgia advertisements are linked to consumer effects of, respectively, empathy and idealization of the self. Eight Propositions are developed for additional research in three areas: content analysis, different gender responses, and effects on consumer values.

A set of editors at major women's magazines sorted photos of professional fashion models. A multidimensional scaling analysis of these choices revealed six distinct types of good looks, and also identified prototypical fashion models who embodied these types. The beauty types were differentially associated with a set of perfumes and women's magazines representing diverse images. Implications of beauty types for product imagery in advertising are discussed.

TI THE IMPACT OF HUMOR IN ADVERTISING - A REVIEW
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The use of humor has become common practice in advertising; yet our knowledge about its impact has not been updated since the last major review almost twenty years ago. In the interim, a great deal of humor research has been conducted. The outcome of this research only partially supports earlier conclusions and highlights the need to apply humor with care. Humor is by no means a guarantee of better ads, but its effect can be enhanced with careful consideration of the objectives one seeks to achieve as well as the audience, situation, and type of humor.

TI DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AMERICAN AND BRITISH TELEVISION ADVERTISING -
   EXPLANATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Despite cultural similarities between the United States and the United Kingdom, there are substantial differences between American and British television advertising. British commercials tend to contain less information, employ a soft sell rather than a hard sell approach, and attempt to entertain the viewer. British viewers' opinions of advertising are also more favorable than those of American viewers. It is important that scholars and practitioners concerned with these two markets and with international advertising generally be aware of these differences and understand why they have evolved. Possible explanations are evaluated and implications of these findings discussed, including areas for future research.

Results of the current study indicate that the inclusion of sound effects can increase imagery activity and that there is a relationship between degree of imaging and feelings. Further, it is found that imagery evoking sound effects can result in more favorable attitude toward the commercial and in improved recall and recognition of ad claims. Implications for theory and advertising practice are discussed.

I also appreciate his description of the paper as ''thought-provoking'' since my objective in writing the paper was to provoke thought and discussion. Spirited debate should be a characteristic of the academic enterprise. It provides a source of energy and motivation; it can also serve to place issues and points of controversy in better focus.

TI CONTEXTUAL PRIMING EFFECTS IN PRINT ADVERTISEMENTS - THE MODERATING ROLE
   OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study examines the moderating effect of prior knowledge on the degree to which contextual priming influences evaluations of an ambiguous product (i.e., a product that can be evaluated in various ways) in the ad. Before subjects saw an ad containing ambiguous product information, one of the two product attributes pertinent to product evaluations had been brought to mind through contextual priming. Contextual priming had pronounced effects on brand evaluations among moderate-knowledge subjects, but the effects on low- and high-knowledge subjects diminished sharply. By showing that ad context can inhibit or facilitate the effects of a particular ad on brand evaluations and that the effects vary as a function of consumer knowledge, the study provides insights into the situations when contextual effects may be strong.

TI SETTING THE STAGE - COLLECTIVE SELECTION IN THE STYLISTIC CONTEXT OF
   COMMERCIALS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB While the settings (eg., furniture, props, clothing) employed in television commercials and other media are carefully selected by production personnel to convey desired imagery, little is known about the process whereby the surroundings so depicted are chosen over many other stylistic possibilities. The study investigates the degree to which the process of collective selection, where cultural specialists adhere to implicit cultural formulae in making stylistic decisions, is operative when settings to be used in television commercials are created. In a simulated preproduction task, 25 professional property masters were asked to choose from among an assortment of three types of props to dress the set for four different commercial scenarios, each of which varied the gender and implied social class of the actor who would appear. Extremely high convergence among participants was obtained for prop choices, and these selections systematically varied as the actor's demographic background was alternated. This consensus highlights the need for further research on stylistic context in advertising - the physical and sensory cues that ''place'' a product in some real or imaginary setting.

TI PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL OF INFERENCES AND DESCRIPTIVE ADVERTISING
   INFORMATION - THE EFFECTS OF MESSAGE ELABORATION
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Two issues make advertising effectiveness difficult to assess: (1) advertising effects occur both during ad processing and when ad information is retrieved, and (2) the information that consumers derive from advertisements is likely to be some combination of explicit information and inferences. The study reported in this paper addresses these issues, examining the effects of encoding and time delay on advertising processing. Results indicate that while some types of inferences (product features) are more likely to be made under strong than weak encoding conditions, other types of inferences (consumption situation) are not affected by encoding. In addition, at the time of a decision (after a time delay), memory information use depends both upon individual brand accessibility and the relative accessibility of alternative brands in the memory set. Implications for both advertising researchers and managers are offered.

TI ATTORNEY ADVERTISING AND CHANGES IN THE DEMAND FOR WILLS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Removing the ban on attorney advertising in 1977 was expected to improve consumer access to legal services. To test that proposition, we collected data on the ratio of estates probated without a will to estates probated with a will for the period 1974-1989 in one metropolitan area. It was expected that during the advertising period (August 1977 to December 1989) the time series would exhibit a downward trend statistically different from any trend component in the series prior to the advent of advertising and that the systematic behavior of the series would also change after the introduction of advertising. The intervention analysis of the ratio time series revealed that the behavior of the time series did change in 1977, consistent with the hypothesized effects of advertising on the demand for wills.

TI ATTENTION VERSUS DISTRACTION - THE INTERACTIVE EFFECT OF PROGRAM
   INVOLVEMENT AND ATTENTIONAL DEVICES ON COMMERCIAL PROCESSING
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Viewer processing of television commercials is influenced by an affective triad of viewer involvement; that is, involvement in a particular program interacts with both the viewer's involvement in the advertising message and with the ad's inherent attention-engaging capacity. Two experiments were conducted to test hypotheses relevant to this theory; the results support the assertion that both program involvement and dramatic attentional devices used in television advertisements, based on their interaction with one another and with viewers' processing motivation, have the capacity to enhance or hinder the generation of viewer thoughts relevant to ad messages. Building on prior studies, this research reveals some of the cognitive processes underlying program involvement as well as demonstrating the interactive nature of that construct in terms of message and audience characteristics.

AB This exploratory study examines the relationship between viewers' emotional response and their evaluation of television commercials along several dimensions using the Viewer Response Profile (VRP). Two general research questions are addressed. First, are demographic characteristics (such as age, sex, and brand usage) related to emotional response? Second, are there certain dimensions on the VRP that tend to be reflective of emotional response? Findings show preliminary evidence that emotional response, as measured by verbal protocols, produces no characteristic patterns in the VRP. This implies that emotional response measures may complement the VRP, rather than being redundant with it.

However, few researchers have considered how home-country culture influences firms' marketing strategies and tactics in foreign markets. In the present study, print advertisements for German and Japanese products appearing in, Indonesian, Spanish, and U.S. print media are compared. It was hypothesized that home-country culture would influence ads in each of the target countries. However, an analysis of informational and emotional content provides evidence to the contrary--that is, Japanese advertisers, in particular, appear to adapt their advertising approaches to foreign markets, whereas Germans do so, but to a lesser degree. Managerial implications of these findings are discussed.

For example, ads which employed a contrast between everyday life and the unexpected were generally perceived as more humorous than those employing a contrast between everyday life and the impossible. The theoretical and applied implications of such findings are discussed.

The study used a moral development scale developed from moral cognition research (Kohlberg 1969) to investigate the moral reasoning process used by marketing/advertising researchers. Findings from this study of 185 researchers indicate that marketing/advertising researchers reason at least at the same levels of moral development as does the general population. Further, there is very little difference in the moral reasoning skills between groups in the research chain. One implication of these findings is that a uniform code of marketing ethics might be a useful way to address perceptions of research misconduct.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Interest in information disclosure is increasing as the marketplace awaits the impact of prescription drugs gaining over-the-counter status, the FDA crackdown on health-related claims for food and cosmetics, and the attempt of advertisers to protect themselves against allegations of misleading advertising. This study examines the structural features of disclosures in prime time television advertising with respect to the FTC ''clear and conspicuous standard'' recommendations established in 1979. None of the disclosures studied was found to meet all six of the clear and conspicuous standards that were investigated. Only 12 percent of video disclosures met all video-related criteria. The findings suggest that advertisers attempt to circumvent the FTC's intentions to provide ''clear and conspicuous'' consumer information by limiting their efforts to protecting themselves against misleading advertising claims.

TI FEAR APPEALS IN PRINT ADVERTISING - AN ANALYSIS OF AROUSAL AND AD
   RESPONSE
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper examines the tenability of a two-dimensional (tension and energy) formulation of fear arousal effects in the context of print advertising. Intuitively, stimulation of fear parallels a two-part continuum of increasing tension. This exploratory study stems from the theoretical premise that increasing tension generates energy up to a certain point, and beyond that ''threshold,'' increasing tension arouses anxiety which begins to deplete energy. The study examines the effects of two print ad stimuli on the multidimensional structure of arousal, resulting attitude toward the ad and behavioral intention. The results indicate that print ad induced arousal effects fell short of the ''threshold'' point. However, a comparison between fear appeal treatment groups reveals that the stronger fear appeal resulted in arousal effects showing ''progress'' toward the threshold point. Thus, these results lend credibility to the idea of a ''threshold'' separating a two-part continuum of increasing tension. General implications of these results are discussed, and tentative suggestions in regard to the design and use of fear appeals using both print and video stimuli are furnished.

TI THE OPERATION OF VISUAL-IMAGERY AS A MEDIATOR OF ADVERTISING EFFECTS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising strategists should be interested in visual imagery because it may represent a useful way to shape consumers' impressions. A framework is tested which casts visual imagery as a mediating factor and individual differences, such as style of processing, as potential moderators of certain advertising strategies which elicit attitude and intentions differences in consumers. Results indicate that the vividness of visual imagery does operate as a latent cognitive construct when concrete wording is used in advertising copy. Instructions to imagine, however, are not found to induce visual imagery. It is concluded that visual imagery vividness has the potential to trace consumers' mental reactions to certain advertising strategies and to explain attitudinal and intentions consequences. Finally, suggestions for future research are discussed.

TI COMPREHENSION AND PERCEIVED BELIEVABILITY OF SEALS OF APPROVAL
   INFORMATION IN ADVERTISING
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper reports two exploratory studies on how seal of approval source, currentness, and longevity affect consumers' comprehension of seal meaning and how seals in general impact the perceived believability of information contained within advertisements. The results indicate that consumers do not comprehend what seals of approval represent, and in most. cases, do not perceive the believability of ad claims to be enhanced by the presence of seals of approval. Implications for researchers, advertisers, and public policy makers are discussed.

TI ADVERTISING CLEARANCE PRACTICES OF RADIO STATIONS - A MODEL OF
   ADVERTISING SELF-REGULATION
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Since advertising media can reject any advertising submission, the clearance Process is one potentially effective and powerful advertising self-regulatory tools. Previous descriptive studies have found that clearance procedures vary greatly among, television stations, and between the networks and individual stations (Rotfeld, Abernethy and Parsons 1990, Wicks 1991). Based on variables identified in the television literature, an overall model of influences on radio clearance practice is built.
   To test the model and to assess how well it can be extended from television to radio, clearance activities of a large number of radio stations are tested. Stations more closely following the 1982 NAB Code have stricter substantiation procedures. Stations with more audience complaints, greater market power and stricter substantiation processes are more likely to reject a higher percentage of advertising submissions.

TI A CONTENT-ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ADVERTISING CLAIMS - A MATRIX-METHOD
   APPROACH
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB As organizations seek to communicate with consumers who are concerned about the environment, advertisements containing environmental claims are becoming more prominent. While much has been written about environmental advertising, this phenomenon has seldom been examined systematically. This paper presents an empirical study which combines two classification schemes to create a matrix that identifies different types of environmental claims and the likelihood that such claims will be judged as misleading and/or deceptive. Results suggest that those claims which extol the environmental benefits of products and those that are designed to enhance the environmental image of an organization are most prone to be considered misleading and/or deceptive. Methods for improving environmental advertising are suggested.

TI ON THE NEED FOR RELATIVE MEASURES WHEN ASSESSING COMPARATIVE ADVERTISING
   EFFECTS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Although comparative advertising is often intended to affect how the advertised brand is perceived in relation to the comparison brand, research in this area has typically tested for effects using nonrelative measures that require judgments about the advertised brand alone. As a result such tests are rather uninformative about comparative advertising's ability to influence perceived differentiation. We propose in this article that nonrelative measures are unlikely to yield as sensitive an assessment of comparative advertising effects as are relative measures. The results from three studies involving both known and unknown advertised brands support the superior sensitivity of relative measures. Implications for copy testing methods are drawn.

TI THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS AND TESTS OF THEORY
   IN AN ADVERTISING MESSAGE INVOLVEMENT CONTEXT
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising message involvement (AMI) has been identified as an important individual/situational factor influencing advertising processing. In order to isolate and examine various theoretical relationships, researchers often experimentally manipulate AMI. In this study, several manipulations of the construct were tested for their ability to place individuals into high- and low-involvement groups. The results of the analyses indicated that modifications in manipulation instructions may alter the pattern of results obtained on manipulation- and confounding-check measures. The findings also suggest that relationships between theoretical constructs may be dependent upon the involvement manipulation utilized. The study is intended to demonstrate the delicate balance/relationship between methodological rigor and theoretical development/advancement.

AB Advertisers spend $3 billion a year on help-wanted advertising but have little empirical knowledge about this market. Using data from nine major metropolitan daily newspapers, this study investigates how changes in advertising costs, readership and market share have affected the linage and number of ads published. While revenue to newspapers has soared, linage and the number of help-wanted ads published have stagnated because dramatic price increases have counteracted the equally dramatic rise in readership and market share.

TI PRETESTING TV COMMERCIALS - METHODS, MEASURES, AND CHANGING AGENCY ROLES
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Research directors with the largest 200 agencies and, advertising executives with the largest 200 advertisers were surveyed to examine their views on the current state of TV commercial pretesting. One-hundred and one agency researchers and 89 ad executives returned completed questionnaires (adjusted response rates of 52% and 49.7%), which asked them 23 closed-ended questions about (1) the methods and measures used to pretest TV commercial executions; (2) the perceived role of the agency versus the client in the selection of pretest methods, and (3) perceived changes in the role of the agency research department in TV commercial pretest research. Of those responding, 18 percent of the agency researchers and 19 percent of the advertising executives indicated that their agencies do not pretest TV commercials for assigned brands. Based on the responses of the 83 agency researchers and 72 advertising executives whose agencies pretest commercial executions, the findings suggest that the role of the agency research department has changed over the past 10 years. Most notably, there has been a proliferation in the use of qualitative methods and measures in TV commercial pretest research.

TI MIRROR, MIRROR - SOME POSTMODERN REFLECTIONS ON GLOBAL ADVERTISING
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Global advertising succeeds when it is perceived in semiotically-equivalent ways by multicultural consumer segments. Before campaigns can be standardized it is necessary to identify segments of consumers who share an ethos, since this represents the foundation for creating advertising executions that can be understood multiculturally. This paper develops the argument that fashion and food products-what people put on and in their bodies-enable the universally-held need of self-expression, and in that sense their perceptions are thereby driven by a common ethos. Certain consumers, apart from their resident cultures, regard these products in essentially equivalent, self-relevant ways, so they are prime candidates for global, if not wholly standardized, advertising. Two multicultural segments for which these products are especially self-relevant are identified: (1) the world's economically-elite consumers (a segment which has been widely recognized); and (2) the post-World-War-II generations of consumers in Western societies (a ''postmodern'' segment, which is only coming into recognition). Using both content analysis and semiotic interpretation, international print advertising for fashion and food products aimed at the latter segment is illustrated with a view toward explaining what makes it mulitculturally understood (and, in that sense, ''effective''). Overall, this stimulus-side analysis demonstrates the use of semiotics as a way of thinking about global advertising, particularly in an imagistic postmodern world.

TI CONSUMPTION IMAGERY IN MUSIC TELEVISION - A BICULTURAL PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Although much has been written concerning music television in the popular press and in academic publications, there has been little empirical research addressing the consumption imagery that accompanies the aesthetic elements of music videos. Given the potentially important role played by this medium in adolescent consumer socialization, this may be a significant oversight This study examines the prevalence and nature of consumption imagery in music television, with emphasis on the covariation of this imagery with different musical genres. We present data from the United States and Sweden-two cultures with very different histories with music television. Implications are drawn for the socializing effects of music television in different cultures.

TI IMAGING AND ANALYZING IN RESPONSE TO NEW PRODUCT ADVERTISING
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study focuses on two complementary modes of elaborative processing in response to advertising: imagery and analysis. Imagery is characterized by nonverbal product-related thoughts, whereas analysis is more semantic and verbal in nature. Two stimulus determinants of ad-induced imaging and analyzing are investigated and related to the purchase consideration of an innovative product. Results show that the consumer's use of imagery is related to the perceived novelty of the advertising stimulus, whereas analyzing is related to less favorable of advertising content. Product-related affect and intention to buy, in turn, are related positively to imaging and negatively to analyzing. Implications for advertising management and research are discussed.

TI FOCAL AND EMOTIONAL INTEGRATION - CONSTRUCTS, MEASURES, AND PRELIMINARY
   EVIDENCE
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper introduces two novel concepts regarding the role of the product in an ad. One concept (focal integration) reflects the extent to which the product is depicted as a central element in the ad. The second concept (emotional integration) reflects the extent to which the product is portrayed as a causal agent to the actor's emotions. Reliable measures of both constructs are developed and shown to be discriminable from related constructs and each other. Furthermore, a sample of existing ads is shown to vary on the constructs. An exploratory study investigating their effects showed that each construct is related to relevant advertising outcomes and that their effects differ for ads using positive vs. negative appeals. When appeals are negative, both integration constructs are related to ad effects. In contrast, when appeals are positive, high emotional integration appears unnecessary for enhancing ad effects, while high focal integration may be detrimental to ad effects. Implications for future research are discussed.

TI NEGATIVE POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND VOTING INTENT - THE ROLE OF
   INVOLVEMENT AND ALTERNATIVE INFORMATION-SOURCES
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Previous research on negative political advertising has found both intended and backlash effects, indicating that the impact of these ads is likely to be contingent on other factors. The current study examines some potentially important contingent variables-level of involvement and attention to both newspapers and television for political information. Regression analyses indicate that both enduring and situational involvement and attention to television news increase the impact of negative political ads on voting decisions. Although it initially appears that attention to newspaper is unrelated to the impact of negative ads, analysis of covariance shows that newspaper reading actually reduces the impact of negative ads after controlling for other variables.

TI THE ROLE OF PERSONAL VALUES AND DEMOGRAPHICS IN PREDICTING TELEVISION
   VIEWING BEHAVIOR - IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY AND APPLICATION
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigates the influence of values on the particular behavior of television viewing, but within the context of other variables, specifically, the demographic variables of gender, age, income, and education. Using a path analytic framework this study supports the position that the relationship of values to behaviors needs to be investigated in the context of other relevant variables; findings of studies investigating the simple bivariate relationships of values and behavior can be misleading. In this study, the inclusion of the direct relationships between demographics and behaviors in the model reduced some effects of values on television viewing to nonsignificance, but also revealed significant values-viewing relationships that had appeared to be nonsignificant when the direct effects of demographics were excluded from the model. Discussion addresses the implications of the model for values research and the relationship of values to television viewing behavior. implications for segmentation and targeting are also discussed.

Instead, many analyses of the relationship between tobacco advertising and consumption as well as of smoking initiation and prevalence as related to advertising, can now be found in such publications as the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the British Journal of Addiction, the New England Journal of Medicine, and the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law. To add insult to injury, those articles are the ones that are frequently quoted on the front pages or in the health columns of major newspapers and magazines as well as by the broadcast media.

TI DEPENDENCY THEORY AND THE EFFECTS OF ADVERTISING BY FOREIGN-BASED
   MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS IN LATIN-AMERICA
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Dependency Theory is a major paradigm of developmental economics that differs sharply from classical economic theory on a number of points. According to Dependency Theory, the ongoing economic, political, social, and cultural transformations within Latin America bring with them a greater reliance on an expanding capitalistic world system. Through this world system, advanced nations extract surplus value from underdeveloped nations, thus keeping the latter underdeveloped and condemning them to perpetual class conflicts and oppressive governments. This theory, which is accepted by many educated Latin Americans, largely explains the chilly reception that many foreign-based multinational corporations have received in Latin America. After a short introduction, four tenets of Dependency Theory are considered that are relevant to consumer advertising by foreign-based multinational corporations. Then, the evidence for and against seven propositions are considered: four of which concern conspicuous consumption, unhealthy lifestyles, and local cultural values, and three of which concern the dominance of U.S. ad agencies in Latin America, the prevalence of foreign programming and ads, and the extent of advertising clutter.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigates (1) how immigrant consumers change their media consumption when they move across cultural boundaries and (2) whether media exposure relates to consumers' acculturation of the new social norms. A total of 938 respondents from four sample groups including Hong Kong residents, long-time and new Hong Kong immigrants to Canada and English-speaking Caucasian Canadians responded to a predesigned questionnaire. It was found that while the immigrant groups did not increase their total media consumption, their consumption across different media types followed both assimilation and ethnic affirmation models. This acculturation process seemed to be affected by immigrants' original media consumption behavior and language ability. Media exposure was found to relate significantly to immigrants' acculturation of the new social norms after influences due to personal characteristics were removed.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Examining the cross-national applicability of advertising measures is becoming increasingly important, especially in rapidly changing countries such as Russia. Therefore, our study's purpose is first to demonstrate recommended procedures for testing the cross-national equivalence of advertising belief and attitude measures. Then, we conduct an initial cross-national comparison of beliefs and attitudes toward advertising in general between student samples from both the U.S. (n=148) and from Russia (n=64). Results indicate that, while Russian respondents felt advertising is more essential, U.S. respondents felt advertising resulted in greater negative social effects. Also, U.S. respondents were more favorable toward the institution of advertising (its purpose and effects), with no differences for the instrument of advertising (its methods and practices). Russian respondents' attitudes toward advertising in general were more favorable than those of U.S. respondents.

Symbolic interactionism suggests that things have different meanings for different people at different times. The author discusses the influence of Russian culture on advertising in the former Soviet Union and the problem of imposing Western concepts. A month-long research study was conducted in Moscow, Russia in May 1991. Interviews with government officials, business and advertising industry professionals, academicians, and students were audiotaped. Findings suggest that advertising in the former Soviet Union is an interaction between social and economic realities and not just a means of uncovering a new marketplace.

AB In Central Europe's first free election, Hungarian campaign architects created a genre of television advertising designed to communicate political party values by linking them with values of national importance. Using Rokeach's two-value typology, this culture-based study analyzes the political commercials produced by the nation's predominant parties in 1990 for their values-related content. Hungarian scholars, media experts and party officials contributed to this interpretive analysis of the campaign's visual images for their reflection of national and political values. Results suggest that political commercials are useful for identifying prevailing values and can contribute to an understanding of a nation's culture. The study has particular importance for advertisers in countries which are undergoing the transition to a free-market economy.

TI A REVISED COMMUNICATION MODEL FOR ADVERTISING - MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OF
   THE SOURCE, THE MESSAGE, AND THE RECIPIENT
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The purpose of this paper is to present a revised communication model that describes advertising by drawing upon its kinship with crafted text rather than with everyday speech. The model expands the traditional communication triad by inscribing advertisers, promotional text, and consumers as multidimensional participants in a complex interactive process. The paper begins by presenting the rationale for treating commercial messages as written ''text'' and recategorizing them as more complex than the oral discourse of word-of-mouth conversations. It next summarizes the steps by which the original oral communication model is transformed from speech to literature to advertising. It then discusses the expanded triad, considering multiple aspects of the source, the message, and consumer-recipients. It concludes with suggestions for research using the revised model to investigate gaps in knowledge about source credibility, message/media effects, and the interactive consumer.

TI THE USE OF FIGURES-OF-SPEECH IN PRINT AD HEADLINES
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A content analysis of 2183 print ads with a headline was conducted to investigate the frequency with which figures of speech and figure categories are used in ad headlines and the extent to which selected executional factors relate to their use. A figure of speech entails the use of words in a manner that is varied from common use. Delineation of forty-one figures of speech, organized by functional similarity, is provided along with a review of relevant research literature. Results revealed that selected figures of speech, including alliteration, assonance and puns are widely used, whereas others are not. Various executional factors were found to be related to figure use. Implications of the results for the practice of advertising are provided and research directions outlined.

Hypotheses are tested using experiments in which subjects set advertising budgets. Results indicate that subjects were generally competitive, but also based their strategy selections on what they expected their opponents to do, what their opponents did last time, whether the competitive relationship was expected to continue, market shares, and whether the subject's profit objectives were short- or long-term, Individual differences also played a part in determining strategy selection.

TI BEAUTY BEFORE THE EYES OF BEHOLDERS - THE CULTURAL ENCODING OF BEAUTY
   TYPES IN MAGAZINE ADVERTISING AND MUSIC TELEVISION
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Although researchers have conceptualized beauty as unidimensional, modern-day cultural definitions of beauty are multidimensional. This paper focuses on two forms of mass media that play an important role in transmitting information about multiple and diverse cultural ideals of beauty-fashion magazine advertising and music videos shown on music television. We examine the overall prevalence of different beauty ideals and how these are distributed across specific vehicles within each medium. We also compare the emphasis placed on different ideals of beauty across these two communications media (print vs. television) and formats (advertising vs. entertainment). The implications of the findings for understanding the cultural construction of beauty ideals and for understanding how advertising and other mass media communications contribute to them are discussed, Several extensions of the present research are proposed.

TI INCREASING COGNITIVE RESPONSE SENSITIVITY
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Traditional cognitive response elicitation procedures may not be sensitive enough to elicit the stylized and subtle thoughts that are generated during exposure to certain types of ads. When these types of thoughts are the focus of an advertising researcher's work, it is critical that he or she develop a procedure that has the sensitivity to draw them forth without being reactive. A laboratory study examines two different procedures to do this: pre-exposure exercises and directed post-exposure instructions. The results suggest that each procedure raises measurement sensitivity, but that there is no advantage in combining them. General guidelines are then presented for developing stylized cognitive response elicitation procedures.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study compares effectiveness of comparative and noncomparative advertising for products characterized by different levels of cognitive and affective involvement. Comparative advertisements induce more positive brand attitudes for products which elicit cognitive and affective motivations simultaneously. This happens because brand comparisons facilitate an attribute-based processing style which might otherwise succumb to the competing affective involvement. Noncomparative attribute-based ads yield more favorable attitudes toward the ad when affective involvement is high than when it is low. Comparative ads are also shown to positively influence brand switchers and have a negative impact on consumers loyal to competing brands.

TI ADVERTISING ETHICS - EMERGING METHODS AND TRENDS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB What is Ethics?  What is Advertising?  The contemporary philosopher, William Frankena (1973), has defined ethics as a set of moral principles directed at enhancing societal well-being.  Frankena reduces those moral principles to two:  beneficence (doing good) and justice (being fair).  Another contemporary philosopher, Geoffrey Warnock (1971), lists four principles which seem to be particularly appropriate for advertising:  beneficence, nonmaleficence (don't harm), nondeception, and nondiscrimination.  At times, questions have arisen as to whether such principles are followed and whether societal well-being is, indeed, enhanced by the actions of advertisers.

Present beliefs about such research, as expressed by a random sample of academicians in the American Academy of Advertising, include the belief that practitioners are uninterested in ethics research.  Beliefs about the future of such research, as forecast by the same academicians, include the need for better measures related to ethics.  Other promising research topics are use of deception, advertising to children, ads for legal vices, negative political ads, and stereotyping in ads.

TI ETHICAL ADVERTISING RESEARCH STANDARDS - 3 CASE-STUDIES
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Demands for major changes in the regulation of advertising have come forth as a result of the December, 1991 publication of three articles concerning the cartoon character Joe Camel.  The articles all appeared in the same issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association and received extensive coverage in major newpapers and magazines.  This paper examines each article to determine its conformance with 15 ethical standards gleaned from various associations and journals; these standards represent the accepted professional norms of conduct for social science research.  There is also a closer examination of one of the studies using discovery material from a law suit against the R.J. Reynolds firm.  This affords a unique opportunity to examine the ethical standards used in that study.
   Five reviewers from different disciplines were asked to independently evaluate each of the papers.  The results revealed major concerns about the quality of each study.  When these reviews are laid against the ethical guidelines for social science research, it appears there were major flaws in the conduct of all three.  Particularly highlighted are the advocacy nature of the research and serious questions concerning reliability and validity.  Additional concern about one of the studies is raised by the litigation discovery material, as there is evidence of pre-determined results, non-reporting of conflicting data, and ''adjusting'' of the sample to produce desired results consistent with researchers' pre-conceived theories.

TI THE NARRATIVE PARADIGM AS A PERSPECTIVE FOR IMPROVING ETHICAL
   EVALUATIONS OF ADVERTISEMENTS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Recently, an increased number of advertisements have been questioned as being potentially unethical.  Because of complaints from academicians, special interest groups, competitors, and broadcasters, certain advertising campaigns have been pulled from the media.  The fact that potentially unethical ads are reaching the market-place suggests that current methods of ad evaluation may be inadequate for some of today's controversial or innovative campaigns.  The authors introduce the narrative paradigm as a possible solution or tool for discerning potentially unethical aspects of advertisements.  A narrative approach to the evaluation of ad messages can reveal inconsistencies between the ad and the intended or influential audiences before the damaging effects of inappropriate campaigns occur.

Findings from the quasi-experiment indicate that the ''ethical'' attribute belongs to a set of salient, ''utilitarian'' cognitions that influence how political commercials are evaluated.  These findings suggest that ethical perceptions really matter.  However, certain emotional ''hedonic'' cognitive responses, which voters say are nonsalient in their overall evaluations of political ads, in fact may circumvent the powerful impact of ethical-and other salient-cognitive elements.  Implications for political advertising strategy and public policy are discussed.

Topics from two broad categories of advertising practices are investigated: targeting practices and message strategies. For each topic, consumer perceptions are analyzed as a function of the participants' moral ideologies of idealism and relativism, dimensions obtained from the Ethics Position Questionnaire. Results show that consumers believe advertising often violates broad ethical norms. In addition, the degree to which consumers judge advertising as ethical or unethical varies as a function of their relativism and idealism.

AB Sexuality in advertising is a major area of ethical concern, though surprisingly little is known about its effects or the norms for its use.  The author suggests a framing perspective on these two issues that consists of (1) a research agenda concerning the alleged effects and morality of sexual appeals (i.e., teleological vs. deontological considerations) and (2) a set of ethics-based, policy guidelines for addressing these issues (i.e., choice enhancement vs. consumer protection).  Applying this framing perspective, the author provides a basis for making ethical choices about the use of sexual appeals in advertising.

It specifically focuses upon responses on the Reidenbach-Robin multidimensional ethics scale, ad attitude, brand attitude, and purchase intentions.  The findings indicate that, regardless of the respondent's gender, the use of a strong overt sexual appeal in a print advertisement was not well received.  Consequently, advertisers need to rethink the use of strong overt sexual appeals, especially given the controversial issues surrounding such advertising stimuli and their popular use to break through media clutter.

The majority of spokes-characters observed in this study were humans, animal personifications, or product personifications.  Characters were more likely to speak for the product than provide visual demonstration although they did both in more than half the cases.  There were far more non-celebrity than celebrity spokes-characters, and a large majority of them were male.  Significant differences were found in the use of animation across dayparts, program types, product classes and product categories.  Although no increase was evident in the use of animation since the last study was completed, there was evidence to suggest that the role of animation has been changing in the past decade.  Findings indicate that animated spokes-characters are being used more often to present high involvement products to adult audiences.

The authors use a time-series approach to study the effect of financial-relations advertising on stock trading volume and stock price.  They find increases in trading volume at the initial appearance of a financial-relations advertisement, but not during subsequent appearances of the ad.  Further, these increases occur mainly for small capitalization firms.  No support is found for the view that this type of advertising positively affects stock prices, at least in the short run.  Although financial-relations advertising may change the expectations of individual investors, such advertising does not appear to change the market's view of a stock.

The number of companies participating in sponsorship, as well as corporate expenditures for sponsoring events, is on the rise as organizations seek new ways to reach audiences and enhance their image.  The importance of corporate sponsorship is now generally acknowledged, but little research has been done to understand its value and effectiveness.  An exploratory study was conducted to examine the relationship between sponsorship and corporate image.  The results suggest that corporate sponsorship can improve corporate image, but its effects differ among companies.  Moreover, sponsorship is only one of the information sources consumers use to form their impressions of an organization.  Under certain circumstances, corporate sponsorship can damage, rather than enhance, the image of a company.

TI THE DEATH OF ADVERTISING
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Mass media advertising as we know it today is on its deathbed, and its prognosis is poor.  Advertising agencies are restructuring to accommodate a harsher advertising climate, agency income is flat, agency employees are being laid off, direct marketing is stealing business from traditional advertising, and the growth of sales promotion and integrated marketing communications both come at the expense of traditional advertising.  The reason for advertising's impending demise is the advent of new technologies that have resulted in the fragmentation of media and markets, and the empowerment of consumers.  In the place of traditional mass media advertising, a new communications environment is developing around an evolving network of new media, which is high capacity, interactive and multimedia.  The result is a new era of producer-consumer interaction.  Because of the speed of technological innovation, the new media advertising paradigm that results will attain prominence faster than did mass media advertising.  The new paradigm of 21st Century Marketing and advertising will be dominant by 2010 and should last well into the middle of the century.  If they hope to survive, university advertising departments will have about ten years to 1) think of themselves much more broadly, and 2) transform themselves into departments specializing in information transfer in the new media environment.

The word ''crisis'' (Stewart 1992) may be too strong to describe the current situation in the advertising industry, but no one can deny that these are trying times for advertisers.  Current trends in the industry are indeed cause for alarm.  However, to paraphrase Mark Twain, Rust and Oliver's (1994) report that advertising is suffering from a terminal illness is greatly exaggerated.  The disturbing trends of the 90s are not necessarily permanent, and the industry's future may be much brighter than suggested.  In what follows, we offer alternative explanations for today's problems and suggest an optimistic future for the industry rather than ''impending doom.''

Men are more apt to change channels during the commercial break than are women. Compared with previous studies conducted prior to the development of the multi-channel viewing environment, program eyes-on-screen times have remained stable while commercial, eyes-on-screen times have diminished. Moreover individuals who view programming are significantly more apt to view commercials. It is argued that eyes-on-screen measures may be valuable in determining exposure to advertising.

TI TO BE AND NOT TO BE - LIFE-STYLE IMAGERY, REFERENCE GROUPS, AND THE
   CLUSTERING OF AMERICA
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising often seeks to portray products in the context of idealized and desirable lifestyles. Similarly, consumers' product choices are often motivated by their desire to identify with or to avoid particular idealized lifestyles. In the present paper, we focus on the degree to which consumers' judgments of the consumption patterns associated with marketer defined lifestyle groups correspond to actual market data. The desire to emulate or to avoid reference groups is hypothesized to influence consumers' cognitive representations of the consumption choices associated with these lifestyle groups, and to mediate the convergence between consumer perceptions and empirical consumption data. Analyses focus on consumers' ability to reproduce commercial lifestyle data (accuracy), and the extent to which consumers' perceptions agree with one another (consensus). Significant differences in accuracy and consensus were found among the perceived consumption patterns associated with aspirational and avoidance groups. We discuss the implications of these reference group processes and their relationship to consumers' cognitive representations of lifestyle categories for advertising strategy and research.

TI THE ADVERTISING EXPOSURE EFFECT OF FREE STANDING INSERTS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Manufacturers of consumer packaged goods regularly distribute coupons through free standing inserts in newspapers. In this paper, we investigate the possibility that free standing inserts have an advertising exposure effect that influences the brand purchases of shoppers who do not use coupons in the category studied. If free standing inserts for a brand do have a pure advertising exposure effect, there should be an increase in the sales of that brand even to non-users of the coupons. Results of an. empirical analysis show that such an effect does exist for two of the six cases investigated. We also find some evidence of a cross-brand advertising exposure effect indicating that the sales of a competing brand to non-users of coupons decrease in the weeks following the appearance of a coupon in a free standing insert.

TI GENDER DIFFERENCES IN INFORMATION-PROCESSING STRATEGIES - AN
   EMPIRICAL-TEST OF THE SELECTIVITY MODEL IN ADVERTISING RESPONSE
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB According to the ''selectivity model,'' females are comprehensive information processors who consider both subjective and objective product attributes, and respond to subtle cues. Conversely, males are selective information processors who tend to use heuristics processing and miss subtle cues. These predictions are tested in an experiment where males and females listened to either objective or subjective advertising claims for either a low-risk or moderate-risk product. The results generally supported the predictions of the selectivity model with the exception that males did not respond more favorably to the objective claims. Implications for advertising theory and research are discussed.

AB In an, exploratory study, two message appeals (rational and emotional) and two media (print and radio) were tested to determine whether certain message or media strategies are more appropriate than others for two broad categories of retail services. For both types of services, a rational appeal generated higher levels of attitude toward the ad than an emotional appeal and radio ads generated higher levels of patronage intention than print ads. In addition, a main effect for service type was found for two of the dependent variables, indicating that more experiential retail services may benefit more, overall, from radio and print advertising than utilitarian offerings.

TI GREEN ADVERTISING - SALVATION OR OXYMORON
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The purpose of this paper is to clarify the nature of green advertising, thus demonstrating that the concept is far more complex than the extant marketing literature suggests. Green is characterized here as a two dimensional concept with political (reformism to radicalism) and human positional (anthropocentric to ecocentric) dimensions. It is argued here that there are at least five different types of green, including environmentalism, conservationism, human welfare ecology, preservationism, and ecologism. To understand the greenness of an advertisement, it is useful to position it within this framework; and each type suggests a different human position with respect to nature and a different political orientation. The proposed framework is useful for defining terms such as ''green,'' ''environmental,'' and ''ecological'' which are often used interchangeably in the marketing and advertising literature.

TI SHADES OF GREEN - A MULTIDIMENSIONAL-ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL
   ADVERTISING
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Environmental appeals are becoming increasingly common in advertising, but all green ads are not created equal. The authors report the results of a content analysis designed to uncover the underlying structure of green advertising. A convenience sample of 95 green TV ads and 173 green print ads were content-analyzed. Multidimensional analysis indicates that the structure of green advertising can be captured in three dimensions: sponsor type (for-profit or nonprofit), ad focus (whether the ad focuses on the advertiser or the consumer), and depth of ad (shallow, moderate, or deep depending on the extent of environmental information mentioned). A majority of advertisers in the sample attempted to project a green corporate image rather than focusing on the environmental benefits of their product or service.

TI AGENCY REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETING CLAIMS - CASE-BY-CASE

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Environmental claims in marketing are subject to review by a variety of government and self-regulatory bodies. Although some of these bodies have issued guidelines, the most important precedents have been set in case-by-case actions. We discuss cases brought by the state attorneys general and the New York City Division of Consumer Affairs, and examine in detail cases brought by the Federal Trade Commission and the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus between 1990 and the end of 1994. Similarities and differences among the cases brought by these bodies are analyzed in relation to the goals and powers of the various review bodies. We conclude with observations about the adequacy with which issues involving environmental issues (e.g., degradability, recyclability, ozone impact, life cycle assessments) have been addressed in case-by-case action and provide some suggestions for future research.

AB This research examined hour consumers responded to different print advertisements for a green laundry detergent. Hypotheses based on the salience literature were developed and tested in a laboratory experiment. One group considered a ''green'' appeal which emphasized the environmental attributes of the product. Another group considered a ''non-green'' appeal which emphasized the cost-saving attributes of the product. We measured each subject's involvement with the environment. Our results showed that for those highly involved with the environment, there were no significant differences in purchase intent, attitude toward the ad, and support arguments between appeals. However, for those Less involved with the environment, the green appeal was significantly more persuasive than the non-green appeal in terms of the same variables.

(1991) and Fine (1990) proposed that, when concern is already high, a sick baby appeal may reduce perceived consumer effectiveness. They suggested an alternative approach, a ''well baby'' appeal, which would stress the significance of individual action. Two experiments supported the hypothesis that the effectiveness of these appeals depends on the relative salience of the issue. Further, the results generally supported the proposed processes by which the appeals operate-mediation of perceived concern and perceived consumer effectiveness.

AB The authors construct a psychographic profile of the green consumer in terms of variables directly related to purchase behavior, such as price consciousness and general care in shopping interest in new products, and brand loyalty. Additionally, they address attitudes toward advertising and media preferences. Data from 3264 respondents to the DDB Needham Life Style Study were analyzed. The results show the green consumer to be an opinion leader and a careful shopper who seeks information on products, including information from advertising, but also suggest that the green consumer is rather skeptical of advertising. The implications are that green consumers may be receptive to green marketing and advertising, but marketers should take care not to alienate them by using ambiguous or misleading messages.

TI DOES TV-ADVERTISING REALLY AFFECT SALES - THE ROLE OF MEASURES, MODELS,

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Traditional econometric models suggest that advertising has a clear and significant positive effect on sales in the current period. However, recent studies using scanner data indicate that the estimated effects of TV advertising on households' brand choices are weak and rarely significant. Do those findings mean that TV advertising does not really have an impact on current brand choices and sales? Or are the discrepant findings due to differences among the measures, models, and aggregation levels used by different researchers? The authors address these issues. Their analysis indicates that aggregating data over time and households may create a false impression of advertising having a statistically significant effect on sales.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The split 30-second commercial format has become a regular feature of today's television advertising. Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of commercials presented in the two halves of a split:30. The authors report findings from a laboratory experiment in which the similarity of commercials presented in the two halves of a split:30 format was systematically varied. In a factorial design, subjects were exposed to either two identical:15s, two very similar:15s, or two very different:15s for the same brand. Memory of the advertised brand was measured after either a short interval (within a few minutes of message exposure) or a Long interval (the next day). Results provide preliminary support for the assertion that presenting identical:15s leads to better memory after short intervals and presenting different:15s produces better memory after long intervals. The findings are explained through a variation of the encoding variability theory.

TI BRAND EQUITY, BRAND PREFERENCE, AND PURCHASE INTENT
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The issue of brand equity has emerged as one of the most critical areas for marketing management in the 1990s. Despite strong interest in. the subject, however, there is little empirical evidence of how brand value is created and what its precise effects are. This study explores some of the consequences of brand equity. In particular, the authors examine the effect of brand equity on consumer preferences and purchase intentions. For comparative purposes, two sets of brands are tested, one from a service category characterized by fairly high financial and functional risk (hotels), and one from a generally lower risk product category (household cleansers). Each set includes two brands that are objectively similar (based on Consumer Reports ratings), but they have invested markedly different levels of advertising spending over the past decade. Across both categories, the brand with the higher advertising budget yielded substantially higher levels of brand equity. In turn, the brand with the higher equity in each category generated significantly greater preferences and purchase intentions.

TI HOW MAGAZINE ARTICLES PORTRAYED ADVERTISING FROM 1900 TO 1940
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising has been a frequent target of criticism during its entire modern era. Most of the criticism has come from ''elite'' observers of society. In contrast, the general public has historically viewed advertising in a more positive way. To understand the origin of this discrepancy in opinions about advertising, the study examines how advertising was portrayed in magazines from 1900 to 1940. Using an ''elitist''-based categorization of advertising criticisms, the study finds that articles addressing advertising appeared most frequently in fairly elite and specialized magazines, and that they were most often positive toward advertising. Given the number of years and number of publications covered by the study, however, the overall number of articles on the subject was relatively small. Magazines' light and mostly positive coverage of advertising suggests that this popular medium may have reflected rather than influenced public opinion, and that editorial boards were interested in pleasing advertisers.

TI STANDARDIZED MULTINATIONAL ADVERTISING - THE INFLUENCING FACTORS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising for multinational products uses standardization most often in strategy, less often in executions, and least often in language. This study's international sample of advertising agency executives considers creative impact the most important and pressure (from time, client, etc.) the least important reason to use some form of standardized advertising. Despite this, it is views on client pressure which explain most of the variance in views on future use of standardization. That is, those respondents who believe that client pressure is increasing also believe that overall use of standardization will increase. A separate sample of agency executives reinforced some of these findings, particularly the role of the successful, big idea and client pressure in making the decision to standardize. Copy research also plays a role in standardization recommendations, but it is not used as extensively as might be necessary.

Most published scales pertain to enduring product involvement. Few studies have addressed enduring involvement with a service or situational involvement with either a product or a service. Most of the involvement research in advertising has investigated the effects of situational involvement on other variables. Despite the considerable theoretical work related to the involvement concept, knowledge remains incomplete. Additional scale development is advocated as a means for increasing the Knowledge base.

TI Ad size as an indicator of perceived advertising costs and effort: The
   effects on memory and perceptions
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In support of past research, ad size was found to lead to enhanced memory; but the existence of an ''interference effect'' (i.e., when increased attention aimed at the relatively large ad interferes with processing of surrounding ads) was not confirmed. Replicating Kirmani (1990), analyses suggest that consumers use ad size as an indicator of advertising costs and effort and that consumers make quality-related inferences based on their perceptions of advertising costs when quality-related information is not explicitly conveyed in an ad. Evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between perceived advertising costs and brand perceptions was found for quality perceptions. That is, perceptions are positively related to perceived advertising costs except at excessive levels when consumers may feel advertising is manipulative. The data also support the notion that perceived advertising effort mediated this relationship. The nature of these relationships between perceived advertising costs and consumer perceptions differed across the various perception measures.

She used nonverbal measures in interviews with children three to eight years of age to assess how recognition of cigarette brand advertising symbols is related to age, cognitive developmental level, children's affect toward cigarettes, children's evaluation of cigarettes, and children's ability to identify adults as the appropriate target market for cigarettes. The results show that recognition of cigarette brand advertising symbols increases with age, as does overall recognition of brand advertising symbols in general. Regardless of age, cognitive developmental level, or recognition scores, children reported not liking cigarettes, believing cigarettes are ''bad for you,'' and finding children to be an inappropriate target market for cigarettes. Findings are discussed in terms of social science and public policy, and in terms of the implications for cognitive development.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The author investigates the ways in which advertisers can use silence in, radio commercials to increase attention to, and subsequent retention of, information in an advertisement. It is argued here that, when music is used in an advertisement, listener attention can be focused on specific pieces of information by cutting to silence just before presenting the crucial information and by continuing the underlying silence as the information is presented. An experiment is reported in which silence effectively increases the listener retention of ad information, in comparison with the use of either background music or background silence throughout. The effect was greatest when the highlighted information was the last item of a series. However, counter to expectations, advertisements with no background music whatsoever did not induce greater overall recall than ads with background music throughout.

The experiment used a two (levels of program arousal) by two (levels of program pleasantness) design to assess the effects of the independent variables on viewers' perceptions of commercial pleasantness for a pod of four commercials. As hypothesized, an assimilation effect occurred in the high arousal condition and a contrast effect occurred in the low arousal condition.

Although most scholars recognize the need for a replication tradition in their respective disciplines, studies have documented a paucity of replication research in the advertising/consumer behavior/marketing literature. The authors investigate the prevalence of replication research by soliciting journal editors' perceptions of their disciplines' attitudes toward such work. Two studies were conducted questioning editors first in the natural and social sciences and, later, editors in advertising, communications, and marketing journals. Findings included that natural science editors have generally endorsed replication as a necessary part of research, while social science editors have been less than enthusiastic about its adoption. Marketing communications and advertising editors responded consistently with that of most other social science editors.

TI How French advertising professionals develop creative strategy
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Content analyses of French advertisements have shown French advertising to be markedly different from American advertising. A qualitative study of French advertising through in-depth interviews with creative directors, analysis of agency documents, and photographic documentation of French advertising revealed four emic descriptors - la seduction, le spectacle, l'amour, l'humour - that characterize French advertising. Suggestions are made for American manufacturers who want to advertise to the French market and implications are drawn for future research in describing the advertising of a particular culture.

TI Responses to humorous advertising: The moderating effect of need for
   cognition
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB An empirical study investigated the effects of humor and need for cognition on an individual's response to print ads about cameras. Results indicate that the effect of humor is moderated by an. individual difference factor, a person's need for cognition. Specifically, on measures of attitudes and purchase intention, humor appears more effective in generating favorable responses from persons whose need for cognition is low rather than high. Findings also suggest that the influence of humor on attitude toward the brand is mediated by attitude toward the ad.

TI Something old, something new: Exploring the interaction between ritual
   and advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Although the study of consumer rituals is increasing, the relationship between advertising and consumer rituals has not been explored. The authors offer a framework for examining the influence of those cultural institutions, articulating the ways advertising can influence consumption during rituals, as well as the ways advertising employs ritual symbolism to create messages about products and services not designed for use during such occasions. They provide examples of ads employing symbols associated with the wedding sociologically and economically significant ritual in our culture. The authors argue that advertising not only influences ritual, but is often a form of secular ritual itself. They propose several areas for future research.

TI The value of competition among agencies in developing ad campaigns:
   Revisiting Gross's model
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Conventionally, an advertiser's spending on the creative component of an advertising campaign is small in relation to the media budget and is channeled exclusively to a single advertising agency. Gross challenged those conventions more than 20 years ago, using a mathematical model of advertising effectiveness. His model suggested spending more on the creative component and doing so in a competition among several independent sources. The model assumed a normal distribution of effectiveness of advertisements. Data on response to consumer product ads show that the distribution of effectiveness is not normal, but quite skewed. Using Monte Carlo simulations and Gross's framework the authors find that the skewness strengthens the case for competition. Shifting a sizable percentage of a campaign budget away from media spending and into competitive generation of creative renderings apparently can be very profitable.

TI The information content of advertising: A meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The amount of information contained in advertising is art important issue to scholars, critics, and users of advertising. Almost 60 studies have used a procedure introduced in 1977 by Resnik and Stern to measure the information content of advertising. The results, reported in a wide variety of outlets, are conflicting Metaanalysis of that literature helps to (1) develop norms for information levels and research procedures, (2) reveal systematic sources of variation in reported information levels across studies, and (3) identify areas that have been examined in depth and call attention to other areas that warrant further research. Because study findings are found to depend on several method factors, controlling for the effects of those factors through the meta-analysis procedure helps to clarify how media type, country economic development, and product durability influence measured information levels.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Subjects scoring high on the Affect Intensity Measurement (AIM) scale responded with greater emotional intensity than low AI subjects to both positive and negative emotional appeals. These high AI individuals also expressed more positive attitudes and higher Levels of enjoyment of the positive emotional appeal. However, in response to the negative emotional appeal, high AI and low AI subjects did not differ in ad enjoyment level or attitude toward the ad. Emotional responses mediated the effects of affect intensity on attitude toward the ad only when subjects were exposed to the positive emotional appeal. Theoretical and managerial implications of the effect of affect intensity on the recipient's attitude toward high impact emotional advertising appeals are discussed.

   commercials run in the Dominican Republic and in the United States
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The use of music and lyrics in commercials run in the United States is compared with their use in commercials run in the Dominican Republic (D.R.). The authors briefly review present theoretical perspectives on the role of music in advertising and address the need to conceptualize music as a culturally situated variable. They discuss the structure of Dominican TV media and examine the influence of U.S. media culture in the D.R., then develop a set of propositions about cross-cultural differences in the extensiveness of music and lyrics in commercials, the style of music used, and the product meanings conveyed in lyrics. The propositions are tested in a content analysis of commercials. The findings support the propositions and indicate a need for sociological and interpretive approaches to the study of the role of music in advertising.

TI Increasing brand name recall in print advertising among Asian consumers
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The authors replicate and extend previous research on the effects of pictures, consumer information-processing level, ad meaning, and ad exposure on brand name recall by using consumers in a different culture. The findings indicate the robustness of the effects of those factors on recall. Specifically, better recall was obtained with ads containing pictures and words than with words-only ads, with ads processed semantically than with ads processed sensorially, with ads having high level of meaning, and with ads that were repeated. Use of a high-meaning picture-and-words ad that was processed semantically and repeated achieved an improvement of nearly 52% in brand name recall over use of a low-meaning words-only ad that was processed sensorially and shown once to subjects. The most significant contributor to explaining brand recall variation is the level-of-meaning factor, followed by ad exposure, level of processing and ad type. Several significant interactions among those factors also were observed that replicate and extend prior findings in psychology and marketing research. Implications of the results are discussed and future research directions are suggested.

TI Is value associated with initiating new advertising agency-client
   relations?
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A variety of factors motivate firms' managers to initiate new relations with advertising agencies. Principal among the factors is the desire to improve the firm's financial performance. The authors examine whether initiating new relations results in a change in the market value of the firm, that is, whether there is a wealth effect. Three situations involving new relations are studied a firm's announcement that a new account is established with an advertising agency, a firm's announcement that a new account is established with an agency already linked to the firm, and a firm's announcement that a new account is established for a new business activity by the Fm. One overall sample and three subsamples corresponding to the three situations were compiled for analysis. The results for the overall sample show significant negative wealth effects associated with the announcements of new agency-client relations. Similarly, negative wealth effects are observed for the first subsample. However, significantly positive wealth effects are observed on a delayed basis for the second subsample (announcements of new accounts with agencies already linked to the firms) and for the third subsample (announcements of new accounts for new activities). Announcements associated with more prestigious agencies resulted in more positive wealth effects. Finally, announcements by firms with relatively poor financial performance were associated with relatively lower wealth effects. Possible managerial implications of the results are discussed.

TI Tangibility in services advertising: An investigation of verbal versus
   visual cues
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB As the service sector of the U.S. economy continues to grow dramatically, so does the need for increased attention to advertising strategies for the service sector. The author examines print advertising strategy for services by testing whether the presence of a visual tangible cue (a physical representation) and the use of verbal tangible cues (informational cues related to tangible dimensions of the service) influence the effectiveness of the advertisement. Results indicate that for a hotel (a service high in experience qualities), verbal tangible cues are related to more positive attitudes toward the ad and service, higher patronage intentions and higher levels of recall. For an auto service (high in credence qualities), verbal tangible cues are related positively to attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the service, and recall, but not patronage intention. The presence of the physical representation did not affect any of the four dependent variables.

AB In an empirical study, the authors investigated the effects of different advertising appeals used in the United States and China. The study focused on the match between values expressed in advertising and values in each of the two cultures, and included the influence of product use condition (socially visible use vs. use in a private setting). Results indicate that although culturally congruent appeals were more effective in general, product use condition moderated the effectiveness of culturally incongruent advertising appeals. Specifically, the subjects' reactions to the appeal were more positive when the appeal matched the product use condition than when the appeal did not match either the culture or the product use condition. Managerial implications are discussed.

TI Assessing the media habits and needs of the mobility-disabled consumer

AB With passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, businesses became aware of the 43 million disabled consumers as a source of concern and additional expense, but not as a salient market segment. Advertisers have yet to recognize that by learning more about the communication needs of the disabled, they can devise strategies to reach that large and generally ignored population of consumers. The authors report a study comparing mobility-disabled with nondisabled consumers in terms of media usage, attitudes toward advertising, and media needs. The results show several significant differences between the two groups. Implications for advertising practitioners are discussed.

TI Textual analysis in advertising research: Construction and
   deconstruction of meanings
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A postmodern literary method of textual analysis is presented as a systematic approach to understanding the meaning of an advertising text. The method has three steps: identification of textual elements (the parts or literary attributes), construction of meaning (the whole, a sum of parts), and deconstruction (the unsaid assumptions that challenge singular meaning). The steps are demonstrated in a workbench analysis of a single advertisement. The author proposes that the addition of deconstruction to literary analysis of advertising text contributes to behavioral and cultural research on advertising by enabling researchers to ''read'' advertisements as expressions of contemporary consumer culture. Traditional language devices long thought to influence affective responses and memory are reexamined and future research directions suggested.

Only two previous studies have looked exclusively at male images in magazine advertisements. The specific objective of the study was to describe the physical characteristics of the men appearing alone in advertisements. Body characteristics, hairstyles, facial hair, body and head positionings, dimensions of eye contact, clothing styles, and types of adornment were appraised for each male image, The results indicate some uniformity of sole-male images across magazine titles as well as interesting differences.

TI Audience accumulation by television daypart allocation based on
   household-level viewing data
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A fundamental challenge to media planners in using television advertising is to choose a daypart (time of day) combination that will achieve efficient delivery of an audience. The author addresses audience accumulation by daypart allocation with a household-level exposure model using viewing records from single-source data. By retaining the behavioral assumption of a popular beta binomial distribution model, exposure by each household within each daypart during each week is assumed to follow a binomial process with a distinct exposure probability that is inferred from the household's past exposure history. The model captures exposure heterogeneity nonparametrically by household-specific exposure probabilities rather than fitting a parametric beta function and automatically accounts for audience duplication across dayparts. This approach is made possible by the availability of large-scale household-level exposure records obtained from audimeters and the increasing computation power of personal computers. An example of spot allocation to dayparts shows hour media planners can use the model to obtain insights into audience accumulation.

Sensation seeking was also included in the experiment and analysis. rn support of the notion that the social implications of a response to a threat message influence the message's effectiveness, social threat communications were more persuasive than physical threat communications. Sensation seeking emerged as an important variable moderating response to threat communications, supporting the argument that responses may be due to factors other than the communication itself. In contrast to the argument that fear arousal is a prerequisite for effective response to threat messages, the authors found fear arousal unnecessary for persuasion to occur. The implications of the findings for the effectiveness of public service announcements are discussed.

After coding advertisements in business publications from 11 countries for the appeals employed, they computed correlation coefficients relating the proportional use of each appeal and Hofstede's cultural dimensions: individualism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity. The culture-reflecting quality of advertising was supported for 10 of 30 hypothesized relationships, and for an additional eight after removal of outliers from the data.

TI Does advertising clutter have diminishing and negative returns?
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising clutter is a phenomenon that arose from advertisers' need for advertising space. When too much space is devoted to advertising, clutter can jeopardize the audience's editorial interest. Commercial pay media such as magazines have to balance the conflicting needs of the advertiser and the audience. The authors report a longitudinal analysis of the impact of clutter on the circulation and advertising revenue of 10 selected magazines. They find that advertising clutter yields negative circulation. returns and diminishing advertising revenue returns when a magazine's clutter level exceeds historical averages. Entertainment-oriented magazines appear to be more susceptible to the negative impact of clutter than, news-oriented magazines.

In a laboratory experiment eye movement data were collected while consumers chose businesses from telephone directories. Consumers scan, listings in alphabetic order. Their scan is not exhaustive. As a result, some ads are never seen. Consumers noticed more than 93% of the quarter-page display ads but only 26% of the plain listings. They perceived color ads before ads without color, noticed more color ads than noncolor ads, and viewed color ads 21% longer than equivalent ads without color. Also, they viewed 42% more bold listings than plain listings. Consumers spent 54% more time viewing ads for businesses they ended up choosing, which demonstrates the importance of attention for subsequent choice behavior.

TI Large-agency media specialists' opinions on newspaper advertising for
   national accounts
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising practitioners' opinions about newspaper advertising for national accounts are important to the newspaper industry. Since the mid-twentieth century, newspapers' revenues from national advertising accounts have declined steadily. The authors report the results of a survey examining what large-agency media specialists think of newspapers as a national-account advertising medium in comparison with other media options. Findings suggest that newspapers fall short as an advertising medium for such accounts on several decisional dimensions, especially in comparison with network television, and that judgments about newspapers hold constant regardless of the personal, professional, and agency backgrounds of the respondents.

TI Stuck in the model trap: The effects of beautiful models in ads on
   female pre-adolescents and adolescents
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB One of advertising's ''unintended effects'' is the impact highly attractive models may have on female preadolescents and adolescents. Using social comparison theory as a framework, the authors propose that young girls compare their physical attractiveness with that of advertising models and, subsequently, their self-perceptions and self-esteem may be affected, depending on the motive for social comparison. They report a study with a mixed-model design in which motive was manipulated. Girls in grades four, sig and eight participated. The results suggest that motive is important, as support was found for all hypotheses. However, the support was not consistent across all grades or for all dependent variables. The authors consider possible reasons for the inconsistency and discuss the implications of the findings for advertisers and educators.

TI A content analysis of guilt appeals in popular magazine advertisements
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The authors document advertisers' application of guilt appeals as a method of influence. A content analysis of guilt advertisements in 24 magazines reveals that (I) guilt appeals appear in advertising at a level comparable to that of other appeals (e.g., humor, sexual, and comparisons), (2) guilt appeals appear in every magazine type, but are most common in news and general editorial magazines, (3) the majority of guilt ads have anticipatory guilt appeals, (4) the single most common guilt statement is the statement of fact, (5) guilt is typically employed in the ad copy or in both the copy and visual images, and (6) guilt appeals appear most often in ads for charities and health-related products. Implications of the content analysis are considered and research directions outlined.

TI Asian-Americans: Television advertising and the ''model minority''
   stereotype
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Asian-Americans are a growth market. Their affluence, high education, and work ethic position them as a ''model minority.'' However complimentary that term may seen, it nonetheless represents a stereotype whose prevalence must be documented to examine the intersection of minority status and gender in mass media portrayals. The authors report a content analysis of more than 1300 prime time television advertisements conducted to assess the frequency and nature of Asian-American representation. They found that Asian male and female models are overrepresented in terms of proportion of the population (3.6%), appearing in 8.4% of the commercials. However, Asian models are more likely than members of other minority groups to appear in background roles, and Asian women are rarely depicted in major roles. Further, the findings indicate that portrayals of Asian-Americans pur so much emphasis on the work ethic that other aspects of life seldom appear. For example, Asian models are overrepresented in business settings and relationships and underrepresented in home settings and family or social relationships. The findings suggest opportunities for advertisers who depict Asian-Americans in nonstereotypical ways.

TI Advertising and product liability litigation
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Since the late 1970s, advertising has become increasingly important in product liability litigation when consumers have been harmed by faulty products. Courts seem willing to consider the impact of advertising on consumer behavior leading to injury-causing situations. If consumer reliance on the content of advertising can be established, the marketer may be subject to liability under a variety of theories of recovery, including warranty, misrepresentation, negligence, and strict liability. The authors examine the role of advertising in product liability litigation. They also develop managerial and public policy recommendations based on their analysis.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The qualitative study reported is based on a new conceptualization that characterizes complex advertising images as figures of rhetoric from which consumers infer advertising messages. Informants interpreted the meanings of sit ads containing pictorial metaphors. The interpretations indicated that shared strong implicatures as well as multiple weak implicatures were drawn from images in the ads. In general, consumers' interpretations matched the intentions of the ads' producers. Informant responses also suggested that consumers use cultural, product, and advertising knowledge to infer meaning from advertising images.

TI Fine print in television advertising: Views from the top
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In recent years, the use and relative effectiveness of fine print messages have been the focus of research attention in the marketing/advertising literature. However, no study has examined those issues specifically from the practitioner's perspective. The authors report the findings of a national survey undertaken. to ascertain the opinions of executives (representing the leading advertisers, ad agencies, media firms, and regulatory/self-regulatory bodies) on a variety of issues pertaining to fine print in television advertising. The results indicate that most respondents considered the use of fine print in television advertising an ineffective means of communicating with consumers and that, given the prevalence of the practice, some adjustment to industry and regulatory standards may be in order. The study findings shed light on relevant managerial and regulatory issues facing advertisers and ad agencies, and explain some of the dynamics at work in the market place that contribute to the use (or potential misuse) of fine print in television advertising.

TI Assessing the use and impact of humor on advertising effectiveness: A
   contingency approach
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Every year billions of dollars are spent on advertising that uses humor to sell products. Hour is that spending decision made? Despite much research examining humor effects in advertising, many advertisers make the decision on faith. Many past studies lack a clear conceptual focus to guide the investigation of humor effects in advertising. The authors examine humor effectiveness by using a conceptual framework adapted from Speck along with a product-contingent focus. The resulting approach affords a clearer understanding of the appropriate use of humor through the examination of (1) the humor mechanisms employed, (2) the intentional relatedness of humor to the ad or product, and (3) the type of product advertised. The descriptive results of the study Indicate that current practice for many advertisers is to employ incongruity-based humor in a humor-dominant context. That practice is contrasted with others to examine the influence of humor on the effectiveness of print advertisements for different product groups. Study results indicate that current advertising practices may not be the most effective in terms of advertisement performance.

TI Effects of print ad pictures and copy containing instructions to imagine
   on mental imagery that mediates attitudes
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Results of an experimental study in a print advertising context suggest that two imagery-eliciting strategies, use of pictures and use of copy containing instructions to imagine, stimulate mental imagery processing, which in turn influences attitudinal judgments. Specifically, an ad containing a concrete picture of a product in use was more effective in stimulating vivid visual imagery processing and favorably influencing attitude toward the advertisement and brand than either an ad containing a considerably less concrete picture or one without a picture. Copy containing instructions to imagine also stimulated vivid and elaborate visual imagery processing and enhanced attitudes. Tests for mediation indicate that mental imagery processing explains all or some of the direct effects of the two imagery-eliciting strategies' influence on attitudes.

AB Most research in the area generally known as "fear appeals" has examined the persuasive effects and effectiveness of different types of threat-based communications on various groups of consumer subjects, often failing to distinguish between the threats, the literal communication stimuli, and the actual fear arousal response that different types of threats might engender. Building on a noteworthy exception to that pattern of past work, which provided a basis for a model of fear arousal, the authors further clarify the distinction between threats and psychological responses to the threats. They test an expanded model based on that distinction that provides further understanding of consumer fear arousal responses to advertising stimuli.

TI Predictors of advertising avoidance in print and broadcast media
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The authors examine the predictors of ad avoidance in four media: magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. A national survey of 946 adults found that ad avoidance is most prevalent for television and magazines. The predictor variables were demographic characteristics; media-related variables, attitudes toward advertising in each medium, and communication problems related to advertising. Ad perceptions were the strongest predictors of ad avoidance and were best in differentiating print from broadcast media. The results indicate that age and income were the best demographic predictors across media. Breadth of media use was an important broadcast media predictor. Among the communication problems considered, search hinderance had the greatest effect on ad avoidance.

TI Advertising repetition as a signal of quality: If it's advertised so
   much, something must be wrong
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The author proposes that consumers infer brand quality from the level of advertising repetition for unfamiliar brands. Consumers are posited to associate high product quality with high levels of repetition because they see repetition as costly and think higher costs reflect the manufacturer's commitment to the product. However, at very high levels of repetition, consumers may perceive the expenditures as excessive and begin to doubt the manufacturer's confidence in product quality, which would lead to art inverted-U relationship between advertising repetition and product quality perceptions. The author demonstrates that the relationship between repetition and perceived brand quality is mediated by perceptions of the manufacturer's effort and confidence in quality rather than by irritation or boredom. The hypotheses were tested in an experiment in which the bevel of repetition and the color of the ad were varied.

TI Advertising intimacy: Relationship marketing and the services consumer
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The article proposes intimacy theory as the basis of services relationships communicated by advertising. It advocates intimacy theory as more generalizable across services marketing situations than either exchange or seduction theory. Drawing from psychology and social psychology, it presents intimacy attributes relevant to services marketing-the "five C's" of communication, caring, commitment, comfort, and conflict resolution. It then streamlines Levinger's five-stage model of intimate relationships into one with four stages-acquaintance, buildup, continuation, and dissolution. Dissolution collapses Levinger's stages of "deterioration" and "endings" into a multidimensional phase that includes four consumer responses adapted from Rusbult's work. These responses are "exit," "voice," "negative WOM," and "loyalty." The article concludes with suggestions for future research on intimacy skills and individual differences in;intimacy needs.

The authors use the content analysis method to investigate differences in several message elements in the context of the two types of services advertisements. In their sample of 186 advertisements, 91 ads were for business-to-business services and 95 were for consumer services. The specific message elements evaluated were message appeal, headline usage, price information, quality claims, and the inclusion of an Internet address. The findings indicate significant differences between business-to-business and consumer services advertisements in the types of message appeals used.

TI Communicating experiences: A narrative approach to creating service
   brand image
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The authors discuss the potential merits of taking a narrative approach to communicating service brand image through advertising. On the assumption that a primary goal of advertising should be to create a vivid image of the brand in consumers' minds, they assess past definitions of brand image and adapt them to the marketing of services. They review metaphors used previously to understand services, and emphasize that the experiential aspect of services should play an important role in how service brand image is conceptualized. Specifically, they suggest that experience is a useful conceptualization for understanding service brand image because it represents the customer's perspective of a service and the symbolic meanings created during service consumption. Using their conceptualization of service as experience, the authors discuss how to view consumers' comprehension of services, and thus how to communicate about services through advertising. They draw on narrative theory to suggest that narrative thought is a. predominant cognitive mode of comprehension used by consumers to interpret experience (and hence services) and that narrative advertising should be effective in communicating service experience. Finally, they present a series of propositions linking the formal structure of advertising to responses related to the creation of service brand image.

Study 1, a within-subjects design, examined attitudes of a single subject pool immediately after exposure, after a one-week delay, and after a three-week, delay. In study 2, the same methods and procedures were used to condition favorable responses to the test brand, but a between-subjects design was used to control for possible measurement effects. Measurements were taken immediately after exposure to conditioning trials for one group of subjects and three weeks after exposure to the trials for a second group. Results from both studies support the hypothesis that attitudes formulated through classical conditioning are enduring.

TI A prophet of modern advertising: Germany's Karl Knies
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The analysis of advertising propounded by the German economist Karl Knies in 1857 was a milestone in the development of advertising thought. Knies was the only economic thinker to treat advertising seriously and positively at a time when it first began to take on its modern intensity and pervasiveness; his contemporaries either ignored it or judged it by its excesses, (e.g, tawdry patent medicine ads). Knies perceived the increasingly important information role that advertising was to play in economic life, as expanding markets made person-to-person interaction impractical. Explaining how it played that role, he identified the basic themes of subsequent advertising research: the communication process, analysis of advertising effects and buyer psychology, target audience selection, and media analysis. After being neglected initially, Knies' work eventually had great impact on German advertising thought, but has remained unknown in the United States. The saga of Knies' analysis is a rich illustration of advertising's intellectual history.

TI Endorsers in advertising: The case of negative celebrity information
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The use of celebrity endorsers is a popular executional device, but it is not without risk. The authors report three studies examining how negative information about a celebrity can affect the brand the celebrity endorses. Using an associative network model of memory as a theoretical framework, they considered four moderating variables: the size of the association set for the brand, the size of the association set for the celebrity, the timing of the negative celebrity information, and the strength of the associative link between the brand and the celebrity. In the first two studies, they used a fictitious but realistic celebrity endorser and in the third they used an actual celebrity. Negative information about a celebrity resulted in a decline in attitude toward the endorsed brand only for the fictitious celebrity. That general relationship was moderated in varying degrees by association set size, timing of the negative information, and the strength of the link between brand and celebrity.

The goals of the study were to: (1) provide current data on level and content of gender stereotyping, (2) compare levels of stereotyping in two countries, and (3) assess stereotyping of self-presentational behaviors. Results are consistent with those of previous research in that boys were depicted as being more knowledgeable, active, aggressive, and instrumental than girls. Nonverbal behaviors involving dominance and control were associated more with boys than girls. Country-related differences in ratios of boys to girls in the commercials and demonstrations of licensed withdrawal, function ranking, and utilitarian contact were observed.

Interpretive analysis of in-depth interviews reveals that informants' life themes are evident in their experiences of alcohol advertisements, suggesting that ad interpretations are a function of highly individual cognitions developed by young people about themselves, alcohol, and advertising during their lives. The findings support the notion that advertising should be analyzed holistically and in context to understand the powerful meanings consumers experience in advertising messages in general and in alcohol advertising in particular.

They found that, although some indigenous gender stereotyping was evident, several traits previously associated with Japanese women (devoted, obliging, rattle-brained, superstitious, thorough) were associated with men. Also, men were not linked with certain stereotypical male traits (autocratic, blustery, forgiving, generous, severe). Other findings included women being shown in a positive way as often as men. In terms of common international stereotypes, women were not associated with lour priced products or portrayed as being more deferential than men. However, women still were portrayed as more concerned with appearance and as younger than men, were not depicted as product authorities, and were shown more often in sexist than in nonsexist depictions.

TI Does television viewership play a role in the perception of quality of
   life?
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The authors hypothesized that television viewership influences materialism and dissatisfaction with standard of living, which in turn contributes to feelings of dissatisfaction with life. They collected data from five countries to examine the issue in a variety of cultural and media environments. The countries and types of samples were: United States (consumer panel and college students), Canada (urban households), Australia (urban households), Turkey (urban households), and China (urban households). The results were generally consistent with the hypotheses. However, nest of the support came from the U.S. samples. Too possible explanations may account for the findings. One is that the effect of television viewership on life satisfaction is a unique phenomenon that is applicable only to the United States. Given the disparity of viewership levels between the U.S. and other countries, that explanation has some face validity. The other is that the effects were less evident in non-U.S. samples because of methodological limitations of the cross-cultural research. Overall, the results show that television viewership, at least in the U.S., nay play a significant role in making people unhappy with their lives. Much of television advertising reinforces material consumption and possession with images of the "good life." Thus, television advertising contributes to terminal materialism-materialism for the sake of materialism. Socially responsible advertising professionals should make a concerted effort to create messages that reflect instrumental materialism-materialism for the sake of meeting essential and basic needs.

TI Social criticism of advertising: On the role of literary theory and the
   use of data
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper discusses the use of literary theory for the social criticism of advertising. In particular, it examines what types of claims can be made simply by analyzing an ad itself and what types of social criticism require extrinsic data about hour other readers understand the ad or the historical context of its creation. The author advocates a "doubly integrated" approach to social criticism that combines literary analysis with use of extrinsic empirical data and also integrates the system by which ads are produced with the way they are comprehended. This approach provides a holistic view of the advertising process and a strong basis for critique. Discussion of a demonstration study shows how qualitative data collected from readers can be used to complement traditional literary interpretations of advertisements.

TI Top-level agency creatives look at advertising creativity then and now
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Influential writings suggest that today's advertising is not as creative as it used to be. To explore this suggestion, the authors asked top-level agency creatives whether they believe creativity has improved, declined, or remained unchanged since they entered the advertising business. Respondents' opinions then were grouped and compared by agreement/disagreement ratings on a series of statements associated with factors previously identified as responsible for advertising's presumed creative decline. From the perspective of the top-level agency creatives, creativity in today's advertising has not declined-in fact, the overwhelming majority view is that advertising is now more creative than it was when they entered the business, or at least as good. In their eyes, certain aspects of advertising creativity have changed, though not always in the direction. predicted in previous writings. With one exception, agency creatives' opinions about advertising creativity then and now were unvarying, regardless of respondent age, years of advertising experience, or agency position/title.

TI Context is key: The effect of program-induced mood on thoughts about the
   ad
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Prior research has shown that the context in which a commercial message is presented can have important effects on how the message is processed and its success in the marketplace. The authors examine the impact of context-induced moods on the processing of embedded television advertisements. Mood was manipulated naturally by varying the program context in which the stimulus ads were embedded, anal its effects on ad processing were observed. The results indicate that ads placed in programs that induce negative moods are processed less systematically than ones placed in, programs that put viewers in positive moods. Moreover, mood was found to influence attitudes toward the advertisements both by affecting the number of cognitions the audience generates about the ads and by modifying the effect of those cognitions on A(ad).

TI Beefcake and cheesecake: Insights for advertisers
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Theory suggests that for an ad with a sexy illustration, the interaction, of the sex of the viewer with the sex of the povocatively clothed model will influence that viewer's responses to the ad. Previous research with sexy ads has supported such reasoning, but principally has used women as the sexy models. The authors examined the responses of melt and women to cheesecake and beefcake (a sexy male model) and found some expected and some surprising effects. Women reported disproportionately negative attitudes toward cheesecake ads, as hypothesized, but men. did not show a parallel response to beefcake. They did have higher recall scores for ads with a nonsexy female model than for cheesecake ads, as expected. Significant results in a direction opposite from that hypothesized showed that women had higher recognition, scores for cheesecake than for beefcake ads.

AB Periodic scanning of research productivity within a discipline is necessary to effectively measure the relative contribution of individual authors and institutions. This review extends Barry's 1990 work and ex amines refereed articles in the three primary U.S. advertising specialty journals-Journal of Advertising, Journal of Advertising Research, and Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising-for the period 1989 through 1996. The findings indicate a significant shift in individual and institutional rangings. Given recent pressures on academic institutions to show concrete evidence of performance, the findings provide a useful benchmark of individual anal institutional research productivity within, the three outlets.

TI Advertising sex-typed services: The effects of sex, service type, and
   employee type on consumer attitudes
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The use of employee spokespersons in. the advertising of services has received growing attention in, the academic literature because the presence of an employee in the advertisement may help visualize the service offering for the customer by providing a physical representation of the service provider. Moreover, a decrease in occupational segregation indicates a potential need for repositioning traditionally sex-typed services. The author examines the use of male versus female employees and the use of service managers versus workers for sex-typed services. Two separate samples were used: students and working adults. For the student sample, results suggest that for female-dominant services, congruency between the source and the service results in higher cognitive attitudes toward the ad. However, for a male-dominant service, a congruent approach and a progressive role portrayal produce equivalent attitudes. For the sample of working adults, results indicate that a congruent and a progressive approach produce equivalent attitudes. Overall, they suggest that (I) among working adults, whether or not a service is male or female dominant has little influence on whether a men or a woman should be pictured in, an ad for that service and (2) student samples are not the best surrogates to use in experimental research if students are not typical consumers of the product(s) being tested.

TI Effects of metaphors on children's comprehension and perception of print
   advertisements
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In an experiment, children in three grade levels (second, fourth, and sixth) viewed four advertisements. The children were shown advertisements with either metaphors in both pictorial anal verbal form or a literal equivalent. The sixth graders interpreted more metaphors correctly than, the fourth and second graders. In terms of recall of advertised content, the sixth and fourth graders recalled brand names, products, and additional copy better than the second graders. Within each grade level, metaphors dial not enhance children's recall of advertised conte,tt or perceptions of the understandability of the advertisements and liking of the advertised products. The authors speculate that metaphors are most likely to enhance recall under conditions in, which the metaphor serves as a direct representation linking the metaphor to the advertised product. Their findings suggest that advertisers should be aware that young readers may have difficulty interpreting metaphors and that metaphors may not be more effective in terms of children's recall and perception, of understandability than literal versions of advertisements.

As American companies are increasingly advertising their products in other countries, the issue of cross-country differences in comparative advertising effectiveness is very important. The study found that although recall of comparative ads was high, consumer attitudes toward comparative ads was not very positive, especially in countries where comparative ads are not widely used or are used rarely. Therefore, comparative ads should he targeted at other countries with caution.

TI "We'll be back in a moment": A content analysis of advertisements in
   children's television in the 1950s
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The children's television advertising environment generally is studied from the 1970s onward. Indeed, so little academic research was reported in the 1950s that the decade has been referred to as the prehistory of research on children's television advertising. The authors rectify that oversight by examining commercials of the 1950s in programs aimed at the child market. Content analysis shows marked distinctions from commercials of subsequent decades in total commercial time, product type, promotional appeals, age and gender of participants, production variables, and controversial techniques. Some of the differences are due to the television technology and technical standards of the 1950s, but others illustrate growth in advertisers' and television executives' understanding of the medium as a way to reach specialized child audiences.

TI Socialization and adolescents' skepticism toward advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The authors adopt a socialization explanation for adolescents' skepticism toward advertising. They conceptualize skepticism as an outcome of the socialization process, a negatively valenced attitude leaned through interaction with the three socialization agents: parents, peers, and the mass media. In particular, the authors posit that the type of family communication (socio-oriented vs. concept-oriented communication), adolescents' susceptibility to peer influence (susceptibility to informational vs. normative peer influence), and the extent of television viewing are related to skepticism. They also posit that teens' marketplace knowledge mediates the effects of specific types of socialization agent-based interaction (concept-orientated communication, susceptibility to informational peer influence, anal the extent of television viewing) on skepticism. For all but of socio-oriented communication, data from a sample of high school students generally support the proposed socialization model of adolescents' skepticism toward advertising.

TI Mothers' preferences for regulating children's television
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The potential ill effects of television advertising and programming directed at children and who should assume responsibility for them are issues being debated by parents, broadcasters, government officials, and child advocates. Some contend that protecting children is government's responsibility; others argue that parents are ultimately responsible. Though many opinions have been offered, few have represented parental views. The authors fill that gap by examining mothers' preferences for the regulation of children's en's television. They also segment mothers by their parental styles and examine their group views of various options. Finally, they offer some insights for persons who affect policies.

The prevalence of fine-print disclosures in the two venues is compared, as well as the placement, duration, and informational characteristics of the disclosures. Statistical differences between Saturday morning and prime-time ad disclosures suggest that advertisers differentiate between audience types in the use and execution of fine-print disclosures. However, the differences do not necessarily suggest that the messages are reaching either audience group effectively. The findings have implications for how advertisers, regulators, and media firms might change fine-print disclosure practices in children's TV advertisements.

The two cigarette ads had similar mandated warnings but produced very different results, thus demonstrating;ting the importance of conducting warnings research in the context in which the warnings will be used. Finally, preliminary results based on eye tracking indicate that in the beer ad, the voluntary message encouraging responsible drinking had limited warning value.

TI The effect of consumer prejudices on ad processing: Heterosexual
   consumers' responses to homosexual imagery in ads
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising researchers often assume that the audience reacts to ads homogeneously, but evidence suggests that individuals process ads subjectively on the basis of their membership in groups defined by ethnicity or gender, or their life themes or experiences. The authors examine how one group, heterosexuals, reacts to the portrayals of an out-group, homosexuals, in ads. They find that heterosexuals' emotional and attitudinal responses to a homosexual ad depend on their general attitude toward homosexuality. The effect on attitude toward the brand sponsor is more muted. Practical implications are noted for advertisers facing consumer groups that have diverse opinions on social issues such as homosexuality.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Despite the limited empirical evidence about the effectiveness of olfactory cues in advertising, firms are increasingly using such cues in their advertisements. The authors examine the effects of olfactory cues that are used as a novelty, as opposed to a product sample, on consumer attitudes. The results show that the addition of a more congruent scratch-and-sniff panel to an advertisement improves neither attitude toward the ad nor attitude toward the brand. Further, the addition of a poorer-fitting scent actually lowers attitudes among individuals who are more motivated to process. Those results appear to be a function of the mood evoked by the scented advertisement and of the scent's perceived pleasantness in the advertising context.

He finds that both thoughts about the program and overall program evaluations (i.e., program liking) mediate the effect of program-induced affect on Aad, and that emotional responses to the ad moderate the relationship between program liking and Aad. More specifically, the program liking-Aad linkage is strengthened if the ad and program are similar in emotional content. That effect is enhanced for ads appearing early within a pod. The author proposes and tests a model specifying the nature of the relationships among those variables, and discusses the practical implications for advertising practitioners.

Such connections among scholars can be used to identify, streams of research in advertising; some of these streams show temporal progressions. The 10,526 citations indicate that a handful of works from the 1960s and 1970s continue to have an impact on the advertising literature, whereas a large and interconnected body of work from the 1980s has had more recent impact. These findings may indicate greater paradigmatic rigor in recent years.

TI The influence of family communication patterns on parental reactions
   toward advertising: A cross-national examination
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The global children's market holds tremendous potential, yet little research has been conducted on international attitudes toward advertising and family communication patterns. Using consumer socialization as a theoretical foundation, the authors examine family communication patterns and general attitudes toward television advertising among mothers of children three to eight years of age in the United States and Japan. A four-category typology based on concept- and socio-orientation was used to classify mothers of both nationalities. Laissez-faire (low socio-, low concept-orientation) mothers had the most positive attitudes toward and the lowest mediation of their children's exposure to television advertising. pluralistic (low socio-, high concept-orientation) and consensual (high on both dimensions) mothers had the highest mediation of and most negative attitudes toward advertising. The responses of protective mothers (high socio-, low concept-orientation) were between those extremes. Overall, American. mothers were distributed relatively equally across categories, whereas Japanese mothers were classified primarily as either laissez-faire or protective. The results confirm and extend the findings of consumer socialization research and yield practical implications for global segmentation.

TI Gender and multicultural issues in advertising: stages on the research
   highway
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Stern contextualizes the six articles in the special issue of Journal of Advertising dedicated to the impact of gender and multicultural issues as on advertising. She presents an overview of the theoretical relationship between evolutionary stages of gender research, formerly called "feminist" or "women's studies," and multicultural research, an outgrowth of cultural studies. To situate the current trends in advertising research, she begins by addressing the nexus between feminist criticism, defined as the cross-disciplinary study of women, and multicultural criticism, defined as the cross-disciplinary study of marginalized populations including (but not limited to) women. Next, she turns to the historical development of gender studies in the modern and post-modern era-the generation from 1960 to the present - to address the interwoven themes of gender and multicultural research as they affect advertising research. Last, she draws implications from the intersection of gender and race to suggest directions for future multicultural research.

TI I can't believe it's not Bakhtin!: Literary theory, postmodern
   advertising, and the gender agenda
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Taking the literary theories of Mikhail Bakhtin as a starting point, the authors offer three gendered readings of a postmodern advertisement for Moet & Chandon champagne. They commence with a discussion of the influence of gender on textual interpretation; continue with an outline of Bakhtin's Key concepts, with particular reference to gender; present three contrasting readings of Moet's postmodern advertisement; and conclude with a discussion of their interpretations together with some reflexive reflections on the gender agenda. Though not claiming to offer a comprehensive introduction to Bakhtin, they do try to exemplify in a quasi-carnivalesque mode of exposition, something of the character of that supremely gifted thinker and to demonstrate the insights his concepts provide in relation to gendered readings of advertising texts.

TI Making the ad perfectly queer: Marketing "normality" to the gay men's
   community
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The author introduces queer theory and queer deconstruction to the advertising literature. First, he briefly outlines the theoretical and political concerns of queer theory-an emerging branch of radical thought from the humanities. Then he interprets an ad exemplar from an Australian gay newspaper by both a traditional structuralist approach and a queer deconstruction approach. He argues that queer theory and queer deconstruction are potentially powerful sources of ad critiques and productive perspectives for more perceptive marketing practices, for they generate meanings associated with the "panoply of otherness" and expose the ways in which heteronormative discourse informs various representations of gay men in advertising.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The authors address cross-cultural variability in the manner in which advertising portrays teenage girls. Specifically, the level to which "girlish" images are portrayed in Japan and the United States by employing a content analysis of 263 advertisements appearing in eight issues of Seventeen, four Japanese and four American. Culture-based differences in advertising are discussed with a specific focus on how advertising constructs the image of teenage girls, and how, in turn, teenage girls are encouraged to identify, with their mediated images of self. Chi-square analysis shows a significantly higher frequency of verbal and visual girlish images in the Japanese Seventeen issues.

TI Ethnic evaluations of advertising: Interaction effects of strength of

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The study reported examined effects of strength of ethnic identification, media placement, and ad racial composition on attitudes and purchase intentions among African-Americans. The effects of the independent variables were assessed via a two (strong ethnic identifier vs. weak ethnic identifier) by two (racially targeted vs. nontargeted media) by four (black model, white model, black-dominant integration, white-dominant integration) experimental design in the context of two personal care products: foundation, a race-based product, and perfume, a racially neutral product. Results indicate that strong ethnic identifiers generally have more positive evaluations of ads that feature African-Americans in positions of dominance and are placed in racially targeted media, whereas weak ethnic identifiers have more positive evaluations of ads that feature whites in positions of dominance and are placed in nontargeted media. In addition, the type of product advertised, whether it be specifically related to physical racial features or racially neutral, effects audience members' evaluations.

TI Ethnic consumer reaction to targeted marketing: A theory of
   intercultural accommodation
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Marketers are increasingly recognizing the growing power of ethnic groups, and are responding with targeted marketing efforts. Targeted communications often draw on various references to the ethnic culture in an attempt to enhance communication with and gain the approval of the intended audience. However, research on how such accommodation efforts may be received is lacking. Drawing on a variety of disciplines, the authors develop a theory of intercultural accommodation to fill that gap. The proposed model views the consumer as having both affective and attributional responses to a targeted communication. The consequences of the response are proposed to influence the consumer's evaluation, comprehension, and recall of the message, and to influence behavioral intentions toward the communicator.

TI Noticing cultural differences: Ad meanings created by target and
   non-target markets
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Target marketing is an increasingly crucial component of marketing strategy, particularly given the expanding cultural diversity of the nation's population. Prior research suggests marketers need to consider the nontarget market (consumers who perceive themselves not to be the target of an advertisement) as well as the target market. Further, researchers have called for a more meaning-based approach to understanding advertising and consumer behavior. The authors therefore explore the meanings created by target and nontarget viewers of advertising targeting black, white, and gay/lesbian cultures. Their results show that asymmetries in cultural expertise, power, distinctiveness, and stigmatization among those cultural groups influence the meanings created by target and nontarget viewers of ads targeting those groups.

   versus negatively framed advertising messages
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A 2 x 2 x 2 experimental study was conducted to investigate the moderating effect of consumer individual differences in need for cognition (NFC) and source credibility on the processing of framed advertising messages. The authors used a student sample (n = 160) and three dependent variables: product attractiveness, willingness to purchase, and perceived performance. Results indicate NFC influenced the strength of framed messages and source credibility effects in consumer responses to ad messages. Specifically, the message framing effect was more salient for low- NFC subjects than high- NFC subjects. Further, low- NFC subjects were influenced more by the negatively framed messages than by the positively framed messages. Although the hypothesized source credibility main effect did not materialize, low- NFC subjects responded the Least favorably to messages presented by non-expert sources. Other findings and implications are discussed.

AB Binge drinking behavior has been described as the most significant health hazard on college campuses today. Using definitions of ritual behavior drawn from the literature, the authors conducted focus groups, depth interviews, and participant observations to explore the ritualized nature of alcohol beverage consumption among college students at two large universities. The themes that emerged provide an understanding of the rituals associated with college student drinking. With the drinking-as-ritual interpretation as a theoretical framework, the authors discuss how developers of public service announcements (PSAs) could capture and contextualize drinking rituals and thus make PSAs more relevant to the target audience. They provide examples of PSAs that could be tested.

AB Recent attention has been paid to the use of citation analysis as an approach to examining relative journal quality and prestige, as well as the relative scholarly status of academic communities and disciplines. The fundamental notion is that citations are objective indicators of knowledge use by scholars and knowledge flows among academic communities. In that context, the authors examine the journal quality ranking of the Journal of Advertising in relation to 33 marketing, advertising, and business journals over the 1986-1997 time period. They find evidence that JA ranks respectably among specialty marketing, advertising, and business journals, but, as expected, generally below the general marketing,and business journals.

TI Moviegoers' experiences and interpretations of brands in films revisited
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The article provides further phenomenological understanding of how brand props are interpreted within the everyday lived experience of the movie audience. Building on previous focus group research and on the grounded theory perspective of social science, the authors gathered first-person audiotaped accounts of experiences with brand props as interpreted in relation to movies, movieviewing, and social experience. Eight focus groups and 30 depth interviews of nonstudent movieviewers who differed in age bracket and moviegoing frequency were conducted. Constant comparative analysis uncovered three themes related to movie centrality and four themes related to consumption-specific aspects of everyday life. The findings reveal that regardless of age or moviegoing frequency, the informants were active participants in the viewing experience and actively interpreted brands encountered in movies. However, to the older moviegoers brands in movies symbolized social change whereas to the younger informants, they symbolized belonging and security. The authors conclude with implications for advertising practitioners and recommendations for future research.

A factorial experimental design, with cue level as either present or absent, yields eight cells with a total of 185 respondents. Results suggest significant main effects for both endorsement and sponsorship cues, with endorsement affecting perceived quality, uniqueness, and esteem, and sponsorship affecting only citizenship, The popularity cue lacks a significant main effect. The three cues do not significantly interact with each other.

AB Using the theory of consumer socialization, the authors explore factors that might shape attitudes toward advertising for African-American and Caucasian young adults. Though the African-American market is growing in importance to advertisers, little if any research has explored African-American perceptions of advertising. The theory of consumer socialization provides a conceptual framework for investigating variables that might influence attitudes toward advertising. African-American and Caucasian young adults were surveyed on various consumer socialization variables. Parental communication, peer communication, mass media, gender, and race were found to be related significantly to attitudes toward advertising. African-Americans watched more TV and had more positive attitudes toward advertising than their Caucasian counterparts.

AB Attitudes and opinions about online advertising practices and consumer privacy concerns have been studied in both the academic and popular press. However, online consumers' response to privacy concerns have not been studied. This study examines this relationship using a national sample of individuals with personal email accounts. Respondents' concerns with a series of situations which effect privacy online were assessed. This overall level of concern was subsequently correlated with the frequency that respondents adopted seven different online behaviors. Analysis demonstrates that the frequency of adopting five of the seven behaviors increased as respondents' privacy concern increased. Specifically, as privacy concern increased, respondents reported that they were more likely to provide incomplete information to web sites, to notify Internet Service Providers (ISPs) about unsolicited e-mail, to request removal from mailing lists, and to send a "flame" to online entities sending unsolicited e-mail. Additionally, as privacy concern increased, respondents reported that they were less likely to register for web sites requesting information. Implications for online advertisers are provided as a part of this study.

TI Effect of archetypal embeds on feelings: An indirect route to affecting
   attitudes?
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertising practitioners have long been the target of charges of unethical conduct stemming from their supposed use of subliminal techniques, though very few studies have shown any value of subliminal embeds in an advertising setting. One way advertising professionals can contend with such charges is to understand as much as possible about subliminal persuasion, including the situations, if any, in which it occurs. Many studies of subliminal persuasion, have investigated the effect of subliminal stimuli on cognitive constructs. The authors add to that work by focusing on affect, specifically three types of feelings identified as important to advertising effectiveness: warm, upbeat, and negative feelings. They found empirical support for the hypothesis that unconscious processing of subliminal embeds has significant effects on the upbeat and negative feelings that subjects report in response to ads. Those feelings in turn had a significant influence on ad and brand attitudes, which suggests that subliminal embeds may have a small, but indirect effect on attitudes.

AB Although metaphors are used by advertising creators to convey brand meaning and enhance brand information processing, little is understood with regard to consumers' comprehension of intended meaning. This research contributes to this body of knowledge by examining the effect of metaphor type (abstract/concrete) and hemispheric processing on respondents' comprehension of metaphors in ads. Overall, the findings suggest that concrete metaphors are more easily understood than abstract metaphors. This effect is moderated by hemispheric processing such that individuals high in right or integrative processing are more likely to provide valid interpretations of both types of metaphors. These findings are discussed and implications for advertising practitioners are offered.

TI The sleeper effect and negative political advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The sleeper effect phenomenon is examined to explain how the impact of negative political advertising persists -and even increases -over time. Using a true experimental design with attack and defensive message treatments, adult subjects were asked to report their vote and its certainty immediately after message exposure and in a delayed telephone callback. Results indicate that a defensive advertisement following the attack is initially effective; however, over the next few weeks, the impact of the attack ad increases substantially. Similarly, an initial perception that the assailant has low credibility has only a temporary suppressive impact on the effectiveness of the attack ad. Our documentation of both an order-driven and a credibility-driven sleeper effect poses strategic challenges for those candidates who are attacked. Further, these results offer theoretical insights into the determinants and the pervasiveness of the sleeper effect in political campaigns.

TI When can affective conditioning and mere exposure directly influence

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The purpose of this research is to identify the circumstances, if any, in which affective conditioning (AC) and mere exposure (ME) based advertising strategies can directly influence brand choice. In an experimental setting, affective conditioning and mere exposure procedures were applied to unknown brands in two product categories. Advertising employing AC and ME was not successful against known, well-established competitors. It was, however, successful against other unknown competitors if (1) these competitors did not have superior performance characteristics or (2) the motivation to deliberate at the time of brand choice was low. The research also suggests that an ME advertising strategy can be as successful as an AC strategy. This is important because an ME strategy is easier to execute. It also suggests that advertisers should place a higher priority on maximizing the prominence of the brand name and package in advertisements.

As a result, little guidance is available for firms that seek to use sponsorship opportunities to aid in brand positioning. This study reports the results of an experiment using undergraduate student subjects, who assessed the degree to which a sporting event's image was transferred to a brand through event sponsorship activity. Subjects in the sponsorship pairing treatment were more likely to report similarities on brand-event personality components than subjects who were not exposed to the event-brand sponsorship link, thus supporting the notion that sponsorship results in image transfer. Further, we found that when event and brand are matched on either an image or functional basis the transfer process is enhanced. Management implications for sporting event sponsorship and future research directions are discussed.

TI Cultural values reflected in theme and execution: A comparative study of
   US and Korean television commercials
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study develops a cross-cultural content analysis framework to examine underlying cultural dimensions: individualism/collectivism, time orientation, relationship with nature, and contextuality. Most cross-cultural content analyses have inferred that differences in execution have been due to assumed cultural differences in the societies examined (often based on the work of Hofstede [1980]); the development of the structure proposed here will allow the direct investigation of those cultural issues. Television commercials from the U.S. and Korea were selected as being representative of North American, and East Asian commercials. Both countries are present-time oriented, and while individualism and collectivism are prevalent in both cultures, individualism is more dominant in the U.S. Korean commercials stress oneness-with-nature slightly more than U.S. commercials, and U.S. commercials use more direct approaches. Directions for refinement and future research are identified.

A model is proposed for examining account lifetimes, which can offer guidance on the likely retention of future accounts. The impact of agency structural characteristics on longevity is also examined and compared for both U.S. and U.K. markets. Results for both markets indicate that cumulative account dissolution increases at a decreasing rate over time. Greater account longevity is associated with larger agency size (both in terms of agency billings and employees), and agency age but not with stability of billings growth. Evidence suggests that several structural characteristics of agencies reflect the motivation and / or ability to maintain accounts.

TI An empirical test of an updated relevance-accessibility model of
   advertising effectiveness
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The Relevance-Accessibility Model provides a framework for studying advertising effects on brand choice. To do this, it shifts the focus of study from the time of advertising exposure to the time of brand choice. The model is motivationally based. Consumers' motivation to deliberate at the time of brand choice influences consumers' preferred choice process. Three choice processes; optimizing, satisficing and indifference, are associated with the preferred use of three different types of information: evidence of performance superiority, evidence of credibility and evidence of liking, respectively. The model predicts that an advertising message appeal is most likely to influence brand choice when it is both relevant and accessible. The message appeal that can most easily achieve the choice objective is the most relevant appeal. A message appeal is most likely to be accessible when consumer involvement at the time of advertising exposure Leads to its efficient encoding in memory. The major contributions of this paper are the updating of the model's theoretical framework and the empirical test of the model's predictions about message appeal effectiveness in different motivational scenarios.

TI The impact of verbal anchoring on consumer response to image ads
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Verbal copy is thought to anchor, or help explain, the meanings of complex image ads to consumers. This study examines the effect of verbal anchoring on consumers' comprehension and liking of complex image ads. Explanatory headlines that differed in level of verbal anchoring were inserted into ads containing pictorial metaphors. Path analysis results indicate that headlines that provide a clue to the meaning of a pictorial metaphor increase ad lilting by increasing comprehension. Headlines that completely explain the metaphor in the ad also increase comprehension but decrease ad Lifting by reducing consumers' pleasure in interpreting the ad's message. Implications for future advertising research are provided.

TI Narrative music in congruent and incongruent TV advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Recent research suggests that music comprises a sign system that could add meanings to advertising. However, research in this area is scant and there is practically no research that has examined the process by which consumers use music to create meanings. This study extends previous research on print advertising to delineate effects of music in congruent / incongruent TV advertising. A mixed design integrating features of qualitative and quantitative methods was used. Results indicated that the viewers' knowledge of cultural texts form a reference point for reading the commercials. Specifically, music in congruent ads reduces "noise" by reinforcing the connecting cultural context to communicate meanings. However, music in incongruent ads helps enact an alternative context that is meaningful to the viewer to communicate the ad message.

TI Effects of absurdity in advertising: The moderating role of product
   category attitude and the mediating role of cognitive responses
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB For this paper, the presence or absence of an absurd image was manipulated in a simulated print advertisement for a fictitious brand of wine cooler. Consumers' prior attitude toward wine coolers was hypothesized to moderate the effectiveness of absurdity in advertising. Consumers' cognitive responses were hypothesized to mediate the impact of absurdity and prior product category attitude on consumers' persuasion as measured by consumers' attitude to the ad and brand. The results supported the moderating role of prior product category attitude and a distraction hypothesis explanation of this effect. For subjects with negative prior attitude toward wine coolers, those viewing the absurd ad had a more positive attitude to the ad and brand than those viewing the non-absurd ad. However, for subjects with positive prior attitude toward wine coolers, those viewing the absurd ad did not differ in their ad or brand attitude than those viewing the non-absurd ad. The results also supported the mediating role of cognitive responses of these effects. Finally, absurdity was found to impact brand name recall in a manner that paralleled the results for the persuasion measures.

TI Cultural influences on agency practitioners' ethical perceptions: A
   comparison of Korea and the US
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Patterns of cross-cultural differences in ethical perceptions can be explained by Hofstede's typology of cultural dimensions. To test hypothesized differences, we conducted a survey of practitioners at Korean advertising agencies and compared their responses with results from previous surveys in the U.S. Evaluations of ethical issues in hypothetical scenarios that are consistent with the two cultures' relative levels of masculinity / femininity and individualism / collectivism. Agency practitioners in the two countries also vary in the ethical problems they face in their daily work. Differing perceptions that the problems are a concern of top management, or are a hindrance to performance and relations with coworkers, are consistent with relative levels of power distance, long-term orientation and individualism / collectivism. The findings illustrate the influence of cultural dimensions on ethical perceptions and practices in the advertising industry.

Consistent with Hofstede's framework which suggests that countries may be characterized along a continuum from masculine to feminine, the authors found that television advertisements from feminine countries featured more depictions of relationships for male and female characters than did masculine countries. Expectations of fewer gender differences in feminine countries than in masculine countries and of greater depictions of productivity being found in television advertisements from masculine countries were not realized however. Implications of these findings for the international advertiser are considered, and future directions for research are suggested.

TI The effects of incongruity, surprise and positive moderators oil
   perceived humor in television advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Few studies have tested models incorporating cognitive as well as affective mechanisms that help explain different levels of perceived humorousness in advertising Icf: Alden and Hoyer 1993; Speck 1991). In the first of two studies, an extended incongruity resolution model of humor perception in television advertising is proposed and tested. In that test, schema familiarity is found to moderate surprise resulting from ad content incongruity. Furthermore, playfulness of the ad, ease of resolution of the incongruity in the ad and warmth created by the ad moderate the effects of surprise on humor. Thus, surprise appears to be a necessary but not sufficient, condition for humor in television advertising. In the second study, the role of surprise in generating humor is examined in more detail. Specifically, evidence supports the hypothesis that, following exposure to incongruity, surprise can be transformed into diverse affective outcomes such as fear and hunter depending on the presence of different contextual moderators. Implications of the overall model are discussed front both theoretic and applied perspectives and directions for future research are suggested.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The literature indicates that the idealized images of physical attractiveness found in advertising have a negative impact on girls' and women's self-perceptions. The current study extends this research to males and adds the dimension of financial success. The empirical findings presented here indicate that exposure to idealized images of both physical attractiveness and financial success have a negative effect on males' self-evaluations. This study also examines the role of attention to social comparison. information (ATSCI) in moderating the effects, and finds that high ATSCI sometimes exacerbates the unintended consequences of attractive advertising images on people's self-perceptions.

TI Manipulating ad message involvement through information expectancy:
   Effects on attitude evaluation and confidence
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research proposes an additional method (with potential advantages) of manipulating ad message involvement (AMI) through ad information expectancy. This manipulation of ad information characteristics showed that unexpected information creates a higher AMI than does expected information. lit addition, the immediate and delayed effects of ad information expectancy on attitude evaluation, confidence, and recall are examined. In particular, attitude evaluation and confidence responded differently under different times of response and levels of AMI. Under immediate responses, ads with unexpected information (high AMI) produced more favorable attitude evaluation than did ads with expected information (low AMI). However, no differences in attitude confidences were found between the two conditions. Under delayed responses, both attitude evaluation and confidence were significantly higher in the unexpected than in the expected conditions. In addition, although delayed ad and brand confidences under low AMI were low, ad and brand attitudes remained significantly correlated with each other. These findings suggest that 1) assessing both attitude evaluation and attitude confidence is important especially when studying delayed attitudinal effects of advertising, and 2) high AMI through the introduction of unexpected information in ads creates relatively persistent and favorable attitudes.

TI The effectiveness of tensile pricing tactics in the advertising of
   services
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Previous research on the use of tensile pricing in advertising has not yet determined if services respond differently to tensile tactics than do products. Moreover, in the product studies of tensile tactics, minimum tested discount levels were based on local market conditions which were assessed in the early 1990's. This study examines the effects of tensile pricing tactics on services, and uses minimum discounts based on, broader current market conditions. Results suggest that advertisements for professional and retail services do not differ front each other in terms of performance in response to a tensile pricing tactic. Results also indicate that tensile pricing tactics may have different dynamics in services versus product advertising. Finally, the findings tend to indicate that consumers' generic perceptions of savings in response to the use of tensile tactics might be distinct from the specific intent to purchase certain services, given. the possible link in the customer's mind between discounts and subsequent perceptions of services quality in certain categories.

TI The effectiveness of information and color in yellow pages advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A mall-intercept study recruited 601 subjects in three cities who viewed simulated Yellow Pages ads for florists or caterers. Ad information was either generally stated or specific to the product involved. Ads either did or did not contain color. Color was used to attract attention to the ad or else to enhance product appearance. Subjects selected an initial consideration set and a final set of ads to call. Ads with product-specific information were more likely to be considered and called. Findings showed that ads with color were more likely to be considered, but only using product-enhancing color increased chances that an ad would be called. Ads that used enhancing color in a manner that substantiated verbal claims were most likely to be called first.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Two studies are presented that examine the role of attractiveness and expertise in the "match-up hypothesis. Much "match-up hypothesis" research has focused on physical attractiveness. Study One examined physical attractiveness as a. match-up factor and its impact on brand attitude, purchase intent and key brand beliefs. In a 2 X 2 experiment, endorser attractiveness and product type are manipulated Results indicated a general "attractiveness effect" on brand attitude and purchase intent but not the match-up predicted in previous literature. Study Two considered expertise as the match-up dimension. The second experiment manipulated product and endorser type. A match-up effect was found as the athlete was most effective as an endorser for the energy bar in increasing brand attitude, but not purchase intent. The variable "fit," or "belongingness, was shown to play an important role in match-up effects.

   ad appeals: The mediating role of world-views
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research investigates gendered responses to self-oriented (help-self) and altruistic (help-others) charitable ad appeals. Results from two studies conducted with U.S. undergraduates show that sex is a determinant of message evaluations, and that variations in moral world-views explain these gendered differences. Study One establishes sex: differences in absolute (attitude toward the ad) and comparative (ad preference) judgments toward help-self and help-others ad appeals. Females respond more favorably to the help-others appeal and males to the help-self appeal. Study Two replicates these findings from Study One and demonstrates that sex differences can be explained through a full mediation, of world-view values.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB As the regulator of all national food advertising, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has expressed concern that consumers may be misled by certain comparative nutrient content claims in advertising. To help examine this issue, primary food shoppers were recruited and interviewed in three U.S. markets according to generally accepted procedures for advertising copy tests. The study employs a 2 (ad claim type) x 2 (nutrition knowledge) x 4 (disclosure type) between-subjects design using manipulated print advertisements. Misleading generalizations for absolute levels of sodium content beyond that of control ads are found for both specific and general nutrient content claims from experimentally manipulated soup advertisements Effects of certain ad disclosure types are found to be dependent on ad claim type and on nutrition knowledge levels. Conclusions from the study and implications for advertising practice and public policy are offered.

TI The impact of corporate credibility and celebrity credibility on
   consumer reaction to advertisements and brands
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertisers frequently use endorsers or spokespersons as credible sources to influence consumers' attitudes and purchase intentions. Corporate credibility-the reputation of a company for honesty and expertise-is another type of source credibility that can influence consumer reactions to ads and shape brand attitudes. The present study assessed the impact of endorser and corporate credibility on attitude-toward-the-ad, attitude-toward-the-brand, and purchase intentions. We surveyed 152 adult consumers who viewed a fictitious ad for Mobil Oil company. They rated the credibility of the ad's endorser, the credibility of the company, and attitude-toward-the-ad, attitude-toward-the-brand, and purchase intentions. Path analysis confirmed that endorser credibility had its strongest impact on Aad while corporate credibility had its strongest impact on AB. The findings suggest that corporate credibility plays an important role in consumers' reactions to advertisements and brands, independent of the equally important role of endorser credibility.

TI The relationship between values and appeals in Israeli advertising: A
   smallest space analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Eight hundred and sixty-one Israeli TV ads, dated from 1995 to 1997, were examined for their value system and their appeal type to determine the relationship of value systems, appeal types and the relative salience of specific value systems. The results verify a combined values-appeal structure that is composed of three distinct classes: rational appeal with functional values, emotional appeal with hedonistic values, and emotional appeal with altruistic values. As expected from studies of advertising in western societies, most of the ads were loaded with either rational-functional characteristics or emotional-hedonistic characteristics. Altruism in its entirety was dominant in only a few of the ads, although one of its signs-collectivism-was surprisingly found in some of the ads that were predominantly hedonistic. Most of the findings support Pollay's conception of advertising as a distorted mirror that refrains from depicting certain values. The work uses Smallest Space Analysis (SSA) to classify the value types, and discusses the use of smallest space analysis as a. method for confirmatory multivariate classification in advertising research.

TI A content analysis of magazine advertisements from the United States and
   the Arab world
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In recent years, a wealth of literature has increased our understanding of cross-cultural differences in advertising content. Abernethy and Franke (1996)point out a gap in literature stating that "no study has examined the advertising information in any African nation, any part of the Middle East other than Saudi Arabia or any of the economies in transition associated with the former USSR." The current study, therefore, investigates differences in content of magazine advertisements from the United States and the Arab world comprising twelve Middle Eastern countries and ten African countries. Differences in the depiction of men and women, the extent of comparative advertising, the extent of information content, and the extent of price information are hypothesized, based on the role of religion in forming values (Luqmani, Yavas and Quraeshi 1987), the level of individualism (Hofstede 1980) and whether the culture is high-context or low-context (Hall 1976), as well as economic differences. One thousand sixty-four ads-from Egyptian, Lebanese and United Arab Emirates, as well as pan-Arabic general interest, family, and women's magazines, together with 540 ads from three U.S. general interest, family and women's magazines, were content analyzed. It was found that people are depicted less frequently in Arabic magazine ads. However, in ads in which people are shown, there are no differences in the extent to which women, are depicted. In ads in which women, are shown, they are depicted wearing long dresses, and tend to be pictured in ads when their presence relates to the advertised product. Also, in ads showing people, there are no differences in the extent to which male models are depicted. U.S. ads have more information content, provide more price information, and use more comparative advertising than Arabic ads. Implications for international marketers wanting to advertise in Arab magazines are offered. Limitations and extensions are also discussed.

TI Communication strategies for brand extensions: Enhancing perceived fit
   by establishing explanatory links
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research examines the proposition that high perceived fit of a brand extension results when consumers can establish explanatory links that connect the parent brand and the extension. Explanatory links are created when, salient parent brand associations are seen as relevant in the extension context. The salience and relevance of associations depends, in part, upon the dominant parent brand associations, the brand-to-extension relationship, and the communication strategy used to introduce the extension. Results indicated that extensions were poorly rated when the parent brand's dominant association was inconsistent with the extension's dominant association. Specifically, brands with dominant attribute-based associations (e.g., physical features) received lower evaluations than brands with dominant non-attribute-based associations (e.g, brand users) when, extended to a category with no physical attributes in common. In this case, evaluations were improved with an elaborational communication strategy that provided information about worrisome extension attributes. On the other hand, brands with dominant non-attribute-based associations received lower evaluations than, brands with dominant attribute-based associations when extended to a category with physical attributes in common. In this case, extension evaluations were improved with a relational communication strategy that raised the salience of the physical relationship between the categories.

The focus here is on how the social alliances existing between fans and a preferred sports team influence purchase intentions. Data from a convenience sample of 678 adults attending a college football game suggest that favorable purchase intentions are more likely to occur (1) as identification with the team increases and (2) when such intentions are perceived as a group norm. Moreover, art ordinal interaction indicates that team identification has a greater effect on intentions at lower levels of group norms than at higher levels. Implications for practice are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study tested in the context of branded products a set of hypotheses derived from theory in political science concerning negative advertising messages: those that unfavorably compare Brand B with Brand A. We expected and found that the most favorably-rated message contains negative elements, and that any negative comparison is perceived differently by users of Brand B, users of A, users of a third brand and users of multiple brands. Two other expectations were also supported. Responses are more favorable to a message simply denigrating product features of a rival brand vs, a message smearing a corporation. Also, all ratings do not differ in the same way when one contrasts responses to negative comparative messages with responses to messages that are simply brand comparisons.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper reports on a cross-cultural study which tests the robustness of the approach developed by Gupta and Gould (1997) concerning use of product placements in movies. Using their American data as a comparison point, additional data using the same questionnaire were collected in Austria and France. As an international medium in which movies freely cross borders, product placement is also a less adaptable one, relative to commercials since it remains in the movie regardless of the nation where it is shown. Applying a three-pronged framework which considered country, product and individual differences and their interactive effects, the results of this study indicate the ways in which all three have an impact on the acceptability of product placements and on. potential purchase behavior. Finally, implications for managing and further researching product placements based on this framework are drawn.

TI A comparative analysis of three communication formats: Advertising,
   infomercial and direct experience
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
CT Association-for-Consumer-Research-Europe Conference
CY 1997
CL STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN
SP Assoc Consumer Res Europe
AB We develop a theoretical framework around the simple proposition that infomercials are similar to ads in some respects and also reflect characteristics inherent in direct experiences (i.e., trial use of branded goods). Using a real infomercial for a rock music album, we conducted true experiments to investigate the relative effectiveness of three different communication formats of research interest: ad, infomercial, and direct experience. Results were consistent across the two studies and indicated that both direct experience and infomercial formats produced greater impact on recall, attitudinal, and purchase intent variables when compared to the ad format. However few significant differences emerged between direct experience and infomercial formats, suggesting that infomercials are closer to direct experiences than they are toads.
   Of the three audio-visual conditions examined 15-minute long ad, 15-minute long infomercial, and 30-minute long infomercial), evidence indicated that the 15-minute long infomercial was most effective for attitudinal and direct-response measures. Thus, from the perspective of both persuasion and behavioral response, the popular 30-minute Long infomercial format may not be optimal; the 15-minute long infomercial format appears to deserve more research scrutiny.

TI Legal considerations when using parodies in advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Using parodies in an advertising campaign presents legal risks to the parodists. This article examines how copyright and trade-mark infringement laws limit the use of parodies in advertising. Under some circumstances, an unauthorized parody of another's work in an advertisement can be legal as a fair use exception under copyright Law. If a parodied trademark is involved, then the issue is whether the parodied math is likely to be confused with the original mark. Following a discussion of the statutory and case law, guidelines for the development of legally successful parodies are offered.

TI Is beauty best? Highly versus normally attractive models in advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Several studies investigating the positive effects of including highly attractive models (HAMs) in advertising have failed to unilaterally support their use. This paper explores the differential effects of pairing highly versus normally attractive models with different types of attractiveness-relevant products. Contrary to past research (Kahle and Homer 1985; Kamins 1990), the results suggest that HAMS are not the most effective choice for all categories of attractiveness-relevant products. This research also explores the method by which the match between model attractiveness and product type influences advertising effectiveness. Results suggest that a match between cc model and a product improves ad effectiveness not necessarily through the elicitation of product arguments fi om model appearance, but instead by heightening perceptions of the model's expertise about the product.

TI The effects of sexual social marketing appeals on cognitive processing
   and persuasion
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Increasingly, social marketers are using sexual information in public service announcements and collateral material for a wide range of causes. This study builds on, previous research to explain how sexual appeals can affect cognitive processing and persuasion for "help-self" social marketing topics. It also goes beyond traditional single-message research designs by testing matched pairs of appeals (sexual / nonsexual) for 13 social marketing topics. The major finding was that sexual appeals were more persuasive overall than matched nonsexual appeals for social marketing topics. Sexual appeals also stimulated more favorable ad execution-related thoughts but had a negative effect an cognitive elaboration (e.g., support and counterarguments). Respondents also reported that sexual appeals were more attention, getting, likeable, dynamic, and somewhat more apt to increase their interest in the topic than. were nonsexual appeals. These findings suggest that persuasion is largely the result of peripheral processing and distraction from somewhat unpleasant messages when receivers are expected to counterargue the message or be resistant to change.

TI Response latency verification of consumption constellations:
   Implications for advertising strategy
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Consumers are assumed to organize information about lifestyle groups much like they organize other category Knowledge, in that features of the object are used by the consumer to assign it to a category. Knowledge about the complementary consumption, choices-consumption constellations-associated with different lifestyles is hypothesized to be organized in associative networks. A consumption constellation is a hypothetical construct used to describe the cognitive organization, of cross-category product information. This study examines several processing alternatives pertaining to consumption constellations using response latency methodology. Participants were asked to respond to stimuli (products) representative of either an aspirational or an avoidance group consumption constellation. Results suggest that, at least for products defining an aspirational lifestyle, consumption constellations exist as constructs in memory. The findings support the value of adapting cognitive processing methodologies to understand better how consumers perceive the symbolic meanings of products. The article concludes with a call for additional research and a discussion of the ramifications for advertising strategy.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Although infomercials are becoming a. much more common type of television. advertising with gross sales of products exceeding one billion, dollars in 1996, there have been no studies examining the interactive influences of different station, policies, market environments and management beliefs on. infomercial clearance decisions. A national survey of television stations with responses from over 350 stations was used to build and assess a model of infomercial clearance decision making. Results suggest there is great variation in the infomercial review process and clearance outcomes between stations. Some stations routinely accept ads that could harm consumers. Thus, policy recommendations based on these results are made.

TI Consumer responses to tropes in print advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research investigates the effects of a specific type of figure of speech in. print advertising. The figures of speech, tropes, are indirect or irregular statements, such as puns or metaphors, that require; viewers to make inferences to understand their intended meaning. The results suggest that using tropes can significantly enhance the effectiveness of a print ad, making the ad more persuasive and more memorable. However, the effectiveness of tropes seems limited to low involvement settings. The authors suggest that advertisers can. employ tropes to overcome some of the difficulties associated with advertising to disinterested consumers.

TI Time pressure and information in sales promotion strategy: Conceptual
   framework and content analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in time pressure and information between two broad classes of promotional offers: (1) "advanced receipts" in which consumers are encouraged to expedite the purchase of a good or service to take advantage of coupons, rebates, price-offs, premiums, etc.; and (2) "delayed payments," in which consumers are urged to "buy now and pay later." A content analysis of 222 promotional offers was conducted using the time and outcome valuation, model as a theoretical basis for understanding the role of time pressure in. terms of time allowed before the offer expiration as well as copy and information in these different types of promotional offers. The findings indicate that delayed payment offers allow less time to participate than advanced receipt offers, have more time pressure copy for those promotional offers giving a deadline and provide more information.

The natures of both creative risk and agency philosophy are discussed. Multiple measures of risk taking are applied and the findings suggest that agency executives working in, agencies with clear identities are more likely to take risks than are those in agencies without such identities (hybrid philosophies), but not for all measures of risk. The extent to which the size of client plays a role also is assessed. After art assessment of the findings, limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed.

TI The role of myth in creative advertising design: Theory, process and
   outcome
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In an empirical study using five real-world creative teams from an advertising agency, participants were given a strategic brief for a new beverage product and asked to design the layout for a print ad. Think-aloud concurrent protocols obtained from each team's copywriter, art director, and the two working together were analyzed to examine the creative process and its relationship to the created advertisement. Interpretive analyses of the protocols reveal that the teams access culturally available plot patterns but in different ways. In this study and with the particular materials and situational context explored here, four of the five teams chose to pursue a single mythic structure to the apparent detriment of their final product. Only one team engaged in fully diversified idea generation involving a wide range of alternative scenarios. Not coincidentally, as a tentative conclusion, this more flexible team produced the adjudged most successful by advertising professionals. This still-to-be-tested exploratory finding deserves further investigation in future research that embodies various methodological refinements.

TI Understanding the mental representations created by comparative
   advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Despite theories suggesting that the cognitive impact of comparative advertisements differs from that of noncomparative ads, little progress has been made toward empirically understanding the types of mental representations engendered by these forms of advertising. The current research provides evidence pertinent to this issue across three experiments. As anticipated, comparative ads are more likely to cause mental impressions about the advertised brand relative to competitors than are noncomparative ads. The results also indicate that differentiative comparative ads generate disassociative rather than the associative mental impressions previously thought to characterize the processing of such ads. In addition, the findings demonstrate that both relative and nonrelative impressions may be formed following exposure to comparative ads. Implications are drawn for interpreting the findings of prior investigations, as well as for undertaking future research on comparative advertising.

TI Exploring managers' perceptions of the impact of sponsorship on brand

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Sponsorship of sporting and other events has become an increasingly popular marketing communications vehicle. However little research has investigated how sponsorship participation is beneficial to a firm and its brands. This study explores how managers view the brand-equity-building capabilities of their sponsorship-linked marketing programs over time. In a two-phase survey, fifty managers report on the value of sponsorships in building brand equity. Findings show that "leverage, " the use of advertising and promotion to support the sponsorship, and active management involvement are significant predictors of both the perceived differentiation of the brand from its competitors and adding financial value to the brand.

TI The unpredictable audience: An exploratory analysis of forecasting error
   for new prime-time network television programs
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This article investigates possible determinants of forecasting error for new prime-time network television programs. Each season, advertising industry forecasters attempt to predict the audience shares for new fall programs. Advertising expenditures are made on the basis of these projections, though historically these forecasts have been very inaccurate. Through an integration of audience behavior theory and decision-making theory, this paper attempts to identify factors that explain the magnitude of uncertainty, and hence the magnitude of forecasting error, surrounding the predictions for new programs. The results indicate that the presence of a returning network lead-in or lead-out significantly reduces the amount of forecasting error. In addition, the results indicate that forecasting error has increased significantly over time. The overall explanatory power of the model suggests that content and audience characteristics must be incorporated into the analytical framework as well.

TI Organizational buying and advertising agency-client relationships in
   China
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The 1980s and 1990s have seen the development of an interesting, diverse, and relevant body of literature on the advertising agency-client relationship. In recent times, an area of focus has been the application of organizational buying behavior principles to companies that are purchasing advertising services from advertising agencies. However, little is known about the application of such theories in the context of a developing country. After examining the literature relating to China's advertising industry and the application of organizational buying behavior principles in the advertising industry, this article reports on a survey of 200 firms in Shanghai. The results unexpectedly show that advertising agency power in the campaign development process is not related to the nature of the advertising task (new task, modified rebuy, straight rebuy) at hand. In addition, bottom-up processes give agencies the weakest pourer, and the client buying process is dominated by marketers, the salesforce, and public relations, with top managers the primary deciders.

AB This research investigates the ability of color and graphics to convey information about quality and credibility and their influence on, choice in Yellow Pages advertising. In Experiment 1, participants exposed to Yellow Pages ads across three product categories had more favorable attitudes toward the advertisement, advertiser, and quality for ads in color than for noncolored ads. Attitudes about the advertisement, advertiser, quality, and credibility were more favorable for ads with photos than, for ads with line art. In both cases, results varied by product category. Experiment 2 tested the effect of color and graphics on selection of a Yellow Pages advertiser across eight product categories. Selection from a 32-page, simulated Yellow Pages booklet was made by 384 subjects. A significant effect for process (full) color and photographic-quality graphics on choice of an advertiser from Yellow Pages was found and varied across product categories. The results also highlight the impact of other variables that are controlled by the advertiser.

TI Memory-based measures for assessing advertising effects: A comparison of
   explicit and implicit memory effects
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Prior marketing studies investigating memory for advertisements have relied almost exclusively on examining effects contingent on explicit memory retrieval. This process involves a deliberate effort on the part of the consumer to think back to an advertisement in an attempt to recall the ad information. Studies in this area have shown that a lengthy delay between ad exposure and test, as well as divided attention during the ad exposure episode, hinder or even eliminate successful explicit memory retrieval. The premise of this paper is that an alternative retrieval process, implicit memory, may function differently. This form of memory retrieval is automatic in nature and does not rely on consumers deliberately searching their memory for a previously viewed advertisement. Comparisons with explicit memory retrieval suggest that implicit memory is preserved even in conditions of delay and divided attention, whereas explicit memory is affected detrimentally by those conditions. The two different forms of retrieval processes are validated with the use of a process dissociation procedure. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

TI "Stay tuned - We will be back right after these messages": Need to
   evaluate moderates the transfer of irritation in advertising
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Studies on irritation in advertising have primarily focused on commercial attributes that produce negative reactions to that commercial and the brand advertised. The present study extends this line of research by examining the carryover effects of irritation previously elicited by either disliked ads or a large number of ads (embedded in a documentary) to an unrelated, neutral ad (at the end of the documentary). We hypothesize that people with a high need to evaluate (NE) will show such a transfer of irritation more clearly than will low NE individuals. The results confirm this hypothesis; high NE individuals were (1) more irritated after exposure to disliked or many ads and, consequently, (2) more negatively affected in their evaluations of the neutral ad and brand. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

TI Advertising's influence on subsequent product trial processing
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Several studies have shown that pretrial ad exposure can positively influence a subsequent product trial experience. In this study, we investigate several specific, positive ad effects on product trial using an experiment that exposes subjects to a trial only, an ad only, or an ad and trial. In general, the pretrial ad appeared to encourage consumers to process a subsequent product trial more deeply, purposefully, and carefully than was the case with the trial alone. Subjects exposed to a pretrial ad rated the subsequent trial higher in diagnosticity, formed more confidently held beliefs, and formed higher expectancy value and purchase intentions. In addition, consumers exposed to an ad prior to trial showed stronger structural relationships among expectancy value, brand attitude, and purchase intentions compared with those consumers that experienced a product trial alone. Such results suggest that posttrial responses are the result of more careful and focused processing of the trial information.
   Advertising and product trial were also shown to differ significantly in their ability to foster strongly held beliefs about experiential and nonexperiential product attributes. As expected, advertising was superior at communicating nonexperiential beliefs, and trial excelled at fostering experiential attribute beliefs.

TI Framing meaning perceptions with music: The case of teaser ads

This research suggests that music may function in a manner similar to verbal captions with regard to the meanings viewers attribute to a teaser ad. Whereas previous research tended to examine the effects of executional cues within a single medium (e.g., music, visual element), this research suggests that interactive audiovisual images play an important role in the meaning enactment process. Specifically, music connects with and accentuates selective visual events, as well as selective aspects of a visual event, to draw out the advertising proposition. The implications of these findings are discussed.

TI Highly attractive models in advertising and the women who loathe them:
   The implications of negative affect for spokesperson effectiveness
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The use of highly attractive women in advertising is certainly popular, though support for their effectiveness is somewhat mixed (e.g., Bower and Landreth 2001; Caballero, Lumpkin, and Madden 1989; Caballero and Solomon 1984). Other research has established that some women experience negative affect by comparing themselves with these beautiful models (e.g., Irving 1990; Martin and Gentry 1997; Richins 1991). The present research extends prior undertakings by investigating whether the negative affect stemming from comparisons with these highly attractive models may have a negative impact on advertising effectiveness. The pattern of results from two studies indicates that, when sufficient negative affect is generated as a consequence of comparison with beautiful models, evaluations of both the model as a spokesperson and the product argument may be affected adversely because of model derogation. Given the significant effect that evaluations of spokesperson and product argument can have on product evaluations and intentions, the importance of this finding of model derogation is discussed.

AB A content analysis was conducted of childrens television commercials from China and the United States that were recorded over a period of eighteen months. We describe how the content of the two sets of commercials differs and the underlying reasons for the differences, including cultural, economic, and social conditions. The results suggest that, for the most part, Chinese children's commercials reflect China's traditional cultural values and its social and economic development level. However, the analysis was able to detect a shifting in power in Chinese society from the elderly to the young, resulting mainly from its one-child policy implemented during the past two decades. We also found some evidence of Western values creeping into Chinese childrens commercials. Limitations are noted, and suggestions are offered for additional research that will corroborate these findings.

TI Interpreting consumer perceptions of advertising: An application of the
   Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB For more than three decades, research has theorized about and investigated consumers' attitudes toward advertising. In this study, we interview fourteen U.S. consumers using the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique, a method that involves semi-structured, in-depth, personal interviews centered around visual images. Our metaphor and cross-case analyses further contribute to an understanding of consumers' impressions of advertising and the meanings that they associate with it. The metaphors attributed to advertising reveal that advertising has positive value, in that it relates information (hostess, teacher, counsel or, enabler, and magician), provides entertainment (performer); and stimulates growth in the economy (engine). However, the goodwill derived from these aspects of advertising is countered by several liabilities, as epitomized by the omnipresent being, nosy neighbor, con-man, seducer, and evil therapist metaphors. In addition, three groups (the ambivalents, the skeptics, and the hostiles) with varying levels of appreciation for the institution of advertising emerge from our cross-case analysis.

TI The "risky business" of binge drinking among college students: Using
   risk models for PSAs and anti-drinking campaigns
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB To assist creators of public service announcements and anti-drinking campaigns, this study provides an in-depth examination of the risks of binge drinking from the perspective of college students. Using current risk models for guidance, key elements from the qualitative data in the study are addressed, including perceived risks and their severity, vulnerability to risks, self-efficacy, response efficacy, benefits from ritual functions, and other costs or benefits based on students' attitudes and beliefs. An integrated risk perception model is introduced.
   Student participants enumerated extensive risks; however, the generally, felt invulnerable to the consequences. Most adopted a management style of "taking chances" when binge drinking because they perceived a built-in safety net in the college environment. Three ritual functions and various attitudes and beliefs help explain why a cost and benefit analysis favors binge drinking. Recommendations are given.

TI Third-party organization endorsement of products: An advertising cue
   affecting consumer prepurchase evaluation of goods and services
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Advertisements containing product endorsements, by a third-party organization (TPO), product endorsements by a celebrity, or no endorsement were compared for their ability to affect the dependent variables of perceived product quality, attitude toward the manufacturer, purchase risk, and information value of the ad. In addition, prior brand evaluation and source (endorser) trustworthiness were tested as moderators of the endorsement effect. In two factorial experiments, one for a desktop computer and one for auto insurance, significant main effects were found for endorsement and brand but not for trustworthiness. Brand interacted with endorsement in the quality perception of computers. In both experiments, TPO endorsement was particularly effective in enhancing respondent perceptions of product quality. It is concluded that TPO endorsement may function as an extrinsic quality cue in advertising.

TI Estimating differential lag effects for multiple media across multiple
   stores
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB More than 30 years of study have provided ample evidence that advertising in one period can continue to influence sales performance in subsequent periods. However, these carryover, or lagged, effects of advertising have generally been studied (1) only for the total advertising budget or (2) using estimation techniques that implicitly assume that different advertising media have the same lag effect, We develop a model that estimates the influence on sales when different advertising media are allowed to have different lag structures. A methodology is presented and illustrated by an application to weekly data from three stores of a large national retailer. Of the two media studied, radio had longer lagged effects than did billboards. The results were consistent for all three stores. This research yields important insights for theory, as well as for the practice of advertising campaign planning and budget allocation.

The results show that respondents' attitudes are more positive when the product is assembled in the United States if U.S. parts are also used than if Mexican parts are used. Similarly, purchase intention is higher when the product is assembled in the United States and U.S. parts are used than if Mexican parts are used. Televisions and stereos are used as the products in this study. The results lend partial support to the congruity principle. Theoretical and public policy implications are discussed, as are limitations and suggestions for further research.

AB This study examines cultural values as reflected in U.S. and Chinese advertising appeals. The findings support most of the hypotheses, indicating that the portrayal of traditional Chinese cultural values remains relatively stable. However, subtle changes in cultural values and advertising strategies are visible. In particular, the youth/modernity appeal that reflects the westernization, as well as the modernization, trend in China seems as prominently displayed in Chinese commercials as in the U.S. commercials. Implications for standardization versus specialization advertising strategies are also explored.

TI Image communicated by the use of 99 endings in advertised prices
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In a controlled experiment, use of the 99 rather than the 00 price ending,(e.g., using $49.99 rather than $50.00) affects the impression created by a price advertisement. The 99 ending increases the likelihood that viewers judge an advertised price as relatively low and as representing a discount. However, in addition to these price-image effects, the 99 ending has negative effects on quality image in the ads sponsored by higher quality retailers. These results suggest that the choice of rightmost digits is an important executional variable in price advertising.

TI An aggregate examination of the backlash effect in political
   advertising: The case of the 1996 US senate race in Minnesota
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study investigates the "dual effects" of negative political information. Research in negative political advertising indicates that negative ads can have intended effects, harming the target of such attacks, or they can boomerang, thereby harming the sponsor (or the opponent of the target) of such advertising. These investigations have commonly been undertaken in an experimental or quasi-experimental setting, exposing subjects to a few isolated advertisements. This study examines advertisements in the context of a real-world campaign setting and utilizes advertising buy data for the entire campaign, which allows for the more accurate construction of messages available in the information environment over time. Advertising messages sponsored by candidates and parties are then analyzed to determine their relationship to a relatively dramatic shift in Republican candidate Rudy Boschwitzs favorability with the public. Findings indicate that, in addition to the intended impact of Paul Wellstone and Democratic Farmer-Labor Party ads against Boschwitz, unintended consequences of National Republican Senatorial Committee ads against Wellstone made a significant contribution to understanding variation in candidate Boschwitzs favorability with the public over time.

   political decision making
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A total of 236 students participated in an experiment testing the effects of positive, negative, and negative comparative political advertising on key variables in the political decision-making process. Participants exposed to negative advertising found it less useful for political decision making and were more negative toward political campaigns than were participants exposed to positive advertising. Negative political advertising had no effect on participants' cynicism, efficacy, or apathy. The findings suggest that, though negative advertising contributes to citizens' disgust with campaigns, this strategy does not automatically increase citizens' cynicism or apathy.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The Virginia Senate campaign between incumbent Democratic Senator Chuck Robb and Republican challenger George Allen was widely touted as one of the most crucial elections in the battle for the Senate. This study presents a pretest/posttest causal exploration of advertising effects for a series of ads aired during early October 2000. Political image evaluations, emotion, and cynicism were linked in effects for the 93 research participants. Findings reveal that emotional responses to ads were strong predictors of posttest candidate image evaluations. Furthermore, participant responses indicate that ads eliciting fearful emotions are significant predictors of overall cynicism. Moment-by-moment responses to the ads show that respondents' evaluation of the ads was strongly associated with the valence of the message strategy and the emotional content occurring at the various points in the ad.

In an experiment using ads from a 2000 congressional race, comparative ads provoked fewer source derogations but more counterarguments than did negative ads, a contrast that may reflect differences in the information processing styles the ads invite. Comparative ads also prompted more support arguments, positive affect, and source bolstering, and they were viewed more favorably than were negative ads.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study focuses on issues related to political advertising and electoral behavior through an examination of political advertising believability, the perceived value of information sources utilized and available in election campaigns, voter involvement, confidence, and emotion. The study was undertaken in a recent state election in Australia. Data were gathered from a sample of registered voters and analyzed using partial least squares. The results indicate that the negative campaign run by the opposition was believed as much as the positive campaign run by the incumbent government. Also, voter involvement, satisfaction, and emotion affected the believability of the positive campaign, but only involvement and satisfaction affected the negative campaign. The findings also indicate that non-paid media (television, newspapers) were valued more as sources of information by voters than were political advertising and the Internet.

AB The primary objective of this research is to investigate the ability of skepticism toward advertising to moderate the effects of brand familiarity on evaluations (i.e., offer fairness, acquisition value, and purchase intentions) of advertisements containing external reference prices (i.e., invoice prices). The results suggest that consumers high in skepticism toward advertising are positively influenced by a high invoice price (versus a low invoice price) when brand familiarity is high but not when brand familiarity is low. However, consumers low in skepticism toward advertising are positively influenced by a high invoice price (versus a low invoice price) regardless of whether brand familiarity is high or low.

AB Recent growth in the U.S. economy has been in the service sectors, and increased understanding of the marketing and advertising of services is critical to sustaining this growth. This paper investigates issues related to the advertising of common retail services. Results from an empirical study into the relative effectiveness of four types of spokespersons for a hedonic and a utilitarian retail service indicate that a created character fits well with the hedonic service but not with the utilitarian service. The celebrity spokesperson performed well for both types of services, but effects varied across service type. The hypothesized contingency relationship between spokesperson type and service type was supported.

Following traditional methods of scale development, the study uses expert-generated adjective lists, expands possible measures using a thesaurus, and finally reduces the number of items statistically to derive a new measure of advertising intrusiveness. The scale is validated using samples in different experimental conditions and is found to be valid, reliable, and parsimonious. The importance of such a scale for the field of advertising is discussed.

TI Oracles on "advertising": Searching for a definition
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Traditional definitions of advertising include a series of elements that distinguish the field from others. Each innovation in communication has been used for advertising, and in some way, each has changed advertising, which in turn has changed the set of elements used in its definition. However, there are or should be some essential elements that determine whether an activity is advertising. Unfortunately, a discussion identifying these elements is lacking in the marketing and advertising literature. This study is designed to begin an open discussion of what constitutes those essential elements, with the ultimate aim of constructing an improved definition of advertising. The Delphi method, originally developed for financial forecasting, is used to engage a diverse group of advertising experts in a dialogue to reconsider those elements and construct a new definition of advertising.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Male and female voices were evaluated in terms of their communication effectiveness in delivering advertising messages. It was hypothesized that the sex of presenters in ads has a significant effect on evaluations of commercials for gender-imaged products but not for products with no gender image (neutral products). As hypothesized, men and women were judged equally effective as presenters for neutral products. For a female-gender-imaged product, the sex of the spokesperson and the announcer significantly affected advertising evaluations. However, results showed that, for a male-gender-imaged product, the sex of the presenters had no impact on evaluations of the commercials. There is only one advertising scenario in which a male voice is preferred as a presenter. Implications of these findings for advertising practice are discussed.

TI Managing the power of curiosity for effective Web advertising strategies
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This research investigates the effect of curiosity on the effectiveness of Internet advertising. In particular, we identify processes that underlie curiosity resolution and study its impact on consumer motivation and learning. The dataset from our simulated Internet experiment includes process tracking variables (i.e., clickstream data from ad-embedded links), traditional attitude and behavioral intention measures, and open-ended protocols. We find that a curiosity-generating advertising strategy increases interest and learning relative to a strategy that provides detailed product information. Furthermore, though curiosity does not dramatically increase the observed quantity of search in our study, it seems to improve the quality of search substantially (i.e., time spent and attention devoted to specific information), resulting in better and more focused memory and comprehension of new product information. To enhance the effectiveness of Internet advertising of new products, we recommend a curiosity advertising strategy based on four elements: (1) curiosity generation by highlighting a gap in extant knowledge, (2) the presence of a hint to guide elaboration for curiosity resolution, (3) sufficient time to try and resolve curiosity as well as the assurance of curiosity-resolving information, and (4) the use of measures of consumer elaboration and learning to gauge advertising effectiveness.

TI The netvertising image: Netvertising image communication model (NICM)
   and construct definition
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper presents a communication model and nominal definition of advertising images on the Internet, here called the netvertising image (Stern 2001). The model and attribute-based definition facilitate the construction of a formal language system for theory development and hypothesis testing specific to images in the multimedia context. The necessity for so doing is that netvertising has inherited a legacy of fuzzy meanings from marketing, advertising, and consumer behavior research, in which "image" is used variously across the domains of media, message, mental responses, and marketplace behavior. Transformation from this ordinary but ambiguous language system to a formal scientific one proceeds through building a model, sourcing the roots of ordinary meanings, recasting them as attributes, and setting forth a nominal definition. The paper ends with suggestions for future research.

Interactivity has been positioned conceptually as a process, a function, and a perception, but most operational definitions have focused on the process or function. This study develops scales to operationalize the perception-based approach to interactivity, because consumer perceptions are central to advertising research. Three overlapping constructs that are central to interactivity are explored: direction of communication, user control, and time. A multistage method is used to identify and refine measures of perceived interactivity (MPI). The 18 items included in the MPI offer researchers a tool for measuring a consumer perception central to advertising on the Web.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The conceptualization of a virtual experience has emerged because advancements in computer technology have led to a movement toward more multisensory online experiences. Two studies designed to explore the concepts of virtual experience and presence are presented, with the results largely supporting the proposition that 3-D advertising is capable of enhancing presence and, to varying degrees, ultimately influencing the product knowledge, brand attitude, and purchase intention of consumers. The marketing implications are immediate because the ability to create a compelling virtual product experience is not beyond the current capability of interactive advertising. By creating compelling on-line virtual experiences, advertisers can potentially enhance the value of product information presented and engage consumers in an active user-controlled product experience.

TI Banner advertisement pricing, measurement, and pretesting practices:
   Perspectives from interactive agencies
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study reports findings from a survey of media directors of interactive advertising agencies regarding how they price, evaluate, and pretest banner ads. Results suggest that more than 90% of the responding agencies used cost per thousand frequently to price banner ads, whereas about 33% used click-throughs. In addition, a majority of the agencies used click-throughs and outcomes (e.g., inquires, purchases) rather than exposures to gauge banner advertising effectiveness. Although few agencies pretested their banner ads on a regular basis, most perceived the lack of measurement standards and independent auditing of Web sites as major problems facing Internet banner advertising. Findings from this study should provide benchmarks for future research on the topic and help facilitate the process of developing viable pricing and measurement standards on the Internet.

TI Choosing the right mix of on-line affiliates: How do you select the
   best?
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB In affiliate advertising, an on-line retailer places a link for its business at a host business's site. The host earns a commission whenever a visitor clicks the link and consummates a transaction with the sponsor. We offer a framework that on-line retailers can use to find appropriate affiliates. Our approach is based on two assumptions. First, we assume that hosts that carry products related to those of the sponsor will be good affiliates. Second, we assume that the relationships between products are reflected in how consumers search for information. Our model uncovers relationships between products on the basis of these two assumptions and thereby identifies potential affiliates.

TI Forced exposure and psychological reactance: Antecedents and
   consequences of the perceived intrusiveness of pop-up ads
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This paper explores forced viewing of "pop-up ads" on the Internet to understand better how viewers come to define ads as irritating and decide to avoid them. Perceived intrusiveness was suggested as the underlying mechanism by which the process occurs. Antecedents of intrusiveness were identified that affect perceptions of ads as interruptions, including congruence of the advertisement content with the current task and intensity of cognition at the moment the ad pops up. The consequences of intrusiveness were shown to be caused by feelings of irritation and ad avoidance. The results provide an understanding of how consumers experience forced exposure situations in interactive environments and highlight implications for advertisers seeking to increase the effectiveness of on-line advertising.

TI The development, change, and transformation of rhetorical style in
   magazine advertisements 1954-1999
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Rhetorical advertising style consists of the method or manner by which ad content is expressed; an example is the use of rhetorical figures such as metaphor or rhyme. Two studies of rhetorical style in U.S. magazine advertisements from 1954 to 1999 are reported. A qualitative content assessment suggests that rhetorical figures were prevalent throughout the period. In addition, the content assessment suggests more layering of multiple figures and less explanation of figures over time. The content analysis supports these trends and clarifies that one kind of figure-a destabilization trope that includes pun, metaphor, and irony-increased in incidence. Several possible explanations for these observed trends are considered, with a focus on how changes in rhetorical style may reflect the mutual adaptation of consumer and advertiser to changes in the advertising environment over this time period.

TI Understanding program-induced mood effects: Decoupling arousal from
   valence
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The role of mood on ad processing was examined by orthogonally manipulating valence (positive versus negative) and arousal (moderate versus high). Measures of signal detection were used to provide evidence of the level (deep versus shallow) and nature (schematic versus data-driven) of processing. Results indicate that the arousal and valence dimensions of mood differentially affect ad processing, with arousal affecting the level of processing and valence influencing the nature of processing. The processing level was more shallow when the arousal level was high rather than moderate. Positive valence was associated with the greater use of schematic processing, whereas negative valence was associated with the greater use of data-driven processing. These results were obtained even when covarying out the effect of arousal and valence at ad retrieval. Therefore, the effects are attributable to the impact of the two dimensions of mood at encoding (i.e., during ad processing) versus ad retrieval (i.e., when responding to the questionnaires).

TI The effects of magazine-induced psychological responses and thematic
   congruence on memory and attitude toward the ad in a real-life setting
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The effects of context-induced psychological responses have primarily been studied in experimental television settings. Contrary to previous research, this study examines the effects of context-induced psychological responses on the processing of magazine advertisements. Furthermore, a real-life survey design was used instead of an experimental design. Test ads were placed in the regular circulation of three magazine titles, and a representative sample of subscribers (n=263) was interviewed face-to-face. In addition to psychological responses, the influence of thematic congruence between magazines and advertisements was studied. Results show that magazine-induced liking and positive feelings had a positive influence on attitude toward the ad. Furthermore, thematically congruent advertisements were better remembered than incongruent advertisements.

TI Consumer response to a firm's endorser (dis)association decisions
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Two studies address how companies should react when celebrity endorsers with whom they wish to associate are blameless or blameworthy for causing negative events (e.g., accidents). Research findings on stigmas suggest a linear endorser blame-company evaluation relationship, such that companies should associate (disassociate) with endorsers who have low (high) levels of blame for negative events. In contrast, research findings on defensive distortions suggest a nonmonotonic blame-evaluation relationship: Owing to the tendency to downgrade low blame persons so that they seem deserving of bad fate, companies benefit from associating with moderate, rather than low or high, blame celebrities. The current research suggests that the stage of the company-endorser relationship influences the pattern of findings and the type of endorser decisions companies should make. In Study 1 (n=121), consistent with stigma research, companies fared better when dismissing existing endorsers with high blame and keeping those with low blame. In Study 2 (n=108), consistent with research on defensive distortions, when making decisions about potential endorsers, companies fared best when hiring low blame candidates and worst when rejecting moderate blame candidates.

TI What is interactivity and is it always such a good thing?. Implications
   of definition, person, and situation for the influence of interactivity
   on advertising effectiveness
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Most perceptions of interactivity are that it is an inherently good thing, that it will change marketing and advertising as we know it. However, though there are obvious and intuitive advantages to interactivity, it may pose a disadvantage for marketing and advertising in some conditions. In this article, we explore the nature of interactivity and its underlying processes to determine the conditions in which interactivity may be both useful and detrimental in an advertising context. We first discuss the multidimensional nature of the interactivity construct as it has appeared in the literature. We then provide a concrete conceptualization and definition of interactivity that encompasses these various dimensions. We argue that inconsistencies between the definitions and operationalizations found in previous studies make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the role of interactivity but that these inconsistencies can be at least partly explained by a focus on the different dimensions of interactivity. Finally, drawing on theory and research in cognitive, social, and personality psychology, we suggest that the influence of interactivity on advertising, effectiveness may be a function of both the person and the situation. We offer a program of research, in the form of testable propositions, to explore these boundary conditions and discuss implications for Internet advertising strategy.

Absent from this stream of research is direct evidence of the influence of individual authors and their works in the form of peer evaluation and readership. For this study, a priori lists of influential books and articles were used in a survey of U.S. advertising educators and academic researchers. The results reveal a core of research-based and practice-oriented contributions of widely recognized importance and influence. The findings also provide (1) valuable lists of readings for current and future students and educators; (2) direct evidence of the quality of individual literary contributions, and (3) useful insights into the theoretical, intellectual, and practical foundations of the field.

TI Associating the corporation with a charitable event through sponsorship:
   Measuring the effects on corporate community relations
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB On the basis of balance theory, corporate sponsorship of a well-liked charitable event is hypothesized to result in significant enhancement of consumer-perceived corporate community relations. However, on the basis of attribution theory, it is proposed that subjects would employ negative attributions (i.e., corporate self-interest) to explain the sponsorship. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that a structural equation model of charitable event sponsorship will show a significant negative path leading from the negative attributions construct to the outcome construct. As predicted, event sponsorship resulted in a significant enhancement of corporate community relations. However, the hypothesized path was not significant. The effects of sponsorship linkage on the outcome variable were largely mediated through the positive attributions construct.

TI Cultural values in advertisements to the Chinese X-Generation -
   Promoting modernity and individualism
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB A content analysis of 463 ads examined the cultural values-modernity, tradition, individualism, and collectivism-promoted in Chinese advertising. Results indicate that both modernity and individualism values predominate in current Chinese advertising. These values are more pervasive in magazine advertisements, which target the Chinese X-Generation (aged 18-35 years with high education and income), than in television commercials, which are aimed at the mass market. In contrast, collectivism and tradition values are found to be more pervasive on television than in magazine ads. These findings reveal the role of advertising in helping shape new values among the X-Generation, as well as reflecting existing values among the mainstream Chinese market. In addition, product characteristics (personal use versus shared products) are found to affect the degree of individualism and collectivism values manifested in ads. The implications for future research on the impact of cultural values in advertising are discussed.

TI Exploring collective memories associated with African-American
   advertising memorabilia - The good, the bad, and the ugly
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB We examine consumers' memories of and meanings associated with stereotypical depictions of African Americans in advertisements and other marketing memorabilia. Although research has discussed the evolution of depictions of African Americans in advertisements over time, there is little academic literature addressing the meanings associated with these images. Our analysis suggests that collecting black memorabilia demonstrates a means of both self and collective recollection, with the meanings of the images/objects differing by individual and social group. These meanings are understood by exploring two secondary themes: the good, the bad, and the ugly but important and black marketing memorabilia as symbols and preservers of the past. Evident in this discussion is that people remember the past in the context of tangible evidence (e.g., promotional items, packaging). People remember the past the way they want and need to remember it, and even images perceived as bad or ugly are important in reconciling with and learning from the past.

This article advances the concept of brand morphing, that is, the ways that brand meanings change among different groupings of consumers as facilitated by ad practitioners' efforts to accommodate, reinforce, and create diverse cultural meanings across different international markets. Depth interview data from a study of ad practitioners illustrate the ways that ad professionals accommodate, work with, and reinforce perceived foreign cultural differences that exist across target markets. Finally, brand morphing's usefulness and relevance to contemporary advertising theory and practice is discussed.

This paper examines the consumption context, implementation, creative execution, and impact of government-sponsored poster advertising during this important turning point in the history of American consumer culture. The final section considers the significance of these campaigns in consumption and poster history, as well as some implications for reinspiring frugal values and behaviors.

TI Tools or toys - Inventing the need for domestic appliances in postwar
   and postmodern Finland
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The article describes how the boundary between necessary and unnecessary consumption items was defined in Finland in the years following World War II. On the basis of extensive comparative data, it focuses on the history of two items: the washing machine and the cellular phone. The data consist of press coverage and material published by manufacturers and consumer counseling organizations. The need for household appliances was invented, shaped, normalized, and legitimized through a social interaction process in which the media were a central vehicle. The data suggest that the need for novelties is interpreted though similar types of cultural modes, no matter what the product or type of cultural text. Thus, the entry of technology into the home in the postwar years was accompanied by a discussion flavored not only by technological determinism, but also by a form of social and cultural determinism manifested in deep-grounded conceptual distinctions, such as tools versus toys. The world-record pace at which Finnish consumers took up new technology in the postwar period provides illustrative evidence and new stimuli for evaluating the potential for digitalizing the home in the twenty-first century.

TI Account planners' views on how their work is and should be evaluated
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB Account planning in the United States is now part of the mainstream agency landscape. The planning field has evolved from the original British conceptualization of the 1960s and 1970s. Now planners are central to client business strategy development and are also accountable for the outcomes of the agency's products. In light of increased demands by shareholders, holding companies, and market analysts on agencies for accountability, this study examines how the work of account planners in U.S. agencies is currently and should be evaluated. The study reports results of a national survey of U.S. planners regarding these questions. The study found that there are three general factors that planners say are currently being used to evaluate their work: (1) feedback from creatives, clients, and account teams; (2) traditional advertising campaign measures; and (3) awards and press. Of the three, the traditional advertising campaign measures factor accounts for most of the variance in responses. Planners rate the feedback factor as most important, however. Overall, awards and press were not a major consideration in evaluating the work of planners. These finding were consistent when planners were asked how they feel their work should be evaluated: For the most part, it appears that planners feel that the way their work is currently being evaluated is the way it should be evaluated. The study concludes with suggestions for future research.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB As the number of Internet users increases daily, Internet advertising grows in importance as one of the elements of the communications mix. Because of the controversy surrounding the effectiveness of banner advertising, many companies are seeking alternative formats for capturing on-line consumers. Through two studies, this research provides an empirical investigation of the effects of banner advertising and sponsored content on Web site communities and their advertisers. The studies demonstrate that Web communities and advertisers both benefit from sponsored content. Specifically, sponsored content can be an effective advertising tool to engender positive response toward an advertiser and increase feelings of customer responsiveness, product quality, category leadership, and even purchase intention. In addition, there is evidence that these types of messages are processed differently, indicating to communications managers that program objectives should drive the decision as to whether sponsored content, banner advertising, or some combination of the two will be most effective.

TI On the use of time expressions in promoting product benefits - The
   metaphoric and the literal
SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The purpose of this study is to investigate how the theme of time is used to advertise product benefits by providing a framework that integrates literal expression and relational/nominative, dead/alive metaphors. The model proposes that the linguistic field is composed of metaphoric and literal words that express wider or narrower ranges of inferences and implications. These words are linked to product benefits with differing ranges of implications and then communicated to consumers. A content analysis of 382 print ads tests the model by examining (1) metaphoric versus literal time expressions in conveying functional versus psychosocial benefits and (2) dead versus alive and relational versus nominative time metaphors in conveying functional versus psychosocial benefits. The findings suggest that advertisers use proportionately more psychosocial than functional benefits with metaphoric time expressions, whereas proportionately more functional benefits are likely to be associated with literal expressions. Proportionately more psychosocial rather than functional benefits are associated with relational/alive metaphors, and more functional than psychosocial benefits are associated with nominative/dead metaphors. Finally, guidelines are offered for the use of time metaphors in conveying product benefits.

Significant marketing persistence was found in sales of consumer durables, whereas there were mixed results in sales of nondurables.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB This study employed an experiment during the official campaign period to investigate the impacts of political advertising in the 1998 Taipei mayoral election. Specifically, this study argues that voters' party identifications have a moderating impact on how they respond to advertising messages. As expected, partisans evaluated political advertising sponsored by candidates of their affiliated party as more persuasive and likable than political advertising sponsored by candidates of the competing party. Independents showed no different responses to the ads by the two competing candidates, however. In addition, partisans who were exposed to either positive ad messages or negative ad messages for two competing candidates, compared with those who were exposed to no ad messages, had a significant positive change in voting support for the candidate nominated by their affiliated party, but a significant negative change in their voting support for the candidate of the opposing party. In clear contrast to partisans, independents' voting support for candidates was not influenced by advertising exposure. Contrary to expectations, the results also showed that affiliated voters' evaluations of the candidates they supported deteriorated after exposure to advertising messages, whether positive or negative. Explanations and implications for these findings will be discussed.
