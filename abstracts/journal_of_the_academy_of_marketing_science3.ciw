AB For almost half a century, researchers have examined consumer knowledge
   of prices, often with disturbing and conflicting results. Although the
   general findings suggest that consumer knowledge of prices is poorer
   than assumed in neoclassical economic theory, significant variations
   among results exist. The authors synthesize findings from prior studies
   to determine the impact of research design choices on price recall
   accuracy measures. A meta-analysis indicates that a significant amount
   of variation in the accuracy of consumers' price recall is related to
   research design characteristics such as the presence of financial
   rewards, respondents' task size, and the price elicitation approach.
   Implications for price awareness research are discussed.

AB The process by which managers implement marketing plans in smaller
   industrial organizations has yet to be conceptualized in ways that can
   spur theoretical development or speak to the practical realities of
   managers from this growing, important segment of American industry. This
   article, based on an exploratory study of marketing strategy processes
   in 50 smaller entrepreneurial organizations develops a framework to
   stimulate thinking and an inventory of propositions for future testing
   The study finds market planning and implementation inextricably linked.
   Marketing implementation emerges as an organization's adaptive response
   to day-to-day market events that is rarely scripted by plans and as a
   process that involves purposeful actions and improvisations as much as
   stop-gap actions and firefights. The nature and extent of
   implementation-related improvisations appear to directly affect a firm's
   market orientation, rate of growth, and strategic effectiveness.

   This study investigates factors that are related to the use of marketing
   information in the evaluation of marketing communications productivity.
   The information used in this context originates from a wide range of
   internal and external sources. On the basis of organizational theories
   of information processing, the authors develop and test a conceptual
   framework explaining the use of information to evaluate marketing
   communications productivity. Collected survey data indicate that
   information quality organization formalization, task complexity, market
   turbulence, rationality of decision style, and group involvement are all
   positively related to the use of information in assessing marketing
   communications productivity. Moderating relationships involving
   formalization, complexity, decision style, and the degree of group
   involvement are also found Implications for managing market knowledge
   and future research in information use are discussed.

AB Although product innovation is widely recognized as crucial to the
   success of organizations, the literature still contains certain gaps
   that limit our understanding of successful product innovation. These
   gaps include a lack of research employing a decompositional approach
   (i.e., analysis of the drivers at each stage of the process) to studying
   product innovation and a related lack of research investigating the
   effect of organizational characteristics on: specific stages of the
   product innovation process. The authors attempt to close these gaps by
   developing and testing a model examining the moderating effects of
   organizational characteristics on the relationship between the amount of
   market information gathered and the number of new product ideas
   generated by work groups in organizations. The study findings provide
   insights into the types of organizational structure and climate
   characteristics that can have an impact on the relationship between
   amount of market information and new product idea generation.

AB Value creation through alliances requires the simultaneous pursuit of
   partners with similar characteristics on certain dimensions and
   different characteristics on other dimensions. Partnering firms need to
   have different resource and capability profiles yet share similarities
   in their social institutions. In this article, the authors empirically
   examine the impact of partner characteristics on the performance of
   alliances. In particular, they test hypotheses related to both direct
   impact of partner characteristics on alliance performance and indirect
   effects through relational capital aspects of the alliance. Empirical
   results based on a sample of alliances in the global construction
   contracting industry suggest that complementarity in partner resources
   and compatibility in cultural and operational norms have different
   direct and indirect effects on alliance performance. Accordingly,
   organizational routines aimed at partner selection need to be
   complemented by relationship management routines to maximize the
   potential benefits from an alliance.

   concern about customer "churn," a concern that parallels issues of

   manuscript reports results of two field studies, conducted among two
   randomly selected samples of online service users, that investigate the
   degree to which selected behavioral (information that customers used
   when making the online service decision, their service usage),
   attitudinal (risk-taking propensity), and demographic (income and
   education) factors are effective in discriminating between continuers
   and switchers. The research in Study I is replicated in Study 2 and
   extended to consider additional attitudinal factors of satisfaction and
   involvement. Implications for managers and researchers are discussed.

   of these relationships has only recently begun. This article examines
   how adaptive selling behaviors and intercultural dispositions of
   marketing executives contribute to their perceived intercultural

   adaptive, the intercultural disposition of a marketer is of key
   importance in developing intercultural communication competence.

AB Market analysts and marketing strategists stress understanding the
   fundamental dynamics of a market, but how deeply do they think about the
   interplay of such fundamentals and what frameworks do they use in such
   thinking? How do business schools teach managers to think this way ? The
   premise of this article is that in their strategizing, senior marketing
   executives, boards of directors, consultants, and financial analysts
   should see the market and the firm's embeddedness in a market as a
   moving video rather than a static snapshot. The authors propose that
   what makes the video move are fundamental feedback effects that create
   the evolutionary paths that a market and a firm mar travel. A taxonomy
   of systemic feedback regularities is presented with applications that
   demonstrate how the taxonomy and proposed soft mapping techniques can be
   used to construct dynamic mental models that help managers and
   consultants improve their dynamic strategic thinking and the strategic
   foresight of firms.

   on the unit's satisfaction and performance. S ales unit refers to a set
   of salespersons working out of the same office and for the same
   supervisor, and heterogeneity refers to salespersons' dispersion or
   variance on key dimensions. Specifically, drawing on theories in social
   psychology, the authors study the influence of sales unit heterogeneity
   in terms of (1) demographic characteristics (e.g., gender dispersion),
   (2) skills and rewards (e.g., reward dispersion), and (3) goal
   orientations (e.g., learning orientation dispersion) on a sales unit's
   performance and job satisfaction levels. The hypotheses developed are
   tested using data from a study involving 476 salespeople belonging to
   105 sales units in a large organization. The authors find that the focal
   heterogeneity variables account for nearly 25 percent of the total
   variance explained by the full set of independent variables included in
   the model.

AB A growing concern among international marketing managers is how to
   increase the market orientation and thereby performance of their
   transnational organizations. This study broaches this issue by
   investigating how the marketing concept, the heart of the market
   orientation, may be established in a multinational setting and the
   effects of national culture on that process. From a wide array of
   literature, the authors construct a theoretical framework and
   propositions on how global organizations may transform this philosophy
   from an abstract platitude to an operational reality. Their findings
   suggest that the process consists of complex, interdependent
   steps-interpretation, adoption, and implementation of the marketing
   concept. Cultural values shape interpretation and facilitate or impede
   adoption and implementation. The overall framework and findings can be
   used to guide institutionalization of the marketing concept across the
   organizational span, in particular by anticipating culture-based
   reactions from international subsidiaries.

AB This research investigates the impact of selling strategies on selling
   effectiveness. The authors compare two selling strategies: (1) an agenda
   strategy, in which a salesperson attempts to influence the structure of
   the buyer's decision by suggesting constraints that eliminate
   competitive products from consideration, and (2) a more typical selling
   strategy that summarizes the target product's benefits. The results show
   that when sellers use an agenda selling strategy, target products
   receive higher evaluations and have higher probabilities of being

   agenda strategy in most cases having more impact on novice buyers than
   on expert buyers. These findings demonstrate the importance of selling
   strategy to selling effectiveness, suggest the potential benefit for
   sellers of using selling strategies that attempt to influence the
   structure of the buyer's decision, and provide support for the
   contingent nature of selling effectiveness.

AB A multidimensional approach for accuracy of ratings is introduced that
   examines consumers' abilities to assess various brands across a set of
   attributes and attribute performances across a set of brands. A model is
   presented that addresses the roles of the relevancy of information,
   attribute-relationship schemata, and consumers' product category
   experience on the accuracy of their brand attribute ratings. Study
   participants were provided either with relevant or irrelevant attribute
   information for various automobile brands and Eater asked to rate the
   attribute performances of brands. The results indicate that the
   provision of relevant information in the judgment environment increases
   brand and attribute rating accuracy but does not favorably affect
   consumers' brand attribute-relationship schemata. Rather consumers'
   product experience was directly related to their attribute-relationship
   schemata, which in turn were related to improved accuracy of brand and
   attribute ratings.

AB This study examines the impact of transformational and transactional
   leader behaviors on the sales performance and organizational citizenship
   behaviors of salespeople, as well as the mediating role played by trust
   and role ambiguity in that process. Measures of six forms of
   transformational leader behavior two forms of transactional leader
   behavior trust, and role ambiguity were obtained from 477 sales agents
   working for a large national insurance company. Objective sales
   performance data were obtained for the agents, and their supervisors
   provided evaluations of their citizenship behaviors. The findings
   validate not only the basic notion that transformational leadership
   influences salespeople to perform "above and beyond the call of duty"
   but also that transformational leader behaviors actually have stronger
   direct and indirect relationships with sales performance and
   organizational citizenship behavior than transactional leader behaviors.
   Moreover this is true even when common method biases are controlled The
   implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

   in the marketing literature. Two central and interrelated aspects of
   collective learning are organizational culture and memory. The
   relationship between culture and performance has been demonstrated both
   theoretically and empirically. This study investigates the influence of
   culture and organizational memory development on perceptions of
   managers' decision-making context. Findings suggest that both
   organizational culture and memory influence marketing managers'
   perceptions of decision-making context. Specifically, managers in
   externally focused cultures tend to perceive a relatively higher
   proportion of strategic problems than managers in internally focused
   cultures, and managers in organic process cultures tend to perceive a
   relatively higher proportion of unstructured problems than managers in
   mechanistic cultures. The implications for managerial practice are
   discussed and avenues for future research outlined.

   initiating fundamental changes in organizational form and practice.
   These restructuring efforts are having significant effects on the
   organization and management of work within customer firms. However these
   important changes have been largely ignored in the extant marketing
   literature. The research presented in this article first describes a
   general theory of the effects of organizational downsizing. Then, it
   examines the potential effects of downsizing on buying center structure
   and purchase participant characteristics. Findings support several of
   the hypotheses related to the proposed effects of organizational

AB The primary emphasis of previous research concerning salespeople has
   been focused on their attitudes and behavior: The relationship between
   organizational variables and salesperson attitudes and behavior has
   received very limited attention. Sales territory design is largely
   uncontrollable by the salesperson, yet is acknowledged by managers and
   researchers as an important factor enabling salespeople to perform well.
   The objective is to examine satisfaction with territory design from the
   perspective of the salesperson. A conceptual model and hypotheses are
   developed linking the satisfaction with territory design with role
   ambiguity, intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, and performance. Role
   conflict, met expectations, organizational commitment, and intention to
   leave are also included in the model. Survey results provide strong
   support for 19 of the 21 hypotheses examined. The findings offer
   significant insights concerning the role of territory design
   satisfaction in face-to-face selling and its consequences. Several
   managerial implications and avenues for future research are discussed.

AB More businesses than ever are using telemarketing as a complement to or
   substitute for face-to-face selling. More businesses than ever are also
   selling services in lieu of selling goods. Yet, despite these trends, no
   empirical research has documented the relative effectiveness of
   telesales versus face-to-face presentations for selling goods versus
   services. The author begins to fill this void in the literature by
   presenting an initial investigation into the effects of modality
   (telesales vs. face-to-face presentation) and offering (a service vs. a
   good) on consumer recall, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. The
   findings reveal that recall is higher in a face-to-face presentation,
   attitudes and behavioral intentions are more positive following a
   telesales presentation for a service, and attitudes and behavioral
   intentions for a good are unaffected by the nature of the sales
   presentation. Implications of the findings for research, business
   practice, and future study are discussed.

AB This study applied Hofstede's typology to examine the effect of culture
   on ethical sensitivity toward various stake-holders. It was found that
   uncertainty avoidance had a positive effect and that power distance and
   individualism/ masculinity had negative effects on ethical sensitivity.
   The results also indicated that ethical sensitivity to stakeholder
   interests is dependent on which stakeholder is affected. Although
   Americans and Taiwanese sales agents were equally sensitive to customer
   interests, the Taiwanese were more sensitive to the interests of their
   company and a competitor bur were less sensitive to the interests of a
   colleague. This study should prove valuable to international marketers
   because the cultural typology allows managers to identify differences in
   work-related values of employees across different nationalities and thus
   provides a theoretical base for designing more effective sales
   management practices.

AB This article examines the historical evolution of the relationships
   among brands, consumers, and resellers in a world increasingly dominated
   by very large retail organizations with substantial power within the
   marketing channel. It is widely believed that manufacturers' brands are
   becoming less important as major retailers are becoming more powerful.
   This view is based on the mistaken assumption that brands are
   relationships with consumers, not resellers. Arguments about the decline
   of brands are often confused with arguments about changes in the brand
   management function. As major firms redefine their customer as the
   reseller; not the consumer there are substantial implications for brand
   management and the role of the brand manager Marketing strategy
   implementation will require increasingly careful coordination of
   marketing programs with sales strategy to achieve the necessary
   coordination of reseller- and consumer-targeted communications to
   maximize the value of the brand to both the retailer and the end user.

   To keep this edge over rivals, who continually try to attract these
   customers away, a firm has to master the three elements of a
   market-relating capability. First a relationship orientation must
   pervade the mind-set, values, and norms of the organization. Second, the
   firm must keep deepening its knowledge of these customers and putting it
   to work through out the organization. Third, the key processes must be
   internally integrated and externally aligned with the corresponding
   processes of the firm's customers.

   the embodiment of information technology in new products, globalization,
   and the increasing concentration and interdependence of industries. New
   rules to succeed in these markets depend on (I) an understanding of the

   profitable, customer-focused action. This article looks at market
   calibration including the development of new stimuli, measures, and
   models, lr then takes the results of that calibration to show how firms
   in the new millennium can focus marketing action not only on a well
   targeted marketing mix that has historically been the focus of marketing

AB The purpose of this article is to discuss two approaches to being market
   oriented-a market-driven approach and a driving-markets approach. Market
   driven refers to a business orientation that is based on understanding
   and reacting to the preferences and behaviors of players within a given
   market structure. Driving markets, on the other hand, implies
   influencing the structure of the market and/or the behavior(s) of market
   players in a direction that enhances the competitive position of the
   business. There are three generic ways of changing the structure of a
   marker: (I) eliminating players in a market (deconstruction approach),
   (2) building a new or modified set of players in a market (construction
   approach), and (3) changing the functions performed by players
   (functional modification approach). Market behavior can be modified
   directly or alternatively, indirectly by changing the mind-set of market
   players (e.g., customers, competitors, and other stakeholders).

   propose that just as the marketing function gradually shifted from mass
   marketing to segmented marketing in the twentieth century, it will
   increasingly move reward customer-centric marketing in the next century.
   In the practice of customer-centric marketing, the marketing function
   seeks to fulfill the needs and wants of each individual customer The
   antecedents of customer-centric marketing are the increasing pressure on
   firms to improve marketing productivity, increasing market diversity in
   household and business markets, and technology applicability. On the
   basis of the shift toward customer-centric marketing, the authors expect
   increased importance of marketing as a "supply management" function,
   customer outsourcing, cocreation marketing, fixed-cost marketing, and
   customer-centric organizations. This article highlights the implications
   of customer-centric marketing as well as the boundary conditions that

   (3) defensive effects; (4) the link between perceived service quality
   and purchase intentions; (5) customer and segment profitability; and (6)
   key service drivers of service quality customer retention, and

   questions needing answers. The article is organized around a conceptual

AB Critics have suggested that delighting the customer "raises the bar" of
   customer expectations, making it more difficult to satisfy the customer
   in the next purchase cycle and hurting the firm in the long run. The
   authors explore this issue by using a mathematical model of delight,
   based on assumptions gathered from the customer satisfaction literature.
   Although delighting the customer heightens repurchase expectations and
   makes satisfying the customer more difficult in the future, and the
   delighting firm is injured by raised customer expectations, the
   (nondelighting) competition is hurt worse through customer attrition to
   the delighting firm. If customers forget delighting incidents to some
   degree from occasion to occasion, the delighting firm suffers if it is
   in a position to take customers from the competition. If taking
   customers from the competition is difficult, the delighting firm
   actually benefits from customer forgetting, because the same delighting
   experience can be repeated again, with the same effect.

   that members in the loyalty reward program overlook or discount negative

   relationship between suppliers and customers. During the past 15 years,
   a body of scholarship on antecedents and consequences of market
   orientation has emerged. But what is the appropriate level of market
   orientation, and what happens when customers and suppliers disagree
   about the appropriate level of a supplier's market orientation? To what
   extent does such disagreement concerning market orientation affect the
   customer-supplier relationship ? Do answers to these questions vary by
   country? The authors examine these issues using data from a survey of
   leading Japanese and U.S. business firms and their key customers that
   employed a unique matched supplier-customer sampling methodology. The
   authors report several interesting results.

   continuously generate intelligence about customers' expressed and latent
   needs, and about how to satisfy those needs, is essential for it to
   continuously create superior customer value. However intelligence
   generation typically has been treated as a generic firm activity The

   primary research with 14 mature, high-performance service companies,
   makes a case for service branding as a cornerstone of services marketing
   for today and tomorrow. The article presents a service-branding model
   that underscores the salient role of customers' service experiences in
   brand formation. Four primary strategies that excellent service firms
   use to cultivate brand equity are discussed and illustrated. Branding is
   nor just for tangible goods; it is a principal success driver for

AB Service encounters are critical in all industries, including those that
   have nor been traditionally defined as service industries. The
   increasing deployment of technology is altering the essence of service
   encounters formerly anchored in a "low-tech, high-touch" paradigm. This
   article explores the changing nature of service, with an emphasis on how
   encounters can be improved through the effective use of technology. The
   authors examine the ability of technology to effectively (1) customize
   service offerings, (2) recover from service failure, and (3)
   spontaneously delight customers. The infusion of technology is examined
   as an enabler of both employees and customers in efforts to achieve
   these three goals. Although the infusion of technology can lead to
   negative outcomes and may not be embraced by all customers, the focus of
   this article is on the benefits of thoughtfully managed and effectively
   implemented technology applications. Past research and industry examples
   are featured and future research directions and managerial implications
   are highlighted.

AB The authors propose a framework for understanding key mechanisms that
   shape satisfaction in individual encounters, and loyalty across ongoing
   exchanges. In particular the framework draws together two distinct
   approaches: (I) agency theory, rooted in the economic approach, that
   views relational exchanges as encounters between principals (consumers)
   and agents (service providers) and (2) trust research that adopts a
   psychological approach toward consumer-provider relationships. In so
   doing, the authors specify how trust mechanisms cooperate and compete
   with agency mechanisms to affect satisfaction in individual encounters
   and influence loyalty in the long run. Because a multidimensional
   conceptualization of trust is used, the hypothesized framework offers a
   fine-grained understanding of the interrelated mechanisms. The high
   level of specificity allows extraction of multiple propositions,
   facilitates empirical testing and encourages theoretical development of
   the proposed model. Several directions to guide future research are
   provided.

AB There has been growing interest in the future of marketing and changes
   in marketing's organization and role within the firm. However there has
   not been research that holistically explores key changes in marketing
   organization. The authors draw on qualitative interviews with 50
   managers in the United States and Germany and argue that changes in
   marketing organization that have been discussed in isolation are part of
   a more general shift toward customer-focused organizational structures.
   They initially discuss two specific changes related to the overall
   shift: changes concerning primary marketing coordinators and increasing
   dispersion of marketing activities. They then introduce the concept of a
   customer-focused organizational structure that uses groups of customers
   as the primary basis for structuring the organization. They identify
   typical organizational transitions as firms move toward a
   customer-focused organizational structure and discuss the challenges
   firms face in making this transition. They conclude with implications
   for academic research, managerial practice, and business school

   internal volatility (turbulence within an organization) in shaping
   manifest conflict Based on a large-scale, multi-informant empirical

AB This research examines the role of team-based superordinate identity in
   influencing new product performance. The author also studies how several
   team-related factors affect superordinate identity and, through this
   psychological bond, influence new product performance. The findings,
   based on a sample of 118 teams, reveal that superordinate identity
   indeed enhances the performance of the new product developed by a team.
   Traditional group factors such as task interdependence and physical
   proximity do not play any role in influencing either superordinate
   identity or new product performance. Team longevity improves
   superordinate identity but has no effect on new product performance.
   Instead, a special team structure (i.e., high autonomy and outcome
   interdependence) improves both superordinate identity and new product
   performance. If interdepartmental connectedness in the firm is high,
   there is a reduced need for high autonomy in the team. Finally, the
   characteristics of the special team structure influence new product
   performance only through superordinate identity.

   ethical norms, and the nature of selling practices as communicated by
   the firm. Both first- and second-order levels of abstraction are
   validated. Relationships with role stress, job satisfaction, and

   unique from previous attempts in its scope, intended purpose (marketing

   qualitative study, the authors first develop a generalizable typology of
   quality dimensions for durable goods that includes ease of use,
   versatility, durability, serviceability, performance, and prestige.
   Second, the authors conduct a process-tracing laboratory experiment to
   examine how key marketing variables-price, brand name, and product
   attributes-affect consumers' judgment processes and inferences about how
   products perform on the six quality dimensions. Results of the
   experiment indicate that consumers use price and brand name differently
   to judge the quality dimensions, searching for price and brand name much
   more frequently when evaluating prestige than when evaluating any other
   quality dimension. Results suggest that managers must determine the
   relevant quality dimensions for a product category and the cues that ave
   salient for judging those dimensions.

   they examine the implementation of a personal-banker strategy as a means
   to developing customer relationships in the retail banking industry. The
   authors show that an "excellent" personal banker can increase overall
   customer satisfaction and loyalty compared to customers who do not have
   a personal banket: However a poorly performing personal banker can
   result in lower overall customer satisfaction and loyalty than if no

   the link between the interfirm power-influence process and relational

   highlighting (a) the moderating effects of channel climate on the
   interfirm power-influence process and (b) the main effect of influence
   strategies on a relational exchange element, solidarity of a dyad.
   Specifically, the author proposes that channel climate, as manifested by
   dyadic trust and dyadic relationship continuity, moderates (a) the link
   between asymmetry of interfirm power and the use of influence strategies
   and (b) the reciprocation of influence strategies. In turn, the use of
   influence strategies is posited to affect solidarity of a dyad. The
   results of hypotheses' tests, based on the analysis of industrial

   of dyadic trust and dyadic relationship continuity and(b)fully confirm

AB This article develops and validates measures of intergenerational
   communication and influence about consumption. Despite the widespread
   belief that parents play a pivotal role in the consumer socialization of
   their children, empirical research on the skills, attitudes, and
   preferences transmitted from one generation to the next is quite
   limited. One factor that may explain this deficiency is the lack of
   appropriate instruments for assessing intergenerational issues. Drawing
   on consumer socialization theory and research, intergenerational
   transmission is defined in terms of three components directly relevant
   to marketplace transactions: (1) consumer skills, (2) preferences, and
   (3) attitudes toward marketer-supplied information. Multi-item scales
   are developed to measure each of these components. The findings of three
   studies supporting the reliability, dimensionality, and validity of the

AB As a means of enhancing consumer understanding of nutritional
   information, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires
   the provision of percentage daily values (%DVs) on food labels. Findings
   from existing research, however vary in their support for the assumption
   that including %DVs will assist consumers in their efforts to comprehend
   nutritional information. To shed further light on this issue, the
   present study examines the moderating role of consumer knowledge about
   how to use %DVs in evaluating a product's healthiness. The results
   indicate that the usefulness of providing %DVs on a nutritional label
   depends strongly on this form of knowledge. Implications for public
   policy and directions for future research efforts are presented.

AB The organization of interfirm exchanges has become of critical
   importance in today's business environment. Many scholars have
   criticized the inadequacies of legal contracts as mechanisms for
   governing exchange, especially in the face of uncertainty and
   dependence. Other scholars argue that it is not the contracts per se but
   the social contexts in which they are embedded that determine their
   effectiveness. This study investigates the performance implications of
   governance structures involving contractual agreements and relational
   social norms, individually and in combination (plural form) under
   varying conditions and forms of transactional uncertainty and
   relationship-specific adaptation. Hypotheses are developed and tested on
   a sample of 396 buyer-seller relationships. The results provide support
   for the plural form thesis-increasing the relational content of a
   governance structure containing contractual agreements enhances
   performance when transactional uncertainty is high, but not when it is
   low. Implications for theory and future research are discussed.

   and brand associations combined with brand awareness. These dimensions
   are then related to brand equity. The empirical tests using a structural
   equation model support the research hypotheses. The results show that
   frequent price promotions, such as price deals, are related to low brand
   equity, whereas high advertising spending, high price good store image,
   and high distribution intensity are related to high brand equity.

AB Research on relational exchange has focused primarily on long-term, or
   "enduring," relational exchange. The evolutionary model of relationship
   development that is the foundation for much of the research on enduring
   relational exchange lacks applicability for short-term, or
   "interimistic," relational exchange. Interimistic relational exchange is
   defined as a close, collaborative, fast-developing, short-lived exchange
   relationship in which companies pool their skills and/or resources to
   address a transient albeit important, business opportunity and/or
   threat. Because interimistic exchange relationships must quickly become
   functional and have a short life, these relationships have less time to
   fully develop the relational governance mechanisms assumed in the
   evolutionary model. Therefore, interimistic relational exchange appears
   to rely more on nonrelational mechanisms than does enduring relational
   exchange. This article (1) examines how interimistic relational exchange
   governance differs from that of enduring relational exchange and (2)
   develops propositions for further research on interimistic relational
   exchange.

   limited empirical evidence. The authors investigate the relationship
   between two focal constructs in the debate: market orientation and
   product innovation. On the basis of a sample of U.S. manufacturing
   companies, the authors' analysis shows that product innovation varies
   with market orientation. Specifically, (1) customer orientation
   increases the introduction of new-to-the-world products and reduces the
   launching of me-too products, (2) competitor orientation increases the
   introduction of me-too products and reduces the launching of line
   extensions and new-to-the-world products, and (3) interfunctional
   coordination increases the launching of line extensions and reduces the
   introduction of me-too products.

AB Are consumers more likely to select brands offered by companies that
   engage in cause-related marketing (CRM)? Somewhat surprisingly, little
   evidence exists that directly addresses this issue. Accordingly, the
   present examination investigates whether and when CRM efforts influence
   consumer choice. The results from several studies indicate that
   information regarding a company's support of social causes can affect
   choice. However CRM's influence on choice is found to depend on the
   perceived motivation underlying the company's CRM efforts as well as
   whether consumers must trade off company sponsorship of causes for lower
   performance or higher price. The results also indicate that CRM cues
   affect choice primarily through compensatory strategies involving
   trade-offs rather than through noncompensatory strategies. Implications
   of the current findings for existing theory are discussed along with
   directions for future research.

AB Although slotting fees and introductory allowances have become well
   established in the grocery and other industries, they remain a source of
   controversy among channel members. Retailers claim that these fees and
   allowances help mitigate the risks associated with new-product
   acceptance. Manufacturers counter that retailers are abusing slotting
   fees and allowances by using them as a source of profit The authors
   investigate this controversy by empirically examining the role of
   slotting fees and allowances in the retail buyers' product acceptance
   decision process. Results provide evidence to suggest that introductory
   allowances are indeed being used by retailers in the sample to offset
   perceived risks and costs of carrying new products. However findings

   contextual effects in the development and outcomes of strategic
   integration in industrial distribution channels. A survey of industrial
   equipment distributors revealed that dependence, flexibility, continuity
   expectations, and relationship age encouraged the distributor's
   strategic integration of its supplier relationship. In addition,
   strategic integration enhanced distributor financial performance.
   However uncertainty did not play a role in the distributors' strategic

   effects of gender, religiosity, education, experience, salary, and

   and relativism decreases PMI in four ethical scenarios. PMI increases
   perceptions of ethical problems, which reduce intentions to act
   unethically. The study tests whether relationships between variables are
   direct or mediated by intervening variables, revealing that PMI has
   direct as well as indirect effects on intentions. Intentions are also
   influenced by gender: women have more ethical intentions than men, on
   average, and this effect is not mediated by other variables in the
   model.

   consumers according to their variety-seeking needs, researchers have
   established some interesting results regarding the variation in

   segmentation thus far has been unidimensional (e.g., high- and
   low-variety seekers). This research discusses a unique way to segment
   consumers based not only on the usual extent (or mean) of variety
   seeking but also on the intensity (or consistency) of variety-seeking

AB A number of researchers have reported the positive benefits of creating
   and maintaining a market orientation. This study is one of the first to
   explicitly investigate the effects of marker orientation within a
   channel context. It is proposed that a supplier's perceptions of a
   reseller's market orientation will positively affect the supplier's
   perceptions of certain key relationship marketing constructs. Data
   collected from 380 suppliers were used to test the hypotheses. All
   hypotheses were supported.

AB Since being recognized as a separate field of inquiry over 75 years ago,
   marketing has made enormous strides in terms of becoming a scholarly
   discipline. Marketing scholars have used scientific approaches to
   discover and document a number of regularities pertaining to consumer
   behavior and marketing exchanges. Many regularities that have been
   empirically validated have achieved the status of "lawlike
   generalizations." In this article, the authors first classify these
   generalizations into four categories: location centric, time centric,
   market centric, and competition centric. They then argue that each
   category is now being affected by at least one major contextual
   discontinuity that is likely to challenge the relevance, if not
   validity, of these well-accepted lawlike generalizations. The authors
   also identify important questions stemming from these discontinuities
   and issue a call for further research to discover new insights and
   paradigms.

   managers' evaluations of their sales personnel's performance and to
   examine whether the impact of OCBs on performance evaluations is greater
   at higher levels of the sales organization hierarchy. Two samples were

   agents and a sample of 161 agency managers. Objective measures of sales
   productivity were obtained for both samples along with evaluations of
   three dimensions of OCBs and an assessment of overall performance. The
   results indicate that managers' evaluations are determined at least as
   much by OCBs as they are by objective measures of performance. After
   partialing our common method variance, the results also indicate that
   OCBs account for a greater proportion of a sales manager's evaluation

AB Can point-of-purchase (POP) displays cause a decrease in sales of the
   featured brand? In an actual test-market promotion, the use of special
   POP displays led to a decrease in sales of featured wines from a
   specific U.S. region. Moreover sales of regularly shelved wines from
   competitive regions actually increased. The results of a laboratory
   experiment supported the explanation that the POP displays essentially
   reorganized the wines into region categories within the stores, making
   it easier for consumers to compare alternatives by region. As a result,
   sales of wines from preferred regions increased and sales of wines from
   disliked regions decreased relative to when the wines were displayed by
   variety categories on regular shelf space. Further evidence indicated
   that reorganizing products by levels of a given attribute influences
   purchase likelihoods mainly when the attribute is otherwise low rather
   than high in salience and when brands have normally high rather than low
   purchase likelihoods.

   comprehensible quantitative nutrition information that would allow
   consumers to make more informed food choices that could result in
   significant long-term health benefits. This study (1) examines how
   accurately consumers can use nutrient information in the facts panel to
   determine ifa product has more or less than the recommended daily values
   of certain nutrients and (2) offers predictions and tests of the
   relationships between this usage ability and product nutrition
   evaluations and purchase intentions. Results show that more accurate use
   moderates the effect of product nutrition value on consumer evaluations,
   as predicted. Findings also reveal that several variables (e.g.,
   measures of nutrition knowledge, attitude toward the "facts" label) are
   related to accuracy in the usage task. Implications based on these
   findings are offered.

   specificity) is an antecedent of joint action in manufacturer-supplier
   relationships. The authors build on prior research to identify several
   variables that moderate the effect of manufacturer asset specificity on
   joint action. Drawing from transaction cost analysis and relational
   exchange theory, the authors propose a conceptual model that explicates
   the moderating role of three contextual variables: specific asset
   investments by the supplier (reciprocal asset investments), manufacturer
   decision-making uncertainty, and manufacturer trust in the supplier.
   Consistent with their hypotheses, results from a survey of firms in
   three SIC codes show that decision-making uncertainty and trust enhance
   the effect of manufacturer asset specificity on joint action. Contrary
   to expectation, however the moderating effect of reciprocal asset
   investments was nor significant. Theoretical and managerial implications
   of the results are discussed.

   article, the authors examine the complex issue of trade promotion use

   promotions can produce dissimilar types of channel cooperation, consumer
   responses, and postpromotion channel member behavior resulting in
   differences in distribution-programming preferences between suppliers
   and retailers. The authors argue that the adjudication of these
   different preference structures is addressed through the market power of

AB This study addressed the ill-understood issue of how loyalty develops in
   service patrons. Although many theorists hold commitment to be an
   essential part of this process, the link between commitment and loyalty
   has received little empirical attention. To address this void, the study
   first portrayed commitment's root tendency to resist changing preference
   as a function of three antecedent processes. Second, this portrayal
   formed the basis for developing a psychometrically sound scale to
   measure the construct of commitment. Third, the scale was then used in a
   mediating effects model (M-E-M) to test the commitment-loyalty link.
   Path analyses found this parsimonious structure to be a significant
   improvement over rival direct effects models (D-E-Ms). Results found the
   tendency to resist changing preference to be a key precursor to loyalty,
   largely explained by a patron's willingness to identify with a brand.
   Implications of these findings for loyalty's development and research
   are explored.

   concerns should be given more attention, particularly in TA research.
   Three recommendations are made for implementing these concerns: (1)
   consumer behavior articles should be required to have a section
   indicating how increased levels of external validity can be obtained
   with other studies, (2) "joint ventures" between consumer behavior and
   marketing science researchers can be profitable and should be
   encouraged, and (3) analyses of electronic scanner panel data or other
   secondary data can be used to generate higher levels of external
   validity. Three examples are given from the marketing literature of how
   findings from experiments and scanner data can be combined to advance a

AB The authors have distinguished between two broad types of research:
   studies dedicated to development and testing of theoretical explanations
   and studies seeking to generalize observed effects to settings of
   interest. Winer (1999 [this issue]) argues that the goal of making
   research conducted by marketing academics more relevant can be served by
   coupling theory studies with effects studies. Outcomes observed in the
   former type of study would gain external validity from the latter While
   this notion has much intuitive appeal, the authors believe it is flawed.
   Generalizing the effects obtained in theory testing research by
   conducting additional effects studies using realistic data, such as
   scanner data, fails to take into account that theoretical explanation is
   not inherent in any set of data. An alternative view is offered in this
   article in which theoretical explanation serves as the basis for solving
   real-world problems and is the appropriate focus of business school
   education.

AB Winer (1999 [this issue]) proposes that external validity concerns
   require more attention in theoretical research. The author argues that
   one cannot "enhance" external validity by choosing one method over
   another External validity can only be "assessed" by better understanding
   how the focal variables in one's theory interact with moderator
   variables that are seen as irrelevant early in a research stream.
   Findings from single real-world settings and specific sets of "real"
   people are no more likely to generalize than are findings from single
   laboratory settings with student subjects. Both the laboratory and real
   world vary in background facets of subject characteristics, setting,
   context relevant "history," and time. It is only when these facets vary
   and we see how they interact that understanding of external validity is
   enhanced. For this to happen, the observable "background" factors have
   to be conceptualized in terms of more general constructs and
   incorporated as moderators into the researcher's theory Enriched
   theory-not method-confers confidence in our understanding of whether
   effects will be robust or highly contingent. To map this knowledge to
   some specific substantive system requires an added step of understanding
   the mapping from observables in that system onto theoretical constructs.
   The author proposes "friendly amendments" to Winer's three proposals to
   pursue a better understanding of external validity through theory.

   the authors develop an organizing framework to serve as a roadmap for
   assessing research in marketing strategy. Their assessment of the state
   of the field based on a review of extant literature suggests that
   significant strides in conceptual development and empirical research
   have been achieved in a number of areas. Several recent developments in
   the business world, including deconglomeration and increased
   organizational focus on managing and leveraging market-based assets such
   as brand equity and customer equity, suggest that marketing is likely to
   play a mom important role in charting the strategic direction of the
   firm. However, the theoretical contributions of the field to the
   academic dialogue on strategy leave much to be desired.

AB Strategy theorists share (I) the view that the strategic imperative of a
   firm should be sustained, superior financial performance and (2) the
   belief that this goal can be achieved through a sustainable competitive
   advantage in the marketplace. Neoclassical perfect competition and
   traditional industrial organization economics, however; imply that the
   sustained performance goal advocated by strategy theorists is
   anticompetitive and its achievement presumptively detrimental to social
   welfare. This article addresses the strategy-is-anticompetitive thesis
   with the goal of grounding strategy in a theory of
   competition-resource-advantage theory-that does not imply that the
   strategic imperative and its achievement are presumptively
   anticompetitive and antisocial. As such, this article initiates a
   discussion of the public policy implications of resource-advantage
   theory.

AB A traditional assumption concerning how prices influence buyers'
   purchasing behaviors has been that buyers know the prices of the
   products and services that they consider for purchase. However,
   empirical research during the past four decades repeatedly has
   discovered that buyers often are not able to remember the prices of
   items they had recently purchased. One conclusion that has been drawn is
   that buyers often do not attend to price information in purchase
   decisions. The authors argue that this conclusion may be incorrect in
   that what consumers can explicitly remember is not always a good
   indicator of what they implicitly know. Price information not
   consciously remembered can still influence internal reference prices and
   product evaluations. In this article, the authors discuss the conceptual
   and methodological ramifications of the distinction between remembering
   and knowing to reassess and refine our understanding of how buyers
   process and use price information.

   is to provide a perspective opt how, channels research should proceed in

   management is changing as a result of the increased attention on
   long-term, buyer-seller relationships and identify some implications of
   these changes. Changes in the traditional personal selling and sales
   management activities are needed to support the emergence of the
   partnering role for salespeople. For salespeople in the partnering role,
   the personal selling shifts from a focus on influencing buyer behavior
   to managing the conflict inherent in buyer-seller relationships. The
   emphasis on building relationships rather than making short-term sales
   and the use of sales teams dictates changes in the way firms select
   train, evaluate, and compensate salespeople and members of sales teams.
   In this article, the authors have suggested some issues concerning the
   emerging partnering role for salespeople that deserve the attention of
   scholars interested in personal selling and sales management research.

   Lanham Act, will influence the manner in which marketing is practiced
   well into the twenty-first century. Although the FTDA is specifically
   concerned with protecting famous trademarks from being diluted-either by
   having their distinctiveness diminished or positive associations
   tarnished-by similar trademarks, its influence will not be limited to
   trademark or branding issues. Implications range from the allocation of
   advertising resources to the increased use of marketing research.

AB A conceptual model of preventive health care behavior is proposed and
   tested. Results suggest that preventive health care behaviors are
   strongly influenced by the value consumers perceive in engaging in such
   actions. This value is greatly affected by response efficacy, or the
   person's belief that a specific action will mitigate the health threat.
   A separate consideration affecting adherence to a prescribed preventive
   health care behavior is self-efficacy, or the person's belief that the
   target behaviors can be enacted. Additionally health motivation and
   health consciousness are also shown to influence preventive health care
   behaviors. Future research directions and managerial implications of the
   findings are outlined.

   Literatures such as social identity theory are used to propose
   hypotheses that are tested using a hazard rate model on archival data
   pertaining to 7,798 members of an art museum. The results indicate that
   the hazard of lapsing is lowered with increasing duration, participation
   in special interest groups whose goals are related to those of the focal
   organization, gift frequency, and increasing interrenewal times.
   Conversely, members who have downgraded their membership level in the
   past, those who have participated in special interest groups whose goals
   are unrelated to those of the focal organization, and those who received
   their membership as a gift are more likely to lapse.

   century is to meet customers' needs over time better than the
   competition by offering a high-variety product line. More variety in a
   product line can make it more likely that each consumer finds exactly
   the option he or she desires (customization strategy). In addition, more
   variety in a product line can allow each consumer to enjoy a diversity
   of options over time (variety-seeking strategy). Other issues such as
   profitability, cost considerations, how much variety to offer and where
   in the delivery chain to offer it, and when does too much variety cause
   confusion or overload are also discussed.

AB It is generally claimed that brand names are a corporate asset with an
   economic value that creates wealth for a firm's shareholders. However
   the scholarly literature has neither provided a comprehensive
   theoretical basis for this claim nor documented an empirical
   relationship between brand value and shareholder value. This exploratory
   study describes a rationale for and documents, the statistical strength
   and functional form of a brand value-shareholder value relationship for
   publicly held consumer goods companies in the United States. A
   theoretical argument supportive of a positive relationship between a
   firm's accumulated brand value and market-to-book (M/B) ratio was
   empirically validated. However even though firms with higher accumulated
   brand values have higher M/B ratios, the functional form of the
   relationship was found to be concave with decreasing returns to scale.
   Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are out-lined,
   as well as study limitations and directions for future research.

AB A measure of consumers' attitude toward private label brands is
   developed and its psychometric properties are assessed. Predictions are
   then tested regarding relationships between private label attitude and
   (1) latent perceptual and sales promotion constructs, and (2) purchase
   behaviors measured in a field setting The measure is positively related
   to value consciousness, deal proneness and smart-shopper
   self-perceptions, and negatively related to the propensity to be brand
   loyal and hold price-quality perceptions. Predictive validity of the
   private label measure is supported by a positive relationship with
   private label purchases from a grocery store shopping trip. Despite a
   positive relationship between the latent constructs of private label
   attitude and deal proneness, the consumer segment that allocated a high
   percentage of total purchases to private label products made fewer
   purchases on sale or with a coupon. These findings suggest that
   consumers may choose between price-related deals and private label

AB High-risk sports, such as skydiving, parachuting, and hang gliding, have
   become increasingly popular in recent years. This article uses
   expectancy-value theory to integrate previous research on risky behavior
   and risky sports. The model that is developed relates the expected
   benefits of risky sports to several antecedents; specifically, thrill
   and adventure seeking, arousal avoidance, role relaxation, and age. Two
   samples are drawn to represent the general population, as well as people
   just joining risky-sports clubs. In the general population, the
   intention to engage in risky sports is related to the ability to arouse
   curiosity. Other motives, specifically thrill and adventure seeking,
   become more salient as an individual moves closer to actually engaging
   in a risky sport.

AB Although previous research provides a foundation for developing,
   maintaining, and exiting relationships, the extant literature has yet to
   consider the influence that patterns of economic and social forces have
   in guiding the future of deteriorating relationships. To understand
   better and respond to relationships in decline and to salvage
   relationships that are destined to fail needlessly, the authors use the
   political economic paradigm to identify symptoms of deteriorating
   relationships and provide a framework for combining relational forces
   that best guides relationship retention decisions. They propose a model
   based on the theoretical foundations of transactional cost analysis
   (TCA), social exchange, and distributive justice. Using relative
   dependence, interdependence, and mutual dependence to define the
   economic and social worth of the relationship, they incorporate dyadic
   patterns of behavior to illustrate similar and different interpretations
   and evaluations of fairness and the impact on relational outcomes. The
   article culminates with managerial implications and directions for

   relationships between family communication and adolescent involvement in
   consumer activity using two measures of family communication, one that
   measures the general quality of communication between parents and
   adolescents, and another that measures the frequency of
   consumption-specific communication between parents and adolescents. In
   addition, the perceptions of mothers, fathers, and adolescents are used
   in the analysis. Findings show that the two communication constructs are
   conceptually distinct. Positive relationships between the communication
   constructs and adolescents' consumer activities are found; however the
   presence of significant relationships depends on which individual family
   members' or family member dyads' perceptions are used in the analysis.

AB This article reports the development of a theoretical model of consumer
   complaint behavior by using cognitive appraisal theory as its
   foundation. Because of its importance to management and lack of
   attention in the marketing literature, specific emphasis is placed on
   the phenomenon of noncomplaining and the role of consumer emotion in
   dissatisfying marketplace experiences. The model presents cognitive
   appraisal as the key element in the evaluation of consumer threat and
   harm, which subsequently may result in psychological stress. Stressful
   appraisal outcomes are suggested to elicit emotive reactions that, in
   conjunction with cognitive appraisal, influence the type of coping
   strategy used by the consumer Three coping strategies (problem focused,
   emotion focused, and avoidance) are identified and discussed. Key
   propositions are illustrated by using in-depth interview data fi om a
   sample of older female consumers.

AB The management of quality and development of effective cross-functional
   cooperation have assumed a new strategic importance over the past
   decade. However many companies have reported that quality strategies
   have failed to deliver anticipated performance benefits and that
   ineffective interfunctional relationships may be to blame. This study
   explores marketing-quality interfunctional relationships as a potential
   source of quality strategy implementation failure at the strategic
   business unit (SBU) level. This study focuses on interdepartmental
   connectedness, communication and conflict between marketing and quality,
   and the antecedents and consequences of these dimensions of
   interfunctional interaction. Using data from a pooled response mail
   survey, the results suggest that marketing-quality interactions are
   associated with senior management quality leadership, strategic quality
   planning process, and control system characteristics. Interfunctional
   interactions between marketing and quality are found to be only weakly
   related to relative quality, market performance, and financial
   performance outcomes.

AB Customer satisfaction and service quality measures obtained through
   consumer surveys invariably have skewed distributions. As such,
   researchers have questioned the appropriateness of the popular approach
   of using the mean rating to summarize such data. However, no detailed
   study on this topic has yet been conducted. In two independent studies,
   the relative validity of the various indexes that can be used to
   summarize consumers' service quality ratings (e.g. mean, median, mode,
   kurtosis, skewness, top/bottom-tail percentiles) are examined in Study
   1, using typical commercial survey data from a fast-food/convenience
   retail chain, both the mean and top-box percentiles are found to be the
   best indicators of,service quality, based on their correlation with
   customer-driven business performance measures. In Study 2, the results
   are further confirmed by an extensive simulation that varies factors
   such as the shape of the underlying distribution of customer ratings and
   the strength of the relationship between customer ratings and business
   performance measures. The article concludes with a discussion of the
   findings and implications for future research.

AB Reviewing the marketing strategy implementation issue in an era of a
   weaker marketing paradigm contrasts traditional sequential flow models
   of implementation with the "strategy formulation/implementation
   dichotomy" and leads to the emergence of a processual view of
   implementation. The processual view clarifies the underlying behavioral
   and organizational factors that build strategy implementation
   capabilities. These underlying factors are at risk from a weaker
   marketing paradigm. The weakening of the marketing paradigm is discussed
   in terms of the downsizing and disappearance of the marketing function,
   but more fundamentally in the loss of strategic influence for marketing
   in the face of competing management paradigms such as the "lean
   enterprise" and "lean thinking." The conclusion is that the impact on
   implementation capabilities is being felt first in companies where the
   marketing paradigm has been traditionally weak, but that this may be
   prototypical for other companies in the longer term. A number of
   important areas for conceptual and empirical attention are indentified.

   explore the effect of personality on customer service behavior among
   frontline sales personnel in a fast-food convenience store chain. An
   exploratory qualitative study with customers, store managers, and
   salespeople showed that there was consistency in the trait descriptors
   used to describe superior service providers. Another study validated
   scales that measure the personality constructs (extroversion,
   adjustment, and agreeableness) underlying trait descriptors noted in the
   exploratory study. Finally the results of two studies showed that
   personality does influence customer service and that superior service
   providers tend to be higher in extroversion and agreeableness. The

AB Companies implement preferred supplier programs to reduce their vendor
   relationships to a reasonable few. Consequently, vendors who do not
   effectively manage their customer-based relationships are strong
   candidates for deletion from a customers list of long-term suppliers.
   The emergence of preferred supplier programs suggests that businesses
   are beginning to formally recognize and reward differences between their
   qualified vendors. Vendor stratification is proposed as a framework for
   understanding the evolution of preferred vendor programs. With the
   growing interest in relationship marketing, a study was conducted to
   empirically examine the extent to which businesses use relationship
   quality perceptions to differentiate their qualified vendors. The
   findings support the notion that relationship quality is a higher-order
   construct that can be used as a basis for-developing vendor
   stratification systems. The article concludes with a discussion of the

   impact of affect on attitude formation. The results of Experiment I
   indicate that affect can influence attitudes even in the absence of
   product beliefs. The results of Experiment 2 suggest that affect plays
   as important or more important a role than the belief mechanism in
   attitude formation, depending on the number of repetitions. Implications
   of the results for understanding the role of affect in advertising are
   discussed.

AB This research empirically examines for the first rime the determinants
   of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction (CS/D) in the context of
   business professional services. The simultaneous effect of key CS/D
   constructs (expectations, performance, and disconfirmation) and several
   variables-fairness (equity), purchase situation (novelty, importance,
   and complexity)-and individual-level variables (decision uncertainty and
   stakeholding) are examined in a causal path framework. Data were
   obtained from a two-stage longitudinal survey of client organizations.
   The results indicated substantial support for the hypothesized model,
   The effect of purchase situation and individual level variables (via
   their indirect affects) rivals that of disconfirmation and expectations
   in explaining CS/D. Performance was found to affect CS/D directly but
   not as powerfully as disconfirmation.

AB A general model of satisfaction formation is proposed that extends the
   feminal disconfirmation of expectations model by explicitly
   incorporating the processing of both chosen and nonchosen alternatives,
   Using presidential election data, the results shaw that satisfaction
   with the nonchoice does remain salient in the determination of overall
   postchoice satisfaction. Disconfirmation related to either the chosen or
   the nonchosen alternative influences satisfaction with both the chosen
   and the nonchosen alternative. Overall, the model suggests that the
   nonchoice alternative may continue to be relevant in the satisfaction
   formation process.

   in industrial purchasing decisions. To better understand the criteria
   used to assess physical distribution service quality the authors
   examined the literature on physical distribution and service quality and
   conducted interviews with purchasing managers. Based on the results of
   the literature reviews and interviews, plus a two-step data-gathering
   process, a valid and reliable measurement instrument for perceptions of
   physical distribution service quality (PDSQ) was developed and refined.

AB The existing literature finds that price discrepancy, which represents
   the difference between expected and observed price, helps explain brand
   choice and purchase intention. This effect is often attributed to
   transaction utility, that is, the incremental utility associated with
   the surprise of observing a price lower or higher than expected. This
   research considers the possibility, however that transaction utility is
   a less important determinant of choice when quality is uncertain. We
   propose and find that acquisition utility (perceived value for the
   money) tends to dominate the explanation of purchase intention, but
   transaction utility is significant only when consumers are more certain
   about quality. Our discussion considers the relative role of transaction
   utility in explaining consumer decision making and how the informative
   and allocative roles of price might be distinguished.

AB The marketing environment in the 21st century promises to be knowledge
   rich and very turbulent, The classic, vertically integrated
   multidivisional organization, so successful in the 20th century, is
   unlikely to survive in such an environment. The evidence indicates it
   will be replaced by new forms of network organization consisting of
   large numbers of functionally specialized firms tied together in
   cooperative exchange relationships. This article explores the
   characteristics of four types of network organization that may represent
   prototypes of the dominant organizations of the next century These
   include the internal market network the vertical market network the
   intermarket network, and the opportunity network The economic rationale
   and the types of coordination and control mechanisms driving network
   organizations are very distinct from those studied under the current
   exchange or dyadic paradigm. This article analyses the kinds of changes
   involved in key variables and their meanings in moving from a dyadic
   view of exchange to a network view.

   using strong-tie sources (e.g., friends and family) and weak-tie sources
   (e.g., acquaintances or strangers) of recommendations. The factors used
   in the model are the prior knowledge level of the consumer about the
   product being considered the perceived decision task difficulty level,
   and the type of evaluative cues sought by the consumer Hypotheses are
   tested using data collected in an extensive field study with consumers.
   Two paths or routes Of influence on the use of recommendation sources

   specific process for market-based organizational learning is postulated.
   An empirical test of this model leads the authors to conclude that a
   more positive learning orientation (a value-based construct) will
   directly result in increased market information generation and
   dissemination (knowledge-based constructs), which, in turn, directly
   affects the degree to which an organization makes changes in its
   marketing strategies (a behavioral construct). Managerial implications

   assesses the validity of the framework using a cross-sectional sample of
   salespeople and sales managers drawn from a variety of

   salespeople's perceptions of their managers' role-modeling behavior
   relate positively to trust in the sales manager and relate indirectly,
   through trust, to both job satisfaction and overall performance of sales
   people. The study provides empirical validity for practitioner
   suggestions that sales managers should lead by example, and thus should

AB Past commentaries on the potential impact of the internet on consumer
   marketing have typically failed to acknowledge that consumer markets are
   heterogeneous and complex and that the Internet is but one possible
   distribution, transaction, and communication channel in a world
   dominated by conventional retailing channels. This failure has led to
   excessively broad predictions regarding the effect of the Internet on
   the structure and performance of product and service markets. The
   objective of this article is to provide a framework for understanding
   possible impacts of the Internet on marketing to consumers. This is done
   by analyzing channel intermediary functions that can be performed on the
   Internet, suggesting classification schemes that clarify the potential
   impact of the Internet across different products and services,
   positioning the Internet against conventional retailing channels, and
   identifying similarities and differences that exist between them The
   article concludes with a series of questions designed to stimulate the
   development of theory and strategy in the context of internet-based
   marketing.

AB The authors examine the role of organizational factors affecting
   interdepartmental interactions and their subsequent effects an product
   quality. Results from a national study suggest that product quality is
   affected by interdepartmental conflict and connectedness. importantly
   the linkage between interdepartmental conflict and product quality
   appears to be robust across varying levels of market turbulence and
   technological turbulence. in contrast, interdepartmental connectedness
   appears to be more important for product quality under conditions of
   high market and technological turbulence. The results also indicate that
   interdepartmental interactions are influenced by leadership
   characteristics (risk aversion of top managers), reward system
   orientation, and organization structure (centralization
   departmentalization, and hierarchical levels). Managerial implications
   and directions for future work are proposed.

AB The channel literature has paid little attention to issues related to
   exclusive dealing governance arrangements. Consequently, there is only
   limited knowledge about how exclusive dealing impacts various channel
   processes and outcomes. This gap is especially regrettable since
   exclusive dealing, in addition to being one of the most commonplace
   governance formats within the distribution channels, is also one of the
   best exemplars of viable unilateral governance formats. In this initial
   investigation, the authors explore the linkages among the constructs of
   exclusive dealing, relationalism, communication, and performance.
   Empirical data for the study were drawn from the photocopier industry.

AB Literature reflects that a product/technological innovation introduced
   later in a country results in faster diffusion as the consumers in the
   lag market have an opportunity to learn about the new product from the
   consumers in the lead marker. A systematic understanding of the learning
   that takes place between consumers in two countries-a pair of lead and
   lag countries-can provide insights for a firm's international market
   entry decisions. To provide a richer understanding of the underlying
   structure and patterns that govern this process, propositions linking
   factors (country characteristics, product/innovation characteristics,
   and time lag) to the learning process are drawn. Subsequently, these
   propositions are tested through an empirical investigation of the
   diffusion patterns of four consumer innovations in multiple European
   countries. The findings help provide some preliminary guidelines for
   manufacturers regarding selection of foreign markers and the timing and
   order-of-entry decisions.

AB The predictive validity of two measurement methods of self-image
   congruence-traditional versus new-were compared in six studies involving
   different consumer populations, products, consumption settings, and
   dependent variables (brand preference, preference far product form,
   consumer satisfaction/dissatisfaction, brand attitude, and program
   choice). The traditional method is based on tapping the subject's
   perception of product-user image and the subject's perception of his/her
   self-image along a predetermined set of image attributes and adding the
   self-congruity scores across all image dimensions. Three problems were
   identified and discussed in relation to the traditional method: (1) the
   use of discrepancy scores, (2) the possible use of irrelevant images,
   and (3) the use of the compensatory decision rule. The new method is
   based on tapping the psychological experience of self-congruity directly
   and globally. The findings demonstrated the predictive validity of the
   new method over and beyond the traditional method.

AB Marketers frequently include promotional stimuli which elicit some form
   of response from the recipient among the tactics used to market products
   or services. Print ads, including 800 numbers which allow consumers to
   respond, and direct mail campaigns are examples of such activities.
   Promotions of this nature are often repeated a number of times, thus
   providing several opportunities to respond. Understanding consumer
   response to such campaigns is critical for more efficient design and use
   of these activities. A conceptual framework of response to repetitive
   stimuli is proposed, and stochastic models of alternative response
   patterns are developed. Alternative contexts in which such models are
   useful are also noted. Variations of the models are provided for those
   situations when only a fraction of the target population will ever
   respond. Estimation of model parameters is discussed, and data from
   actual campaigns are used to demonstrate how to apply the models.

AB This study examines how pricing decisions might be improved. We test the
   hypothesis that managers have a tendency to overcompete by comparing the
   performance of managers with the performance of computerized strategies
   in a Prisoner's Dilemma pricing experiment. We find that the subjects in
   our study obtain lower profits than marched computer strategies. The
   subjects appear To value relative performance against competitors, even
   when they are explicitly instructed to maximize profits and are
   compensated based on profits. The implication for managers is that
   pricing to maximize profits may require tolerating the strong
   performance of competitors, even to the point of accepting a lower
   profit than some or all the competitors. If competitiveness means an
   adversarial, "zero-sum game" view of one 4 competitors, then the price
   of competitiveness in competitive markets such as those in our
   experiment may be lower profits. Being less competitive may be more
   profitable.

AB A thorough understanding of how businesses gain and maintain long-term
   relationships with clients is critical in today's environment. This
   study develops a scale for salesperson listening behavior and
   investigates the impact of customers' perceptions of salespeople's
   listening behavior on trust, satisfaction, and anticipation of future
   interaction. A structural equations model is developed and empirically
   tested using a sample of new car buyers. The research results suggest
   that listening is a higher-order construct composed of three dimensions:
   (a) sensing, (b) evaluating, and (c) responding. When customers perceive
   a high level of listening behavior by a salesperson, it enhances their
   trust in the salesperson and leads to greater anticipation of future
   interaction. Implications and future research issues are discussed.

   economies and industries, many organizations search for new ways to
   achieve and retain a competitive advantage. Past attempts have largely
   looked internally within the organization far improvement, such as
   reflected by quality management, reengineering, downsizing, and
   restructuring. The next major source for competitive advantage likely
   will come from more outward orientation toward customers, as indicated
   by the many calls for organizations to compete on superior customer
   value delivery. Although the reasons for these calls are sound, what are
   the implications for managing organizations in the next decade and
   beyond? This article addresses this question. It presents frameworks for
   thinking about customer value, customer value learning, and the related
   skills that managers will need to create and implement superior customer
