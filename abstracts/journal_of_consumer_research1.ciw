TI AUTODRIVING - A PHOTOELICITATION TECHNIQUE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article presents a literature review that explains the antecedents and values of visual research. Then it illustrates the use of photographs and audio recordings of informants to enrich interviews. The term "autodriving" indicates that the interview is "driven" by informants who are seeing and hearing their own behavior. Autodriving addresses the obtrusiveness and reactivity inherent in consumer-behavior research by explicitly encouraging consumers to comment on their consumption behavior as the photographs and recordings represent it. Thus, the research aims for a negotiated interpretation of consumption events. The results suggest that photographs offer exciting challenges to informants by encouraging their need to explain themselves.

TI A CRITICAL-APPRAISAL OF DEMAND ARTIFACTS IN CONSUMER RESEARCH
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Especially since the publication of Sawyer's instructive article on the topic, consumer researchers have been concerned that demand artifacts significantly compromise the validity and generalizability of experimental findings. In this article we provide an overview of the issues surrounding the demand-artifacts controversy, evaluate the preconditions for demand artifacts, and offer a critique of suppositions about the consequences and appropriate control of demand artifacts. Kellaris and Cox's critique of Gorn's well-known classical conditioning experiments provides the back-drop drop for much of the discussion.

TI CONTRAST EFFECTS IN CONSUMER JUDGMENTS - CHANGES IN MENTAL
   REPRESENTATIONS OR IN THE ANCHORING OF RATING-SCALES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Contrast effects in consumers' judgments of products can stem from changes in how consumers mentally represent the stimuli or in how they anchor rating scales when mapping context-invariant mental representations onto those scales. We present a framework for distinguishing between these types of contrast effects on the basis of whether changes in mean ratings of multiattribute stimuli are accompanied by evidence of changes in their rank order. We also report two empirical studies. In study 1, mean overall ratings of a "core set" of car profiles showed contrast effects due to manipulations of the ranges of gas mileage and price in several sets of "context profiles. " Diagnostic tests implied that these effects reflected changes in response-scale anchoring rather than in mental representations. In study 2, consumers high and low in knowledge of automobile prices showed equally large contrast effects on ratings of the expensiveness of a core set of real cars. Diagnostic tests showed that these reflected true changes in mental representation for low-knowledge consumers but only changes in scale anchoring for more knowledgeable ones. Thus, ostensibly similar context effects on simple ratings have different underlying causes and implications for behavior. The findings suggest alternative interpretations of contrast effects in past research on price perception, consumer satisfaction, and service quality.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article investigates homelessness among adult women, an important and growing subpopulation among the homeless. To examine their situation within a consumer-behavior context, an ethnographic case study of a shelter for homeless women run by an order of Roman Catholic sisters was performed. The study focused on how these women became homeless, the effects of early life experiences on their homelessness, available emotional and financial support, possessions that were lost, maintained, or became available during their homeless period(s), their perspectives on their lives at the shelter and its ability to act as a "home," and their fantasies about home life. Public policy implications and contributions of these findings to the developing literature in consumer behavior regarding the meaning of possessions are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Although the perception of contextualized objects pervades our everyday experiences, the literature provides little insight into how consumers ascribe meaning to contextualized products, or indeed into what meaning is. We address this gap in the literature by providing a conceptualization of consumption-object meaning and an a priori model for measuring it. An experiment tested several hypotheses concerning how the kind and amount of context affects the meanings people ascribe to ordinary consumption objects (and the labels that they use to identify those meanings). Overall, the findings support the proposed conceptualization.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Three experiments examined the effects of situational factor's on the ability to learn simple rules for classifying products and estimating prices. In each experiment, multiattribute information about stereo speakers was presented to subjects in a training phase. However, only one attribute was diagnostic. Analytic processing (i.e., the ability to isolate the diagnostic attribute in a subsequent test of product knowledge) was measured. Results showed that analytic processing varied significantly as a function of memory load, processing goals, type of information search, and the relative perceptual salience of product attributes. Surprisingly little holistic (i.e., multiattribute) processing was observed among nonanalytic subjects. Most of these subjects relied on a small subset of attributes, often placing heavy emphasis on a single nondiagnostic attribute.

TI ADAPTING CUTOFFS TO THE CHOICE ENVIRONMENT - THE EFFECTS OF ATTRIBUTE
   CORRELATION AND RELIABILITY
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumers frequently simplify complex choices by setting attribute cutoffs, which are minimum acceptable levels that an alternative must possess to be considered further. We explore the extent to which consumers adapt these cutoffs to the choice environment. We show that, as the reliability of information about the attribute increases, consumers make more severe cutoffs (i.e., fewer attribute levels are acceptable). Further, positive correlations between attributes elicit more severe cutoffs than negative correlations do, and consumers' expectations about the choice outcome partially mediate this relationship. The format of correlational information also affects adaptation: consumers adapt their cutoffs when they are given direct information about the correlation, but not when they are allowed to infer the correlation from a set of alternatives. Overall, consumers appear to adapt to information about reliability and correlations, but they have difficulty assessing correlation from the choice environment.

TI ELABORATING ON ELABORATION - THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN RELATIONAL AND
   ITEM-SPECIFIC ELABORATION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article examines the distinction between and the effects of two different types of elaboration on various indicators of ad effectiveness. One type of elaboration, known as item-specific processing, emphasizes the distinctive features of each ad claim. A second type, called relational processing, highlights similarities (e.g., common themes) that link various ad claims. This study shows that recall of ad claims is enhanced when manipulations foster both types of elaboration simultaneously. However, recognition and clustered recall are enhanced only when manipulations invite item-specific and relational processing, respectively. Finally, data on product judgments, consumption intentions, and the correspondence between these types of responses suggest that item-specific processing may have more impact on these measures.

TI ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS OF HOUSEHOLD GIFT GIVING
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The purpose of this research was to explore economic dimensions of a consumer gift-giving model. Two dimensions of extrahousehold gift expenditures were modeled: the probability of giving and the expected value of the corresponding expenditures. Data were from 4,139 households in the Quarterly interview component of the 1984-1985 U.S. Continuing Consumer Expenditure Survey. The results demonstrated that both the probability of giving and the value of annual expenditures for gifts given outside the consumer unit are related to total expenditures (a proxy for income), family size, life-cycle stage, and education. In addition, the probability of gift giving is related to the number of female adults, ethnicity, and urbanization, and the value of gift expenditures is related to region. Extrahousehold gift expenditures appear to be a luxury-as income increases, gift expenditures increase more rapidly.

TI THE EFFECT OF SEMANTIC CUES ON CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS OF REFERENCE PRICE

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article examines the differential effects of two types of semantic cues: (1) cues connoting that an advertised price discount exhibits low consistency over time, and (2) cues connoting that an advertised discount is highly distinctive vis-a-vis competitors. Results suggest that, for manipulations of external reference prices with offering price held constant, semantic cues that connote high distinctiveness are more effective in influencing consumers' price-related evaluations when the external reference price is otherwise implausibly high than are semantic cues that connote low consistency. For manipulations of offering prices with external reference price held constant, however, semantic cues connoting high distinctiveness exert more relative influence on price-related cognitions when offering prices are high.

Polychronic time use is defined and reviewed in relation to role overload and household demographic characteristics. When a sample of consumers in New Jersey was surveyed, both the PAI and role overload were found to be related to different types of polychronic time use. Overall. this research demonstrates that the concept of polychronic time use contributes to our understanding of consumer behavior and raises questions worthy of future research.

AB This article employs citation analysis to investigate empirically the influence of the Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) on the social science literature. Some 7,166 citations from the Social Science Citation Index (1974-1989) were articles published in JCR between 1974 and 1986, The results show that most research appearing in JCR is used and that research in the journal has an influence on other disciplines. Consumer research, marketing, and psychology were the largest users of JCR. Empirical articles have the single largest influence on the literature, although review and theory articles have a disproportionate influence.

TI LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVE COMPREHENSION IN ADVERTISING PROCESSING AND THEIR
   RELATIONS TO AD PERCEPTIONS, ATTITUDES, AND MEMORY
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Two fundamental orientations toward message comprehension have appeared in advertising research:  the traditional objective view, which applies an accuracy criterion to conceptualize and evaluate comprehension, and the subjective view, which applies other criteria related to the individual comprehender and the actual experience of the message.  This article develops a framework for four levels of subjective comprehension on the basis of an elaboration criterion.  Comprehension levels are hypothesized to differ in their relations to ad perceptions, attitudes, and memory.  Results from an empirical study provide initial support for the framework, including new theoretical insights and explanatory ability beyond the objective orientation.  Discussion focuses on implications for advertising theory and consumer research.

TI HOW DO YOUNG-CHILDREN LEARN TO BE CONSUMERS - A SCRIPT-PROCESSING
   APPROACH
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The experiments reported in this article examine young children's knowledge-acquisition abilities, relative to older children, with the goal of identifying how young children learn and then using this understanding to design situations in which age differences in learning are eliminated.  The results indicate that young children are able to acquire knowledge equivalent to that of older children when the experimental materials and response formats are congruent with their encoding and retrieval abilities.  Younger children's learning was enhanced by (1) the repetition of the same event in an audiovisual format, (2) the presentation of somewhat different events in which the goal of the event and the steps involved in enacting the event were made salient, and (3) contextual response formats that enhanced their retrieval skills.

TI FEELING AND LIKING RESPONSES TO TELEVISION PROGRAMS - AN EXAMINATION OF
   2 EXPLANATIONS FOR MEDIA-CONTEXT EFFECTS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This research empirically examined how the feelings elicited by television programs and the liking of television programs affected viewers' evaluations of commercials.  Subjects' feelings were manipulated by viewing a positive, negative, or neutral emotion-eliciting program while program liking was controlled statistically.  Viewers' liking of programs positively influenced attitude toward the ad and attitude toward the brand, with the effect on the latter mediated through the former.  Feelings elicited by the programs had no effect on these same attitudes.  The influence of program liking on attitude toward the ad, and subsequently on attitude toward the brand, was moderated by both commercial involvement and the commercial's position in a sequence of commercials.

TI A STUDY OF INFORMATION SEARCH BEHAVIOR DURING THE CATEGORIZATION OF NEW
   PRODUCTS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumers are confronted with hundreds of new products each year, yet little is known about how these new products are integrated into existing knowledge structures.  Depending on the new products' similarity or dissimilarity to categories stored in memory, consumers' information search may be influenced.  In this study, consumers' information-seeking behavior was explored during the categorization of new products that differed in varying degrees from preexisting category expectations.  Results suggest that subjects manage the cognitive effort of search by limiting the breadth of search.  However, an inverted-U relationship exists between discrepancy and depth of search.  Thus, it appears that, at a moderate level of discrepancy, subjects may examine a relevant set of attributes in greater depth rather than search for information on a broad range of attributes.  With high discrepancy, however, it appears that subjects try alternative internal strategies rather than search for more information.

TI SELECTIVE RECALL AND INFORMATION USE IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This study investigated the relation between consumers' memory and use of information in judging brand preferences. The authors used ads to test hypotheses about how pictorial and verbal presentations of previously encountered information and the content of subsequently encountered information affect recall and information use in shaping brand preferences. Even when subjects more easily recalled pictured attributes than verbally described attributes, this picture superiority effect did not influence memory-based preferences. In contrast, externally available information for an alternative brand influenced both recall and preferences. The overall pattern of results suggests that enhancing recallability improves the likelihood that consumers will use a piece of information to compare brands only if other information is unavailable or inadequate.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Three experiments are presented that investigate the effect of using incongruent information to improve the memorability of complex marketing communications.  The basic premise of the research is that incongruency is a multidimensional concept, the components of which may produce countervailing effects on memory.  Drawing on research in social cognition and information processing, a theoretical framework is developed that posits two dimensions of incongruency:  relevancy and expectancy.  Results of the research provide empirical support for the framework and suggest implications for consumer research and the development of ads.

TI A COMPARISON OF ATTITUDES AND EMOTIONS AS PREDICTORS OF BEHAVIOR AT
   DIVERSE LEVELS OF BEHAVIORAL EXPERIENCE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This study examines individuals' reports about emotive experience vis-a-vis their attitudinal judgements as predictors of subsequent behavior.  Hypotheses are developed around the general premise that emotional reports tap information with motivational implications that need not be integrated into attitude judgements and thus should supplement attitude in prediction.  The hypotheses are tested with a unique data base that allows categorization of subjects on the basis of diverse levels of prior experience and features naturally occurring behavior over a 12-month period as the criterion variable.  The data support the premise that emotional variables can serve as incremental predictors in instances in which situational pressures may inhibit formation of meaningful attitudes.  Also, the data suggest that emotional reports may furnish some unique information about what perpetuates a behavior.  Implications for further integration of emotional experience into consumer research are discussed.

TI STATE VERSUS ACTION ORIENTATION AND THE THEORY OF REASONED ACTION - AN
   APPLICATION TO COUPON USAGE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article investigates how the individual difference variable of state versus action orientation moderates the pattern of relationships among constructs in the theory of reasoned action.  State orientation refers to a low capacity for the enactment of action-related mental structures, whereas action orientation refers to a high capacity for this type of enactment.  A field study was conducted in the context of consumers' self-reported usage of coupons for grocery shopping.  The results showed that state versus action orientation moderates the relative importance of determinants of intentions; specifically, subjective norms become more important as people become state oriented, whereas the relative importance of attitudes increases as people become action oriented.  In addition, the study showed that past behavior is a determinant of intentions to use coupons.

   PROCESSING ON BRAND ATTITUDES AND INTENTIONS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This study examined how motivation moderates the impact of central and peripheral processing on the formation of brand attitudes and purchase intentions in an advertising pretest setting. The results indicate that increasing motivation to evaluate an advertised brand through the manipulation of consumer processing goals (1) increases the impact of central brand processing on brand attitudes and decreases the impact of a peripheral cue on brand attitudes, primarily by influencing the strengths of the relations among these constructs rather than by influencing their mean levels, (2) has no effect on the impact of the peripheral cue on brand cognitions, and (3) increases the impact of brand attitudes on purchase intentions by strengthening the attitude-intention relation and by increasing brand attitudes directly. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

TI GENERALIZING THE SENSITIVITY CONDITIONS IN AN OVERALL INDEX OF PRODUCT
   QUALITY
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The issue of the sensitivity of weighted linear composites to attribute-importance weights has attracted researchers from various disciplines, including marketing, psychology, and statistics.  At issue is how sensitive a weighted scale is to a particular choice of weights.  Scale sensitivity is defined by a negative correlation between two scales.  By considering the general case of n attributes and using an algebraic approach, we specify the precise sufficiency conditions under which two scales will correlate negatively and thus be sensitive to the weights chosen.  These sensitivity conditions are derived in the context of the computation of an overall product-quality scale, which is simply a special case of the general multiattribute problem.  We illustrate these conditions for the case of two quality scales using examples from Test (from 1983), a German magazine similar to Consumer Reports, and from Places Rated Almanac (from 1987).

TI ITEM CONTEXT AND THE STABILITY OF ENTITY-BASED AND ATTRIBUTE-BASED
   MULTIATTRIBUTE SCALING METHODS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Multientity scaling is a multiattribute-measurement procedure that obtains simultaneous ratings of two or more entities from a single respondent.  The purpose of this research is to examine experimentally the issue of item-context effects on the stability of two types of multientity scaling procedures-attribute-based and entity-based multientity scaling.  The findings indicate that both procedures may be subject to problems of instability when the comparative context of the ratings is changed, with attribute-based scaling being characterized by more instability than entity-based scaling.  On the basis of the findings, potential methods of increasing multientity scaling stability are explored.

TI AN ATTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF RESISTANCE TO GROUP PRESSURE REGARDING
   ILLICIT DRUG AND ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article investigates the role of attributional thinking in generating resistance to pressures toward conformity in the illicit consumption of drugs and alcohol. The results of four studies regarding how conformity influences illicit drug and alcohol consumption among high school and college students are reported. In study 1 more than two-thirds of the respondents reported concern for the implications of their own dissent or compliance regarding the reactions of their peers. Study 2 demonstrated a significant relationship between high school students' attributional thinking concerning a peer group's illicit beer consumption and conformity, expressed as intentions to drink the beer. In study 3, in-depth interviews with high school students provided insight into the realism of the conformity scenarios used in the research and the types of conformity pressures experienced by young people. In study 4, locus of causality, an abstract attributional dimension, and several specific attributions were shown to be significantly associated with conformity in the consumption of marijuana.

TI MAKING INFERENCES ABOUT MISSING INFORMATION - THE EFFECTS OF EXISTING
   INFORMATION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article is concerned with the process by which inferences about missing information are formed. We propose that consumers use within-attribute (other-brand) processing first and, if that information is diagnostic, infer the value of the missing information with little consideration of additional information. If the within-attribute processing does not prove diagnostic, consumers then move to within-alternative (same-brand) processing. In two experiments, we find that high variation in other-brand information results in a statistically significant discount to the inferred value even with no variation in same-brand information, whereas the reverse is not true. This is supportive of an inference-formation process in which other-brand information is considered first. Further, we find that, if there is low variation in other-brand information, time and effort are reduced, attention to the attribute with the missing information is proportionately increased, and there is a shift away from alternative-based processing. These results, encompassing both traditional process measures and inference-based measures, support the process model that we advance.

TI DOES ATTITUDE TOWARD THE AD ENDURE - THE MODERATING EFFECTS OF ATTENTION
   AND DELAY
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Do the effects of attitude toward the ad on consumer decisions endure beyond the scenarios that characterize previous research? in examining this question, we focus on the persistence of ad-attitude effects as a function of the level of attention at encoding and the delay between ad exposure and response. The results of an experiment designed to test our hypotheses suggest that ad-attitude effects do not persist in a number of instances. Over time, as memory for an ad fades, its effects on ad attitude dissipate. As a result, the ad-attitude effects on brand attitude that are reported in past research disappear after a delay. In fact, in certain situations likable ads are shown to have a detrimental impact on brand attitude. For instance, when it receives little attention, a highly affective ad (compared with a more neutral ad) may focus attention away from the brand claims and lead to a lower brand attitude after a delay.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB A meta-analysis of pairwise relationships involving attitude toward the ad was conducted. Analyses of correlations across studies are first analyzed and reported. Because significant variance across studies was found, moderator analyses were conducted to account for interstudy variance. The results suggest a number of methodological variables that moderate the strengths of relationships found in studies of ad attitudes. Analyses were also conducted to assess the robustness of the dual-mediation path model of the effects of ad attitudes. Results indicate support for the model as well as a more important role for the indirect influence of ad attitudes on brand attitudes (via brand cognitions) than that found in previous model tests.

   EXPERIMENTAL-EVIDENCE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The value that consumers place on time spent in price-comparison shopping is central to the economics of information theory and models of consumers' search behavior. Yet few empirical studies have examined consumers' subjective value of time. Building on Gary Becker's work, this article presents two tests of a model of the subjective value of time. In an effort to explain consumers' subjective value of time while they are price-comparison shopping, the model introduces perceived enjoyment of shopping as a new explanatory variable. The findings reveal that respondents incorporate both wage rates and perceived enjoyment of price-comparison shopping into their subjective value of time.

TI AN EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL REFERENCE PRICES USING
   SCANNER DATA
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Single-source yogurt data are used to examine whether both internal and external reference prices affect purchase decisions. Internal reference prices are memory-resident prices based on actual, fair, or other price concepts. External reference prices are observed stimuli, such as "regular prices", that stores may display along with a sale price for comparability. Discrete choice models with variables representing the two types of reference prices are estimated, and both types of variables are found to have significant effects on purchase probabilities. This suggests that consumers may use multiple reference points in evaluating price in purchase decisions. In addition, a model using an indicator of a sale price discount explains purchase probabilities as well as one that models the actual discount, which suggests that consumers may be reacting to the indication of savings rather than to the amount of the discount.

TI THE GENERATION AND CONSEQUENCES OF COMMUNICATION-EVOKED IMAGERY
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumer researchers seem to believe that the use of imagery increases recall, enhances attitude toward the brand, and positively affects behavioral intentions. Yet few empirical investigations of imagery effects have been conducted in a consumer-behavior context. In this article, we provide a theoretical rationale based on extant literature as to which imagery content variables may influence imagery and how imagery may, in turn, affect key purchase-related variables such as attitudes and behavioral intentions. In addition, the results of two empirical investigations are presented. These studies address how self versus other relatedness and situation plausibility affect the degree of reported imagery and subsequently affect ad and brand evaluations. The results of the two studies show that the focal character and plausibility of the imagined scene influence the degree of imagery evoked by the message. Focal character is shown to directly affect attitude toward the ad. In addition, we find that imagery directly influences attitude toward the ad but has no effect on attitude toward the brand or behavioral intentions.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF ANTICIPATING REGRET AND RESPONSIBILITY ON PURCHASE
   DECISIONS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB It is suggested that consumers' choices between alternatives can be systematically influenced by asking them to anticipate the regret and responsibility they would feel if they made the wrong decision. Specifically, on the basis of the notion that choices of conventional or default options are associated with lower regret and responsibility, it is proposed that consumers who anticipate how they would feel if they made the wrong decision would be more likely to purchase a currently available item on sale rather than wait for a better sale and more likely to prefer a higher-priced, well-known brand over a less expensive, lesser-known brand. These propositions were supported in three studies. The findings also suggest that an error caused by selection of a lesser-known, lower-priced brand is associated with greater responsibility but less regret than an error caused by a choice of a well-known, higher-priced brand.

TI VALUE-SYSTEM SEGMENTATION - EXPLORING THE MEANING OF LOV
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Human values have been increasingly used as a basis for market segmentation. The list of values (LOV) is one common approach to segmentation: typically, marketers use the top-ranked value to assign consumers to segments. Although it is simple to implement, the top-rank approach to values segmentation conflicts with Rokeach's concept of an ordered value system, in which individual values are organized in the context of an overall hierarchy- This study uses a new measurement model that identifies latent (unobserved) value-system segments derived from a ranking of the LOV items. Higher-order value-system segments reflect the reality that multiple values will affect an individual's behavior- A values map is also constructed, which allows dimensions underlying the value-system segments to be identified. Data from a national survey show that the resulting value-system segments and values map have face validity consistent with the psychological structure of human values recently hypothesized by S. H. Schwartz and W. Bilsky.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF PURCHASE QUANTITY AND DISPLAY FORMAT ON CONSUMER
   PREFERENCE FOR VARIETY
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB We propose that what consumers buy can be systematically influenced by how much they buy. We hypothesize that, as the number of items purchased in a category on a shopping occasion increases, a consumer is more likely to select product variants (e.g., yogurt flavors) that s/he does not usually purchase. We used yogurt scanner data to support this hypothesis. This study also revealed that consumers were more likely to select their regular brands when purchasing more containers of yogurt on a given occasion. A laboratory experiment showed that this reflects the combined impact of purchase quantity and product-display format (i.e., the by-brand display of yogurt in supermarkets) on consumer choice.

TI HYPOTHESIZED AND CONFOUNDED EXPLANATIONS IN THEORY TESTS - A
   BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Traditional views of research methodology hold that little, if any, useful information can be obtained from one or more confounded studies, unless the results from one study rule out or falsify an alternative explanation from a previous study. We present a Bayesian analysis of hypothesis testing to model knowledge accumulation from a series of confounded or unconfounded experiments. By applying this Bayesian analysis, we find that a hypothesis can receive support from a study with known flaws. Our analysis also implies that the status of an explanation is independent of whether it was proposed a priori or post hoc.

TI THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ADDICTION - TOWARD A GENERAL-THEORY OF COMPULSIVE
   CONSUMPTION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article reviews and integrates recent theories of addiction drawn from a diverse set of disciplines-consumer behavior, medicine, sociology, psychiatry, and psychology-to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the etiology of addiction and other compulsive consumer behaviors. Interpretive material from personal interviews with addicted and nonaddicted drug users is then used to illustrate the consciousness of addictive consumption. Two a priori themes-serial/simultaneous addictions and personal crises/role transitions-and five emergent themes-relapse, deception, dysfunctional families, suicide, and boundaries-are discussed.

TI ON RESONANCE - A CRITICAL PLURALISTIC INQUIRY INTO ADVERTISING RHETORIC
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Print ads exhibit resonance when they combine wordplay with a relevant picture to create ambiguity and incongruity. This article uses multiple perspectives and methods within a framework of critical pluralism to investigate advertising resonance. Semiotic text analyses, a content analysis of contemporary magazine ads, two experiments, and phenomenological interviews combine to yield insights into the operation, prevalence, impact, and experience of resonance. Specifically, the two experiments show that manipulation of resonance produces positive treatment effects in three domains: liking for the ad, brand attitude, and unaided recall of ad headlines. These effects appear contingent on subjects' successful decoding of resonance and their tolerance for ambiguity (an individual difference variable). Implications for future research on resonance and for the use of critical pluralism in consumer advertising research are discussed.

The influence of peers on individuals' product and brand decisions for products that range in their degree of conspicuousness is examined for comparable samples in the United States and in Thailand to assess the validity of the original framework over time and across cultural contexts. Further, the influence of the family is addressed through an examination of intergenerational influences across the two cultures. The results of the study lend support to the original theoretical approach and also provide insight into how reference-group influence may vary depending on whether the influence is exercised by a member of a peer group or by a family member.

TI LOW-INVOLVEMENT LEARNING - MEMORY WITHOUT EVALUATION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB In three learning experiments we examined how subjects' level of involvement during initial exposure to consumer trivia influences what they learn and what they subsequently come to believe. Subjects rated consumer trivia statements as more true when they had been exposed to those statements earlier in the experiment. Simple repetition increased subsequent truth ratings. Moreover, when subjects processed the information during initial exposure in a less involving fashion, the effect of repetition on truth became more pronounced. Familiarity emerged as a key mediator of the truth effect. When subjects experienced an "it rings a bell" reaction, they judged the information to be more true. Finally, under low-involvement processing, the truth effect increased when subjects engaged in a processing task (rote rehearsal) that increased familiarity without increasing evaluative processing of the information.

TI PERIPHERAL PERSUASION AND BRAND CHOICE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Although the impact of peripheral advertising cues on postcommunication attitudes has received considerable attention in the research literature, less consideration has been given to whether such persuasion affects behavior. This research examines the potential for peripheral persuasion to influence brand choice as a function of the degree of differentiation among choice alternatives. The results from three experiments show that peripheral advertising cues can affect brand choice but that the extent of this influence depends on the particular brand-relevant information available at the time of choice. These findings substantiate the usefulness of peripheral persuasion tactics for modifying consumer choice.

TI SOME EFFECTS OF SCHEMATIC PROCESSING ON CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS AND
   DISCONFIRMATION JUDGMENTS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Recent research has shown that processing based on the product-category schemas of consumers can influence the manner in which consumers evaluate products. This article presents a series of studies that explore how processing based on such schemas interacts with consumer expectations prior to the trial of a new product and influences disconfirmation judgments and product evaluations following the trial. An initial study finds that, when attributes included in the description of a new product are very discrepant from a prior category schema, consumers may switch schemas in forming pretrial expectations. A second study finds that more negative product evaluations following the trial may result when consumers' experience with a product during the trial is very different from schema expectations, compared with the situation in which the product matches schema expectations. A third study demonstrates that disconfirmation judgments and posttrial evaluations may occur through processing at the product-category schema level, rather than through processing at the product attribute level.

TI THE EFFECT OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ON PRICE ACCEPTABILITY AND THE TYPE OF
   INFORMATION EXAMINED
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article assesses whether differences in prior knowledge result in differences in (1) price acceptability and (2) the extent to which different types of information are examined. Using a personal computer-based methodology, subjects who varied in their prior product knowledge provided price responses, and the time they spent examining various kinds of information was measured. Acceptable price-range end-points (price limits) were found to be lowest for low-knowledge subjects. Further, the extent to which price and related extrinsic information was examined was found to be lowest for moderately knowledgeable subjects. Results from a second study provide substantive support for the claim that increasing prior knowledge is accompanied by an increase in both limits of the acceptable price range.

   RESEARCH - A SOCIAL-EXCHANGE PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The communication patterns (1977 through 1988) between the Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) and other related disciplines are examined from a social exchange perspective. As one way of assessing scientific status, we completed a citation analysis to consider both the journals that JCR authors cite and the journals that cite JCR. The results reveal that JCR performs an important bridging function between the psychology and marketing literatures. However, JCR has had considerably less impact on other cognate disciplines, in particular those represented by the members of its policy board. In general, we find that JCR does appear to be making some progress in achieving its goal of becoming an interdisciplinary consumer-research publication.

Cognitive age is shown to possess unidimensionality and to demonstrate acceptable reliability. Cognitively younger "older" women manifested higher self-confidence and greater fashion interest, were more work oriented, and had greater participation in entertainment and culturally related activities. Contrary to the hypothesis, cognitively younger women were not more socially involved than their cognitively older counterparts.

The development of a values-oriented materialism scale with three components-acquisition centrality, acquisition as the pursuit of happiness, and possession-defined success-is described.

TI A MEANING-BASED MODEL OF ADVERTISING EXPERIENCES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article adopts and extends a meaning-based approach to advertising. We emphasize the consumer's perspective and seek to address important factors that motivate and shape actualized advertising meanings. A graphic model is delineated that focuses on consumers' life themes (e.g., being true vs. being false) and life projects (e.g., what it means to be an educator). The model is assessed through a phenomenological inquiry into the life stories of three individuals and their respective experiences of contemporary magazine advertisements. Findings corroborate the proposition that many actualized ad meanings are a function of the consumer's salient life projects as conjoined by life themes. Discussion focuses on the implications for advertising theory and consumer research.

TI MOVING POSSESSIONS - AN ANALYSIS BASED ON PERSONAL DOCUMENTS FROM THE
   1847-1869 MORMON MIGRATION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Possessions may be a burden to nomadic people of the present and past, but for those moving to more permanent dwellings, possessions offer a means to shed, transport, or create meanings across locales. Mormon pioneer diaries and other historical personal documents are used to assess the meanings and importance of the possessions these pioneers brought on their journey. Computer-assisted qualitative analyses of these documents suggested five major categories of possession symbolism: (1) sacred meanings, (2) material meanings, (3) personal meanings, (4) familial meanings, and (5) communal meanings. Within some of these categories of meaning there are notable differences between men and women. Even though the present findings are based on a particular group and time period, it seems likely that these types of symbolic possession meanings are also to be found in other moves.

TI THE CONSUMPTION OF PERFORMANCE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article develops a vocabulary to describe the management of performance and the nature of consumer judgments of staged performance quality. It distinguishes three kinds of performance-contractual, enacted, and dramatistic. While all marketing actions are by nature dramatistic, this article explores how marketing can obscure the traces of dramatism by reframing the performance as contractual or enacted. Alternatively, marketing may seek to emphasize a performance's dramatistic character, selecting among skill, show, thrill, or festive frames. I apply this framework to examine the issue of the quality of performances.

TI CONSUMER COVARIATION JUDGMENTS - THEORY OR DATA DRIVEN
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB We examined the issues of when, and how, consumers' prior beliefs or "theories" might bias their judgments of the association between price and quality using a task that involved taste testing orange juices. When the task was manipulated so that subjects had difficulty in comparing and contrasting the taste quality of the juices, their covariation judgments tended to be theory driven: while these judgments were somewhat sensitive to the actual price-quality relationship in the "data," they were biased by individuals' prior beliefs about the covariation. Follow-up studies indicated that this effect was not due to an encoding bias in that subjects' prior beliefs about price and quality did not significantly distort their taste perceptions per se. Instead, when subjects found it difficult to discriminate among the stimuli with regard to taste quality, they appeared to have formed their covariation judgments by making heuristic use of their prior beliefs. Implications are discussed for the covariation judgment process and consumer learning.

TI ASYMMETRIC RESPONSE TO PRICE IN CONSUMER BRAND CHOICE AND PURCHASE
   QUANTITY DECISIONS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The study investigates whether consumers exhibit asymmetry (i.e., different sensitivity) to negative ("loss") and positive ("gain") differences between the reference price and the purchase price in brand choice and purchase quantity decisions. Using panel data for two frequently purchased products with three brands in each product category, we find that consumers loyal to a brand ("loyals") respond to gain and loss with the same sensitivity in brand choice decisions. However, consumers not loyal to any brand ("switchers") respond more strongly to gains than to losses. In purchase quantity decisions, brand-loyal consumers are found to respond asymmetrically to gains and losses, but the direction of the asymmetry depends on whether the decision is made before or after the household inventory reaches a stock-out level (i.e., the level at which the household inventory needs to be replenished). When the decision is made after a stock-out, brand-loyal consumers are more responsive to a gain in the price of their favorite brand than to a loss. In contrast, when the quantity decision is made before a stock-out, loyals are more sensitive to a loss than to a gain. In only two of the six brands examined do we find evidence of asymmetry in switchers' quantity decisions. In both cases, switchers respond more strongly to a price loss than to a gain, regardless of whether the purchase decision is made before or after a stock-out.

TI THE DISCOUNTING OF DISCOUNTS AND PROMOTION THRESHOLDS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This study examines consumers' response to retailers' price promotions. It shows that consumers discount the price discounts. It also suggests that the discounting of discounts and changes in purchase intention depend on the discount level, store image, and whether the product advertised is a name brand or a store brand. The study goes one step further to investigate the existence of promotion thresholds. We use experimental data and an econometric methodology to gather empirical evidence that consumers do not change their intentions to buy unless the promotional discount is above a threshold level. This threshold point differs for name brands and store brands. Specifically, we find that the threshold for a name brand is lower than that for a store brand. In other words, stores can attract consumers by offering a small discount on name brands while a larger discount is needed for a similar effect for a store brand. The study also indicates the existence of a promotion saturation point above which the effect of discounts on changes in consumers' purchase intention is minimal. These results confirm consumers' S-shaped response to promotions.

TI PRICE PREMIUM VARIATIONS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF BUYERS LACK OF INFORMATION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB It appears that buyers sometimes knowingly pay a price that is higher than that justified by the relative quality of the product. Such a price premium is argued to be an economically rational attempt by quality-conscious buyers to ensure that the seller does not provide a lower than promised level of quality for experience products. Conversely, for search products, price premiums are argued to be the consequence of lack of search by buyers who are less quality conscious. Results from a survey conducted in an organizational buying setting indicate that buyers' tendency to pay a price premium for experience products increases with an increase in their quality consciousness, while for search products this tendency decreases with an increase in their quality consciousness. The implications of this findings are discussed; further analysis leads to additional speculation regarding some other mechanisms that buyers may use to assure product quality.

AB Existing theorizing suggests that consumers should experience more intense affective reactions when a posit ve outcome is just missed (short temporal distance) than when its occurrence is relatively remote (long temporal distance). Two studies are reported that explore why and when these effects occur and whether they also occur for persuasion responses. The findings indicate that this effect is likely to occur and influence persuasion only when people's involvement with the message issue is low rather than high. This observation together with findings obtained on a thought-listing task provide evidence that variations in temporal distance seem to operate by altering people's motivation to scrutinize a situation and evoke thoughts about alternative outcomes that might have been.

AB This study examines the role of optimum stimulation level (OSL) in exploratory consumer behavior. The concept of OSL and its measurement are discussed, and the literature on exploratory consumer tendencies and their relationship with OSL is reviewed. Hypotheses are developed concerning the relationship between OSL and cognitive responses to ads, ad repetition, information search. variety seeking, decision making under risk, gambling, and innovative behavior, and these hypotheses are investigated in a series of experiments. Four well-known instruments are used to measure people's characteristic preference for stimulation, and OSL is operationalized as a weighted composite of a person's score on these scales. The results of the study indicate that consumers' OSL is systematically related to curiosity-motivated consumer behaviors, variety seeking, and risk taking.

Seven items representing specific behaviors, motivations, and feelings associated with buying significantly contributed to correctly classifying approximately 88 percent of the subjects. Evidence indicates this screening scale is unidimensional and possesses good reliability. Validity is demonstrated by comparing members of a general consumer sample who are identified as compulsive buyers by the screener with self-identified compulsive buyers and noncompulsive consumers on several established correlates and outcomes of compulsive buying. Evidence of external validity using a separate sample is also presented.

The utility of an unacceptable level was set equal to a value that would have been assigned if the unacceptable levels question was not asked, but the respondent treated that level as unacceptable. With ACA, this resulted in a model with (a) superior predictive power relative to a model that eliminates alternatives with unacceptable levels and (b) equivalent predictive power to a compensatory model that does not consider unacceptable levels. Furthermore, in this application, this was accomplished even though the respondent was presented with approximately 30 percent fewer paired comparison observations.

TI AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SOCIAL-CONTEXT OF EARLY ADOPTION BEHAVIOR
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The social context of new product adoption behavior is a key aspect of the diffusion of innovations. Yet little is known about the process by which social contextual factors influence individual adoption decisions. This research develops and tests a model of the effects of perceived consumption visibility and superordinate group influence on new product intention formation. A structural equation model is used in an experimental design to provide a comprehensive view of variable interdependencies and to incorporate measurement error. Key findings indicate that (1) perceived visibility of consumption significantly affects consumers' predictions of normative outcomes (i.e., social approval from referents) and (2) superordinate group influence has a direct effect on consumers' perceptions of consumption visibility and expectations of both personal (i.e., intrinsically valued product benefits) and normative outcomes from early adoption. The results have important implications for understanding the role of consumption symbols as mechanisms for social differentiation and integration.

Five guidelines seek to redirect the discipline toward its original goals. These guidelines advocate wider horizons, a larger audience, a different talent mix, more emphasis on discovery, more attention to consumers, and more single-minded dedication to meaningful results.

TI THE INTELLECTUAL STRUCTURE OF CONSUMER RESEARCH - A BIBLIOMETRIC STUDY
   OF AUTHOR COCITATIONS IN THE 1ST 15 YEARS OF THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER
   RESEARCH
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This study explores the analysis of citations in the Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) during its first 15 years of publication. We review previous work on citation analysis in marketing and consumer research, and we argue for the value of a more complex approach based on patterns of cocitation. Toward this end, we develop a data base that draws on the work of the 42 most frequently published authors in JCR in the first 15 years. We introduce a new, two-stage procedure to investigate the underlying structure in the from-versus-to or citing-cited matrix based on numbers of references among these authors. Our procedure yields a scale of citing-cited asymmetry for the 42 consumer researchers, a ''citation-similarity space'' showing patterns of symmetric citation among the researchers, and measures of research atypicality. These separate yet complementary results give interesting insights into patterns of cocitation among consumer behavior researchers and thereby appear to reflect the intellectual structure of consumer research.

TI FEMINIST LITERARY-CRITICISM AND THE DECONSTRUCTION OF ADS - A POSTMODERN
   VIEW OF ADVERTISING AND CONSUMER RESPONSES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article examines text and consumer responses from the perspective of postmodern feminist literary criticism. It uses a feminist framework to incorporate the issues of advertising as gendered text and consumer responses as gendered readings into consumer research. The article begins with a brief background discussion of feminist literary theory to introduce the concept of gendered text and to set forth the ''reading'' methodology developed to identify it. Next, this method is demonstrated in a feminist reading of two advertising figures-the Marlboro Man and the Dakota Woman. Then, the article presents a feminist perspective on gendered reading-different male and female reading styles relevant to consumers and ads. Last, ideas about gendered texts and readers are integrated into ongoing consumer research on attitude toward the ad, inferencing, and empathy.

TI FEMALE LABOR-FORCE PARTICIPATION AND TIME-SAVING HOUSEHOLD TECHNOLOGY -
   A CASE-STUDY OF THE MICROWAVE FROM 1978 TO 1989
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB American households are facing severe time constraints as women increase their participation in the wage economy. The implications of this situation for the adoption of time-saving technology in the home are not well understood. Previous research suggests several scenarios regarding the consequences of female labor force participation for the purchase of time-saving technology: (1) there may be no effect, (2) female labor force participation may have a direct effect, (3) female labor force participation may have an indirect effect through income, or (4) direct effects over time. This article evaluates these hypotheses with a case study of the microwave oven, through proprietary cross-sectional surveys of married-couple households conducted from 1978 to 1989.

TI A CONCEPTUAL AND EMPIRICAL-COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE HOUSEHOLD
   LIFE-CYCLE MODELS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB In this article we conceptually and empirically compare a number of alternative family life cycle models, ranging from traditional to ''modernized.'' These comparisons evaluate each model's ability to identify homogeneous categories, maximize between-group variation, classify nearly all households, and result in a reasonably small number of sufficient size categories. Our empirical comparisons consist of a number of between- and within-category a priori contrasts related to these criteria, as well as overall tests of each model's ability to capture attitudinal, leisure activity, and consumption differences. While the model of M. C. Gilly and B. M. Enis outperformed other models overall, we suggest potential modifications based on our a priori comparison findings. We also provide recommendations for future research to determine how to best incorporate nontraditional family forms.

TI HISTORICAL METHOD IN CONSUMER RESEARCH - DEVELOPING CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS
   OF CHANGE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Historical research provides a qualitative interpretive method uniquely formulated to explain the causes of change through time. As such, it offers considerable potential for expanding our current understanding of inherently dynamic and volatile consumer phenomena. Despite recent interest in interpretive approaches among consumer researchers, the historical consumer behavior literature reveals that this method's potential has not been fully realized. We argue that this underutilization derives from the absence of a full explication of history's methodological assumptions and requirements, which are substantially different from those that have traditionally dominated consumer research. We address this problem by providing a conceptual and methodological review of historical research methods and by demonstrating the application of historical method to the study of change in consumer behavior.

In the simplified model, an individual's predisposition to innovate is modified by socially transmitted messages about the innovation, as well as by other situation specific factors. This model is used to make predictions about the future behavior of a sample of consumers that are tested with data collected during the diffusion of six innovations. While our findings support the model, especially with respect to the role of innovative individuals, they also demonstrate the need to develop explanations of rejection.

In this paper, we develop, from a behavioral perspective, a conceptual framework and an associated set of propositions concerning the influence and interaction of a number of factors on agenda setting. We examine the consequences of negotiating multiple issues sequentially as opposed to discussing them simultaneously. Specifically, we posit (a) conditions under which sequential versus simultaneous negotiations are advantageous, (b) conditions that promote and inhibit integrative agreements between parties involved in sequential negotiations, and (c) conditions that foster greater utility and timeliness to the negotiating parties. In addition, directions for future research and methodological guidelines for testing the propositions are discussed.

TI AN EXPLORATION OF HIGH-RISK LEISURE CONSUMPTION THROUGH SKYDIVING
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB A sociocultural approach is used to explore voluntary high-risk consumption. Specifically, we examine the dynamics of individuals' motives, risk perceptions, and benefit/cost outcomes of participation in increasingly popular high-risk leisure activities such as skydiving, climbing, and BASE jumping (parachuting from fixed objects). An ethnography of a skydiving subculture provides the primary empirical data. We propose an extended dramatic model that explains both macroenvironmental and inter- and intrapersonal influences and motives for high-risk consumption. Key findings indicate (1) an evolution of motives that explains initial and continuing participation in high-risk activities and (2) a coinciding evolution of risk acculturation that leads to the normalization of risk.

TI RIVER MAGIC - EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE AND THE EXTENDED SERVICE
   ENCOUNTER
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article explores the provision of extraordinary hedonic experiences on commercial, multiday river rafting trips in the Colorado River basin. White water river rafting provides a dramatic illustration of some of the complex features of delivering an extraordinary experience. Multiple methods were employed over two years of data collection to articulate the lived meaning of this experience from both the guides' and the consumers' perspectives. Robust quantitative measures were developed from rich qualitative data. Participant observation and interview data enriched the interpretation of quantitative results. Experiential themes of personal growth and self-renewal, ''communitas,'' and harmony with nature are evidenced across the data; they evolve and are woven together over the course of the trip. Together they are significant in explaining overall satisfaction. There is a complex relationship between client expectations and satisfaction. The narrative of the ratting experience rather than relationships between expectations and outcomes is shown to be central to its evaluation. Implications for other services and consumption activities are discussed.

TI DOES MEASURING INTENT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Past research has established that, while self-reports of purchase intentions can Predict behavior, various factors affect the strength of the intentions-behavior link. This article explores one such factor: the impact of merely measuring intent. Our specific question concerns the impact of measuring intent on subsequent purchase behavior. Prior research suggests a mere-measurement hypothesis: that merely measuring intent will increase subsequent purchase behavior. We also suggest a polarization hypothesis: that repeated intent questions will have a polarizing effect on behavior. The results reveal that the effect of merely asking intent to buy once is an increase in the subsequent purchase rate. The effect of repeatedly asking intent for those with low levels of intent is a decreased propensity to buy with repeated measurements. These two effects are reduced given prior experience with the product. The implications of these findings and opportunities for future research are discussed.

TI BRAND RETRIEVAL, CONSIDERATION SET COMPOSITION, CONSUMER CHOICE, AND THE
   PIONEERING ADVANTAGE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Recent research on the pioneering advantage has shown that consumers often prefer pioneering brands to follower brands. Recent research on consumer choice suggests that information about brands is filtered through a series of sequential cognitive processes. This study attempts to integrate these two separate lines of research by investigating the effects of pioneering on each stage of the multistage decision process. A within-subjects longitudinal experiment was conducted to simulate brand order of entry into a new market. We also developed a sequential logit model to isolate the direct impact of pioneering on each stage of the decision process while controlling for indirect effects of pioneering on previous stages. The results revealed that the pioneering brand (vs. followers) is more likely to be retrieved, considered, and selected. Moreover, the results revealed that consumers are more likely to bypass consideration set formation when the choice decision is simple (vs. complex). Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumers watch a television ad at different levels depending on their motivation to process the ad. In this article, the fit between an ad and an evoked ad schema in memory is hypothesized to influence consumers' motivation to process. It is also hypothesized that this motivation is moderated by effects due to consumers' prior category affect and processing goals. Results from an advertising experiment suggest that ads typical of an evoked schema elicit relatively less extensive processing and evaluations, while those atypical of the schema motivate more extensive processing and evaluations. In an extension of previous research in the domain, the results imply that typicality effects are moderated by the extremity of prior category affect. Limited evidence also reveals that typicality effects may be moderated by ad-processing goals. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.

An examination of previous research reveals a subtle discrepancy-what is important to consumers when judging the similarity of products does not necessarily match what is important to them when evaluating products for purchase. In an empirical study, we examine this discrepancy and focus on the role of different kinds of attributes. We find that beneficial attributes were relatively more important in preference assessments than in similarity judgments. Alternatively, characteristic attributes were relatively less important in preference assessments than in similarity judgments. Unexpectedly, image attributes were relatively less important in preference assessment than in similarity judgments. These results provide insights into why ''me too'' products may not succeed.

We develop propositions about conditions under which higher warranties may lead to higher, lower, or the same quality perceptions as do lower warranties. These quality perceptions of consumers are consistent with different types of market equilibria predicted by signaling theory. The propositions are tested in an experiment which varies warranty length, warranty scope, and the conditions for warranty signaling. Results suggest that, in general, consumer responses to warranties are consistent with the behavioral assumptions of signaling theory. The authors suggest that consumer researchers can gain greater insight by integrating signaling theory with psychologically based approaches.

We further hypothesize that the way in which negotiators weight their opponents' payoffs, relative to their own, is a function of characteristics of the relationship and of the bargainers' personalities. Specifically, we consider liking of the other party, payoff expectations, satisfaction with past settlements, the likelihood of future negotiations, egocentricity, and power orientation. We demonstrate the impact of these factors on the satisfaction negotiators derive from profiting more and less than their opponents using data from an experiment in which subjects negotiate with computer-simulated opponents.

Although earlier studies have shown that clutter decreases an individual's ability to recall a brand, it is not clear that clutter will have the same effect on other measures of memory.  Two experiments with important methodologic differences from prior clutter studies investigated the impact of clutter on recognition, aided recall, and unaided recall.  The results suggest that clutter may not significantly affect an individual's true ability to remember what was seen.

Less conspicuous warnings were generally no better than no warnings. In experiment 2, participants viewing broadcast commercials with both-modality warnings generally performed better than those exposed to voice-only or no warnings. Print-only warnings produced performance equivalent to, or in one case lower than, both-modality warnings.

Both studies indicate that, when shoppers are instructed to select a cereal according to specific nutritional criteria, elderly subjects are less likely than younger subjects to search intensely and to select an appropriate cereal. In the laboratory setting, however, the age-related differences diminished when subjects wrote down all the nutritional information acquired during their search. Age-related changes in information-processing ability may explain the findings. Implications for public policy are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Three experiments are used to investigate the influence of conditioning procedures on attention to a conditioned stimulus. In experiment 1, scenes presented in a sequence that is consistent with prescribed conditioning procedures are shown to encourage attention to the advertised brands in subsequent product displays. Experiment 2 suggests that differential attention to conditioned brands can be attributed to the signaling properties the brand acquires as a consequence of conditioning. Evidence from a third experiment raises the possibility that semantic conditioning may be responsible for the effects observed in experiments 1 and 2. The findings suggest that current prescriptions on the use of conditioning procedures may need to be updated.

TI GOAL-ORIENTED EXPERIENCES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This research investigates the learning that occurs throughout several information acquisition and choice experiences. The effects of three factors that may naturally vary in consumer experiences are studied: a consumer's goals, how much the consumer knows about the product's features prior to information acquisition and choice, and the content of feedback received after choice. Results show that the information consumers learn is organized in memory around the goal(s) that drives the experiences. Further, higher levels of prior feature knowledge result in more accurate knowledge after experience, but, contrary to predictions, subjects with no prior feature knowledge are quite adept at focusing on their goal in the choice process and at learning goal-appropriate information. The presence of feedback and its consistency with a consumer's goal are also shown to affect the goal orientation and organization of brand and feature knowledge gained during choice experiences.

TI A MODEL OF CONSUMERS PREVENTIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS - THE ROLE OF HEALTH
   MOTIVATION AND HEALTH ABILITY
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article develops and tests a model of the individual and joint effects of various consumer characteristics on health information acquisition behaviors (e.g., using media sources) and health maintenance behaviors (e.g., restricting diet). Theory development overviews the interdisciplinary literature on health and proposes that health motivation independently influences consumers' preventive health behaviors while the effect of health ability on health behaviors is moderated by the level of health motivation. This theory is tested in a survey of 404 consumers. Results indicate that the interaction of health ability and health motivation affects consumers' health behaviors. However, mixed results suggest that high levels of ability and motivation are not always critical precursors of health behaviors; instead, the impact of these characteristics depends on the particular health behavior and the specific health ability characteristic. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

TI GIFT SELECTION FOR EASY AND DIFFICULT RECIPIENTS - A SOCIAL ROLES
   INTERPRETATION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Using interpretive techniques, we explore the meaning underlying Christmas shoppers' description of some recipients as ''easy'' or ''difficult,'' in terms of gift selection. We argue that recipients are described as such because they either help or hinder givers' attempts to express specific social roles through exchange. We identify six such roles that givers express alone or in combination to each recipient on their gift lists. These are the pleaser, the provider, the compensator, the socializer, the acknowledger, and the avoider. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggest areas worthy of further research.

TI NOSTALGIA AND CONSUMPTION PREFERENCES - SOME EMERGING PATTERNS OF
   CONSUMER TASTES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB As studied in recent consumer research, the role of nostalgia involves both (1) a link between age and the development of consumer tastes (over time) and (2) the relationship of nostalgia proneness (a psychographic variable) to patterns of consumer preferences, However, questions remain concerning whether the influence of nostalgia proneness and age can be regarded as two independent aspects of nostalgic consumption. This research reports a pair of studies that investigate this issue with respect to motion picture preferences among subjects. Study 1 uses an age-homogeneous sample to examine 20 items that assess nostalgia proneness, to derive a nostalgia scale, to form a spatial representation of movie preferences, and to test the fit of a vector reflecting differential nostalgia-related tastes in this preference space. Study 2 generalizes these results to a sample heterogeneous with respect to age and shows that age and nostalgia proneness appear to work independently as separate aspects of nostalgic preference patterns.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF POSITIVE AFFECT ON VARIETY SEEKING AMONG SAFE,
   ENJOYABLE PRODUCTS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB In three brand-choice experiments executed on personal computers, a significant interaction was found regarding the influence of positive affect, induced by the gift of a small bag of candy or sugarless gum, on variety-seeking behavior. In three food categories (crackers, soup, and snack foods), a positive-affect manipulation increased variety-seeking behavior relative to that in the control conditions, when circumstances did not make unpleasant or negative features of the items in the choice task salient. However, when a negative feature, such as the possibility that a product would taste bad, was made more salient, there was no difference in variety-seeking behavior between the subjects who had received the small gift and the control subjects. Positive affect was also found (1) to increase the tendency of subjects to categorize nontypical items as belonging to a predefined product category, (2) to increase credibility that a product designed to reduce negative health effects would be successful, and (3) to increase variety-seeking behavior in choice sets containing the latter two types of items.

Results from a laboratory experiment reveal that mood interacts with involvement and shopping experience. Involved subjects are found to magnify their evaluations of the shopping experience, subjects in good moods evaluate good experiences still better, and a bad shopping experience appears to cause mood-protection mechanisms to fail. Finally, consumer mood is shown to be affected by a bad shopping experience.

The results indicate that an audio televised presentation promotes learning equivalent to that of an audiovisual presentation when the audio transmission facilitates both the learning of individual acts or items and the learning of the causal and temporal connections between these acts. In addition, knowledge acquisition differences between older and younger children for audio televised information are eliminated when both types of learning are facilitated.

   ATTITUDE FORMATION

AB How do structural and affective elements in a persuasive message influence consumers' product beliefs and attitudes? In this article, we examine how the logical structure of arguments (provided through warrants) influences consumers' beliefs about product claims. Next, we examine how explicit statements about product claim desirability (provided through affective tag sentences) influence product attitude. Our results show that argument structure has a strong effect on consumers' beliefs. More important, our results suggest that consumers' product attitudes are based on their beliefs about product claims, but only when the desirability of those claims is made explicit.

TI SOCIAL DESIRABILITY BIAS AND THE VALIDITY OF INDIRECT QUESTIONING
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Indirect (i.e., structured projective) questioning has been employed frequently in marketing and other social sciences to reduce social desirability bias, that is, systematic error in self-report measures resulting from the desire of respondents to avoid embarrassment and project a favorable image to others. Yet little is known about the validity of indirect questioning in reducing social desirability bias. This article reports on three studies that examine indirect questioning as a technique to reduce social desirability bias on self-report measures. The effects of asking indirect (i.e., structured, projective) questions were compared with direct (i.e., structured, personal) questions. The pattern of results indicates that indirect questioning reduces social desirability bias on variables subject to social influence and has no significant effect on socially neutral variables. The social nature of the differences between direct and indirect questioning groups, and the attribution of an undesirable trait to an out-group but not an in-group target, supports the view that subjects projected their beliefs and evaluations in the indirect response situation. These results are consistent across several product categories and indirect question wordings.

TI CAPTURING AND CREATING PUBLIC-OPINION IN SURVEY-RESEARCH
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Although consumer researchers often assume that survey responses reflect true beliefs, attitudes, and intentions, most recent research in social judgment and behavioral decision making suggests that people often construct answers to survey questions on the basis of their responses to earlier items. A framework proposed by Feldman and Lynch suggests that answers are most likely to be constructed when the respondent does not have other, more diagnostic inputs accessible in memory. Two field experiments conducted during the 1988 and 1992 presidential elections support this model. In experiment 1, when a respondent had voted for one of the candidates in the primary, voting intention was not based on earlier survey answers; when a respondent had not voted for these candidates in the primary, voting intention appeared to be constructed. Regardless of primary voting behavior, all respondents appeared to construct issue opinions. The effect of earlier answers on issue opinions decreased as the election neared, consistent with the idea that knowledge about the issues increased with time. In experiment 2, placing questions tapping primary voting behavior first affected responses to questions about specific issue opinions, with resulting carryover to a later measure of voting intention. We discuss the implications of these results for consumer judgment processes and for measurement of consumers' attitudes and intentions.

TI INTERPRETING INTERACTIONS - RAW MEANS OR RESIDUAL MEANS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Interpreting interactions is important in analyzing data generated by the ANOVA family of techniques. In this article, we examine how to specify the cell means used to describe an interaction. Although most researchers utilize the raw means that are the output of most analysis packages, R. Rosenthal and R. L. Rosnow suggest an alternative procedure, removing the treatment effects (and possibly the grand means) from the group means and then examining the interaction in isolation. We examine why and under what circumstances it is appropriate to use residual means to examine interactions. How the use of raw means versus residual means affects interpreting interactions is examined in the context of a demonstration experiment. After that, a procedure for interpreting interactions is presented.

TI INTROSPECTION IN CONSUMER RESEARCH - IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPLICATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB On the basis of a review of introspective methods in other social science disciplines, we identify five categories of introspection: (1) researcher introspection, (2) guided introspection, (3) interactive introspection, (4) syncretic combinations, and (5) reflexivity within research. We draw from this literature a set of six methodological issues relevant to the conduct of introspection in consumer research. Because of the recent publication of consumer behavior papers that rely extensively or even exclusively on the researchers' life experiences as data, we consider these methodological issues in detail regarding the conduct of researcher introspection. On the basis of substantive and methodological developments in other categories of introspection, researcher introspection is critiqued in terms of data collection and recording issues, its lack of separation of the roles of the researcher and introspector, and its exclusive focus on one individual. Because of the difficulties of overcoming critical methodological limitations inherent in this research approach, we conclude that researcher introspection has severely limited potential to contribute to future research in consumer behavior. In contrast, we suggest that appropriate use of guided introspection and reflexivity within research can be used to advance theory in consumer behavior. We conclude by discussing the balance between openness and rigor necessitated by the pluralistic composition of the field of consumer research.

TI STRUCTURE, COOPERATION, AND THE FLOW OF MARKET-INFORMATION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article explores the potential impact of individual consumer decisions to transmit or withhold word-of-mouth information on the flow of information in a market. Information flow is examined in networks composed of graphs and nodes, where graphs represent channels that foster information flow and nodes represent sentient decision makers who can potentially impede or foster information flow. We assert that actors in embedded markets first judge the moral hazards imposed by the information they consider for transmission and the social context of transmission, and then moderate their decisions to transmit the information in light of these judgements. We analyze this process using a modified version of Marshall Sahlins's social exchange theory, examine the plausibility of this analysis using two laboratory experiments, and explore the consequences of this behavior at the aggregate level using a computer simulation. Our view highlights the importance of the interplay of individuals and their social context for understanding word-of-mouth processes.

TI PREATTENTIVE MERE EXPOSURE EFFECTS

This article provides evidence that mere exposure effects persist when initial exposures to brand names and product packages are incidental, devoid of any intentional effort to process the brand information. These unintentional mere exposure effects are attributed to preattentive processes and are explained through hemispheric processing theory.

TI GIFT GIVING AS AGAPIC LOVE - AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE EXCHANGE
   PARADIGM-BASED ON DATING EXPERIENCES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The social sciences are dominated by a paradigm that views human behavior as instrumental exchange. It is not surprising that consumer research on gift giving has also been dominated by this exchange paradigm. The present research on dating gift giving among American college students finds support for two variants of this paradigm, but it also reveals an alternative paradigm of gift giving as an expression of agapic love. It is suggested that agapic expressiveness is a needed addition to exchange instrumentalism for understanding gift giving and perhaps for understanding consumer behavior in general.

In separate studies of automobile satisfaction and satisfaction with course instruction, respondents provided the nature of emotional experience, disconfirmation perceptions, and separate attribute satisfaction and dissatisfaction judgments. Analysis confirmed the disconfirmation effect and the effects of separate dimensions of positive and negative affect and also suggested a multidimensional structure to the affect dimensions. Additionally, attribute satisfaction and dissatisfaction were significantly related to positive and negative affect, respectively, and to overall satisfaction. It is suggested that all dimensions tested are needed for a full accounting of postpurchase responses in usage.

Further, the use of heuristics such as rates of occurrence result in more accurate frequency judgments than the use of recall-and-count strategies based on episodic recall.

TI CONSUMER EVALUATIONS OF MULTIPLE VERSUS SINGLE PRICE CHANGE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article examines how consumer evaluations of multiple price changes differ from the evaluation of a single price change of an equal amount. Consistent with R. Thaler's theory about segregation versus integration of gains and losses, we find that multiple price decreases are evaluated more favorably than a single price decrease and multiple price increases are evaluated more unfavorably than a single price increase. However, these effects are moderated by consumer price uncertainty and relative magnitude of the prices being evaluated. Because price-uncertain consumers consider higher ranges of prices acceptable, they are less unfavorable to multiple price increases and more favorable to multiple price decreases than certain consumers. Moreover, when the magnitude of one price is very small relative to other prices, consumers' preference for multiple price decreases (relative to a single price decrease) is reduced. However, this effect is not found when there are price increases.

In addition, the article integrates these concepts through a suggested causal framework. Students evaluated either a high- or a low-involvement product in current use, reported affective responses evoked by it, and assessed their levels of product-derived satisfaction. Analysis shows that two primary dimensions of product evaluation-utilitarian and hedonic judgment-can be viewed as causally antecedent to two dimensions of affect-pleasantness and arousal-and to product satisfaction. Implications of the conceptual framework and empirical findings for the study of consumption events are discussed.

AB Tipping differs from most economic transactions in that consumers who tip are paying a nonobligatory amount for a service that has already been received. Academic research on this unique yet pervasive consumer behavior has focused on the determinants of individuals' tipping decisions. Little attention has been directed at macrolevel issues such as cross-country differences in tipping practices and norms. This article addresses this deficiency by presenting and testing the theory that crosscountry differences in the prevalence of tipping reflect cross-country differences in values. Results of the study generally support the theory.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH

Depth interviews regarding participants' experiences using senior-citizen-type discounts reveal three levels of responsiveness to consumer offerings promoted with age segmentation cues: rejecting senior citizen discounts to avoid self-devaluation, rejecting senior citizen discounts to avoid stigmatization, and assigning positive meanings to the status that promotes senior citizen discount usage. An experimental investigation, undertaken to assess the sequential ordering of these levels of responsiveness, reveals that self-devaluation and perceived stigma mediate age segmentation cue effects on discount usage intention only for younger-aged elderly. Results lend support for a stage model of consumers' progression through phases of responsiveness to ''senior citizen'' labeling.

TI SPOKESPERSON FAME AND VIVIDNESS EFFECTS IN THE CONTEXT OF ISSUE-RELEVANT
   THINKING - THE MODERATING ROLE OF COMPETITIVE SETTING
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Primarily on the basis of research from noncompetitive settings, it is generally believed that nonsubstantive advertising features are ineffective when consumers engage in issue-relevant thinking. Experiment 1 of the current study replicated prior research. Neither spokesperson fame nor the vividness of advertising copy influenced attitudes in noncompetitive settings. However, these same features proved effective in the context of balanced competition. When brands were homogenous (experiment 2) or characterized by large price-quality trade-offs (experiment 3), nonsubstantive features improved attitudes and choice probabilities despite issue-relevant thinking. When trade-offs were small, however, nonsubstantive features were again ineffective. The results suggest that balanced competition can neutralize the effects of substantive features, increase indecision, and promote perceptual contrast. These effects then empower nonsubstantive features to serve as heuristics and/or reduce the risk of postpreference regret.

A secondary comparison was also made between consumers' postpurchase evaluation experiences in general versus those specifically cued by the terms ''satisfaction'' and ''dissatisfaction.'' While some similarities exist, the results show important differences between respondents' postpurchase thoughts versus those f rom both prepurchase and satisfaction. Significant implications of these results for theory, measurement, and future research are discussed.

TI AN INTEGRATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING 2-SIDED PERSUASION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article develops a framework that encompasses past two-sided persuasion research and incorporates additional theory and research on optimal arousal and attitude toward the ad to provide explanations for inconsistencies in previous findings. In particular, explanations are provided for the following: (1) when credibility gains will be enhanced, (2) when refutation is needed, (3) how the message should be structured (in terms of amount and placement of negative information), and (4) what types of attributes should be discounted (in terms of importance, type, and correlation with other attributes). In addition, directions for future research are discussed.

TI EXPLORING LANGUAGE EFFECTS IN ETHNIC ADVERTISING - A SOCIOLINGUISTIC
   PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The authors apply sociolinguistic theories of accommodation to investigate how consumers in a minority subculture respond to the use of their ethnic language in advertising. Specifically, Hispanic consumers' responses to the varying degrees of Spanish-language usage in print advertising were examined. It was found that the effects of Spanish usage in advertising can be usefully explained by accommodation theory. Spanish-language advertising increased Hispanic consumers' perception of advertiser sensitivity to Hispanic culture and people, and this perception in turn enhanced affect toward the advertisements. Yet, after controlling for perceived advertiser sensitivity, it was also found that advertising exclusively in Spanish decreased affect toward the advertisement. This finding may be interpreted to mean that though Spanish-language advertising appears to signal solidarity with the Hispanic community, exclusive use of Spanish in advertising may arouse Hispanic insecurities about language usage. Implications for future research and theory on language choice and usage in communication to consumer subcultures are discussed.

TI PROCESS TRACING OF EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TO TV ADS - REVISITING THE WARMTH

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Because of the transient nature of some emotions stimulated during TV commercials, measurement of emotional reactions at various points during an ad requires process tracing. This research discusses the analysis of process-tracing data using the Warmth Monitor as an illustration. We show that the establishment of the reliability and validity of process-tracing measures hinges on a suitable choice of the relevant domain of (co)variance in the data. The Warmth Monitor is shown to provide a reliable measure of warmth, but questions remain regarding the construct's meaning and valid measurement.

Drama criticism in theater, film, and television is the source used to identify the elements of advertising dramas-narration, plot, story, and character-and to propose models of the two different types. The two models are employed in an empirical analysis of an advertising sample. Consumer effects of classical and vignette dramas are proposed in terms of the attribution theory of persuasion and the elicitation of empathy versus sympathy responses.

TI WORK AND OR FUN - MEASURING HEDONIC AND UTILITARIAN SHOPPING VALUE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumer researchers' growing interest in consumer experiences has revealed that many consumption activities produce both hedonic and utilitarian outcomes. Thus, there is an increasing need for scales to assess consumer perceptions of both hedonic and utilitarian values. This article describes the development of a scale measuring both values obtained from the pervasive consumption experience of shopping. The authors develop and validate the scale using a multistep process. The results demonstrate that distinct hedonic and utilitarian shopping value dimensions exist and are related to a number of important consumption variables. Implications for further applications of the scale are discussed.

The data set consists of every automobile model for which overall injury data was published by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) for the 1989-1991 model years. The empirical analysis in the article indicates that both relative injury and absolute collision losses are never mitigated and usually worsen significantly for airbag-equipped cars relative to belt-only equipped models after airbag adoption. These results are consistent both with the Peltzman hypothesis of driver behavioral changes and at-risk consumers' shifting preference for airbag-equipped models.

In addition, stored product class information was found to be a more important determinant of objective than self-assessed knowledge, while product-related experience was a more important determinant of self-assessed than objective knowledge. We discuss implications of these results for the relationship between self-assessed and objective knowledge and for future research involving consumer knowledge constructs.

AB This research examines the construction of information displays by consumers. This aspect of constructive processing, in which data may be transformed, edited, or inferred, is termed ''restructuring.  Subjects notes and verbal protocols generated during a study are used to examine restructuring behavior when making choices among brands. These methods enable the examination of restructuring and its effect on evaluative processing throughout the course of making a choice. Results demonstrate that consumers do restructure, that restructuring is done in a contingent, opportunistic manner, and that restructuring may influence the type of choice heuristic used (e.g., alternative-based vs. attribute-based).

TI INCORPORATING CHOICE INTO AN ATTITUDINAL FRAMEWORK - ANALYZING MODELS OF
   MENTAL COMPARISON PROCESSES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Choice is introduced into attitudinal models, which traditionally have focused on nonchoice contexts. Four alternative models integrating the information-processing and attitudinal literatures are developed to represent different possible mental comparison processes leading to choice. It is proposed that consumers may compare beliefs about alternatives, or they may compare expectancy-value components, attitudes, or intentions, in order to choose between alternatives. The conditions under which each of these choice models is likely to be employed are discussed. For example, when facing few alternatives where one or more alternatives are somewhat unfamiliar and where beliefs about alternatives can be naturally g into a small number of salient dimensions, consumers are most likely to compare expectancy-value components across alternatives in order to make a choice. In a preliminary test of the proposed framework, the four alternative choice models are tested for a context that fits these specific conditions. A comparative analysis indicates that the Expectancy Comparison Model, which is conceptually appropriate for these conditions, also has the best fit with the data.

TI A MODEL OF PERCEIVED RISK AND INTENDED RISK-HANDLING ACTIVITY

AB On the basis of previous reviews of the perceived-risk concept, a model of risk perception and its effects on consumers' risk-handling behavior is formulated. Hypotheses derived from this model are empirically tested and indicate that, for the setting studied (women purchasing a dress), the intended use of risk-handling activity increases with higher levels of perceived risk. This relationship is more pronounced after the level of risk exceeds the individual's acceptable level of risk. Also of importance in determining the use of a risk-handling activity are the perceived benefit of the type of risk-handling activity and the consumer's inability to absorb a monetary loss.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Risk perceptions have beer employed to understand consumers' use of hazardous products. However, there has been little research linking risk perceptions to actual product use (i.e., risk acceptance). This study examined risk perceptions and alcoholic beverage consumption of 409 women during pregnancy. The survey included a variety of demographic, information search, risk perception, and attitudinal measures. Compared to abstainers, women who continued to drink during pregnancy were less likely to view consuming alcohol in moderation as risky and were less likely to believe that consuming alcohol during pregnancy would harm the unborn child. Drinkers were also older and had less difficulty getting pregnant than abstainers.

TI THE MODERATING EFFECTS OF MESSAGE FRAMING AND SOURCE CREDIBILITY ON THE
   PRICE-PERCEIVED RISK RELATIONSHIP
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB One factor that research has identified as a critical determinant of consumers willingness to buy a new product or brand is the perceived risk associated with the purchase. Consequently, a better understanding of the factors affecting consumers' perceptions of the financial and performance risk entailed by the purchase of a new brand is of both theoretical and pragmatic importance. Previous research has suggested that a new product's price affects consumers' perceptions of risk. The current article extends and integrates previous research by proposing that the effect of price on consumers' perceptions of risk is moderated by two communication factors: message framing and source credibility. The results of an experiment support the predictions that the influence of price on consumers' perceptions of performance risk is greater when the message is framed negatively or the credibility of the source is low. In addition, the results support the prediction that the effect of price on consumers' perceptions of financial risk is greater when the message is framed positively.

TI THE IMPACT OF AUDIOVISUAL INFORMATION ON CHILDRENS PRODUCT-RELATED
   RECALL
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The research addresses the question of when children use visuals to improve their memory performance. In two studies, preschoolers and school-age children were found to encode information most effectively when the visual information was complete and overlapped the audio message. School-age children (seven and eight years old) were also found to recall target information in response to partial visuals paired with audio tracks. However, preschoolers (three, four, and five years old) succeeded in their recall only when complete visuals overlapped the audio information. The findings suggest that younger children's difficulties in encoding partial information can be traced to common types of processing deficits. In addition, the second study tested whether a ''visual superiority effect'' would be evidenced. Children who only heard and children who only saw the information (auditory or visual) performed equally well. This suggests that the critical element in children's processing is the comprehensibility of the information presented, rather than the modality per se.

In study 1, we show that different advertising variation strategies can lead to the development of equally positive attitudes, even though the basis of the attitudes is quite different. In study 2, we show that, despite the appearance of equal effectiveness on the dimensions of extremity, persistence, and confidence, type of advertising repetition strategy differentially influences the extent to which individuals resist change in the face of a counterpersuasive attack.

AB Research in both the consumer and aesthetics literatures suggests that the ambiguity created by a cropped or incomplete object may prompt people to seek closure by supplying the missing part. In turn, this process of resolving the ambiguity can enhance affect. Applying this notion to advertisements, a study is reported that examines whether and when severe cropping of key objects in ads will influence people's product evaluations. The results indicate that severe cropping of objects in ads can enhance product evaluations if people are sufficiently motivated to complete the cropped object and the cropped object does not impede people's attempts to verify the ad claims.

Based on this review, extent of message relevant elaboration is offered as a moderator of primacy versus recency effects in prior research Support for this view is derived from the ability to explain the results of previous studies and from two experiments in which message presentation order and personal relevance of the topic are manipulated n a factorial design. We find that situations that foster high levels of message elaboration lead to greater influence of an initial message on final judgments (a primacy effect) whereas situations that foster low levels of message relevant elaboration lead to greater influence of a second message on final judgments (a recency effect).

An important, but largely unexplored, issue is how this information is processed and used in conjunction with prior beliefs to influence price perceptions. In our initial studies we manipulated prior beliefs and two data-based cues-frequency of price advantage and magnitude of price advantage-to determine their relative influence on consumer price perceptions. Results indicate that prior beliefs affected price perceptions but that the frequency cue exerted a dominating influence. Several follow-up studies demonstrate the robustness of this phenomenon across a variety of presentational and instructional conditions.

Thus, we experimentally investigated the effects of antismoking and cigarette advertising on nonsmoking youths' perceptions (evaluative judgments) of a peer who smokes. Results suggest that exposure to the antismoking ads made salient our seventh-grade subjects' preexisting beliefs that smokers foolishly endanger their health, which resulted in even less favorable evaluations of the smoker's common sense and personal appeal. Further, unlike subjects who saw unrelated (control) ads, those who saw the antismoking ads judged the smoker to be relatively immature and unglamorous. Exposure to the cigarette ads did not significantly affect scale ratings of, but resulted in more favorable thoughts about, the smoker.

TI IMAGES IN ADVERTISING - THE NEED FOR A THEORY OF VISUAL RHETORIC
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB In this article, past consumer research dealing with advertising images is analyzed and critiqued for its underlying assumption: that pictures are reflections of reality. The case against this assumption is presented, and an alternative view, in which visuals are a convention-based symbolic system, is formulated. In this alternative view, pictures must be cognitively processed, rather than absorbed peripherally or automatically. The author argues that current conceptualizations of advertising images are incommensurate with what ads are really like, and that many images currently dismissed as affect laden or information devoid are, in fact, complex figurative arguments. A new theoretical framework for the study of images is advanced in which advertising images are a sophisticated form of visual rhetoric. The process of consumer response implied by the new framework differs radically from past concepts in many ways, but also suggests new ways to approach questions currently open in the literature on the nature and processing of imagery. A pluralistic program for studying advertising pictures as persuasion is outlined.

TI AN EYE-FIXATION ANALYSIS OF CHOICE PROCESSES FOR CONSUMER NONDURABLES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The nature of the choice process for commonly purchased nondurables was examined by tracking eye fixations in a laboratory simulation of supermarket shelving. The observed process contains three stages that were interpreted as (1) orientation, (2) evaluation, and (3) verification. Orientation consisted of an overview of the product display, although some initial screening out of alternatives also occurred. The evaluation stage, the longest by far, was dominated by direct comparisons between two or three alternative products. The last stage, devoted to verification of the tentatively chosen brand-size, mainly examined alternatives with few or no previous fixations. Greater familiarity with a product category led to a choice process that was shorter and that focused on fewer alternatives, but these effects were confined to the evaluation stage. The findings are fully compatible with the general view that the choice process is constructed to adapt to the immediate purchase environment.

TI TRACING THE IMPACT OF ITEM-BY-ITEM INFORMATION ACCESSING ON UNCERTAINTY
   REDUCTION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The impact of item-by-item information accessing on uncertainty reduction is studied under self-selected and researcher-constrained information accessing. Study 1 showed that, at both the aggregate and the individual level, subjective uncertainty reduction assumes several distinct patterns, with the dominant pattern conforming to an accelerating or linear power function. Study 2 revealed that different subjective-uncertainty-reduction patterns tend to be associated with within-options versus within-properties searches. Implications of the findings and the procedure are discussed.

TI HEURISTICS AND BIASES IN TIMING THE REPLACEMENT OF DURABLE PRODUCTS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The process by which individuals make recurrent decisions about when to replace durable goods is examined. Two experiments are reported in which subjects play the role of purchasing agents who must repeatedly decide whether to keep a currently owned manufacturing device or replace it with a superior new one, given uncertainty about the future performance of new and currently owned machines. Replacement patterns are compared with those that would be predicted if subjects made decisions as rational economic agents, following the principles of optimal replacement theory. This comparison reveals a number of systematic departures from optimality that do not vanish with experience. Among these are a tendency to replace at a slower rate than would be predicted by normative theory and a tendency to weigh opportunity costs arising from obsolescence greater than those arising from product deterioration. In addition, subjects display a bias against making replacement purchases given short lapses of time since the previous replacement. The findings are interpreted in terms of known biases in decision making under uncertainty in dynamic and static settings.

TI EFFECTS OF HISPANIC ETHNIC IDENTIFICATION ON MARITAL ROLES IN THE
   PURCHASE DECISION-PROCESS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The research reported in this article investigated the relationship between Hispanic ethnic identification and marital roles as couples proceed through the purchase decision process. Significant differences were found among the Hispanic ethnic identification groups in most of the decision stages for a variety of product categories, even after the effects of social class and length of marriage were removed. The findings of this study revealed a significant positive relationship between ethnic identification and husband dominance in decision making. However, because ethnic identification and product class interact with role specialization and relative influence in decision making, generalizations cannot be made about Hispanic marital roles in the decision-making process. Furthermore, the effect of ethnic identification on marital roles in decision making interacts with the phase of the purchase decision process.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB In this article, we replicate and extend several elements of E. Foxman, P. Tansuhaj, and K. Ekstrom's 1989 study of adolescent influence, while providing an integrative model of teenager influence and a new scale of perceived relative influence. Further, we examine the effect of parental employment status on teens' influence, as well as gender-based differences in perceptions. Motivational aspects, including product importance and usage, provided the strongest and most consistent explanations of teenagers' perceived relative influence across stages and purchase situations. In addition, parental employment status positively influenced teens' perceived influence of durable family purchases. Mothers and daughters generally did not differ in their ratings of the daughters' perceived influence in the durable purchase decision-making process, while fathers' and sons' ratings did differ.

AB Bundling, the joint offering of two or more items, is a common selling strategy, yet little research has been conducted on buyers' evaluation of bundle offers. We developed and tested a model of bundle evaluation in which buyers anchored their evaluation on the item perceived as most important and then made adjustments on the basis of their evaluations of the remaining bundle items. The results of two computerized laboratory experiments suggested that people tend to examine bundle items in a decreasing order of perceived importance and make adjustments to form their overall evaluation of the bundle.

When attribute information was unambiguous, experts based their evaluations on attribute strength, whereas novices relied on country of origin. When attribute information was ambiguous, both experts and novices used country of origin in evaluations. Also, experts and novices used country of origin differently in evaluations. Experts used country of origin to selectively process and recall attribute information, whereas novices used it to differentially interpret subsequent attribute information. The findings are discussed within the framework of stereotyping.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Recorded music is a multibillion dollar industry, yet little consumer research has addressed the decision-making process behind its purchase. This study examined the responses new rock music creates in the listener and how those responses influenced the intention to later buy the music. Experimental findings revealed that the sensorial, emotional, imaginal, and analytical responses to music all had direct effects on the affective and experimential responses, which in turn influenced purchase intention. The strongest indicator of purchase intention was the need to reexperience the music. Liking the music (e.g., affective response) was not as strong an indicator of purchase intention as was the experimental response, which measures the music's ability to create an absorbing experience.

The purpose of this article was to empirically document the magnitudes of alpha coefficients obtained in behavioral research, compare these obtained values with guidelines and recommendations set forth by individuals such as Nunnally (1967, 1978), and provide insights into research design characteristics that may influence the size of coefficient alpha. Average reported alpha coefficients ranged from .70 for values and beliefs to .82 for job satisfaction. With few exceptions, there were no substantive relationships between the magnitude of coefficient alpha and the research design characteristics investigated.

TI THE ROLE OF CONSUMERS INTUITIONS IN INFERENCE MAKING
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Traditional explorations of inference making have examined consumers' reactions to product descriptions that lack information about salient attributes.  Such studies frequently report systematically lower evaluations of incompletely described alternatives along with a generally low incidence of unprompted attribute-to-attribute inference.  We argue that the nature and likelihood of an inference are dependent on the cues available at the time of decision making, and that some cues may exert a disproportionate influence on inference behavior.  In several experiments in which subjects were presented with competing cues that implied different values of a missing attribute, we show that intuitive beliefs about the relationships between attributes are perceived as a particularly reliable basis for interattribute inference.  Strong beliefs appear capable of superseding other compelling cues and may induce consumers to generate inferences spontaneously.

AB Scanner panel data analyses for sweetened and unsweetened drink categories (with four brands in each) support the presence of a region of price insensitivity around a reference price. The analyses also suggest that consumers with higher average reference price have a wider latitude of price acceptance. Consumers with a higher frequency of purchase (i.e., shorter average interpurchase time interval) are found to have a narrower latitude of price acceptance, because they are more aware of the range of price distributions. Finally, consumers with a higher average brand loyalty have a wider latitude of price acceptance, demonstrating greater tolerance of price fluctuations.

TI LANGUAGE AND CONSUMER MEMORY - THE IMPACT OF LINGUISTIC DIFFERENCES
   BETWEEN CHINESE AND ENGLISH
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Languages of the Asia-Pacific region, such as Chinese, are based on ideographic writing systems which are radically different from the alphabetic systems used in Western languages, such as English.  We propose that structural differences between Chinese and English affect mental representations which, in turn, influence consumer memory of verbal information.  Specifically, unaided brand recall should be differentially affected in Chinese and English when it is spoken compared with when it is written.  Furthermore, recognition should be differentially affected in Chinese and English when brand names are learned auditorily compared with when they are learned visually.  Results of a cross-cultural experiment conducted in China and in the United States confirm predictions for unaided brand recall and partially confirm predictions for recognition.

TI THE SPOKEN AND THE UNSPOKEN - A HERMENEUTIC APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING
   THE CULTURAL VIEWPOINTS THAT UNDERLIE CONSUMERS EXPRESSED MEANINGS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article draws on the philosophical concept of the hermeneutical circle to explore the cultural viewpoints that underlie the meanings expressed by consumers.  Phenomenological interviews were conducted with adult female consumers.  The interviews are interpreted first by the identification of an exemplary image or event that we describe as a symbolic metaphor.  We show that these symbolic metaphors highlight key personal meanings that each participant ascribed to her consumer experiences.  We then use a hermeneutic logic known as intertextual analysis to show that these personal meanings reflect more general cultural viewpoints that are implicitly conveyed in language.  These intertextual interpretations offer insights into the sociocultural meanings that underlie skeptical, nostalgic, and pragmatic consumer orientations.  A concluding discussion is given to key implications and areas for future research that follow from this hermeneutic approach.

TI MARKET PRICE VARIATION, PERCEIVED PRICE VARIATION, AND CONSUMERS PRICE
   SEARCH DECISIONS FOR DURABLE GOODS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Previous studies have consistently found that most consumers undertake relatively little prepurchase search for durable goods and do even less price-comparison shopping despite the reported importance of price to consumers' purchase decisions.  This article proposes and tests two possible explanations for why consumers' willingness to engage in price search does not increase concomitantly with the price variation of durable goods.  The first potential explanation, that consumers simply underestimate the market price variation, was not supported.  The second possible explanation, which builds upon Weber's law of psychophysics and Thaler's transaction utility theory, was supported.  The data indicate that the psychological utility that a consumer derives from saving a fixed amount of money is inversely related to the price of the item.  In this case, even if consumers believe that the price variation of more expensive items tends to be greater, their motivation to spend time in price-comparison shopping for these items may not increase as much as expected.

TI THE BRIDGE FROM TEXT TO MIND - ADAPTING READER-RESPONSE THEORY TO
   CONSUMER RESEARCH
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumer research on advertising response has gradually separated the act of reading an ad from the acquisition of brand information.  Because the advertising text is the pathway through which brand information is accessed, current models truncate the process that leads to response in a way that distorts our view of both advertising and the mind that reads it.  This author proposes that reader-response theory would help researchers study the process of reading as an essential link between advertising text and consumer response.  Reader-response theory is a movement within literary criticism that emphasizes the study of reading over formal textual analysis.

TI EFFECTS OF PRESENTATION ORDER AND COMMUNICATION MODALITY ON RECALL AND
   ATTITUDE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Previous consumer research has attributed differences in persuasion between communication modes (e.g., audio vs. print) to differences in the audience's control over the pace of argument presentation.  It is argued in this article that communication modes also differ in the extent to which argument order is an important determinant of persuasion.  The results of two studies show that, while order of argument presentation affects persuasion with audio messages, order is unimportant with print messages.  These differences appear to be due to a first-in-first-our retrieval strategy employed in response to audio presentations but not in response to visual presentations.  Implications of the research for understanding how consumers process messages and how to develop effective communications are discussed.

I contrast these two activities. For analysis I describe seven operations: categorization, abstraction, comparison, dimensionalization, integration, iteration, and refutation. For interpretation I suggest metaphor and other literary devices as models for understanding the meanings of others, identifying patterns in these meanings, and representing how systems of meanings reproduce culture. The purpose of these descriptions is to suggest a vocabulary for and stimulate discussion about how researchers using qualitative analytical techniques arrive at conclusions and make sense of data.

TI SPECIAL POSSESSIONS AND THE EXPRESSION OF MATERIAL VALUES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Possessions often reveal characteristics of their owners. This research examines the important possessions of consumers low and high in materialism to assess the extent to which these possessions express their owners' material values. Two aspects of the expression of values were examined-characterization, in which possessions embody aspects of their owner's values, and communication, in which possessions serve to signal the owner's values to others. Three studies are reported; they demonstrate that material values are characterized in the type of possessions valued and in the private and public meanings of these possessions. The data also show that a person's material values can be communicated through socially constructed stereotypes about possessions and about the relationship between possessions and their owners. In addition, study findings suggest that low-materialism consumers have an orientation that emphasizes both the interpersonal/symbolic value and the hedonic potential of possessions; the orientation toward possessions of those high in materialism seems to emphasize more utilitarian as well as appearance and status concerns.

TI MEMORY-BASED PRODUCT JUDGMENTS - EFFECTS OF INVOLVEMENT AT ENCODING AND

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Two experiments investigated the proposition that memory retrieval is affected by consumer involvement with a product at the time product information is first received as well as when a memory-based judgment is formed.  Results suggest that involvement at the time of a memory-based judgment increases the intensity of search for judgment-relevant information in memory.  Further, subjects seemed to base their memory-based judgment on a prior evaluation (stored in memory) when involvement was either low at the time of memory-based judgment or high both at the time of this judgment and when the prior evaluation was formed.  In contrast, subjects recalled (and presumably used) specific product information when their level of involvement at the time of judgment increased relative to when the prior evaluation was constructed.  These findings are consistent with the cognitive economy principle.  Implications for the role of memory in product judgment and evaluation are discussed.

The goal of this project has always been to inspire researchers to engage in action-oriented programs of research aimed at improving society and the lives of consumers.  On the basis of a dialogue with Hetrick and Lozada's thoughtful work, we suggest that the critical imagination project can still empower both consumers and consumer researchers.  Toward this end, we respond to four important issues:  First, what is a reasonable interpretation of critical theory?  Second, does an accurate interpretation of critical theory necessarily involve a capitalist critique?  Third, what are the core ideas of critical theory?  And finally, what kinds of methods will justify a critical theory?

TI ARE YOUNG-CHILDREN ADAPTIVE DECISION-MAKERS - A STUDY OF AGE-DIFFERENCES
   IN INFORMATION SEARCH BEHAVIOR
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB How adaptive are young children as decision makers?  Although similar questions have been raised frequently with regard to adult consumers, very little attention has been paid to the nature of consumer decision-making abilities in young children.  The purpose of this article is to explore the emergence of adaptivity in young children's decision-making skills in the context of predecisional search behavior.  This article specifically examines the extent to which young children are capable of adapting their search behavior to differing levels of search costs and benefits in the decision environment.  We report results from two experiments, conducted with children aged four to seven years, in which we examined children's search activity in the context of a game called ''house of prizes.''  The game involved making a choice between two ''houses'' that contained prizes hidden behind each ''window.''  Children were allowed to search behind the windows to uncover the prizes prior to making their choices, with differing costs and benefits of doing so.  Data regarding the extent of search conducted by children of different ages suggest that the ability to adapt emerges during the preschool years in a limited fashion and develops rapidly thereafter.

We use a Bayesian analysis to examine what such measures contribute to researchers' beliefs about competing theories and suggest when and why manipulation and confounding checks add to the ability to differentiate among alternative theoretical explanations of empirical results.  We first focus on the case in which a statistically significant between-group difference on the dependent variable is augmented by information from a single indicator of the intended manipulation and a single indicator of a possible confound.  We then examine the implications of multiple indicators and the use of a Bayesian analysis of continuous effect sizes.

TI COPYWRITERS IMPLICIT THEORIES OF COMMUNICATION - AN EXPLORATION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Advertising copywriters, in common with other craftspeople, seemingly work without theories, even though their work exhibits insights about consumer motivation and behavior.  This research explored the existence of implicit theories of communication among a sample of copywriters.  The findings indicated that copywriters do articulate a common set of informal theories that are based on perceptions of the writing of advertising as an internal dialogue.  Aspects of these implicit theories differ from many assumptions and findings of current formal theories of advertising.  These differences exist in the areas of the nature of affect toward advertising, the nature of the connection between advertising and the brand advertised, and involvement with the advertising message.  These implicit theories form the basis for suggesting changes in understanding copywriters' work and for academic and applied research on advertising and marketing.

TI A RATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF THE COMPROMISE EFFECT - USING MARKET DATA
   TO INFER UTILITIES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article explores the possibility that consumers use market data to make inferences about product utilities.  The argument is made by means of an example based on the ''compromise effect'' found in extant experimental data.  This phenomenon is generally looked at as a manifestation of deviations from rationality in choice.  However, assuming full rationality, I describe a decision rule that is based on consumers' inferences about their personal valuation of alternatives from the portfolio of market offerings and some information about their own relative tastes.  Through a number of examples, I will argue that consumers often use this or similar decision rules to amke inferences about utility.  I then show that the decision rule may generate compromise effects in experiments and that it may be sustainable.  The compromise effect could therefore be seen as preliminary evidence that consumers make such inferences.

TI ON THE UTILITY OF CONSUMERS THEORIES IN JUDGMENTS OF COVARIATION
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Previous research on people's proficiency in assessing covariation between continuous variables is reviewed, and the impact of prior expectations and characteristics of the evidence on judgment accuracy is discussed.  The present study investigates how the availability of a theory (i.e., prior expectations of relatedness) influences assessments of contingency as a function of the diagnosticity of the data.  The results indicate that prior expectations have beneficial effects on the accuracy of covariation judgments, even when the relationship implied by the theory is inconsistent with the data.  Little evidence is found for a multiplicative combination of theory and data, although diagnostic data lead to more accurate judgments.  The study also examines some mechanisms that might underlie these effects and presents evidence that the utility of theories is due to prior expectations that give rise to an active hypothesis-testing approach to the assessment of contingency.  The findings suggest that prior expectations do not necessarily have dysfunctional (i.e., biasing) effects on judgments of covariation and that theories, even when they are inconsistent with the data, may facilitate the perception of contingency if they are used as hypotheses to be tested on data.

TI TOWARD A RECONCILIATION OF MARKET POWER AND INFORMATION THEORIES OF
   ADVERTISING EFFECTS ON PRICE ELASTICITY
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Prior work on the economic effects of advertising has presented conflicting views.  Some authors have suggested that advertising creates market power by artificially differentiating brands and thereby lowering price elasticity.  Others have viewed advertising as an efficient source of information about the existence of substitutes, arguing that advertising increases price elasticity.  The present research proposes a unifying theoretical model in which advertising affects price elasticity through its influence on two mediating constructs:  the size of the consideration set and the relative strength of preference.  Pretests 1 and 2 examine the effects of advertising on these two constructs.  Results from the main experiment show that, in accordance with the theoretical framework, the same advertisements that increased price elasticity in some decision environments decreased it in others.

A legal case involving the prosecution of a mail fraud known as Chonda-Za is used to illustrate seduction, and the concept is defined in terms of social constructionist theory.  We identify five stages in the unfolding of a seduction and draw parallels and contrasts to the formation of a normal exchange relationship.  We explore the enrollment stage in more detail and model it as a matter of inducing consumers to accept progressively more involving role agreements.  The distinction between legitimate and illegitimate seduction is also examined.

TI ABORTION IN AMERICA - A CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Abortion is the most frequently performed surgical procedure in this country, yet its provision to consumers remains one of the most contentious issues within our society.  The purpose of this article is to broaden our understanding of this problem by examining abortion from a consumer-behavior perspective.  The phenomenological study described in this article revealed that (1) a wide gap exists between the language of the public debate and that of private decision making, (2) the language of private decision making reflects a moral standard used frequently by women yet virtually ignored in the public debate, and (3) women who take charge of their own decisions cope better with the emotional aftermath, whether their decision is for birth or for abortion.  The article closes with a discussion of policy implications that arise from this feminist look at the abortion dilemma as well as broader implications for consumer behavior.

Market performance expectations are argued to be largely rational in nature yet adaptive to changing market conditions. Customer satisfaction is conceptualized as a cumulative construct that is affected by market expectations and performance perceptions in any given period and is affected by past satisfaction from period to period. An empirical study that supports adaptive market expectations and stable market satisfaction using data from the Swedish Customer Satisfaction Barometer is reported.

AB Previous research has predicted that direct product experience will be superior to advertising in communicating information about products.  In experiment 1 of the present study, claims about search attributes were better recognized and beliefs about search attributes were more accessible and more confidently held after exposure to ads in comparison with direct experience of two inexpensive packaged products.  Experiment 2 replicated the above effects on claim recognition, belief accessibility, and confidence for two consumer durables under low-involvement conditions.  It also showed that search attributes were more frequently mentioned and were rated as more important after exposure to advertising than after direct experience; the opposite was true for experience attributes.  These effects on frequency of mention and attribute importance were significantly weaker under high-involvement than under low-involvement conditions.

TI HOW CONSUMERS CONSUME - A TYPOLOGY OF CONSUMPTION PRACTICES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article examines what people do when they consume. In recent interpretive consumer research, three research streams have emerged, each portraying how people consume through a distinctive metaphor: consuming as experience, consuming as integration, and consuming as classification. The research reported here-a two-year observational case study of baseball spectators in Chicago's Wrigley Field bleachers-builds on this literature to systematically detail the universe of actions that constitute consuming. The resulting typology refines, extends, and synthesizes the three existing approaches to consuming and adds a fourth dimension-consuming as play-to yield a comprehensive vocabulary for describing how consumers consume. The usefulness of the typology is demonstrated by applying it to develop an alternative conception of materialism as a style of consuming.

It is found that increasing self-referencing increases message elaboration and can increase persuasion when message arguments are strong. However, when self-referencing is increased in the presence of other variables that also enhance elaboration, the favorable effect of self-referencing on persuasion is moderated or reversed. A two-factor explanation is employed to generate predictions and account for results.

Three spending patterns emerged: (1) a generalized inverted U pattern, with spending rising sharply as households shift from young single to young married, then remaining relatively high, and falling sharply at the older married and/or older single stages, (2) generally increasing expenditures across stages until the last one or two stages, and (3) generally decreasing expenditures across the life cycle. Expenditures are especially influenced by the presence of young children in the household.

TI SUBCULTURES OF CONSUMPTION - AN ETHNOGRAPHY OF THE NEW BIKERS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article introduces the subculture of consumption as an analytic category through which to better understand consumers and the manner in which they organize their lives and identities. Recognizing that consumption activities, product categories, or even brands may serve as the basis for interaction and social cohesion, the concept of the subculture of consumption solves many problems inherent in the use of ascribed social categories as devices for understanding consumer behavior. This article is based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork with Harley-Davidson motorcycle owners. A key feature of the fieldwork was a process of progressive contextualization of the researchers from outsiders to insiders situated within the subculture. Analysis of the social structure, dominant values, and revealing symbolic behaviors of this distinct, consumption-oriented subculture have led to the advancement of a theoretical framework that situates subcultures of consumption in the context of modern consumer culture and discusses, among other implications, a symbiosis between such subcultures and marketing institutions. Transferability of the principal findings of this research to other subcultures of consumption is established through comparisons with ethnographies of other self-selecting, consumption-oriented subcultures.

TI CREATING CONSUMERS IN THE 1930S - PHILLIPS,IRNA AND THE RADIO SOAP-OPERA
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The 1930s marked an important stage in the evolution of a mass consumer society in the United States. The current article examines the roles that Ima Phillips and the early radio soap opera played in that process. Through the daytime serial, Phillips developed a program format that appealed to American housewives, who were the likely purchasers of most household products. She adjusted story lines to meet the selling needs of her sponsors; she used soap opera characters as effective product spokespersons; and she designed program promotions to stimulate product sales. However, at the same time that her programs sold products contributing to social change, they also reinforced traditional expectations about the roles of women as housewives and mothers.

   REFERENCE DEPENDENCE
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Mental accounting principles for multiple events were replicated and then extended to pricing situations that were designed to moderate these principles if reference dependence is proportional(i.e., if consumers evaluate events in terms of proportional deviations from reference states rather than raw deviations). Prices were stated with or without popular percentage-based pricing frames such as ''33% off.'' Mental accounting principles generally prevailed in the absence of percentage-based frames. However, percentage-based frames altered two principles and increased tendencies toward the others. The findings demonstrate that mental accounting principles, price perception, and reference dependence are sensitive to the ways in which deviations from reference states are framed.

TI WAITING TIME AND DECISION-MAKING - IS TIME-LIKE MONEY
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Time is a resource. As such, consumers have to make decisions regarding their use of time in the purchase and consumption of goods and services. Using prospect theory and mental accounting as theoretical frameworks, this article investigates whether consumers treat time like money when they make decisions. In a series of studies, we found that the value of consumers' time is not constant but depends on contextual characteristics of the decision situation. Our results also suggest that in deterministic situations, people make decisions involving time losses in a manner consistent with the convex loss function proposed by prospect theory. However, in decision making under conditions of risk, people seem to make risk-averse choices with respect to decisions in the domain of time in contrast to the risk-seeking behavior often found with respect to decisions involving losses of money. We discuss the nonfungibility of time as an explanation for the discrepancy between decisions involving time and those involving money.

TI UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF COLOR - HOW THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN
   AVAILABLE AND REQUIRED RESOURCES AFFECTS ATTITUDES
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The impact of presenting full-color, black-and-white, and color-highlighted ad photos is examined under different processing resource conditions. When viewers devote few resources to processing, ads with some color outperform black-and-white ads. However, when viewers engage in more effortful ad processing, attitudes are sensitive to the match between available and required resources. When the substantial resources devoted to ad processing are inadequate for thorough ad scrutiny, black-and-white ads or those that color highlight aspects highly relevant to ad claims are more persuasive. By contrast, when available resources better approximate those required for extensive ad scrutiny, full-color ads or ads that color highlight ad photo elements that are highly relevant to the ad claims are more persuasive than either black-and-white ads or ads that color highlight aspects of low relevance to ad claims. These outcomes are interpreted by extending notions offered by elaboration-likelihood and resource theories.

Poststructuralist interpretive procedures were used to analyze interviews with 30 male and female consumers, aged 6-54. This discourse analysis led to the development of three process-orientated themes: (1) the ideology of self-control, (2) the social processes of normalization and problematization, and (3) the operation of the disciplinary gaze. The systematic manifestations of these themes are illustrated across a range of consumer experiences and body-focused perceptions. Implications of these themes for the theoretical conceptualizations of body image and the nature of self-concept in contemporary consumer culture are discussed.

TI CONSUMER MYTHS - FRYES TAXONOMY AND THE STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS OF
   CONSUMPTION TEXT
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article presents a structural analysis of myths in consumption text, using Northrop Frye's taxonomy of mythol to assign consumer narratives and selected advertisements to four categories of mythic plots: comedy, romance, tragedy, and irony. Frye's categorization scheme derives from literature, and the plot types embody structural links between consumption myths and those found in other cultural texts. Each mythos also incorporates values encoded in the plot that reappear in consumption narratives and in advertising appeals using mythic patterns and characterization. Frye's taxonomy is first applied to a reanalysis of Thanksgiving narratives in Wallendorf and Arnould's '''We Gather Together': Consumption Rituals of Thanksgiving Day'' and next to an analysis of pre-Thanksgiving food advertising coupons. The analysis demonstrates that the Thanksgiving narratives and related advertising exemplars fit into conventional plot structures that serve as organizing devices for both the articulation of consumption experience and the design of consumer appeals.

TI REASONS FOR SUBSTANTIAL DELAY IN CONSUMER DECISION-MAKING
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This study proposes a typology of reasons why people substantially delay important consumer decisions. The delay reasons we study are drawn from delay typologies identified in other contexts as well as from the product diffusion literature. Two studies reported here examine why subjects delay consumer decisions. These support most of the reasons in the proposed typology, while some unanticipated delay reasons also emerge. We find that the delay reasons are related to the reasons consumers stop delaying, a process that we call delay closure, and are also related to the amount of time that consumers spend in different stages of the decision-making process. A final study supports a conceptual framework to classify these delay reasons based on the two dimensions of internal versus external locus of causation, and whether the purpose of delay is related to the decision or to unrelated activities.

Experiment 1 shows that name remembrance increases request compliance, but name forgetting does not cause a decrease in compliance. Experiments 2 and 3 show that name remembrance is perceived as a compliment by the person remembered, which mediates compliance with the purchase request. Experimental manipulations of the likelihood of name remembrance (experiment 2) and need for self-enhancement (experiment 3) provide results consistent with a complimentary explanation for the findings.

TI BEHAVIORAL FREQUENCY JUDGMENTS - AN ACCESSIBILITY DIAGNOSTICITY
   FRAMEWORK
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Marketing research surveys often elicit behavioral frequency reports. When estimating the number of times a respondent engages in a behavior, s/he may use information about the behavior stored in memory, information provided by the response context, or both. Based on an accessibility-diagnosticity framework, we theorize that the probability of using context-based information in forming a frequency judgment is inversely proportional to the diagnosticity of the alternate inputs accessible in memory. That is, when memory-based information is accessible and diagnostic, contextual information is not used; when memory-based information is accessible but not diagnostic, the use of contextual information depends on its perceived diagnosticity. Finally, when memory-based information is not accessible, contextual information is used even when its diagnosticity is questionable. The results of three experiments support this model. Theoretical implications and recommendations for questionnaire design are discussed.

In experiment 1, in a static-choice context, subjects in conditions in which the odor is congruent with the product class are found to spend more time processing the data, are more holistic in their processing, are more likely to go beyond the information given, and are more likely to spread their choices evenly over the whole choice set than are subjects in the incongruent-odor conditions. In experiment 2, in a dynamic-choice context, subjects in the congruent conditions are more likely to exhibit behavior that is consistent with variety seeking than are subjects in the incongruent conditions.

TI Liberatory postmodernism and the reenchantment of consumption

AB In this article, we elaborate on various key ideas about consumption and consumer from a theoretical position that we have labeled ''liberatory postmodernism.'' By unmasking the limitations of modernism that have to do with the onerous nature of its metanarratives and narrow conventionalism, we show that postmodern developments offer alternate visions of consumption processes that have an emancipatory potential. The analysis in our article begins with a discussion of the philosophical foundations of modernism and postmodernism followed by a cultural critique of modernism-exposing, for example, the modernist distinction between production and consumption and the privileging of production over consumption. We demonstrate how postmodernism is concerned with the reversing of the conditions of modernity and with a wide range of issues regarding the construction of the subject (i.e., the consumer), the role of the symbolic in consumption processes, the notion of the spectacularization of life, the creation of the hyperreal, and the cultural signification of fragmentation. We conclude the article with a proposal for an epistemology of consumption that subsumes scientific knowledge under a broader category of narrative knowledge and recognizes multivocality of consumption forms.

TI Asymmetric decoy effects on lower-quality versus higher-quality brands:
   Meta-analytic and experimental evidence
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Prior research demonstrates that adding decoys to choice sets can increase choice shares of brands similar to decoys while reducing shares of brands dissimilar to decoys. Such effects have been dubbed attraction effects and violate the principles of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) and regularity. We report a metaanalysis that, in addition to revealing heretofore unsupported range effects, demonstrates an effect of brand quality. Decoys reduce shares of lower-quality competitors more than they reduce shares of higher-quality competitors. Moreover, whereas IIA is violated throughout, regularity is violated only when higher-quality brands are targeted. Decoys increase shares of higher-quality brands but typically do not increase shares of lower-quality brands. To assess the generalizability of the mete-analytic pattern, we tested decoy effects on two distinct populations in a large experiment. The more traditional population replicated the mete-analytic pattern (standard asymmetry) while the more nontraditional population reversed it. These findings suggest that while the standard asymmetry is replicable, it may not generalize to all market segments.

TI The impact of context on variety seeking in product choices
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB One reason consumers seek variety in product choices is to satisfy a need for stimulation. It is suggested that consumers may try to achieve an optimal level of stimulation by balancing the stimulation sought from product choice with the stimulation available from the choice context. Two laboratory experiments are conducted that show that causing changes in the choice context (thus increasing stimulation) decreases the amount of variety seeking subjects exhibit in product choices. Specifically, the results of the experiments suggest that consumers' needs for stimulation may be met by providing variety in a different product category or in other aspects of the choice context. A limiting condition to this finding is also examined. If positive affect is induced along with stimulation, then the reduction in variety-seeking behavior is mitigated.

TI Two forms of compulsive consumption: Comorbidity of compulsive buying
   and binge eating
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Several authors have articulated the need for broader theories or models to account for multiple forms of compulsive or addictive consumption. Development of these broader theories requires more information regarding the overlap and interrelationship of specific consumption disorders. Two studies are presented here to examine the comorbidity of compulsive buying and eating disorders involving binge eating. Study 1 found that women diagnosed as having binge eating disorder had significantly greater compulsive buying tendencies than nonbinge eaters of similar weight. Study 2 showed that compulsive buyers were more likely to have engaged in binge eating, had more symptoms characteristic of both binge sating disorder and bulimia nervosa, and were more likely to be clinically diagnosed as having an eating disorder than a matched control group.

TI Normative influences on impulsive buying behavior
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Although consumer researchers have investigated impulse buying for nearly 50 years, almost no research has empirically examined its normative aspects. This article presents conceptual and empirical evidence that consumers' normative evaluations (i.e., judgments about the appropriateness of engaging in impulse buying behavior) moderate the relationship between the impulse buying trait and consumers' buying behaviors. Specifically, the relationship between the buying impulsiveness trait and related buying behaviors is significant only when consumers believe that acting on impulse is appropriate. The findings from two studies across student and retail customer samples converge and support the hypothesized moderating role of consumers' normative evaluations.

TI Assessing the domain specificity of deal proneness: A field study
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Results of two studies designed to assess the manner in which the deal proneness construct is best conceptualized are presented. On the basis of a review of the sales promotion literature, three alternatives are identified: (1) deal proneness is a general construct that encompasses various deal types (i.e., a single deal proneness construct), (2) deal proneness is a domain-specific construct (e.g., coupon proneness, sale proneness, rebate proneness), or (3) deal proneness is a construct that includes only certain types of deals (e.g., price-oriented deals, active-oriented deals). Across both studies, operationalizations consistent with each of the alternatives are developed, confirmatory factor models consistent with each are compared, and the predictive validity of the alternatives is assessed by relating operationalizations consistent with each alternative to a variety of deal-responsive behaviors collected unobtrusively in natural field settings. Results support treating deal proneness as a domain-specific construct.

TI How is a possession ''me'' or ''not me''? Characterizing types and an
   antecedent of material possession attachment
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Material possession attachment, a property of the relationship between a specific person and a specific object of possession, reflects the extent of ''me-ness'' associated with that possession. The two Q-methodological studies reported here investigated the nature of this me-ness (and ''not me-ness''). Study 1 explores different types of attachment and how these types portray various facets of a person's life story (i.e., identity). It shows how strong Versus weak attachment, affiliation and/or autonomy seeking, and past, present, or future temporal orientation combine to form qualitatively distinct types of psychological significance. Study 2 begins development of a nomological network encompassing attachment by showing how mode of gift receipt (self-gift vs. interpersonal gift), as an antecedent, influences attachment type. Study 2 also examines aspects of successful and unsuccessful gifts. Both studies demonstrate that unidimensional affect fails to adequately describe or explain attachment. Together, the two studies suggest a more parsimonious way to represent person-possession relationships than has been offered in previous studies. Moreover, the findings help delineate the boundaries of attachment (e.g., What does it mean to say a possession is ''not me''?).

   behavior
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH

The results suggest (1) the importance of intracultural variation in the study of culture, (2) differences between experts and novices as a robust source of this variation, (3) novel insights into the relationship between expertise and sociocultural phenomena, and (4) the potential for investigating attitude structure, categorization, and attribution as products of causal reasoning originating from cultural belief systems. The study also demonstrates the synergy created by diverse research methods.

TI Cue representation and selection effects of arousal on persuasion
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB A popular prediction in persuasion research is that decreased ability to process information increases reliance on peripheral cues and decreases reliance on central claims. This article explains why this prediction does not necessarily hold when processing capacity is impaired by high arousal. Three experiments suggest that two types of processes underlie arousal effects on persuasion. Arousal induces selective processing of cues that are diagnostic at the expense of cues that are nondiagnostic-the selection effect. Arousal may also dilute the influence of cues that are capacity demanding-the representation effect. It is therefore important to disentangle the diagnosticity of persuasion cues from their processing demands.

TI Caring consumers: Gendered consumption meanings and the juggling
   lifestyle
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article explores the meanings that consumption experiences hold for professional working mothers engaged in the culturally prominent lifestyle known as ''juggling.'' A discussion is given to prior research documenting the cultural and historical processes that gave rise to this lifestyle pattern. These analyses suggest that ''jugglers'' of the baby boom generation have been socialized in a common system of conflicting cultural ideals, beliefs, and gender ideologies. A hermeneutic research approach is used to explicate the emic consumer meanings that arise in relation to the participants' salient life concerns and their sense of personal history. An etic framework is then derived that further analyzes these perceptions in the context of issues related to the social construction of feminine identities and cultural conceptions of motherhood. The conceptual and methodological implications of the emic and etic frameworks for consumer research are discussed.

TI Moderators of the impact of self-reference on persuasion
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article examines two related issues: how variation in the level of self-reference in which people engage affects their persuasion and what factors may moderate self-reference effects. Respondents viewed ads that varied on two dimensions intended to influence the use of self-reference, namely, the wording of the ad copy and the perspective from which the ad photo was shot. Results indicated that an initial (moderate) increase in self-referencing enhanced persuasion, while a further (extreme) increase undermined persuasion. These effects emerged, however, only when subjects were highly motivated to attend to the ad. When ad recipients' motivation was low, self-referencing had no effect.

TI Figures of rhetoric in advertising language
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB A rhetorical figure can be defined as an artful deviation in the form taken by a statement. Since antiquity dozens of figures have been cataloged, ranging from the familiar (rhyme, pun) to the obscure (antimetabole). Despite the frequent appearance of rhetorical figures in print advertisements, their incorporation into advertising theory and research has been minimal. This article develops a framework for classifying rhetorical figures that distinguishes between figurative and nonfigurative text, between two types of figures (schemes and tropes), and among four rhetorical operations that underlie individual figures (repetition, reversal, substitution, and destabilization). These differentiations in the framework are supported by preliminary validation data and are linked to suggested consumer responses. The article also considers the theoretical import of the proposed framework for future research on rhetorical structure in advertising.

An experiment using actual television programs found that positive emotions directly enhance program liking, while negative emotions have a deleterious effect. However, the latter effect diminishes when viewers believe that the negative emotions elicited by the programs do not signal threats to their well-being. These findings support the theory that positive emotions influence evaluations via simple decision heuristics, while negative emotions motivate detailed analyses of the emoting event or stimulus.

TI Increasing the persuasiveness of fear appeals: The effect of arousal and
   elaboration
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB We investigate the conditions under which messages that prompt low and high levels of fear are likely to be effective. Our premise is that when a low level of fear is ineffective, it is because there is insufficient elaboration of the harmful consequences of engaging in the destructive behavior. By contrast, when appeals arousing high levels of fear are ineffective, it is because too much elaboration on the harmful consequences interferes with processing of the recommended change in behavior. We find support for these expectations in the context of a communication advocating that people stop smoking. The elaboration-enhancing interventions used, self-reference and imagery processing, increased the persuasiveness of a low-fear appeal by prompting elaboration on the harmful consequences of smoking, whereas the use of two elaboration-suppressing interventions, reference to others and objective processing, increased the persuasiveness of a high-fear appeal by decreasing the extent to which consumers deny harmful consequences.

TI The effect of measuring intent on brand-level purchase behavior
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Previous research has demonstrated that merely asking consumers purchase intent questions has a significant impact on their actual purchase incidence in the category. Our article extends this research to explore the impact of the ''mere-measurement'' effect at the brand level. We hypothesize that there are predictable patterns of brand-level purchase effects that depend on whether a consumer has previously made a purchase in the product category. The results demonstrate that current owners of cars are more likely to repurchase the brands they currently own when they are asked intent questions. In addition, the purchase behavior of current car owners is more consistent with their brand attitudes when they are asked intent questions. First-time car buyers, on the other hand, are more likely to purchase brands that have large market shares when asked intent questions. Finally, we discuss both the implications of these results and opportunities for future research.

TI As the crow flies: Bias in consumers' map-based distance judgments
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumers make distance judgments when they decide which store to visit or which route to take. However, these judgments may be prone to various spatial perception biases. While there is a rich literature on spatial perceptions in urban planning and environmental and cognitive psychology, there is little in the field of consumer behavior. In this article we introduce the topic of spatial perceptions as an area of research In marketing. We extend the literature on spatial perceptions by proposing that consumers use the direct distance between the endpoints of a path, or the distance ''as the crow flies,'' as a source of information while making distance judgments-the shorter the direct distance, the shorter the distance estimate. We study two spatial features that affect direct distance-path angularity (i.e., the size of the angle between path segments) and path direction (i.e., whether the path retraces back or not). We further propose and demonstrate that the direct-distance bias is due to the perceptual salience of direct distance and Is used by consumers in an automatic manner. Theoretical implications for the manner in which consumers process spatial information and the use of cognitive heuristics while making spatial judgments are discussed.

TI Mental budgeting and consumer decisions
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumers often set budgets for categories of expenses (e.g., entertainment) and track expenses against their budget. Because budgets cannot perfectly anticipate consumption opportunities, people may earmark too much or too little money for a particular category. This leads them to overconsume or underconsume goods in that category, The results of three studies suggest that consumers do indeed set budgets and that budgeting may lead to underconsumption. To show that consumers track expenses, the studies demonstrate that budgeting effects are larger for purchases that are highly typical of their category. Such purchases reduce the amount people spend in a category and block the purchase of other typical items. The studies control for satiation and income effects; thus, budgeting adds predictive power to standard economic consumer theory.

TI Do polls reflect opinions or do opinions reflect polls? The impact of
   political polling on voters' expectations, preferences, and behavior
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Can political polls alter the choices voters make on election day? Prior research on cognitive consistency suggests they can. This article develops a set of hypotheses based on cognitive dissonance theory concerning the effects of exposure to the results of political polls on voters' expectations about the outcome of the election, attitudes toward the candidates, voting intentions, and choice. These hypotheses were tested during experiments conducted during the 1992 U.S. presidential election and the 1993 New York City mayoral election. The results demonstrate that political polls do alter voting behavior. Voters use political polls as a way to maintain or move to a state of cognitive consistency. Depending on which candidate voters expect to win as well as the candidate for whom they intend to vote, polls can have no effect, lead voters to change their expectations about who will win, or lead voters to actually change their preferences and their voting behavior. The results have important implications for public policy and for survey methodology.

TI Predicting preferences: An examination of agent learning
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Agent decision making occurs when an individual acts as a purchasing agent for another. Effective agent decision making requires that the agent learn to predict the target's preferences. Two experimental studies demonstrate the impact of providing agents veridical feedback. The results further our understanding of interpersonal prediction and learning from experience. Agents who are given the opportunity to learn from their own successes and failures do not exhibit the false consensus effect, or projection, that has been demonstrated in previous research. Any facilitative effect of similarity in tastes on predictive accuracy disappears when feedback is provided. Information theory is used to establish the informational value of individual instances, as well as an overall distribution of feedback. The results of the studies reported in the present article indicate that agents spend significantly more time considering informative than uninformative feedback, which improves their predictive accuracy.

Therefore, when imaging and perception compete for the same resources, message elaboration and learning should be undermined. Two experiments are reported that provide support for this theorizing. In the first experiment, the learning of visual or auditory imagery-provoking information is adversely affected by reading or listening, respectively. In the second experiment, information with high levels of visual imagery is found to be learned better than information with low levels of visual imagery when the information is presented auditorily, but the reverse occurs when information is presented visually.

TI Effect size estimates: Issues and problems in interpretation
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB In recent years, researchers have recognized the importance of the concept of effect size for planning research, determining the significance of research results, and accumulating results across studies. However, the uncritical use of effect-size indicators may lead to different interpretations of similar research findings because of differences in assumptions underlying the nature of the research, aspects of the phenomenon being investigated, or the methodological characteristics of the research. This article reviews the substantive, measurement, and methodological issues that influence the relative magnitude of an empirical effect size, The relationships and transformations between different types of effect-size indicators are presented. It is the thesis of this article that the meaningfulness of an estimated effect size should be interpreted with consideration of the type of research (relational vs, experimental), the anticipated application of the results obtained (effects application vs. theory testing), and the research history in the domain of inquiry. Researchers must be cognizant of the many different causal factors that influence effect size before using the magnitude of an effect for assessing the importance of research results, calculating the statistical power of a test, or synthesizing findings across different studies.

TI Are studies of dark side variables confounded by socially desirable

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Socially desirable responding (SDR) is the tendency of individuals to make themselves look good according to current cultural norms when answering researchers' questions. For over 50 years in the social sciences, SDR has been a complex and controversial issue, typically viewed as a contaminating response bias. Meanwhile, most consumer researchers have neglected SDR, including those studying sensitive ''dark side'' topics where SDR could have an especially detrimental impact on research conclusions. This article reviews conceptual, measurement, and statistical analysis issues related to SDR. Two surveys are then reported that explore the effect of SDR on testing propositions about the nomological network surrounding the materialism value. Implications and recommendations are discussed for investigating SDR in consumer research, including opportunities for Mure contributions.

TI Consumption vocabulary and preference formation
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumers' understanding of their own preferences can be aided by a ''consumption vocabulary''-a taxonomy or framework that facilitates identifying the relation between a product's features and one's evaluation of the product. In the absence of such a vocabulary, consumers' understanding of their own preferences will require more extensive experience and may never fully develop. The effect of such a vocabulary is tested in two experiments in which subjects provided with a vocabulary (1) exhibit better-defined and more consistent preferences than control subjects, (2) show improved cue discovery, and (3) show learning (i.e., increases in consistency over time). All results hold regardless of the functional form of the model used to assess subjects' preference formation.

TI Communicating price information through semantic cues: The moderating
   effects of situation and discount size
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB While several studies have examined how the specific wording (i.e., semantic cue) used to communicate a price offer affects consumers' perceptions of value, this area of research has not produced a set of consistent findings. To resolve the apparent inconsistencies, the current article builds on past research and explains why a consumer's response to a semantic cue depends on the situation (or decision context) and the discount size, The results of two studies are reported. The first experiment provides evidence that the relative effectiveness of two widely used types of semantic cues depends on both consumers' decision context and the level of processing evoked by ?he discount site, The second experiment replicates the semantic cue by situation interaction and demonstrates the robustness of this effect across store familiarity.

TI Trend effects and gender differences in retrospective judgments of
   consumption emotions
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB A field study performed at the end of multiday hospital slays investigated trend effects on retrospective global judgments ct emotions. Subjects (43 women and 50 men) reported instances of their positive and negative emotions, retrospective global judgments of these emotions, and satisfaction with hospital services. Retrospective global judgments of positive and negative emotions were a positive function of the increase or decrease of the instances of emotions over time. Consistent with predictions based on the literature on gender differences in information processing, men's retrospective judgments of positive emotions were highly sensitive to trend effects, but no trend effect was found for negative emotions. In contrast, women demonstrated trend effects primarily in judgments of negative emotions. Trends in positive and negative emotions, however, did not significantly contribute to satisfaction judgments for men and women. Theoretical and managerial implications of the results are discussed.

TI The moderating role of prior knowledge in schema-based product
   evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Recent evidence suggests that a new product is evaluated more favorably when its attributes are moderately incongruent with an activated product category schema than when its attributes are either congruent or extremely incongruent with the schema. We extend this finding by showing that it obtains when consumers have limited knowledge about the product category. When consumers possess elaborate knowledge about the category, their evaluations are unaffected by the level of congruity but rather are influenced by their schema-based associations to specific product attributes. These findings are discussed in terms of current theorizing related to schema congruity and schema-based inferencing.

TI The effect of common and unique features in consumer choice
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumer choice often involves a comparison among the available alternatives. Recent research finds that features shared by alternatives are canceled and greater weight is placed on the unique features in choosing among the alternatives provided. Building on this research, the authors propose that the attractiveness of the choice set can be enhanced or reduced by altering which features appear unique. In the first study, this proposition is tested for choice problems in which subjects choose or delay choice between pairs of alternatives that have either shared bad features and unique good features (unique good pairs) or unique bad features and shared good features (unique bad pairs). As predicted, a greater percentage of subjects chose an alternative when there were unique good pairs than when there were unique bad pairs. A second study allowed subjects to switch from their initial choice to a new alternative with both unique good and unique bad features. The likelihood of switching to a new alternative was greater for subjects who made the initial choice from unique bad pairs. A third study used the choice context to increase the attractiveness of a specific alternative by making its good features appear unique. Finally, another study used think-aloud protocols to gain insights into the underlying mechanism.

   cross cultural consumer research
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The importance to cross-cultural consumer research of an encompassing yet intricate approach to evaluating the role of culture has been broadly recognized. This article charts a procedure for operationalizing the descriptive term ''cultural categories'' for this purpose. By analyzing the acceptance, use, and meaning-attachment patterns of selected goods or services in a given environment, culture-exclusive (and nonexclusive) categories can be discerned and labeled. Explanation and illustration of this approach are drawn from a field investigation conducted in western Japan.

TI The assessment of alternative measures of consumer expertise
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This study assesses a number of different measures of consumer expertise by examining their ability to predict correct choices in three stimulus-based choice tasks and to support a number of hypotheses derived from the cognitive psychology and consumer behavior literature. The hypotheses concern how consumer expertise should affect the content and organization of knowledge for a product class and reasons for choice across different usage contexts. After a factor analysis of the different measures of consumer expertise that yielded three orthogonal factors, we used regression and TOBIT analyses to examine the effect of each factor on the number of correct choices and the hypothesized differences in the content and organization of knowledge and reasons for choice in the choice tasks. Two of the factors, ''subjective/objective knowledge'' and ''friends owning motorcycles,'' predict the number of correct choices in the stimulus-based choice tasks, while the subjective/objective-knowledge factor supports almost all of the hypothesized relationships for the content and organization of knowledge and reasons for choice. The third factor, ''magazines read/motorcycles owned,'' also supports many of the relationships concerning general knowledge.

TI Goal derived categories and the antecedents of across category
   consideration
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB We employ the concept of goal-derived categories and examine when and why consideration sets might include alternatives from different nominal product categories. An experiment in stimulus-based choice was conducted wherein subjects were given a large, heterogeneous set of alternatives and asked to form consideration sets. A key finding was that across-category consideration was high when there was either goal conflict (i.e., a single product category could not deliver on all salient goals) or goal ambiguity (i.e., a lack of salient goals). However, goal-conflict and goal-ambiguity subjects engaged in across-category consideration for different reasons. Goal-conflict subjects potentially could have prioritized goals and eliminated entire categories prior to forming consideration sets. Instead, they formed mixed consideration sets in the service of salient goals and postponed conflict resolution to the final choice stage. Goal-ambiguity subjects, on the other hand, considered alternatives from different categories because they were influenced by extrinsic cues (e.g., leading brand names). Implications are discussed for consideration set formation and product-market structure.

TI Preschoolers' learning of brand names from visual cues
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This research addresses the question of how perceptual cues affect preschoolers' learning of brand names. It is found that when visual cues are provided in addition to brand names that are prior-associated in children's memory structures, children better remember the brand names. Although two cues (a picture and a color) improve memory over the imposition of a single cue, extensive visual cues may overtax young children's processing abilities. The study contributes to our understanding of how visual cues increase the effectiveness of nonverbal communication.

TI Consumer information search revisited: Theory and empirical analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB A comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding consumers' information search behavior is presented. Unlike previous research, our model identifies not only what factors affect consumers' search behavior but also how these factors interact with each other. In particular, the model emphasizes the effect of prior brand perceptions on the search process, We argue that when consumers have brand-specific prior distributions of utility, the existence of relative uncertainty among brands is necessary for search to be useful. Thus, we explain why product class involvement or low search costs may not be sufficient to induce targe amounts of search activity and why there may be an inverted-U-shaped relationship between search activity and experience. We test our theory on consumers' search behavior for new automobiles, using data collected contemporaneously with consumers' actual decision process. Our data support our theory.

TI The role of television in the construction of consumer reality
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article presents the results of a two-study inquiry into a particular type of consumer socialization: the construction of consumer social reality via exposure to television. In study 1, estimates of the prevalence of products and activities associated with an affluent lifestyle were positively related to the total amount of television respondents watched, The amount of television viewing was shown to function as a mediating variable between the demographic variables income and education and the affluence estimates. In study 2, which consisted of student participants who were either very heavy or very light soap opera viewers, heavy viewers again provided higher estimates of the prevalence of the same types of products and behaviors measured in study 1. In addition, heavy soap opera viewers constructed their estimates significantly faster than light viewers, which suggests that relevant information is more accessible in memory for heavy viewers than light viewers, The results are consistent with heuristic processing strategies, particularly the availability heuristic, in which individuals infer prevalence from the ease of retrieval of relevant examples (Tversky and Kahneman 1973).

TI The impact of interstimulus interval and background silence on recall
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Three experiments investigate how the interval between target items of information in an audio context influences recall under background conditions of music and silence. In experiment 1, when a goal-directed learning task encouraged allocation of resources to the message, recall increased linearly for both background conditions as the interval increased. However, under the incidental learning task used in experiment 2, increasing the interval from two to three seconds had a deleterious impact on recall, but only in the background silence condition. Experiment 3 suggested that this was due to a surplus of cognitive resources in the background silence condition producing interfering extracommunication thought. Results also support the theory presented that background music borrows resources from the processing of message information in an incidental learning task. Although music impairs processing of brand information and reduces recall at shorter intervals, relative to silence, it increases the interval preceding the onset of excess resources, delaying interfering thought.

   attribute importance
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB In this article, the effect of common features on brand choice and the moderating role of attribute importance are examined. It is argued that when brand attributes differ in importance, common features are likely to enhance consumer preferences for the option with the best value on the most important attribute, thus further polarizing brands' choice shares. In contrast, when attributes are similar in their importance, common features are likely to have an opposite effect, equalizing brands' shares. The data provide support for these propositions.

TI Family structure, materialism, and compulsive consumption
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Despite the rapid and dramatic changes in the structure of the American family over the past 30 years (e.g., divorce, single parenting), consumer researchers have largely neglected the issue of how alternative family forms influence consumer behavior, Our initial inquiry into this area finds that young adults reared in disrupted families are more materialistic and exhibit higher levels of compulsive consumption than young adults reared in intact families. Furthermore, we show that the relationship between family structure and compulsive consumption is partially mediated by both the amount of resources available within the family and the degree of family stress. We also find that the impact of family disruption on family stress is moderated by socioeconomic status. We conclude by proposing an agenda for future research that considers the antecedents, processes, and consequences of alternative family structures as they relate to consumer behavior.

TI Poststructuralist lifestyle analysis: Conceptualizing the social
   patterning of consumption in postmodernity
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB In the sociology of consumption, a core research issue is the symbolic expression, reproduction, and potential transformation of social collectivities through consumption. The two theoretical perspectives that have long dominated both consumer research and sociological investigations of this class of research questions-what I term personality/values lifestyle analysis and object signification research-have become less useful in the postmodern era. In this study, I develop an alternative poststructuralist approach for analyzing lifestyles, I describe five core principles of poststructuralist lifestyle analysis that distinguish this approach from the two predominant paradigms. Drawing from a series of unstructured interviews, I argue that each of these five features allows for more nuanced description of lifestyles than the two predominant approaches. Poststructuralist lifestyle analysis can be used to unravel the social patterning of consumption according to important social categories such as social class, gender, race/ethnicity, nationality, and generation in advanced capitalist countries in which postmodern cultural conditions make tracing these patterns difficult with conventional approaches.

TI All cues are not created equal: Obtaining attitude persistence under
   low-involvement conditions
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Attitude persistence research in consumer behavior has been predominantly associated with high- rather than low-involvement processing. Advertising, however, is most often processed as a low-involvement communication. We predict that different low-involvement cues lead to different degrees of attitude persistence. Consistent with this prediction, we find that under low-involvement conditions, when both related and unrelated peripheral cues evoke similar initial attitudes, only when the cue is related to the product category do attitudes persist over time. The results of two studies attest to the robustness of the phenomenon and add to current models of attitude persistence by showing that peripherally processed advertising cues (e.g., brand names and celebrity endorsers) may lead to persistence if they are related to the product being endorsed.

TI Consumer memory for television advertising: A field study of duration,
   serial position, and competition effects
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB We simultaneously analyze the impact on consumer memory of the duration and serial position of a commercial and of the number of competing commercials in a block using a marketplace database of 2,677 television commercials. Our results indicate that duration, competition, and the time lag until the onset of a commercial in a block have large effect sizes, while primacy and recency have only modest effect sizes. By decomposing serial position into its ordinal and time-lag aspects, this study shows that recency effects are masked by the time until the onset of a commercial in a block, The findings suggest that, given comparable costs and a goal to maximize brand recall, placing a commercial first is better than placing it last. In addition, the analyses identify several significant and previously undocumented interactions.

TI Context effects at encoding and judgment in consumption settings: The
   role of cognitive resources
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB When consumers learn about a new product, cues in the surrounding context have been found to bias their response to the product in two ways. In some instances, judgments of the product are assimilated toward the affect or descriptive implications associated with the context, whereas in other circumstances, responses are contrasted with or adjusted away from the context. We examine how cognitive resources influence whether assimilation or contrast occurs and when such context effects are reflected in subsequent judgments. Building on a model developed by Martin and his colleagues, we propose that assimilation will occur spontaneously during encoding. Contrast will occur only when this contextual influence is viewed as inappropriate and efforts to partial out the context result in overcorrection. These encoding effects of context should be evident in later judgments when the nature of either the judgment task or consumers' predisposition toward effortful thought encourage retrieval of the context-encoded information. The results of two experiments support our predictions and lead to a modified version of Martin's model. In this model, the cognitive resources available at encoding determine the type of context effect and the cognitive resources at judgment determine whether the encoding effect of context will be reflected in product evaluations.

TI Speaking of fashion: Consumers' uses of fashion discourses and the
   appropriation of countervailing cultural meanings
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article explores the ways that consumers use fashion discourse to inscribe their consumption behaviors in a complex ideological system of folk theories about the nature of self and society. Verbatim texts of 20 phenomenological interviews concerning consumers' perceptions and experiences of fashion are interpreted through a hermeneutic process with specific consideration given to gender issues. Whereas critics of consumer culture frequently argue that fashion discourses enshroud consumer perceptions in a common hegemonic outlook, our analysis suggests that this ideological system offers a myriad of countervailing interpretive standpoints that consumers combine, adapt, and juxtapose to fit the conditions of their everyday lives. By appropriating fashion discourse, consumers generate personalized fashion narratives and metaphoric and metonymic references that negotiate key existential tensions and that often express resistance to dominant fashion norms in their social milieu or consumer culture at large. A theoretical model is derived that portrays a dialogical relationship between consumers and this cultural system of countervailing fashion meanings. The implications of this model for future research on the meaning transfer process and the sociocognitive dimensions of consumer beliefs are discussed.

TI The emergence of adaptive decision making in children
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB How do children become adaptive decision makers in complex environments? Though we know that adult-like abilities are present by age 11 or 12, and that children younger than this often fail to adapt, we know virtually nothing about the mechanisms responsible for this development. In this article, we explore the obstacles that confront young children as they attempt to adapt to complex decision tasks. We focus on the possibility that younger children's failures might be linked to a fairly simple obstacle, such as being insensitive to the cost or effort involved in pursuing alternative strategies for making decisions. This possibility was tested in an experimental setting, with children aged seven to 11 years, in which children's decision-making strategies were monitored as they made choices from increasingly complex information boards in the presence or absence of imposed costs for gathering information from the boards. Our results indicate that age differences in adaptivity can be eliminated with the imposition of search costs, implicating sensitivity to decision-making costs as a major contributor to the development of adaptivity in complex environments.

This study attempts to incorporate these proposed behaviors into the implicit utility function of consumer choice models, resulting in both a more accurate tool for managerial decision making and additional insights into how consumers actually behave toward price endings. An attempt is made to compensate for both level effects (those effects in which consumers may underestimate the value of a price) and image effects (those effects in which consumers may infer meaning from the right-hand digits). The models are estimated using scanner panel data for two frequently purchased products, tuna and yogurt. The results support the importance of accounting for the digits in consume: choice models, providing evidence for both image effects and level effects.

TI Framing the deal: The role of restrictions in accentuating deal value
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB We propose that consumers use the presence of a restriction (i.e., purchase limit, purchase precondition, or time limit) as a source of information to evaluate a dear. In a series of four studies we present evidence suggesting that restrictions serve to accentuate deal value and act as ''promoters'' of promotions. We begin by using aggregate lever scanner data to test our hypothesis that a sales restriction (e.g., ''limit X per customer'') results in higher sales. Via three subsequent experiments, we then investigate contextual and individual factors moderating this effect. Study 2 suggests that restrictions only have a positive effect for low need for cognition individuals. Study 3 explores the potential mediating role of deal evaluations on purchase intent across discount levels. Study 4 examines the effect of three types of restrictions (purchase limits, time limits, and purchase preconditions) across discount levels and explores the underlying beliefs driving these effects. An integrative model across studies demonstrates the robustness of the restriction effect and supports the premise that restrictions work through signaling value, implications for how consumers determine promotional value are discussed.

A formal definition of consumer ambivalence is provided. Our analysis revealed four antecedents of consumer ambivalence: expectation versus reality, overload, role conflict with purchase influencers, and custom and value conflict. These antecedents were then linked to particular coping strategies that informants employed to manage the ambivalence that was generated. Suggestions of how future research might explore consumer ambivalence are offered.

In two experiments, we demonstrate that merely possessing a coupon for a product, as opposed to the actual product, can increase consumers' preference for that option over its competitors' in real choices from meaningfully comparable choice sets. In addition, a characterization of the cognitive processes underlying this phenomenon, and its variation with individual perceptions of task meaningfulness, provides support for a loss-aversion account of consumers' possession-induced preferences for goods they do not actually possess.

TI The role of inference in context effects: Inferring what you want from
   what is available
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB It has recently been suggested that a number of experimental findings of context effects in choice settings can be explained by the ability of subjects to draw choice-relevant inferences from the stimuli. We aim to measure the importance of this explanation. To do so, inferences are assessed in an experiment using the basic context-effect design, supplemented by direct measures of inferred locations of available products on the price-quality Hotelling line. We use these measures to estimate a predicted context effect due to inference alone. For our stimuli, we find that the inference effect accounts for two-thirds of the average magnitude of the context effect and for about one-half of the cross-category context-effect variance.

TI Measuring emotions in the consumption experience
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Although consumption-related emotions have been studied with increasing frequency in consumer behavior, issues concerning the appropriate way to measure these emotions remain unresolved. This article reviews the emotion measures currently used in consumer research and the theories on which they are based; it concludes that the existing measures are unsuited for the purpose of measuring consumption-related emotions. The article describes six empirical studies that assess the domain of consumption-related emotions, that identify an appropriate set of consumption emotion descriptors (the CES), and that compare the usefulness of this descriptor set with the usefulness of other measures in assessing consumption-related emotions.

TI Cognitive effort, affect, and choice
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article examines cognitive effort and its influence on choice outcomes through process-induced negative affect. We propose that an alternative that requires more cognitive effort to evaluate leads the decision maker to generate more negative affect and to choose that alternative less frequently than an alternative that is less effortful to evaluate. Two studies demonstrate that when different levels of effort are expended processing equivalent alternatives, the effort adversely affects choice of the more difficult to process alternatives. More respondents, especially those with less skill at the evaluation task, selected a brand and expressed a greater willingness to pay a premium for it when it was less effortful to evaluate. The second study shows that more negative affect was generated as the cognitive effort increased, lowering the likelihood of the difficult alternative being selected. The extent of negative affect generated was exaggerated under time pressure and increased the choice of the less difficult alternative. Although negative affect was generated, it did not influence choice when there was a clearly superior alternative.

   generation influence attitudes?
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The effects of imagined versus actual ease of self-generating product-related information were investigated. An ad invited recipients to name either one reason or 10 reasons for (against) choosing a BMW over a Mercedes. Participants who complied with the task experienced the retrieval of one reason as easier than the retrieval of 10 reasons. Participants who did not comply nevertheless imagined the former as easier than the latter. Independent of whether ease was actually experienced or merely imagined, participants evaluated BMW more (less) favorably and Mercedes less (more) favorably when the retrieval was easy rather than difficult.

TI Evaluating persuasion-enhancing techniques from a resource-matching
   perspective
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article examines how two ad execution characteristics intended to heighten persuasion can influence the resources required to process an ad under high and low motivation conditions. These ad execution characteristics include (1) whether the ad copy is narrative or factual and (2) whether the ad layout either physically integrates or separates the ad picture and ad claims. Results reveal that under low motivation, persuasion is unaffected by these two execution characteristics but instead is affected by heuristic aspects of the ad photo. Under high motivation, whether persuasion is heightened or undermined appears to depend on the extent to which the ad execution characteristics render the resources needed to process the ad equal to, in excess of, or inadequate compared with those that motivated viewers have available for processing the ad.

TI Patterns of rightmost digits used in advertised prices: Implications for
   nine-ending effects
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Analysis of the rightmost digits of selling prices in a sample of retail price advertisements confirmed past findings indicating the overrepresentation of the digits 0, 5, and 9. The high cognitive accessibility of round numbers can account for the overrepresentation of 0- and 5-ending prices and suggests the existence of two effects that could account for the overrepresentation of 9-ending prices: (1) a tendency of consumers to perceive a 9-ending price as a round-number price with a small amount given back and (2) a tendency of consumers to underestimate a 9-ending price by encoding it as the first round number evoked during incomplete left-to-right processing. Analysis of the patterns of rightmost digits observed in the sample provides supportive evidence particularly for the second of these two 9-ending effects.

TI A comparative analysis of reference price models
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The effect of reference price on brand choice decisions has been well documented in the literature, Researchers, however, have differed in their conceptualizations and, therefore, in their modeling of reference price. In this article, we evaluate five alternative models of reference price of which two are stimulus based (i.e., based on information available at the point-of-purchase) and three that are memory based (i.e., based on price history and/or other contextual factors). We calibrate the models using scanner panel data for peanut butter, liquid detergent, ground coffee, and tissue. To account for heterogeneity in model parameters, we employ a latent class approach and select the best segmentation scheme for each model. The best model of reference price is then selected on the basis of fit and prediction, as well as on the basis of parsimony in cases where the fits of the models are not very different. In all four categories, we find that the best reference price model is a memory-based model, namely, one that is based on the brand's own price history. In the liquid detergent category, however, we find that one of the stimulus-based models, namely, the current price of a previously chosen brand, also performs fairly well. We discuss the implications of these findings.

TI Consumer preference for a no-choice option
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The traditional focus in the decision-making literature has been on understanding how consumers choose among a given set of alternatives. The notion that preference uncertainty may lead to choice deferral when no single alternative has a decisive advantage is tested in seven studies. Building on recent research, the article shows that the decision to defer choice is influenced by the absolute difference in attractiveness among the alternatives provided and is not consistent with trade-off difficulty or the theory of search. These findings are then extended to show that choice deferral can also be modified for the same alternatives by manipulations that make them appear more similar in attractiveness, or that decrease the need to differentiate among them. The results are consistent with the notion that preference uncertainty results in a hesitation to commit to any single action since small differences in attractiveness among the alternatives are potentially reversible. Consistent with this premise, the effect of attractiveness difference on choice deferral decreased significantly when subjects were first allowed to practice making monetary trade-offs among the available alternatives.

TI A varying-parameter averaging model of on-line brand evaluations
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Consumer evaluations of new brands evolve over time as information is acquired. We conceptualize the extent to which evaluations are updated in terms of the weight given to new information during information integration, Based on information processing theory, we derive hypotheses regarding the weights given to new information under different processing ability conditions. We then develop a varying-parameter averaging model that captures the hypothesized moderating effects of processing ability (i.e., time pressure and knowledge) and also takes into account order effects. Scale values and weights for information items are derived by estimating the model using continuous evaluations obtained in a process-tracing experiment that allows subjects to access information that they desire in any order. Results from model estimation support the hypothesis that compared with prior evaluations new information plays a larger role in evaluations of high (vs. low) ability subjects. Estimating order effects on weights when order is endogenous, we find a recency effect such that information seen later is given a greater weight than information seen earlier. However, this recency effect is reduced as category knowledge increases. We discuss the theoretical and methodological contributions of this research.

TI Contingent processes of source identification
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Effective communication requires that consumers attribute the message content to its intended source. The proposed framework distinguishes four types of source identification processes-cued retrieval, memory-trace refreshment, schematic inferencing, and pure guessing-and delineates their contingencies. Two experiments examine portions of the framework, and experiment 2 introduces a new methodology for decomposing multiple processes, Findings suggest that when cued retrieval fails, consumers try to refresh the original memory trace for the learning episode-a process that is effortful. They invoke schematic inferencing only a the original memory trace cannot be refreshed. Reliance on cued retrieval seems to require little processing capacity. If there is some motivation for accuracy, pure guessing appears to be invoked only as a last resort.

In this article, we develop a conceptual model to explain how previously acquired knowledge is transferred in the process of consumer learning, Augmenting analogical learning theory with research on expertise effects and conceptual development, our model details the underlying stages in the process of knowledge transfer and identifies key factors influencing the nature and outcome of each stage. Applying our model to several consumer behavior contexts, we demonstrate its utility both as a tool for enhancing our understanding of knowledge transfer and as a productive guide to future research on consumer learning.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article examines the effects of negative and positive framing of ad claims on consumers' choices and attitudes. Propositions about how the extent of processing before choice affects the relative impact of claims-related Versus advertising tactics-related cognitions are tested in three experiments. Findings suggest that when processing is limited, claims-related cognitions have a greater impact on choice, which results in the sponsoring brand being chosen more often when the ad claims are negatively framed than when they are positively framed. When respondents engage in more extensive processing before choice, tactics-related cognitions become more accessible and, if perceived to be unfair, result in an. attenuation of the advantage of negative framing over positive framing. A different pattern of results is obtained when one examines brand attitudes rather than brand choice.

Three experiments confirm the predicted inverted-U relationship between resource allocation and persuasion for vivid information, and a positive linear relationship between resource allocation and persuasion for nonvivid information when vivid information is less resource demanding than nonvivid information. This persuasion pattern is reversed in experiment 4, where nonvivid information is less resource demanding than Vivid information; that is, there is an inverted-ii relationship for nonvivid information, and a positive linear relationship for vivid information. The contrasting persuasion functions for Vivid and nonvivid information can predict when vivid information will be more Versus less persuasive than nonvivid information.

In an illustrative experiment, we monitor consumers' eye movements during naturalistic exposure to a consumer magazine, in which experimentally designed ads are inserted. A latent class regression model accounting for heterogeneity across consumers through unobserved segments is used to analyze the eye movement data in detail. Three consumer segments are identified that exhibit distinct patterns of visual attention as well as different profiles of product involvement, brand attitude, and advertising recall. Implications for visual attention theory and for advertising research are discussed.

This research supports the view that perceptual differences in cue diagnosticity account for systematic differences in persuasive effects across cultures. It is also suggested that existing theoretical frameworks, specifically the dual process models of persuasion, are robust across cultures and can help predict and explain cultural differences.

TI Age differences in consumers' processing strategies: An investigation of
   moderating influences
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Relative to younger adults, older adults appear to exhibit greater use of schema-based, as opposed to detailed, processing strategies. This relationship is investigated in an experimental study that examines the moderating influences of two marketing-relevant variables, incongruity of message items and optimal time of day, Signal detection analysis performed on recognition measures serves as a basis for assessing strategy use. Both older and younger adults, during their optimal times of day (morning and evening, respectively), engage in detailed processing, but this tendency is particularly pronounced for the elderly when exposed to high-incongruity cues. By contrast, during their nonoptimal time of day, older adults seem to rely on schema-based processing regardless of the level of incongruity, whereas younger adults remain relatively detailed in their processing strategies. Theoretical and practical implications for marketing are discussed.

TI Consumers and their brands: Developing relationship theory in consumer
   research
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Although the relationship metaphor dominates contemporary marketing thought and practice, surprisingly little empirical work has been conducted on relational phenomena in the consumer products domain, particularly at the level of the brand. In this article, the author: (1) argues for the validity of the relationship proposition in the consumer-brand context, including a debate as to the legitimacy of the brand as an active relationship partner and empirical support for the phenomenological significance of consumer-brand bonds; (2) provides a framework for characterizing and better understanding the types of relationships consumers form with brands; and (3) inducts from the data the concept of brand relationship quality, a diagnostic tool for conceptualizing and evaluating relationship strength. Three in-depth case studies inform this agenda, their interpretation guided by an integrative review of the literature on person-to-person relationships. Insights offered through application of inducted concepts to two relevant research domains-brand loyalty and brand personality-are advanced in closing. The exercise is intended to urge fellow researchers to refine, test, and augment the working hypotheses suggested herein and to progress toward these goals with confidence in the validity of the relationship premise at the level of consumers' lived experiences with their brands.

   product designs
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Unity and prototypicality are important visual aspects of product design. These design principles were operationalized by modifying line drawings of existing products. The results of four experiments provide evidence that these two factors positively affect aesthetic response, These effects were strongest when visual properties were the sole basis of judgment and when design variations were easily compared, However, they persisted when aesthetic aspects were combined with other product information and when comparing design features was difficult. The effect of unity was found to be superadditive, suggesting that it has a relational, "all-or-none" character. Finally, regression analyses show that direct effects of the design modifications on aesthetic response exist in addition to possible indirect effects that are mediated by perceived typicality.

TI Pennies-a-day: The effect of temporal reframing on transaction
   evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB To increase transaction compliance, marketers sometimes temporally reframe the cost of a product from an aggregate one-time expense to a series of small ongoing expenses, often in spite of the fact that the physical payments remain aggregated. This temporal reframing is identified in this article as the "pennies-a-day" (PAD) strategy. A two-step consumer decision-making process of (1) comparison retrieval and (2) transaction evaluation is posited to explain the effectiveness of this strategy. In a series of laboratory studies, general support for PAD effectiveness across a range of product categories and specific support for the proposed two-step model was found. The PAD framing of a target transaction is shown to systematically foster the retrieval and consideration of small ongoing expenses as the standard of comparison, whereas an aggregate framing of that same transaction is shown to foster the retrieval and consideration of large infrequent expenses. This difference in retrieval is shown to significantly influence subsequent transaction evaluation and compliance.

TI Choosing to avoid: Coping with negatively emotion-laden consumer
   decisions
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article addresses how consumers resolve decisions involving conflict between attributes linked to highly valued goals, such as an automobile purchase decision requiring determination of how much safety one is willing to sacrifice in order to obtain other benefits.,One salient goal for these decisions may be coping with or minimizing the negative emotion generated during decision making. The conceptual framework developed in this article predicts that choosing avoidant options (e.g., the option to maintain the status quo) can satisfy coping goals by minimizing explicit confrontation of negative potential decision consequences and difficult trade-offs. Two experiments demonstrate that reported emotion can be altered by manipulating decision attributes, that the opportunity to choose an avoidant option mitigates levels of reported emotion, and that increasingly emotion-laden decision environments are associated with more choice of avoidant options. Mediation analyses indicate that actual choice of an avoidant option results in less retrospective negative emotion (in experiment I)and that increased initial negative emotion results in increased choice of avoidant options (in experiment 2). Mediation analyses for experiment 2 also indicate that increased response times mediate avoidant choice, in contrast to explanations of the status quo bias and similar choice phenomena that appeal to decision makers' desires to minimize cognitive effort.

Both studies found evidence that heavy viewers' beliefs about social reality are more consistent with the content of television programming than are those of light viewers. The use of a priming methodology provided support for the notion that television is a causal factor in the formation of these beliefs and that a failure to discount television-based exemplars in forming these beliefs accounts for its influence. Implications of these results for a heuristic processing model of television effects are discussed.

A large body of research indicates, however, that preferences often are labile. That is, preferences can be reversed depending on factors such as how the preference is elicited. In three studies, we examine the effect of familiarity in two preference-elicitation tasks, choice and matching judgments. We provide evidence of an interaction between familiarity and response mode (choice or matching) in each study. In study 3, we test the explanation that preference reversals may occur when the interaction of response mode with product-category familiarity leads to systematic changes in attribute weighting.

   waiting
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This study considers the interaction effect of service stage (conceptualized as the distance to the goal state of the service encounter) and delay type (procedural, correctional, and unknown) on consumers' reactions to waiting. Field theory suggests that the further away a delay occurs from the goal state of the service encounter, the more negative its impact will be on consumers. The anticipatory model, however, suggests that the direction of the impact should be the other way around. Results obtained from an experimental study confirm that the nature of the delay, in terms of whether it constitutes a threat to the successful completion of a task or not, moderates the impact of service stage (i.e., how close to the goal state the delay occurs) on consumers' reactions to the wait.

TI Does cultural capital structure American consumption?
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This study examines one of the most debated questions in the sociology of culture: Does Pierre Bourdieu's theory relating levels of cultural capital to consumption patterns apply to the contemporary United States? First, I summarize the innovative characteristics of Bourdieu's theory in relation to the Warnerian tradition of social class research. Next, I critique American appropriations of Bourdieu's theory of tastes and suggest that, in the contemporary United States, the theory should be reformulated to focus on consumption practices rather than consumption objects and on mass rather than high culture. Using this reformulation, I conduct an interpretive empirical study to investigate whether differences in cultural capital resources structure patterns of taste in a mideastern American county. Analyzing a series of ethnographic interviews, I describe six dimensions of taste that distinguish informants with high versus low cultural capital resources: material versus formal aesthetics, referential versus critical interpretations, materialism versus idealism, local versus cosmopolitan tastes, communal versus individualist forms of consumer subjectivity, and autotelic Versus self-actualizing leisure. These findings suggest that consumption continues to serve as a potent site for the reproduction of social class.

TI Language in multimedia: Interaction of spoken and written information
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Recent findings on the brain's anatomy suggest that there are modality-specific resources for the processing of language. This article develops a theoretical model on the behavioral consequences of modality-specific resources for spoken and written information. The model predicts antagonistic effects of reduced interference versus reduced integration of verbal information presented across the two modalities, as compared to within a single modality. Three experiments compare unimodal to multimedia messages containing either a mix of modalities or information presented bimodally. The results provide qualified support far the model in the realm of item-specific Versus relational memory and elaboration. Compared to unimodal presentations, alternating the presentation modality decreases relational processing but can increase item-specific processing. Furthermore, a simultaneous bimodal presentation format increases recognition memory but does not appear to affect relational processing or item-specific elaboration.

TI Integrating multiple opinions: The role of aspiration level on consumer
   response to critic consensus
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Four studies examine the process by which consumers integrate critic opinions and attribute information into their product evaluations and how critic consensus affects this process. A reference-dependent model is proposed such that consumer response to consensus depends on whether the average critic rating for an alternative is above or below an aspiration level. Consensus is shown to be preferred for alternatives above an aspiration level, whereas critic disagreement is preferred for alternatives below an aspiration level. Consumers exhibited a tendency to prefer critic disagreement for high-priced products or decisions associated with high social risk because most alternatives fell below their high aspiration levels.

TI AIDS and me, never the twain shall meet: The effects of information
   accessibility on judgments of risk and advertising effectiveness
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The HIV virus is now an international killer, but individuals perceive that they are less likely to contract the virus than are others (the self-positivity bias). Three studies investigate the antecedents and consequences of the self-positivity bias in judgments of the risk of contracting AIDS. We show that the perceived similarity of another person to oneself and the ease with which related information can be retrieved from memory (the accessibility of information) moderate self-perceptions of risk in an absolute sense and reduce the self-positivity bias. We then demonstrate that increasing the accessibility of a cause of AIDS, in an advertisement propounding safe sex, increases perceptions of one's own risk of contracting AIDS, reduces the self-positivity bias, leads to more favorable attitudes and intentions toward practicing precautionary behaviors (e.g., using condoms, taking an HIV test), and also leads to deeper processing of AIDS educational material. Theoretical implications regarding the use of the accessibility of information as a cue and the self-positivity bias are discussed, and recommendations for social marketing communications are offered.

TI Knowledge, information mode, and the attraction effect
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB This article focuses on the complex role of category knowledge in context effects by examining how knowledge interacts with the mode of information presentation (verbal vs. numerical) to moderate the magnitude of the attraction effect. On the basis of Chakravarti and Lynch's framework for understanding context effects and prior research on consumer knowledge, we delineate two distinct influences of knowledge on the choice process and demonstrate that the moderating influence of knowledge on the attraction effect Varies with the information mode. When the choice set information is presented numerically, greater category knowledge attenuates the attraction effect, but when information is presented verbally, greater knowledge actually increases the size of the attraction effect. The implications of these findings for the role of knowledge in consumer context effects ape discussed.

TI Assessing measurement invariance in cross-national consumer research
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Assessing the applicability of frameworks developed in one country to other countries is an important step in establishing the generalizability of consumer behavior theories. in order for such comparisons to be meaningful, however. the instruments used to measure the theoretical constructs of interest have to exhibit adequate cross-national equivalence. We review the various forms of measurement invariance that have been proposed in the literature, organize them into a coherent conceptual framework that ties different requirements of measure equivalence to the goals of the research, and propose a practical, sequential testing procedure for assessing measurement invariance in cross-national consumer research. The approach is based on multisample confirmatory factor analysis and clarifies under what conditions meaningful comparisons of construct conceptualizations, construct means, and relationships between constructs are possible. An empirical application dealing with the single-factor construct of consumer ethnocentrism in Belgium, Great Britain, and Greece is provided to illustrate the procedure.

AB This research examines the impact of age-related deficits in recognition and source memory on repetition-induced increases in belief in fictitious statements (the "truth effect"). Young and elderly subjects made recognition-memory judgments and rated the credibility of new and previously presented statements. Experiment 1 assessed the level of memory impairment in the elderly, as compared to the young, and its influence on the truth effect. The elderly, who had a greater tendency to make false-alarm errors in recognition and had poorer source memory for the claims, were more susceptible to the truth-inflating effect of repetition than were the young. Deeper(semantic vs. perceptual) processing was ineffective in reducing age-related deficits in memory or sensitivity to repetition-induced beliefs. Experiment 2 demonstrated that an imagery encoding task did provide more environmental support (a greater improvement in recognition and source memory for the elderly than the young) than did a perceptual encoding task. When both young and elderly subjects engaged in an imagery task during encoding, their memory performance was equivalent and age-related differences in the truth effect were abolished. Thus, it appears that the elderly are more susceptible to the truth-inflating effect of repetition, and this effect seems to be mediated via their poor memory. However, if memory is enhanced using environmental support, the elderly are no longer especially vulnerable to the truth effect.

TI Language structure and categorization: A study of classifiers in
   consumer cognition, judgment, and choice
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Using classifiers-lexical items that depict perceptual and conceptual properties of objects-six cross-cultural experiments were conducted In the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States to investigate how structural features of languages affect mental structures and, in turn, consumer behavior. Experiments 1-4 show how classifiers affect the perceived similarity between objects, attribute accessibility, and concept organization. Experiment: 5 shows how classifier-based schemata result in inferences about product features. Experiment 6 provides evidence for the effect of classifiers, on judgment and choice via assimilation and contrast processes and affect transfer. We discuss our findings in light of the Whorfian hypothesis and argue for the incorporation of structural components of languages into models of consumer behavior.

TI Paradoxes of technology: Consumer cognizance, emotions, and coping
   strategies
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB Although technological products are unavoidable in contemporary life, studies focusing on them in the consumer behavior field have been few and narrow. In this article, we investigate consumers' perspectives, meanings, and experiences in relation to a range of technological products, emphasizing lengthy and repeated interviews with 29 households, including a set of first-time owners. We draw on literatures spanning from technology, paradox, and postmodernism to clinical and social psychology, and combine them with data collection and analysis in the spirit of grounded theory. The outcome is a new conceptual framework on the paradoxes of technological products and their influences on emotional reactions and behavioral coping strategies. We discuss the findings in terms of implications for theories of technology, innovation diffusion, and human coping, and an expanded role for the paradox construct in consumer research.
