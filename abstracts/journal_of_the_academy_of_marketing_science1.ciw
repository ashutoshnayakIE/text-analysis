AB A typical customer relationship management model is designed to increase
   the value of a company's existing customers in the next period. While
   useful in the short term, such a process, followed blindly period after
   period, would drive the company out of business when those existing
   customers all eventually died. In reality, no company would do this.
   Instead, these short-term models are nested within a long-term view of
   customer management, and it is long-term customer management that the
   proposed model addresses. The model assumes that a company has
   identified a set of customer types across which it needs balance in
   order to remain viable in the long-term (e.g., a company might wish to
   maintain a supply of "entry-level customers" in order to eventually
   replenish its collection of more profitable "loyal customers"). Though
   the model is applicable in any industry, we illustrate it for
   automobiles. Results reveal the strengths with which each marketing
   intervention causes General Motors to attract each of their desired
   customer types. The model is extended to also reveal differences in the
   ways that marketing interventions by Ford, Toyota, and Honda change the
   strengths with which those automakers attract customers.

AB Scholarly research regarding origins of products and brands is
   deep-rooted within international marketing, with an extraordinary
   following as evidenced by the large body of literature that is
   continuing to evolve. Our goal in this research is to examine this
   domain, generically referred to as the country-of-origin (CO)
   literature, and identify the most influential contributions and their
   corresponding topics that form the intellectual foundations of this
   knowledge domain. Using citation and co-citation analyses, we develop a
   spatial representation of the CO literature via multidimensional scaling
   with two concurrent goals of unfolding the literature's knowledge
   structure as the basis for proposing a conceptual framework and
   identifying new research directions in the field. Our database consists
   of 482 articles, extracted from the Web of Science, that contain 33,194
   citations through 2019. We develop a managerially relevant conceptual
   approach based on the results of our co-citations-based CO knowledge
   structure to unfold new research directions and expand the boundaries of
   the CO literature in fruitful directions.

EA JAN 2021
PY 2021
AB On encountering a prospect whom they believe unlikely to make a
   purchase, some retail salespeople adopt a sales strategy of limiting
   engagement with the customer, relying on a "no conversion, no
   conversation" (NC2) sales strategy. Is this a good or bad sales
   strategy? Based on a multisource dataset combining salespeople and
   objective sales performance data, the authors examine retail
   salespeople's performance consequences of disengaging from a customer,
   i.e., of the NC2 sales strategy. Higher sales performance and sales
   growth arises from the use of an NC2 sales strategy when (1) salespeople
   are experienced professionals skilled in gauging customers' purchase
   likelihood, (2) store traffic is high, and (3) salespeople are oriented
   to building lasting customer relationships. However, (4) when store
   traffic is low and peers use the NC2 sales strategy as well, this
   customer disengagement strategy yields lower returns for salespeople.

AB Despite the large body of research that examines the determinants of
   salesperson performance, significant variation exists regarding how
   scholars can operationalize salesperson performance using secondary,
   firm-provided data. Moreover, this variation often exists without
   explanation or justification. We explore the issue in three parts.
   First, we conduct practitioner surveys to discover various salesperson
   performance operationalizations (SPOs) in use by salespeople and sales
   managers. Second, using a carefully constructed and theoretically driven
   evaluative framework, we conduct a systematic review of the literature
   on salesperson performance that encompasses over thirty years of
   empirical research on the subject; this review allows us to better
   understand the SPOs that scholars use. Third, we compare these
   practitioner and scholarly perspectives to create a comprehensive
   conceptual model of the different types of SPOs. The model highlights
   theoretical insights and provides guidance to scholars and reviewers
   related to the selection of appropriate SPOs for meeting specific
   research objectives.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE

EA JAN 2021
PY 2021
AB There are enduring misconceptions in the marketing and management
   literature about the potential biasing effects of Common Method Variance
   (CMV). One belief is that the biasing effect of CMV is of greater
   theoretical than practical importance; another belief is that if CMV is
   a potential problem, it can be easily identified with the Harman
   one-factor test. In this article, we show that both beliefs are ill
   founded and need correction. To demonstrate our key points with greater
   generality, we use analytical derivations rather than empirical
   simulations. First, we examine the effects of CMV on correlations
   between observed variables as a function of measure unreliability and
   the sign and size of the "true" trait correlation. We demonstrate that,
   for negative trait correlations, CMV leads to a substantial upward bias
   in observed correlations (i.e., observed correlations are less negative
   than the trait correlation), and under certain conditions observed
   correlations may even have the wrong sign (assuming that the method
   loadings are both positive or both negative). We also show that, for
   positive trait correlations, the downward bias due to measurement
   unreliability does not always mitigate the upward bias due to CMV (again
   assuming that the method loadings are either both positive or both
   negative). Importantly, our results indicate that the inflationary
   effect of CMV is larger at lower levels of (positive) trait
   correlations, whereas the deflationary effect of unreliability is larger
   at higher levels of trait correlations. Second, we demonstrate
   analytically the serious deficiencies of the popular Harman one-factor
   test for detecting common method variance and strongly recommend against
   its use in future research.

TI Understanding anthropomorphism in service provision: a meta-analysis of

SO JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE

EA JAN 2021
PY 2021
AB An increasing number of firms introduce service robots, such as physical
   robots and virtual chatbots, to provide services to customers. While
   some firms use robots that resemble human beings by looking and acting
   humanlike to increase customers' use intention of this technology,
   others employ machinelike robots to avoid uncanny valley effects,
   assuming that very humanlike robots may induce feelings of eeriness.
   There is no consensus in the service literature regarding whether
   customers' anthropomorphism of robots facilitates or constrains their
   use intention. The present meta-analysis synthesizes data from 11,053
   individuals interacting with service robots reported in 108 independent
   samples. The study synthesizes previous research to clarify this issue
   and enhance understanding of the construct. We develop a comprehensive
   model to investigate relationships between anthropomorphism and its
   antecedents and consequences. Customer traits and predispositions (e.g.,
   computer anxiety), sociodemographics (e.g., gender), and robot design
   features (e.g., physical, nonphysical) are identified as triggers of
   anthropomorphism. Robot characteristics (e.g., intelligence) and
   functional characteristics (e.g., usefulness) are identified as
   important mediators, although relational characteristics (e.g., rapport)
   receive less support as mediators. The findings clarify contextual
   circumstances in which anthropomorphism impacts customer intention to
   use a robot. The moderator analysis indicates that the impact depends on
   robot type (i.e., robot gender) and service type (i.e.,
   possession-processing service, mental stimulus-processing service).
   Based on these findings, we develop a comprehensive agenda for future
   research on service robots in marketing.

EA DEC 2020
PY 2020
AB Recent marketing research has identified mixed effects of luxury
   companies' corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement on
   customer-level outcomes. To gain a better understanding of these
   effects, we develop a conceptual framework in which we propose that,
   unless carefully implemented, CSR engagement leads to lower financial
   performance, decreased customer loyalty, and elevated extrinsic CSR
   attributions for luxury companies. These effects are exacerbated if
   consumers actively deliberate on the company's CSR efforts. However,
   luxury companies can mitigate these pitfalls and reap the potential
   rewards of CSR engagement by (1) engaging in company-internal,
   especially employee-focused CSR instead of company-external,
   philanthropic CSR or (2) framing their brands as sustainable instead of
   exclusive. We find consistent support for our theorizing in five
   empirical studies. The results contribute to existing knowledge on
   stakeholder reactions to luxury brands' CSR and can help managers
   successfully navigate the implementation of CSR in luxury contexts.

PY 2020
AB This study proposes an ideal, four-stage model of construct evolution
   (emergence -> conceptualization -> competition -> consensus) to explain
   construct development over time. An in-depth analysis of
   conceptualizations of two constructs, market orientation (MO) and
   customer-based brand equity (CBBE), however, reveals different
   evolutionary stages and trajectories that deviate from the ideal model.
   The final stage for MO and CBBE is fragmentation, not consensus,
   characterized by customized operationalizations and variable construct
   definitions. A supplementary analysis of need for cognition (NFC) and
   involvement constructs provides additional support. For example, the
   final stage of NFC is dominance, characterized by nearly complete
   reliance on standard definitions and operationalizations. Conceptual
   research, formal measure development, and differing types of constructs
   all can influence the evolution of constructs. These findings have deep
   implications for marketing research: Diverse definitions and
   operationalizations can impede knowledge accumulation. This article
   proposes guidelines for improving research practices and managing
   constructs across evolutionary stages.

PY 2020
AB The current research demonstrates how conversational robo advisors as

   trust, the evaluation of a financial services firm, and consumer
   financial decision making. We develop and empirically test a novel
   conceptualization of conversational robo advisors building on prior work
   in human-to-human communication and interpersonal psychology, showing
   that conversational robo advisors cause greater levels of affective
   trust compared to non-conversational robo advisors and evoke a more
   benevolent evaluation of a financial services firm. We demonstrate that
   this increase in affective trust not only affects firm perception (in
   terms of benevolence attributions or a more positively-valenced
   onboarding experience), but has important implications for investor
   behavior, such as greater recommendation acceptance and an increase in
   asset allocation toward conversational robo advisors. These findings
   have important implications for research on trust formation between
   humans and machines, the effective design of conversational robo
   advisors, and public policy in the digital economy.

EA NOV 2020
PY 2020
AB Modularization, an important trend in innovation markets, allows for
   recombination of product components into multiple end-product
   configurations. Although modularization has consequences for how firms
   manage their relationships with upstream component suppliers, the
   governance implications of modularity for innovation sourcing
   relationships have not been adequately examined in the prior literature.
   We intend to bridge this gap. We argue that (i) buyer firms employ
   governance mechanisms (monitoring and socialization) to cope with the
   strategic hazards of innovation sourcing relationships (knowledge
   specificity, knowledge asymmetry, and knowledge spillover) and (ii) the
   consequences of deploying these mechanisms in response to the strategic
   hazards on relationship performance are contingent upon the degree of
   modularity of the system in which they are deployed. We provide
   empirical support for the developed moderated mediation model through an
   analysis of 194 innovation projects. The developed theory and findings
   contribute to the governance and modularity literatures. In addition,
   our findings may help change managers' behaviors: we observe that
   managers do not consider modularity when selecting governance
   mechanisms, while our model findings suggest they should.

AB Conflict between channel members is of great interest to marketers given
   its presumed negative impact on the channel's business performance. In a
   comprehensive meta-analysis of the empirical literature spanning six
   decades between 1960 and 2020, we observe channel performance is indeed
   negatively linked to channel conflict. However, we find that this
   conflict-performance link has evolved significantly over time, roughly
   in keeping with the growth and maturing of e-commerce technologies.
   Further, the damage caused by conflict appears to be more pronounced for
   channels with international operations, and for channels with greater
   dependency between channel members. Additionally, businesses in North
   America seem to suffer the consequences of channel conflict more than
   others. Our results also show several study characteristics related to
   measurement and sampling significantly impact the empirical
   conflict-performance links reported in the literature. We base our
   conclusions on correlational analyses, two-stage meta-analytic
   structural equation modeling (TSSEM), and meta-analytic regression

EA NOV 2020
PY 2020
AB Extant communication theories predate the explosion of digital formats
   and technological advances such as virtual reality, which likely
   explains their predominant focus on traditional and format-level (e.g.,
   face-to-face, email) rather than digital or characteristic-level (e.g.,
   visual cues, synchronicity) design decisions. Firms thus lack insights
   into how to create and use emerging digital formats, individually or
   synergistically. To establish a holistic framework of bilateral
   multiformat communication for relationship marketing, this article
   reviews communication theory to establish a foundation for understanding
   multiformat communication and to identify any gaps (e.g., AI agents,
   simulated cues). The authors then review bilateral communication
   research in light of the identified theoretical gaps, to inform their
   framework. Finally, by decomposing these formats according to six
   fundamental characteristics, they predict how each characteristic might
   promote effective, efficient, and experiential communication goals, in
   light of distinct message, temporal, and dyadic factors. Ultimately,
   these combined insights reveal an overarching framework, with
   characteristic-level propositions grouped into five key themes, that can
   serve as a platform for academics and managers to develop multiformat
   communication theory and relationship strategies.

PY 2020
AB This research aims to bridge the entrepreneurship and marketing/sales
   literature streams by studying how young firms enable their resource
   endowments using value-based selling. Drawing on effectuation logic, the
   authors examine how young firms can achieve sales growth by using human
   and financial resource slack during the early years of their existence
   and accounting for the impact of the variability of these resources over
   time. The integrated framework and hypotheses are tested using unique,
   multisource (survey and objective archival) longitudinal panel data from
   71 young firms covering a seven-year period. As anticipated, the
   findings show that both financial and human resource slack are
   negatively related to young firms' sales growth over time and that
   financial resource slack variability exerts a positive impact and human
   resource slack variability exerts a (nonsignificant) negative impact.
   The results also confirm the importance of value-based selling as a
   guiding mechanism that significantly alters the effects of both types of
   resource slack and their variability over time. While value-based
   selling can help a young firm use slack to grow more effectively, it
   also has a dark side in that it can stand in the way of risk taking.

   feeling AI for analyzing interactions and human emotions. This framework
   lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy
   (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the
   marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection,
   thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer
   understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can
   be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for
   targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning

   used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling

AB Measurement invariance is necessary before any substantive
   cross-national comparisons can be made. The statistical workhorse for
   conducting measurement invariance analyses is the multigroup
   confirmatory factor analysis model. This model works well if a few items
   exhibit clearly differential item functioning, but it is not able to
   capture, model, and control for measurement bias that affects all items,
   i.e., this model cannot account for common method variance. The presence
   of common method variance in cross-national data leads to poorly fitting
   models which in turn often results in biased, if not incorrect, results.
   We introduce a procedure to analyze and control for common method
   variance in one's data, based on a series of factor analysis models with
   a random intercept. The modeling framework yields constructs and factor
   scores free of method effects. We use marker variables to support the
   validity of the interpretation of the random intercept as method factor.
   An empirical application dealing with material values in Spain, the UK,
   and Brazil is provided. We compare results with those obtained for the
   standard multigroup confirmatory factor analysis model.

AB Practitioners have touted sales enablement as a prominent solution to

   empirical research on this concept is nonexistent in extant literature.
   Furthermore, while the pervasiveness of sales domain scholarship
   suggests that salespeople will continue to influence sales practice
   through expanded opportunities, firms must also blend the art and
   science of engaging customers in a profitable and sustainable manner. To
   address these scholarly demands, the authors designed an empirical study
   that conceptualizes sales enablement and offers an in-depth perspective
   on how organizations enable their sales force. The authors employ an
   ethnographic inquiry comprising various data sources, including 41 depth
   interviews with professionals responsible for sales enablement
   architecture and/or execution. Findings offer a multi-dimensional
   conceptualization of sales enablement and introduce a process model
   which explicates how firms develop sales enablement as a dynamic

   foundational insights and advanced theories of sales enablement, while

AB Marketing scholars have long acknowledged that buyer-supplier
   relationships (BSRs) evolve over time. Nevertheless, truly dynamic
   considerations tend to be confined to the "future research" sections of
   papers. Performing dynamic BSR research is difficult, not only because
   of the requirements of data collection and analysis, but also due to the
   somewhat fragmented understanding of the available studies on BSR
   dynamics and how an overarching understanding of their findings can
   refine static relationship models. We conduct a systematic literature
   review to organize the available research on BSR dynamics. The review
   process reveals four overarching themes: (1) relationship continuity,
   (2) relationship learning, (3) relationship stages and trajectories, and
   (4) relationship fluctuations. We discuss each theme, describe how the
   themes can be applied as a dynamic lens to research questions involving
   BSRs, and outline research directions that might stimulate further work
   on relationship dynamics.

EA SEP 2020

AB We model consumer journeys for user-created programs published in an
   online programming platform (OPP) and uncover factors that predict their
   occurrence. We build our model on a theoretical framework where consumer
   journeys involve three latent stages (Learn, Feel, Do), in which users
   gather information about, express fondness toward, and try the published
   items, respectively. Using a dataset from an OPP where users publish
   multimedia items and follow other users, we find that there is no one
   dominant consumer journey; instead, the sequences of stages in a journey
   (e.g., Learn -> Feel -> Do) vary across published items. Furthermore, we
   find that the social capital (i.e., social network) of a publisher
   influences the occurrence of spillover effects between latent stages
   (the phenomenon that one stage in a period triggers another stage in the
   next period) for the items posted by the publisher. We also find that a
   publisher's social capital has only a transient impact on the consumer
   journeys for the publisher's projects, underlining the importance of
   consistently making new network connections in order to promote the
   growth of user activities surrounding the publisher's projects. We apply
   our findings to the publishers' networking investment decisions to show
   that publishers' networking investment would be severely suboptimal if
   journey heterogeneity is not considered.

EA SEP 2020
PY 2020
AB Inertia might secure consumers' continued patronage, but it also can
   stunt potential expansion. By examining the psychology underlying
   inertia, this research informs managers about whether to engage inertial
   consumers proactively. In the proposed conceptual model, an inertia
   mindset orients a customer toward status quo consumption. This mindset
   emerges from dual sources, and each source consists of a behavioral and
   a psychological component. Specifically, the behavioral consistency of
   prior consumption activates an inertia mindset by prompting a
   psychological inclination to minimize thinking; the magnitude of prior
   consumption leads to inertia by evoking an inclination to minimize
   regret. Complementary survey and field studies offer support for the
   proposed model and reveal that a proactive loyalty reward can reinforce
   inertia based on regret minimization but disrupt inertia based on
   thinking minimization. Even well-intentioned marketing initiatives thus
   might be ineffective or detrimental, depending on the source and
   strength of inertia already present in the customer.

   approach, we identify the drivers of GRI, develop and define GRI as a
   multidimensional construct, explain the outcomes, and suggest the
   moderating factors conducive to GRI success. We then discuss and develop
   research propositions on the various proposed relationships in the GRI
   framework. In addition to setting up a foundation for a future research

   mainstream firms, and co-operative societies/non-profit organizations to
   realize the financial, environmental, and societal benefits from GRI.

AB International new product launch speed is a crucial goal for firms, as
   it has major implications for their performance. The authors examine
   whether and how (1) the price and number of attributes of a new product,
   (2) the number of developed (emerging) countries in which it has been
   launched, and (3) the nature of the firm that originally launched it
   (i.e., multinational versus not) affect the new product's speed of
   launch from developed countries to emerging ones (i.e., trickle-down) or
   vice versa (i.e., reverse innovation). In order to test the hypotheses,
   the authors use data on new product launches in the global packaged food
   industry in 2001-2014. The results indicate that a lower price
   accelerates trickle-down, while a higher price and more attributes
   accelerate reverse innovation. Further, having been launched in more
   countries and having been launched by a multinational firm both
   accelerate trickle-down and reverse innovation.

AB As emerging market international marketing alliances (E-IMAs) are
   becoming popular as instruments of growth for firms from the developed
   markets that are attempting to expand into emerging markets, there is a
   growing need to understand how these E-IMAs are formed, operate, and
   even get dissolved in the emerging markets. Extant theories on IMAs,
   although limited, have primarily focused on alliances that are formed
   and operate in developing markets. However, as the institutional context
   of emerging markets differs significantly from that of developing
   markets, these existing theories are not sufficient to explain and
   predict phenomena related to E-IMAs. Therefore, using data from in-depth
   interviews with senior executives from 106 companies involved in
   marketing alliances, this study develops a new theoretical model based
   on the awareness-motivation-capability framework that can explain and
   predict phenomena related to E-IMAs. Related propositions are presented
   for both researchers and practitioners who are interested in studying or
   developing E-IMAs.

AB Building on the properties of emerging markets, we investigate how a

   of service failure to reduce customer churn in an emerging market. Using
   resource exchange theory and a multi-method approach, we show that the
   conventional wisdom related to service recovery needs to be reevaluated
   in emerging markets. Our results show that process failures lead to a
   higher likelihood of customer churn compared to outcome failures in
   emerging markets. Investigating service recovery mechanisms, we find
   that compensation is more effective in recovering from process failures
   than in recovering from outcome failures in emerging markets. Similarly,
   employee behavior has a stronger impact on mitigating the ill effects of
   process failures than those of outcome failures. The study contributes
   to the literature on service recovery and resource exchange theory and
   provides managerial insights for the effective management of customer
   churn due to service failures in emerging markets.

AB Extant research has established the effects of nostalgic brand
   positioning on brand equity, but studies have only examined individual
   nostalgic brand relationship dimensions separately. Combining these
   strands, we offer a holistic perspective of the mediating processes and
   identify contextual and firm-related moderators that affect the
   individual linkages. We draw on construal level theory and develop a
   multilevel model in which emotional attachment, brand local iconness,
   and brand authenticity explain how nostalgic brand positioning creates
   brand equity. We posit that country differences between emerging and
   developed markets and brand innovativeness moderate these mediating
   effects. The results from large consumer samples suggest that emotional
   attachment and brand local iconness play a weaker role in mediating the
   connection of nostalgic brand positioning and brand equity in emerging
   markets. However, this disadvantage in creating brand equity through
   nostalgic brand positioning in emerging markets can be attenuated with
   increasing levels of brand innovativeness.

   lack the sophisticated knowledge required to innovate. However, extant

   also typically treats openness as a firm-level concept. In contrast,
   this study investigates how individual employees rely on both internal
   and external knowledge to increase their innovative work output (and,
   secondarily, their customer acquisition performance) and how their
   supervising manager's characteristics moderate these mechanisms. Using
   hierarchical linear modeling of data collected from 123 employees and 50
   managers in telecommunications companies in the emerging market of
   Vietnam, we find support for our hypothesized relationships. These
   findings have important implications for research and practice as they

AB Growth in emerging markets is critical as it leads global economic
   growth. Emerging market innovations, which we define as innovations
   created in an emerging market for use by consumers or customers in that
   market and possibly other markets, form the engine for such growth and
   continue to rise in importance for various stakeholders. These
   innovations fundamentally differ from developed market innovations, and
   impact consumers, firms, governments, and the society at large.
   Conceptual research on emerging market innovation has not focused on the
   differential drivers of emerging and developed market innovations. Most
   empirical studies have also focused on only one emerging market, not
   offering generalizable conclusions across emerging markets. Thus, while
   prior research offers a limited understanding of factors specific to
   emerging market innovations, not much is known about the unique and
   differential drivers of emerging market innovations relative to
   developed market innovations. Our study offers a broader framework
   highlighting the unique aspects of emerging market innovations, their
   unique and differential (relative to developed market innovations)
   drivers, and related practitioner takeaways. Our framework and
   propositions suggest that different drivers impact the demand and supply
   for innovations, and, in turn, the number of innovations differently in
   emerging and developed markets. We outline an agenda for future
   research.

AB Nonprofit organizations play a critical role in society. To fulfill
   their missions, they require sufficient supply to meet demand. In
   addressing how nonprofits can work towards meeting the needed demand
   through donors, the marketing literature focuses primarily on leveraging
   individual differences, message characteristics, motives, or social
   norms to secure donor time, talent, or treasure. Other ways in which
   donors make impactful contributions, however, are less studied. One of
   these less examined cases is donor activism, a social mechanism by which
   donors act to increase supply for nonprofits. Through an ethnographic
   study of donors organizing a Guinness World Records attempt for the most
   living organ donors gathered together, we investigate the mechanisms
   underlying donor efforts to positively influence the supply of living
   donors. Our findings suggest that donation behaviors that increase
   supply may lead to varying degrees of activism. Managerial implications
   of these findings are presented with specific suggestions for how donors
   and nonprofit organizations may interact within consumer movements to
   support supply generation.

AB Digital technology in financial services is helping consumers gain wider

   creates new challenges because consumers may make suboptimal investment
   decisions. We address the challenge that consumers often face complex
   investment decisions involving multiple funds. Normative optimal asset
   allocation theory prescribes that investors should simultaneously
   optimize risk-returns over their entire portfolio. We propose two
   behavioral effects (mental separation and correlation neglect) that
   prevent consumers from doing so and a new choice architecture of
   virtually integrating investment funds that can help overcome these
   effects. Results from three experiments, using general population
   samples, provide support for the predicted behavioral effects and the
   beneficial impact of virtual integration. We find that consumers'
   behavioral biases are not overcome by financial literacy, which further
   underlines the marketing relevance of this research.

AB Big data technologies and analytics enable new digital services and are
   often associated with superior performance. However, firms investing in
   big data often fail to attain those advantages. To answer the questions
   of how and when big data pay off, marketing scholars need new
   theoretical approaches and empirical tools that account for the
   digitized world. Building on affordance theory, the authors develop a
   novel, conceptually rigorous, and practice-oriented framework of the
   impact of big data investments on service innovation and performance.
   Affordances representaction possibilities, namely what individuals or
   organizations with certain goals and capabilities can do with a
   technology. The authors conceptualize and operationalize three important
   big data marketing affordances: customer behavior pattern spotting,
   real-time market responsiveness, and data-driven market ambidexterity.
   The empirical analysis establishes construct validity and offers a
   preliminary nomological test of direct, indirect, and conditional
   effects of big data marketing affordances on perceived big data
   performance.

AB Although marketing researchers agree that brand authenticity has various
   meanings, little consensus exists concerning the number of meanings and
   what those meanings entail. This paper addresses this lack of clarity in
   the literature by introducing the Entity-Referent Correspondence (ERC)
   Framework of Authenticity. The ERC Framework provides an overarching
   definition of authenticity-a consumer's perception of the degree to
   which a supposed authenticentity corresponds withor is "true to"
   something else, which we label areferent. The ERC Framework also
   suggests three types of authenticity-true-to-ideal,true-to-fact,
   andtrue-to-self-that are consistent with the general definition yet are
   distinct. Each type may manifest in a variety of ways in a brand
   context, suggesting that brand authenticity is not a singular concept.
   The framework also proposes nomological nets that explain how consumers
   form perceptions of each type, how the types lead to managerially
   relevant outcomes (e.g., expected quality, trust), and how the types
   affect each other. This research advances the literature on brand
   authenticity by offering three types of conceptual contributions as
   identified by MacInnis (2011):integrating,differentiating,

AB Investor stock market response has received a great deal of attention in
   the marketing literature. However, firms are not faceless corporations;
   individuals such as CEOs set their strategies. Upper echelon and
   strategic leadership theories hold that chosen strategies derive from
   these individuals' opinions, which are a function of their
   personalities, demographics, experiences, and values. Building on recent
   literature, the authors propose how CEO characteristics can influence
   innovation and stock returns. Investors are motivated by cash flow
   expectations-in particular, the prospect of increasing and accelerating
   future cash flows, reducing associated risks, and increasing residual
   value. This systematic review focuses on four main
   characteristics-personality, demographics, experience and
   compensation-to arrive at a set of propositions on innovation and stock
   returns. After reviewing the extensive literature on CEO
   characteristics, the authors outline the emerging findings on CMO
   characteristics; propose future research directions on CEO and CMO
   characteristics, innovations, and stock returns; and offer implications
   for practice.

AB This systematic review of sponsorship-linked marketing from 1996 to 2017

   that there is a surplus of research that examines audience responses to
   sponsorship-linked marketing but a shortage of research that examines
   marketing management of the sponsorship process. This misalignment
   ofresearch needstoresearch investmentsstems partly from a failure to
   consider the sponsorship process as a whole. Research has failed to
   account for the complexity of the sponsorship-linked marketing ecosystem
   that influences both audience response and management decision making.
   The authors develop a sponsoring process model, generalizable to all
   sponsorship contexts, as an organizing frame for the review and as a
   reorienting perspective for research and practice. To spur future work,
   they advance a series of research questions and, to support practice,
   provide managerial insights.

AB Customer experience is a key marketing concept, yet the growing number
   of studies focused on this topic has led to considerable fragmentation
   and theoretical confusion. To move the field forward, this article
   develops a set of fundamental premises that reconcile contradictions in
   research on customer experience and provide integrative guideposts for
   future research. A systematic review of 136 articles identifies eight
   literature fields that address customer experience. The article then
   compares the phenomena and metatheoretical assumptions prevalent in each
   field to establish a dual classification of research traditions that
   study customer experience as responses to either (1) managerial stimuli
   or (2) consumption processes. By analyzing the compatibility of these
   research traditions through a metatheoretical lens, this investigation
   derives four fundamental premises of customer experience that are
   generalizable across settings and contexts. These premises advance the
   conceptual development of customer experience by defining its core
   conceptual domain and providing guidelines for further research.

AB The technology readiness (TR) index aims to better understand people's
   propensity to embrace and use cutting-edge technologies. The initial TR
   construct considers four dimensions-innovativeness, optimism,
   insecurity, and discomfort-that collectively explain technology usage.
   The present meta-analysis advances understanding of TR by reexamining
   its dimensionality, and investigating mediating mechanisms and
   moderating influences in the TR-technology usage relationship. Using
   data from 193 independent samples extracted from 163 articles reported
   by 69,263 individuals, we find that TR is best conceptualized as a
   two-dimensional construct differentiating between motivators
   (innovativeness, optimism) and inhibitors (insecurity, discomfort). We
   observe strong indirect effects of these dimensions on technology usage
   through mediators proposed by the quality-value-satisfaction chain and
   technology acceptance model. The results suggest stronger relationships
   for motivators than for inhibitors, but also that these TR dimensions
   exert influence through different mediators. Further, the moderator
   results suggest that the strength of TR-technology usage relationships
   depends on the technology type (hedonic/utilitarian), examined firm
   characteristics (voluntary/mandatory use; firm support), and country
   context (gross domestic product; human development). Finally, customer
   age, education, and experience are related to TR. These findings enhance
   managers' understanding of how TR influences technology usage.

   how it is affected by the presence of three other functional heads (or

   based on a panel of 401 U.S. manufacturers reaffirm the positive CMO
   presence-firm performance relationship and establish that the linkage is
   (a) strengthened by chief sales officer presence when industry sales
   volatility is high, (b) strengthened (weakened) by chief technology
   officer presence when industry innovation and firm differentiation (cost
   leadership) are high, and (c) strengthened (weakened) by chief supply
   chain officer presence when firm diversification (differentiation) is
   high. The study: expands top management team research by investigating
   executive dyads formed by the pairing of heads of functions advocated in
   the organizationally embedded view of marketing; delineates CXOs' roles
   and orientations to clarify mechanisms that aid or hamper the CMO; and,
   identifies industry and firm-level contexts that affect the CMO-CXO
   interfaces. Additionally, the findings underscore the importance of
   appointing CMOs and, of CMOs spanning organizational silos.

AB Although brands increasingly disseminate their brand biographies through
   brand sources, this research shows that this practice can decrease brand
   attitudes and consumer preferences. A brand source activates consumers'
   persuasion knowledge, increasing negative thoughts and impeding
   narrative transportation into the brand biography. This research
   furthermore demonstrates that the negative impact of a brand source in
   the dissemination of brand biographies depends on self-congruence, such
   that a detrimental effect on consumer attitudes and preferences occurs
   when the brand biography is incongruent with consumer's self-concept,
   but is mitigated when the brand biography is self-congruent. These
   findings suggest that the dissemination of brand biographies by brand
   sources requires consideration of source and congruence effects.

AB Programmatic television advertising technologies allow advertisers to
   detect the placement of competitor ads and schedule their own ads almost
   in real time. This paper investigates how managers can improve the
   effectiveness of their ad schedules by considering the relative
   placement of their ads with respect to competitor ads. By analyzing a
   dataset of more than 43,000 own-brand and 49,000 competitor TV ad
   insertions, we propose and estimate the effects of four ad scheduling
   strategies on online conversions. The best strategy is to place ads in
   isolation, either when competitors are not advertising at all or
   advertising on other stations; this avoidance strategy results in the
   greatest effectiveness of own-brand ads and delivers conversions from
   competitor ads. If an avoidance strategy is not possible, brands should
   advertise more heavily than their competitors. Doing so mitigates the
   substitution effect of competitive advertising, which occurs when
   competitor ads outnumber own-brand ads. Our analyses show that adopting
   programmatic television technology would have led the focal firm to
   increase the conversions from television advertising by 59%.

AB Complex services, such as healthcare, struggle to realize the benefits
   of value co-creation due to the substantial challenges of managing such
   services over the long-term. Key to overcoming these challenges to value
   co-creation is a profound understanding of dialogue (i.e., 'quality of
   discourse' facilitating shared meaning) during service interactions.
   Contributing to an emerging literature, we undertake a longitudinal,
   ethnographic study to assess dialogue between professionals and patients
   through the lens of dialogic engagement (i.e., iterative mutual learning
   processes that bring about action through dialogue). We develop and
   empirically support six dialogic co-creation and co-destruction
   mechanisms that impact on the resolution of tensions and integration of
   knowledge resources between service providers and consumers. We reveal
   the multidimensional and dynamic nature of value created or destroyed
   through these mechanisms in dialogue over time. Taking healthcare as an
   exemplar, we offer a research agenda for developing our understanding of
   DE in complex services.

AB Marketing scholars have recently embraced the study of the corporate
   upper echelons-the executives and board members atop the organizational
   hierarchy. However, management scholars have researched the upper
   echelons for decades, with frequent forays into the marketing strategy
   domain. As a result of progressing in two separate disciplines, the
   literature on marketing strategy and the upper echelons is fragmented
   and disjointed. We develop an organizing framework to review extant
   research and assess and synthesize the knowledge in the upper echelons
   marketing strategy domain. Our review covers the 14 most influential
   marketing and management journals from 1984 through February, 2020.
   Given the relative newness of this research within marketing, we develop
   a conceptual model fusing existing theory in the upper echelons and
   marketing strategy literatures, and use this to identify key blind spots
   and underdeveloped areas of knowledge caused by the two fields'
   independent evolutions. Finally, we also examine challenges associated
   with conducting research in this area and provide recommendations to
   help researchers and reviewers navigate these challenges to advance
   theory and practice.

   13 million audience members, we develop theory regarding the iterative
   process by which person brands attract engaged attention in such online

AB We investigate the widespread yet under-researched social phenomenon of
   consumer arrogance-the propensity to broadcast one's superiority over
   others in the consumption domain. Building on the theory of positive
   illusions, we examine how and under what conditions triggering people's
   consumer arrogance prompts their positive and negative word-of-mouth
   communication. In a pilot study and five experiments, we establish that
   triggering people's sense of consumer arrogance will increase their
   word-of-mouth inclinations and behaviors. We show that triggering
   consumers' sense of arrogance will result in a greater propensity for
   word-of-mouth communication than triggering their sense of superiority
   or desire to brag independently. While most consumers engage in positive
   word-of-mouth, consumer arrogance fuels both positive and negative
   word-of-mouth communication. Furthermore, whereas the former stems from
   self-enhancement needs, negative word-of-mouth communication arises from
   the needs for both self-affirmation and self-enhancement, especially in
   a social context. Overall, the results highlight the uniqueness and
   strategic potential of consumer arrogance as a social phenomenon.

AB Although social media use is gaining increasing importance as a

   SMMS, using social media and marketing strategy dimensions. This is
   followed by a conceptualization of the developmental process of SMMSs,
   which comprises four major components, namely drivers, inputs,
   throughputs, and outputs. Next, we propose a taxonomy that classifies
   SMMSs into four types according to their strategic maturity level:
   social commerce strategy, social content strategy, social monitoring
   strategy, and social CRM strategy. We subsequently validate this
   taxonomy of SMMSs using information derived from prior empirical
   studies, as well with data collected from in-depth interviews and a

AB Continuous improvement products (CIPs) are designed so that firms can
   make post-purchase improvements without requiring the user to fully
   replace the product. Although CIPs are becoming increasingly common in
   the marketplace, there are challenges in having customers adopt these
   products. In this multimethod research using two different types of
   studies, we find that sharing information about development progress
   increases adoption of the current version of the CIP, and that this
   relationship is mediated by the perceived commitment of developers to
   the product. Furthermore, we find that product familiarity moderates
   this mediation relationship. Our research offers insight to scholars
   interested in this new wave of products, and offers direction for
   managers in how to market their CIPs. Specifically, we recommend that
   firms developing CIPs use product development information as a marketing
   tool to communicate their commitment to the continued improvement of the
   product and to spur the purchase of the current versions of their CIPs.

AB Product proliferation may not be an effective strategy for every brand
   in every product category. Rather, the success of product proliferation
   may be conditional on previously unconsidered differences across product
   categories. In particular, brand relevance in category (BRiC), which is
   closely associated with an array of category-level characteristics,
   offers a potentially influential contingency. We rely on a survey study
   (Study 1a) and a lab experiment (Study 1b) to examine individual
   consumer reactions to product proliferation. These studies show that
   product proliferation has a stronger impact on customer-based brand
   equity in high BRiC categories than in low BRiC categories. From a firm
   perspective, Study 2 explores the effect of product proliferation on
   brand sales performance using IRI scanner data; it indicates conversely
   that BRiC has an opposing moderating effect, such that product
   proliferation has a stronger impact on brand sales in low BRiC
   categories than in high BRiC categories. Together, these nuanced results
   have important implications for product line and brand management
   resource allocation decisions.

AB This study explains how manufacturers tackle the critical managerial
   challenge of transforming a product-focused sales force to undertake

   authors explain how individual and organizational conditions combine to
   determine salespeople's engagement in solution selling. Multilevel,
   multisource data from the sales organization of a global supplier of
   building solutions represent input from salespeople (N = 184), solution
   champions (N = 23), and sales managers (N = 26). A fuzzy set qualitative
   comparative analysis reveals no single, optimal way to overcome
   transformation challenges. Rather, consistent with prior research,
   solution selling requires certain types of salespeople, because
   value-based selling is a necessary condition for successful engagement.

   engaged, as long as the organization provides appropriate support that
   is tailored to individual salespersons' needs. The findings affirm that
   this viable support can come from either sales managers or solution

AB This research examines customer engagement in social media (CESM) using
   a meta-analytic model of 814 effect sizes across 97 studies involving
   161,059 respondents. Findings reveal that customer engagement is driven
   by satisfaction, positive emotions, and trust, but not by commitment.
   Satisfaction is a stronger predictor of customer engagement in high (vs.
   low) convenience, B2B (vs. B2C), and Twitter (vs. Facebook and Blogs).
   Twitter appears twice as likely as other social media platforms to
   improve customer engagement via satisfaction and positive emotions.
   Customer engagement is also found to have substantial value for
   companies, directly impacting firm performance, behavioral intention,
   and word-of-mouth. Moreover, hedonic consumption yields nearly three
   times stronger customer engagement to firm performance effects vis-a-vis
   utilitarian consumption. However, contrary to conventional managerial
   wisdom, word-of-mouth does not improve firm performance nor does it
   mediate customer engagement effects on firm performance. Contributions
   to customer engagement theory, including an embellishment of the
   customer engagement mechanics definition, and practical implications for
   managers are discussed.

AB As consumers continue to struggle with issues related to unhealthy
   consumption, the goal of front-of-package (FOP) nutrition labels is to
   provide nutrition information in more understandable formats. The
   marketplace is filled with different FOP labels, but their true effects
   remain unclear, as does which label works best to change perceptions and
   behaviors. We address these issues through an interdisciplinary
   meta-analysis, generalizing the findings of 114 articles on the impact
   of FOP labels on outcomes such as consumers' ability to identify
   healthier options, product perceptions, purchase behavior, and
   consumption. The results show that, although FOP labels help consumers
   to identify healthier products, their ability to nudge consumers toward
   healthier choices is more limited. Importantly, FOP labels may lead to
   halo effects, positively influencing not only virtue but also vice
   products, e.g., interpretive nutrient-specific labels improve health
   perceptions of both vice and virtue products, yet they influence only
   the purchase intention of virtues.

AB Impulse buying by consumers has received considerable attention in
   consumer research. The phenomenon is interesting because it is not only
   prompted by a variety of internal psychological factors but also
   influenced by external, market-related stimuli. The meta-analysis
   reported in this article integrates findings from 231 samples and more
   than 75,000 consumers to extend understanding of the relationship
   between impulse buying and its determinants, associated with several
   internal and external factors. Traits (e.g., sensation-seeking, impulse
   buying tendency), motives (e.g., utilitarian, hedonic), consumer
   resources (e.g., time, money), and marketing stimuli emerge as key
   triggers of impulse buying. Consumers' self-control and mood states
   mediate and explain the affective and cognitive psychological processes
   associated with impulse buying. By establishing these pathways and
   processes, this study helps clarify factors contributing to impulse
   buying and the role of factors in resisting such impulses. It also
   explains the inconsistent findings in prior research by highlighting the
   context-dependency of various determinants. Specifically, the results of
   a moderator analysis indicate that the impacts of many determinants
   depend on the consumption context (e.g., product's identity expression,
   price level in the industry).

AB Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) is a prevalent consumer practice that
   has undeniable effects on the company bottom line, yet it remains an
   over-labeled and under-theorized concept. Thus, marketers could benefit

   Building on the consumer motivation-opportunity-ability framework, this
   study conceptualizes three distinct stages in the eWOM process: eWOM
   creation, eWOM exposure, and eWOM evaluation. For each stage, we adopt a
   dual lens-from the perspective of the consumer (who sends and receives
   eWOM) and that of the marketer (who amplifies and manages eWOM for
   business results)-to synthesize key research insights and propose a
   research agenda based on a multi-disciplinary systematic review of 1050
   academic publications on eWOM published between 1996 and 2019. We
   conclude with a discussion of the future of eWOM research and practice.

AB Distinguishing between consumers' positive and negative affect is a
   popular approach in both marketing research and practice, but such
   valence-based approaches sacrifice specificity and explanatory power. As
   emotions of the same valence can greatly differ with regard to their
   underlying appraisal patterns, they also differently affect consumer
   judgment and behavior. Our meta-analysis of 1035 effect sizes (N =
   40,777) across 10 discrete emotions shows that analyzing discrete
   emotions clearly outperforms models of core affect (valence and arousal)
   when studying firm-customer encounters. Specifically, we find that the
   greatest impact stems from the medium-arousal emotion of gratitude and
   that positive emotions show consistently stronger effect sizes than do
   negative emotions. We also examine how effects are moderated by
   situational characteristics of the experience triggering the emotion.
   Based on our findings, we develop recommendations that help marketers
   identify and manage consumers' emotions more effectively.

AB Consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) is highly relevant to managers and
   academics, and the various direct and indirect methods used to measure
   it vary in their accuracy, defined as how closely the hypothetically
   measured WTP (HWTP) matches consumers' real WTP (RWTP). The difference
   between HWTP and RWTP is the "hypothetical bias." A prevalent assumption
   in marketing science is that indirect methods measure WTP more
   accurately than do direct methods. With a meta-analysis of 77 studies
   reported in 47 papers and resulting in 115 effect sizes, we test that
   assumption by assessing the hypothetical bias. The total sample consists
   of 24,347 included observations for HWTP and 20,656 for RWTP. Moving
   beyond extant meta-analyses in marketing, we introduce an effect size
   metric (i.e., response ratio) and a novel analysis method (i.e.,
   multivariate mixed linear model) to analyze the stochastically dependent
   effect sizes. Our findings are relevant for academic researchers and
   managers. First, on average, the hypothetical bias is 21%, and this
   study provides a reference point for the expected magnitude of the
   hypothetical bias. Second, the deviation primarily depends on the use of
   a direct or indirect method for measuring HWTP. In contrast with
   conventional wisdom, indirect methods actually overestimate RWTP
   significantly stronger than direct methods. Third, the hypothetical bias
   is greater for higher valued products, specialty goods (cf. other
   product types), and within-subject designs (cf. between-subject
   designs), thus a stronger downward adjustment of HWTP values is
   necessary to reflect consumers' RWTP.

AB Research studies on brand transgression (BT), service failure and
   recovery (SFR), and product-harm crisis (PHC) appear to have a common
   focus, yet the three streams developed surprisingly independently and
   with limited reference to one another. This situation is unfortunate
   because all three fields study a similar phenomenon by using
   complementary conceptualizations, theories, and methods; we argue that
   this development in silos represents an unnecessary obstacle to the
   development of a common discipline. In response, this review synthesizes
   the growing BT, SFR, and PHC literatures by systematically reviewing 236
   articles across 21 years using an integrative conceptual framework. In
   doing so, we showcase how the mature field of SFR in concert with the
   younger but prolific BT and PHC fields can enrich one another while
   jointly advancing a broad and unified discipline of negative events in
   marketing. Through this process, we provide and explicate seven
   overarching insights across three major themes (theory, dynamic aspects,
   and method) to encourage researchers to contribute to the interface
   between these three important fields. The review concludes with academic
   contributions and practical implications.

AB Emphasizing customer satisfaction as a strategic lever for enhancing
   business performance is a widespread business practice. However, just
   over 25 years of empirical studies by academic researchers has produced
   evidence that is sometimes contradictory. Hence, greater academic
   clarity and improved managerial understanding could result from a
   meta-analysis of the customer satisfaction-business performance
   relationship. To that end, the authors analyzed 251 correlations from 96
   studies published between 1991 and 2017. While the
   satisfaction-performance relationship is positive and statistically
   significant on average (r = .101), more meaningful insights emerge from
   the explication of moderating and mediating relationships. Illustrative
   of these insights is the finding that satisfaction is more appropriately
   depicted as mediating the effects of selected marketing strategy
   variables on firm performance outcomes. Moreover, when satisfaction is
   viewed in the right setting using the right satisfaction and performance
   measures, a most favorable contingencies (MFC) perspective, the
   estimated correlation is reasonably strong (r = .349).

AB In recent decades, the competitive landscape in many markets (e.g.,
   retailing) and the methods that researchers use to analyze these markets
   have changed heavily. This has resulted in updates of empirical
   generalizations in many areas. For cross-price elasticities, however,
   this update is pending. Hence, it is unclear how these changes have
   affected cross-price elasticities, a key measure of competitive
   interaction. To address this void, we conduct a meta-analysis of prior
   econometric estimates and consider a broad set of determinants that have
   not been analyzed before in the context of cross-price elasticities.
   Using 7,264 estimates from 115 studies, we identify six new main
   empirical generalizations. (1) The mean cross-price elasticity is .26
   (median =.10), which is half the magnitude of the previous meta-analytic
   mean. (2) Cross-price elasticities have decreased over time, and (3)
   they decrease over the product life cycle. (4) High-stockpiling
   groceries have the highest cross-price elasticities. (5) Long-term
   cross-price elasticities are larger than short-term cross-price
   elasticities. (6) The asymmetric share effect only holds in high-share
   tiers. We derive implications based on these empirical generalizations.

   supermarkets and analyzed the nutritional quality of 1,668,301 purchases
   using the FSA nutrient profiling score. Effect sizes were 17 times

   The most effective nutrition label, Nutri-Score, increased the purchases
   of foods in the top third of their category nutrition-wise by 14%, but
   had no impact on the purchases of foods with medium, low, or unlabeled
   nutrition quality. Therefore, Nutri-Score only improved the nutritional
   quality of the basket of labeled foods purchased by 2.5% (-0.142 FSA
   points). Nutri-Score's performance improved with the variance (but not
   the mean) of the nutritional quality of the category. In-store surveys
   suggest that Nutri-Score's ability to attract attention and help

   performance.

AB As exemplary instruments of relationship marketing, loyalty programs are
   being implemented and studied at an unprecedented rate. Yet real-world
   efforts often fail-or at least do not live up to expectations-and
   despite the growing richness of loyalty program literature, the field
   remains fragmented. Thus, a comprehensive perspective is required. To
   guide further research and suggest ways that managers might improve
   loyalty program effectiveness, this article synthesizes insights on
   loyalty programs from empirical research and underlying psychological
   theories. The proposed conceptual model of loyalty program effectiveness
   consists of psychological, design, and operational elements; in turn, it
   suggests a set of 12 propositions that account for differential effects
   across customer acquisition, onboarding, expansion, and retention
   stages. With an evolving theory of loyalty programs across relationship
   dynamics, this propositional inventory parsimoniously delineates the
   trade-offs associated with relationship stage-based management of these
   programs. The proposed comprehensive foundation can guide loyalty
   program practice and research.

AB Consumer attitudes and behaviors are fundamentally dynamic processes;
   thus, understanding consumer dynamics is crucial for truly understanding
   consumer behaviors and for firms to formulate appropriate actions.
   Recent history in empirical marketing research has enjoyed increasingly
   richer consumer data as the result of technology and firms' conscious
   data collection efforts. Richer data, in turn, have propelled the
   development and application of quantitative methods in modeling consumer
   dynamics, and have contributed to the understanding of complex dynamic
   behaviors across many domains. In this paper, we discuss the sources of
   consumer dynamics and how our understanding in this area has improved
   over the past four decades. Accordingly, we discuss several commonly
   used empirical methods for conducting dynamics research. Finally, as the
   data evolution continues into new forms and new environments, we
   identify cutting-edge trends and domains, and offer directions for
   advancing the understanding of consumer dynamics in these emerging
   areas.

AB Firms increasingly seek to improve the online shopping experience by
   enabling customers to exchange product recommendations through social
   augmented reality (AR). We utilize socially situated cognition theory
   and conduct a series of five studies to explore how social AR supports
   shared decision making in recommender-decision maker dyads. We
   demonstrate that optimal configurations of social AR, that is, a static
   (vs. dynamic) point-of-view sharing format matched with an
   image-enhanced (vs. text-only) communicative act, increase recommenders'
   comfort with providing advice and decision makers' likelihood of using
   the advice in their choice. For both, these effects are due to a sense
   of social empowerment, which also stimulates recommenders' desire for a
   product and positive behavioral intentions. However, recommenders'
   communication motives impose boundary conditions. When recommenders have
   strong impression management concerns, this weakens the effect of social
   empowerment on recommendation comfort. Furthermore, the stronger a
   recommender's persuasion goal, the less likely the decision maker is to
   use the recommendation in their choice.

AB Although customers frequently negotiate the prices of both goods and
   services, academic research has mostly examined negotiations in goods
   contexts, neglecting the fact that negotiations for services may be
   different. This study examines the consequences of customers' price
   negotiation behavior relating to services as compared to goods. Using
   five empirical studies with field and experimental data, the authors
   show that services exert ambivalent effects. First, the heterogeneity
   intrinsic to services leads customers to aspire to better negotiation
   outcomes because customers perceive higher risk and regard negotiation
   as more legitimate, particularly if services are customized. Second, the
   inseparability of services leads customers to lower their negotiation
   aspirations because they fear negative consequences, particularly if
   customers are closely integrated in the service process. Building on
   these findings, the authors conceptualize and test communication
   strategies that diminish customers' negotiation aspirations. Study
   results provide actionable recommendations for managers and salespeople
   in service industries.

AB Many consumer decisions are assisted by product recommendations. When
   retailers provide such recommendations, there is an inherent tension
   between (1) presenting a set of products that are close in
   attractiveness (fine product set granularity) and (2) presenting a wider
   range of products that are more different in attractiveness (coarse
   product set granularity). While the former can maximize the
   attractiveness of the recommended set of products, the latter makes it
   easier for consumers to determine which of the recommended products is
   most attractive, thus boosting consumer response. Evidence from a
   large-scale field study (with naturally occurring variation in the
   granularity of online recommendation sets) provides strong support for
   this tension and shows that less fine-grained product recommendation
   sets promote consumer response. We also find that, in line with our
   theorizing, coarser set granularity increases the time consumers spend
   processing detailed information about individual products relative to
   time they spend comparing products at the set level. These effects are
   less pronounced when consumer engagement in the decision process is low.
   The key insights from the field study are replicated in a tightly
   controlled experiment (using a different product domain). The findings
   of this research have important implications for how best to integrate
   large online assortments and product recommendations to stimulate
   consumer response.

AB Cause-related marketing (CM) is the creation of a mutually beneficial
   relationship between a company and a nonprofit organization, with the
   dual objectives of boosting profit for the company and promoting the
   cause of the nonprofit. The present research demonstrates that mere
   exposure to CM evokes in consumers a desire to be prosocial and reduces
   the likelihood of self-indulgent choices. However, the act of purchasing
   CM products may provide consumers with a "warm glow" feeling from being
   prosocial. This feeling of a warm glow licenses subsequent
   self-indulgent behaviors, especially when the product with a cause is
   hedonic (vs. utilitarian) in nature. We further find that when the warm
   glow feeling is misattributed to something else (e.g., weather), the
   licensing effect is reduced. By distinguishing between the pre- and
   post-purchase effects of cause-related products, this research offers
   practical insights to managers on how to design and execute CM
   strategies.

AB Despite growing applications of social and healthcare marketing to
   enhance public well-being through anti-stigma campaigns, little research
   investigates how public stigma surrounding health conditions might limit
   the outcomes of these campaigns. By drawing on the theory of implicit
   worldviews, this study identifies reasons for public stigma as well as
   associated message frames to address these reasons. Study 1a provides
   evidence that implicit worldviews are relevant to campaign results.
   Study 1b and Study 2 demonstrate that fitting consumers' implicit
   worldview with suitable (i.e., biomedical or biopsychosocial) health
   frames reduces stigma endorsement. Study 3 identifies the perceived
   severity of a mental illness as a boundary condition; marketing
   communications have the greatest impact when they refer to an illness
   with lower perceived severity. Finally, Study 4 expands understanding of
   the phenomenon by extending the findings to physical health conditions
   (i.e., obesity). The article concludes by discussing the implications of
   these findings for policy and future applications.

AB A significant proportion of many firms' customers are unprofitable. The
   question of how unprofitable customers should be managed has recently
   received increasing research attention from the customer and manager
   angles, but the effects of unprofitable customer management (UCM)
   strategies on shareholder value is unknown. Using an event study
   methodology, we examine stock market reactions to disclosures of firms'
   UCM strategy decisions. Results from a sample of UCM strategy disclosure
   events reveal an average short-term abnormal stock return of -0.53%.
   Drawing on signaling theory logic, we explore a number of signal (UCM
   strategy), signaler (firm engaging in UCM), and signaling environment
   characteristics that may affect the shareholder value effects of firms'
   UCM approaches. Our analyses show that investors respond more favorably
   to indirect UCM strategies than to direct customer divestment
   strategies. We also find that particular types of indirect UCM strategy
   approaches and strategic intent in UCM strategy adoption, stronger firm
   marketing capabilities and, and positive publicity can help mitigate the
   generally negative abnormal stock returns observed. Overall, our
   findings have important implications for marketing theory and provide
   actionable new insights for managers into how to approach the management
   of unprofitable customers.

AB Electronic word of mouth (eWOM), especially on online platforms such as

   is understood about competitive spillover effects in eWOM, especially
   among mature brands in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) markets. In
   this article we analyze the entire corpus of tweets of two main FMCG
   brands (Pepsi and Coke) and use dynamic factorial analysis to classify
   eWOM into topic categories in an unsupervised manner. We then analyze
   how these topics influence sales, taking into account traditional
   marketing mix elements and endogeneity concerns. Our results show that
   looking at eWOM in an aggregate manner (positive vs. negative valence)
   can be misleading and mask important effects. We see strong evidence for
   eWOM competitor spillover, depending on eWOM content diagnosticity (high
   vs. low). We also show the presence of asymmetric eWOM spillover effects
   depending on the typicality and directionality of brand associations.

AB Despite the common belief that knowledge sharing in new product
   development (NPD) teams is beneficial, empirical findings are mixed. We
   adopt a microfoundations perspective and draw from the socio-cognitive
   theory to propose a model that theorizes a nonlinear effect of customer
   knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance. In particular, we
   identify the underlying mechanism through which shared common customer
   knowledge and perceived diagnostic value shape the nonlinear returns to
   customer knowledge sharing behaviors. In Study 1, data from the
   biotechnology industry provide support for the hypothesis that customer
   knowledge sharing behaviors in NPD teams have an inverted U-shaped
   relationship with NPD performance. In Study 2, data from
   business-to-business (B2B) industries demonstrate that customer
   knowledge sharing behaviors are positively related to shared common
   customer knowledge in NPD teams, and the latter has an inverted U-shaped
   effect on NPD performance. Finally, this nonlinear effect is moderated
   by the team's perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge, such
   that the inflection point of the inverted U-shaped curve is shifted
   upward in teams with high levels of perceived diagnostic value of
   customer knowledge, strengthening the impact of shared common knowledge
   on NPD performance.

   new ventures and use a novel approach to measuring personality that is
   based on computer text analysis-specifically, the LIWC application-which
   we apply to the CMOs' Twitter accounts. Our findings indicate that a
   CMO's extraversion positively moderates the relationship between a new
   venture's maturity and web traffic, while a CMO's conscientiousness is a
   negative moderator of this relationship. These results have useful
   theoretical and practical implications for the role of the CMO and for

   that distributors' compliance with channel programs may hinge upon their
   motivation and their perceived ability to comply. To enhance
   distributors' compliance level, manufacturers can proactively model
   reward events to positively influence observing distributors. Our
   empirical results from one experiment and one field survey confirm that,
   if distributors lack motivation to comply with the channel program,
   manufacturers should model a high-performance distributor as a reward
   recipient, which enhances observers' compliance through a decrease in
   perceived financial uncertainty. In contrast, if distributors perceive
   themselves as having a low ability to comply with the channel program,
   manufacturers should model a mediocre-performance distributor as the
   reward recipient, which enhances observers' compliance through an
   increase in perceived goal attainability.

AB While previous studies have demonstrated that organizational pride (OP)
   enhances frontline employees' customer-oriented behavior (COB), they
   have neglected to address the dynamics of the relationship. This
   research helps close this gap by elaborating on a theory of spirals
   positing that the extent of COB depends not only on current levels of OP
   but also on the direction and rate of OP change. In addition, the
   authors challenge the prevalent view that OP affects COB
   unidirectionally, instead predicting reciprocal loops. Hence, they
   propose that increases in OP repeatedly amplify COB and trigger an
   upward spiral, whereas decreases trigger a downward spiral. The results
   of a six-wave panel study support these predictions. Furthermore, the
   authors identify lower and upper boundaries of the spiral: while a
   certain threshold of OP is required to create momentum, the effects of
   further increases in the same variables diminish at high levels of OP
   and COB.

   studies, including a field study conducted in a grocery store, show that
   when unit price information is available, consumer decisions are

   changes in package size. Consumers thus respond more favorably to
   simultaneous decreases than to simultaneous increases. We further show
   that when unit price information is unavailable, consumers focus on the
   observed retail price increase for simultaneous increases, whereas they
   tend to estimate the unit price increase for simultaneous decreases.
   Since both forms of processing result in the cognition of an increase in
   "price," consumers respond similarly to the two tactics.

   marketing lacks a comprehensive understanding of how and when it affects
   consumers and businesses. The current research investigates the effect
   of weather, a ubiquitous environmental cue, on consumers' valuation of
   products. A large-scale field study and four experiments demonstrate
   that weather affects product valuation but only under particular
   conditions. In line with a process account drawing on mental simulation
   of product use, product valuation increases only if (1) the product is
   associated (vs. not associated) with a given weather state, as the match
   of product and weather facilitates mental simulation, and (2) the
   product is perceived as attractive (vs. unattractive), as mental
   simulation highlights both positive and negative product
   characteristics. We test three weather states-sunshine, snowfall, and
   rain-and find that our effects emerge for sunshine and snowfall but not
   for rain, as the latter does not enhance mental simulation. The findings
   advance literature on the effects of environmental cues and mental
   simulation and guide firms on how to increase consumers' valuation of
   products by weather-related measures.

AB In the future, artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to substantially
   change both marketing strategies and customer behaviors. Building from
   not only extant research but also extensive interactions with practice,
   the authors propose a multidimensional framework for understanding the
   impact of AI involving intelligence levels, task types, and whether AI
   is embedded in a robot. Prior research typically addresses a subset of
   these dimensions; this paper integrates all three into a single
   framework. Next, the authors propose a research agenda that addresses
   not only how marketing strategies and customer behaviors will change in
   the future, but also highlights important policy questions relating to
   privacy, bias and ethics. Finally, the authors suggest AI will be more
   effective if it augments (rather than replaces) human managers.

AB Because of modern digital technologies, business environments are
   turning into digital ecosystems, wherein a firm's traditional
   interdependencies are increasingly influenced by digital connectivity.
   For legacy firms, or firms yet to incorporate these technologies into
   their business models, this shift ushers in new opportunities for value
   creation, albeit through new capabilities. In this article, we focus on
   how legacy firms can embrace digital ecosystems to create value through
   a new capability: digital customer orientation. We define digital
   customer orientation as offering customized and enriched customer
   experiences made possible by embracing digital ecosystems. We develop a
   framework for legacy firms to develop capabilities for digital customer
   orientation in three steps: (1) by distilling key insights on how
   digital natives such as Amazon, Google and Facebook leverage their
   digital ecosystems for digital customer orientation; (2) by showing how
   legacy firms can apply those insights to harness their digital
   ecosystems and develop their own approaches for digital customer
   orientation; and (3) by offering a road map and a research agenda for
   legacy firms to engage in digital customer orientation-both by
   highlighting the organizational attributes needed, and by framing those
   attributes within the principles of transformative marketing.

   express purpose of laying new groundwork for the understanding of
   business model innovations in emerging markets. Altogether, the papers
   delineate a new organizational framework for doing business in emerging
   markets and for optimizing gains from emerging market innovations. This
   Special Issue defines and clearly differentiates emerging market
   innovations (EMIs) from developed market innovations (DMIs) and provides
   a generalizable framework. The proposed framework corresponds to the
   process whereby developed market firms do business in emerging markets,
   capitalize on the innovative potential therein, reap the benefits and
   drawbacks of reverse innovations back to developed markets, and,
   finally, continually refine and optimize their innovation strategies.
   This study offers crucial managerial guidance through discussion on
   marketing to the Bottom-of-Pyramid (BoP), the importance of Grassroots
   Innovation (GRI), the necessity of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
   strategies, and the role of employees in open innovation. Lastly, this
   Special Issue posits conceptual and methodological limitations and
   future research direction to capture the emerging market phenomena
   entirely.

AB A central question for firms releasing successive generations of a
   product is whether they should pursue a market-driven approach and align
   own product releases to existing industry-level patterns. While an
   alignment with industry patterns enables firms to capitalize on general
   market receptivity, it may also entail dilution and competitive
   interference effects. Using data on the consumer electronics and
   automotive industries, we show that the effectiveness of such alignment
   depends on two additional timing-related decisions: the firm's release
   regularity for successive product generations and its preannouncement
   timing. Firms benefit from alignment to the industry only if they
   release successive generations in a regular manner (to create
   anticipation) and refrain from early preannouncements (to avoid
   competitive counteraction). For all other combinations of release
   regularity and preannouncement timing, not aligning to the industry
   rhythm leads to higher levels of firm performance. Taken together, our
   findings enable a nuanced view of the interplay of timing-related launch
   decisions that provides actionable guidance for managers.

   approach, we define RI as a multidimensional construct, identify the
   antecedents of RI, discuss the outcomes, and propose a set of moderating
   variables contributing to the success of RIs. We also present a set of
   research propositions with their relative effects on the relationships

AB The Web is a constantly evolving, complex system, with important
   implications for both marketers and consumers. In this paper, we contend
   that over the next five to ten years society will see a shift in the
   nature of the Web, as consumers, firms and regulators become
   increasingly concerned about privacy. In particular, we predict that, as
   a result of this privacy-focus, various information sharing and
   protection practices currently found on the Dark Web will be
   increasingly adapted in the overall Web, and in the process, firms will
   lose much of their ability to fuel a modern marketing machinery that
   relies on abundant, rich, and timely consumer data. In this type of
   controlled information-sharing environment, we foresee the emersion of
   two distinct types of consumers: (1) those generally willing to share
   their information with marketers (Buffs), and (2) those who generally
   deny access to their personal information (Ghosts). We argue that one
   way marketers can navigate this new environment is by effectively
   designing and deploying conversational agents (CAs), often referred to
   as "chatbots." In particular, we propose that CAs may be used to
   understand and engage both types of consumers, while providing
   personalization, and serving both as a form of differentiation and as an
   important strategic asset for the firm-one capable of eliciting
   self-disclosure of otherwise private consumer information.

AB Firms are increasingly deploying a value-based selling (VBS) approach in
   their sales organizations to drive growth for new offerings. However,
   VBS adoption remains challenging, signaling that leaders need guidance
   to motivate VBS. Drawing from the systems theory of motivation, we
   examine motivational mechanisms at two levels-salesperson and sales
   team-to understand how to motivate, and benefit from, VBS. Using
   multisource data (i.e., salespeople, managers, archival performance)
   from 70 sales teams in a U.S.-based manufacturing and services provider,
   our findings illustrate drivers and outcomes of VBS. Specifically, we
   uncover a framework of salesperson, leader, customer, and team factors
   that help explain salesperson motivation for VBS. Importantly, we link
   VBS to customers' adoption of new products to support VBS's role for
   selling new products. Critical for sales team strategy, our model also
   integrates a team-level motivational mechanism to provide a
   comprehensive framework for salesperson and sales team motivations and
   outcomes.

AB Previous research on the impact of corporate crises on customers'
   elasticity has largely focused on performance-related crises (e.g.,
   product recalls) and found an increasing price elasticity under these
   conditions. We investigate whether this result differs for value-related
   crises that are due to ethical violations, such as the use of child
   labor or environmental pollution. In line with moral foundation theory
   (MFT), we propose that value-related crises lead to stronger moral
   outrage and increased boycott intentions, thereby decreasing price and
   product-performance elasticities. We first analyze more than 360,000
   Facebook user comments in relation to four value-related and four
   performance-related crises and show that the different outcomes for
   value- and performance-related crises can be explained according to MFT.
   Then, through discrete choice experiments, we demonstrate that, in
   contrast to performance-related crises, price elasticity decreases
   substantially for a value-related crisis that affects both violating and
   nonviolating companies. We also show for the first time the impact on
   product-performance elasticities with similar negative effects as for
   price. The results are stable even for different product categories,
   causes of ethical violations, and measurement conditions. As a result,
   it is more difficult for companies to recover from value- than
   performance-related crises.

AB In user-generated content (UGC) platforms, content generators (i.e.,
   posters) account for only a minority of users. The majority of users
   lurk, participating in information diffusion only and making no direct
   contributions to the platforms (i.e., diffusers). In this paper, we
   study diffusers' reposting behavior in a UGC platform and compare it
   with that of posters. We find that diffusers generally behave similarly
   to posters in reposting. Both groups repost more when seeing more posts
   and encountering popular posts. Interestingly, their reposting behavior
   diverges under information redundancy, i.e., when more popular posts are
   seen in a dense network. Under this condition, diffusers show a much
   higher propensity to repost, which is (partially) driven by their lesser
   need for uniqueness (NFU). Overall, this study suggests an exquisite way
   for platforms to activate their lurking users and it sheds light on
   their value in generating word-of-mouth and in facilitating information
   diffusion. It also provides useful guidelines for firms to approach the
   right type of lurking users (i.e., diffusers in a dense network) by
   using the right method of stimulation (i.e., offering popular albeit
   redundant information) during product diffusion online.

   demonstrate differential effects of non-hub usersversus hub users

   followers of non-hubusers, and that there are more reciprocal ties
   between non-hub users andtheir followers than relationships between hub

   narration accompanied by competent images earns more likes by
   stimulating the motivation of self-enhancement. We also confirm

AB Different types of crowdfunding backers adopt various social and
   economic roles, beyond just financial support. Yet the most appropriate
   message strategy for attracting these different types of backers remains
   unclear. To fill this gap, using insights into advertising appeals and
   the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we propose a conceptual
   framework reflecting how the emphasis of the appeals in a crowdfunding
   message might influence support decisions by two types of backers:
   consumers and investors. Objective data from a crowdfunding website
   reveal that appeals that emphasize information (emotion) exert more
   positive persuasive effects on consumer (investment) backers than on
   investment (consumer) backers. When devising the appeal emphasis,
   entrepreneurs thus must make a trade-off while also considering
   contingent factors such as decision control, social orientation, and
   reward tangibility. The practical implications of these findings suggest
   that entrepreneurs should activate backers' information processing
   routes differentially, using distinct appeal emphases, rather than
   relying on an undifferentiated message strategy.

AB Channel relationships with dependence asymmetry, which are especially
   harmful to partners with dependence disadvantage, abound in developing
   markets. To help these dependence-disadvantaged parties find feasible
   solutions for dependence balancing, this study examines network
   embeddedness and its differential role in enforcing the counterpart's
   relationship-specific investments (RSIs), thus leading to improved
   channel performance for both partners. Based on the political economy
   framework, we posit that a dependence-disadvantaged partner's
   embeddedness in business and government networks entices its partner to
   commit more RSIs, which in turn improve its channel performance;
   conversely, such an effect is weaker for the dependence-advantaged
   partner. We also predict that under high dependence asymmetry, a
   dependence-disadvantaged partner's embeddedness in the business network
   will exert a smaller effect, but its embeddedness in the government
   network will exert a larger effect. We collected dyadic survey data of
   buyer-supplier pairs in consumer product industries in China. In
   general, the results provide support for our predictions. The findings
   provide theoretical and managerial implications for partners in
   asymmetric channel relationships in developing markets.

AB In business markets, firms operating in developing economies deal with
   burgeoning use of the internet, new electronic purchase methods, and a
   wide range of social media and online sales platforms. However,
   marketers are unclear about the pattern of influence of firm-initiated
   (i.e., paid media, owned media, and digital inbound marketing) and
   market-initiated (i.e., earned social media and organic search) digital
   communications on B2B sales and customer acquisition. We develop and
   test a model of digital echoverse in an emerging market B2B context,
   using vector autoregressive modeling to analyze a unique 132-week
   dataset from a Brazilian hub firm operating in the marketplace. We find
   empirical evidence supporting our conceptual framework in emerging
   markets. Underscoring the importance of a market development approach
   for emerging markets, the findings show that owned media and digital
   inbound marketing play a bigger role in influencing customer
   acquisition. Impressions generated through earned social media
   complement owned media, but not paid media. These insights highlight the
   notion that while sources of digital echoverse may remain the same
   across countries, its components exert a particular pattern of influence
   in an emerging market context. This is expected to encourage managers to
   rethink their digital strategies for B2B customer acquisition and sales
   enhancement while operating in emerging markets.

AB The objective of this paper is to examine whether including words that
   associate a stock name with a country name might influence investor
   behavior and stock returns. Across three studies, we collect and analyze
   both stock market data and individual-level experimental data to show
   the effect of home-name effect on investors' behavior and stock market
   performance. Using stock trading records, Study 1 shows that home-name
   stocks significantly outperform non-home-name stocks in emerging Chinese
   stock markets dominated by retail investors. We replicate this home-name
   effect on individual Chinese investors in randomized experiments
   (Studies 2 and 3) and further test the underlying psychological process
   by exploring the mediating effect of investor firm psychological
   identification. We find that associations with the home country name
   lead to stronger investor psychological identification with the firm and
   higher investment intentions, and that this effect is much stronger when
   investors are motivated to self-enhance. Together, these studies inform
   firms' stock naming strategies and provide guidance for financial
   advising by demonstrating the crucial role of identification in
   financial decision making.

AB Although nutrition information informs consumer decisions at the point
   of sale in offline stores, it is unclear whether such information
   affects online food sales. Using a field experiment, we examine three
   issues: (1) the impact of nutrition information in online food shopping;
   (2) the interaction effects between nutrition information and seller
   reputation; and (3) the different effects of healthy and unhealthy food
   sales. Results indicate that nutrition information significantly
   increases food sales in online conditions and that seller reputation can
   strengthen the impact of such information. Furthermore, nutrition
   information creates more sales of healthy (versus unhealthy) food. Using
   an eye-tracking experiment to measure whether purchasers pay attention
   to nutrition information, we find that participants who look at
   nutrition information longer tend to choose foods with nutrition-fact
   labels.

AB Paid search advertising is a critical source of traffic for sellers on
   e-commerce platforms. As the mobile Internet gains prominence as the
   main channel for reaching consumers, sellers need to know how to select
   and bid on keywords in online versus mobile search settings. This study
   compares the differential effects of paid search keywords in online and
   mobile settings on both direct and indirect sales, along with the
   moderating roles of keyword specificity and keyword cost. Two field
   studies and two lab experiments consistently show that a paid keyword in
   a mobile setting can prompt higher direct sales than it does in an
   online setting, but it generates lower indirect sales in general.
   Moreover, while keyword cost attenuates this positive relationship
   between mobile searching and direct sales, keyword specificity and
   keyword cost attenuate this negative relationship between mobile
   searching and indirect sales. Empirical evidence also reveals the sales
   and return on investment of paid search keywords in mobile and online
   settings. This study enriches previous literature by detailing new
   insights into the distinct settings of mobile and online search
   advertising.

AB This manuscript delineates technological innovation into the separate
   dimensions of novelty and meaningfulness to examine how a firm's
   organizational learning modes of adaptive learning and experimental
   learning, together with unabsorbed slack resources, influence the
   effects of novelty and meaningfulness on firm financial performance. The
   multi-method empirical approach leverages secondary data from firm
   patent information and COMPUSTAT, and primary data from senior
   executives at 167 firms in various high-tech industries. The results
   indicate that adaptive learning heightens meaningfulness but diminishes
   novelty, whereas experimental learning harms meaningfulness.
   Additionally, firms' unabsorbed slack resources moderate the
   relationships of experimental and adaptive learning with novelty. In
   particular, experimental learning enhances novelty only when a firm has
   sufficient unabsorbed slack to adjust resource levels in accordance with
   experimentation. Further, the results suggest that meaningfulness
   increases firm financial performance as represented by Tobin's q, both
   independently and jointly when considered with novelty. These insights
   underscore the necessity of treating novelty and meaningfulness as
   separate dimensions of technological innovation that impact firm
   performance.

AB Recent years have witnessed the diffusion of 3D printing technologies
   that allow consumers to create products with the push of a button. While
   these technologies may change how value is created in the marketplace,
   there is little research on 3D printing from a consumer perspective.
   Against this background, this research conceptualizes 3D printing as a
   form of co-creation and presents four studies aimed at understanding how
   consumers respond to products they have printed themselves. Study 1
   shows that self-printing a product positively affects product
   evaluations by increasing perceived ownership. Study 2 finds that this
   effect occurs even when people are not able to observe the printing
   process. Study 3 shows that the positive effect of self-printing is
   moderated by the affective quality of the products being printed.
   Specifically, while self-printing enhances the evaluations of hedonic
   products, it has no effect on the evaluations of utilitarian products.
   Finally, Study 4 identifies a strategy that may offset the disadvantage
   that utilitarian products face in a 3D printing context, that is,
   ingredient branding.

AB Recent meta-analyses provide clear insights into how service firms can
   benefit from relationship marketing, whereas investigations of
   customers' relational benefits (1) are unclear about the absolute and
   relative strengths by which different relational benefit dimensions
   induce different customer responses and (2) have not simultaneously
   examined the various mediating processes (including perceived value,
   relationship quality, and switching costs) through which relational
   benefits reportedly affect customer loyalty. To consolidate extant
   research on the benefits of relationship marketing for customers, this
   meta-analysis integrates 1242 effect sizes drawn from 235 independent
   samples across 224 papers disseminated in the past two decades. The
   results reveal that all three relational benefits affect loyalty, though
   confidence benefits and social benefits have the strongest effects.
   Among the three identified mediation paths through which relational
   benefits influence customer loyalty, the sequential path through
   perceived value and relationship quality is the strongest. From a
   service research perspective, this study provides novel empirical
   generalizations; managerially, the findings suggest that a primary goal
   for service managers should be strengthening confidence and social
   benefits.

AB The last decade has seen marketing strategy evolve rapidly in three
   major directions, which can be summarized in three Ds: digital,
   data-rich, and developing markets. The first D refers to "digital";
   digital marketing strategy deals with firms' judicious use of digital
   resources to create differentiated and sustainable value for customers.
   The second D is "data-rich"; digital marketing has made available to
   researchers unprecedented data on firm and customer behavior. The third
   D is "developing markets"; the issue of marketing strategy in a digital
   and data-rich context is particularly relevant in developing markets
   such as BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries. This article
   formally defines the scopes of the three Ds, identifies opportunities
   associated with three Ds, and highlights the work published in these
   areas that will hopefully trigger more research work in D-3
   environments.

AB Psychology and economics (together known as behavioral economics) are
   two prominent disciplines underlying many theories in marketing. The
   extensive marketing literature documents consumers' nonrational behavior
   even though behavioral biases might not always be consistently termed or
   formally described. In this review, we identify and synthesize empirical
   research on behavioral biases in marketing. We document the key findings
   according to three classes of deviations (i.e., nonstandard preferences,
   nonstandard beliefs, and nonstandard decision making) and the four
   phases of consumer purchase decision making (i.e., need recognition,
   pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase). Our organizing framework
   allows us to (1) synthesize instructive marketing papers in a concise
   and meaningful manner and (2) identify connections and differences
   within and across categories in both dimensions. In our review, we
   discuss specific implications for management and avenues for future
   research.

   technological advances including the digital capture of health data,
   improvements in methodologies for data analysis, and exponential
   increases in processing power and storage capacity, which have created a

AB Research and practice have called for the incorporation of customer
   mindset metrics (CMMs) to improve the accuracy of models that predict
   individual customer profits. However, as CMMs are self-reported data,
   collected through customer surveys, they are seldom available for a
   firm's entire customer database and in addition always measured with
   some degree of error. Their usage in models for individual-level
   predictions of customer profit has therefore proven challenging. We
   offer a solution through a new method called multiple overimputation
   (MO). MO treats missing data as an extreme form of measurement error and
   imputes the CMMs for both customers with observed, albeit with
   measurement error, as well as missing values, that are then included as
   predictors in a model of individual customer profits. Through a
   simulation study, empirical application in the pharmaceutical industry,
   and a customer selection exercise, we demonstrate the predictive and
   economic value of applying MO in the context of CRM.

AB This research reveals the ways that salespeople manage intrafirm
   relationships by acting as intermediaries, connecting intrafirm members
   that would otherwise be unconnected. Using a two-study, multimethod
   design, the authors establish that (1) salespeople act as representative
   intermediaries positioned between peers in sales and those in marketing
   and product development; (2) the effects of representative positions
   with marketing and product development on performance are non-linear;
   and (3) selling-related knowledge moderates representative effects on
   performance. Representative salespeople act as the exclusive connection
   between a peer salesperson and a non-sales contact (marketing or product
   development), controlling non-redundant knowledge to gain influence over
   their peers. This research contributes to marketing by identifying
   non-linear effects for how salespeople mediate relationships between
   their peers and others in key intrafirm functions, and showing that
   salespeople with high selling-related knowledge realize enhanced effects
   of the representative position on sales performance.

AB Does improving employee happiness affect customer outcomes? The current
   study attempts to answer this question by examining the impact of
   employee satisfaction trajectories (i.e., systematic changes in employee
   satisfaction) on customer outcomes. After accounting for employees'
   initial satisfaction levels, the analyses demonstrate the importance of
   employee satisfaction trajectories for customer satisfaction and
   repatronage intentions, as well as identify customer-employee contact as
   a necessary conduit for their effect. From a macro perspective, employee
   satisfaction trajectories strongly impact customer satisfaction for
   companies with significant employee-customer interaction, but not for
   companies without such interaction. From a micro perspective, employee
   satisfaction trajectories influence customer repatronage intentions for
   frequent customers, but not for infrequent customers. These effects are
   robust to controlling for previous customer evaluations and recent
   employee evaluations. Overall, these findings extend the dominant view
   of examining static, employee satisfaction levels and offer important
   implications for the management of the organizational frontline.

AB As organizational buying systems grow more complex and sophisticated,
   suppliers increasingly rely on buyer advocacy: an individual buyer's
   efforts to influence his/her colleagues such that the supplier's
   standing is improved. Drawing from cognitive response theory, the
   authors hypothesize an inverted U-shaped relationship between a buyer's
   advocacy for a supplier and the customer's purchases from that supplier.
   They theorize that this effect is moderated by the advocate's industry
   experience and customer-supplier relationship characteristics. An
   analysis of multisource data from a B2B service provider (Study 1)
   supports the predicted inverted U-shaped relationship, while a unique
   dataset from a large industrial supplier (Study 2) provides broad
   support for the hypothesized moderators. Finally, a randomized
   experiment (Study 3) replicates key findings and corroborates the
   theorized cognitive response mechanisms. Findings contribute to the
   limited literature on buyer advocacy within the organizational buying
   domain and offer practical implications for suppliers and buyers.

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that brands should respond in an
   accommodative way to consumer complaints. However, this research shows
   that observers of the communication between complainants and brands on
   social media may prefer a defensive response under specific conditions.
   Thus, this study helps managers to find optimal responses to social
   media complaints, thereby minimizing negative consequences. We introduce
   a previously unexamined key moderator that takes account of the observer
   perspective: the benefits sought in the context of a complainant-brand
   interaction (e.g., brand presences in social media). Hence, we
   differentiate hedonic from utilitarian contexts and we note the distinct
   observer benefits and corresponding preferences. A field study and a
   series of experiments show that a defensive response can be superior in
   hedonic contexts but inferior in utilitarian ones. We also show how
   response strategy indirectly affects observers' behavioral consequences
   and identify complaint reasoning and brand communication style as
   relevant boundary conditions.

AB Recent literature has identified consumers' fairness and image concerns
   as the primary drivers of payments under pay-what-you-want (PWYW)
   pricing. Consequently, managers have employed a variety of design
   variations to invoke/alleviate these concerns to attract more customers
   and increase payment magnitudes. We develop a theoretical approach that
   combines both prosocial and self-interested motives to examine
   consumers' four possible responses to design variations in PWYW
   exchange: (1) opt-out, (2) free-ride, (3) default to recommendation, or
   (4) other payment. We confirm model predictions using an empirical
   approach that jointly estimates the multipartite customer response. We
   report findings pertaining to four managerially controllable variables
   namely, 'payment visibility', 'information on payment recipients',
   'timing of payment', and 'explicit price recommendations' using both
   secondary data and controlled experiments. We show that design
   variations have a heterogeneous effect on different types of consumer
   responses leading to countervailing effects on revenues. We derive
   several actionable managerial recommendations.

AB Companies are increasing their use of cause-related marketing as a means
   of communicating their commitment to corporate social responsibility
   while accomplishing their strategic goals. Although prior studies
   suggest that consumers react positively to cause-related marketing
   programs, understanding of their impact on financial performance remains
   limited. To address this gap, the authors employ an event study to
   examine the effects of cause-related marketing announcements on
   shareholder value using a sample of firms that appeared on Fortune's
   Most Admired All-Star list between 2005 and 2017. Study results show
   that announcement of these initiatives results in a significant loss of
   shareholder value. These losses are most pronounced for firms making
   monetary-only contributions, in comparison to those that make in-kind
   donations. In addition, the negative effects are mitigated for firms
   that have stronger reputations, have greater resource slack, and operate
   in more dynamic industries. Moreover, low-reputation and low-slack firms
   benefit most from in-kind contributions.

AB For many professional services, advice adherence is a necessary
   condition for achieving service success for both customers and service
   providers. Despite their pivotal roles in value co-creation, typical
   conversational interactions often lead to low adherence. We propose that
   enabling a "dominance transition," from provider dominance in the
   pre-advice stage to customer dominance in the post-advice stage,
   enhances advice adherence because it increases customers' perceived
   common ground. Furthermore, providers' consultation focus, customers'
   prior knowledge, and customers' perceived adherence effort moderate this
   process. Using mixed methods, including both empirical modeling and
   controlled and field experiments, we validate the proposed model in
   various contexts (healthcare, financial services, and fitness and
   wellness counseling). The findings establish several theoretical
   contributions and offer managerial implications for improving advice
   adherence by managing dominance transitions in conversational
   interactions more effectively through training service providers or even
   programming AI chatbots.

AB Strategic alliances entail process-oriented decisions, in which
   information about outcomes is unveiled over time. Therefore, it is
   difficult for investors to gauge the value of such decisions in the
   short term; longitudinal analysis is necessary. Accordingly, the authors
   apply latent growth modeling to a data set of 270 international
   codevelopment alliances announced over an 18-year period. The results
   demonstrate that investors reward firms for their international
   codevelopment alliances in the short term but punish them in the long
   term. Initially, exchange conditions have positive effects, but these
   effects decrease over time. However, the decrease slows when firms'
   market updates contain positive news. Although investors view sharing of
   innovation resources as a competitive advantage in the short term, they
   perceive exchange conditions as transaction hazards in the long term.
   The results also show that long-term decreases in market returns are
   greater when codevelopment activities are conducted offshore rather than
   onshore.

AB While online platforms often provide a single composite rating and the
   ratings of different attributes of a product, they largely ignore the
   attribute characteristics and customer criticality, which limits
   managerial action. We propose a multi-facet item response theory (MFIRT)
   approach to simultaneously examine the effects of product attributes,
   reviewer criticality, consumption situation, product type, and time in
   assessing latent customer satisfaction. Analyses of hotel ratings from
   TripAdvisor and beer ratings from BeerAdvocate suggest that product
   attributes differ with respect to their discriminating and threshold
   characteristics and that reviewer segments emphasize different
   attributes when rating various products over time. The MFIRT approach
   predicts product performance more accurately than alternative methods
   and provides novel insights to inform marketing strategies. The MFIRT
   framework can fundamentally advance how we analyze customer satisfaction
   and other consumer attitudes and improve marketing research and
   practice.

AB As mobile phones continue to rapidly expand around the world, marketers
   are seeking to better understand the impact these devices have on
   consumer outcomes. One common but understudied area is how mobile phones
   may influence in-store behaviors. Although prior research has
   investigated the many shopping related activities consumers undertake on
   their phones, it is still estimated that nearly half of all in-store
   mobile phone use is unrelated to the shopping task. Therefore, this
   paper examines the impact of shopping-unrelated mobile phone use, a
   frequent but understudied phenomenon, on consumers' ability to
   accurately manage in-store shopping plans. Using both field and
   experimental data, we demonstrate that shopping-unrelated mobile phone
   use negatively affects consumers' ability to accurately carry out
   in-store shopping plans and is associated with an increase in unplanned
   purchasing. Furthermore, we find that consumers who are highly dependent
   upon mobile phones tend to be the most at risk of deviating from a
   shopping plan while engaging in shopping-unrelated mobile phone use.

AB Containing customer fraud has great economic relevance. This research
   proposes a fresh approach, derived from mental accounting theory and
   behavioral pricing research. Large-scale field data from more than
   100,000 insurance customers and a follow-up experiment reveal that
   payment schemes influence customer fraud. Specifically, customers with
   annual payment schedules submit more rejected claims soon after their
   lump sum payments, and customers with monthly payment schedules exhibit
   greater customer fraud, in an effect that increases over time and
   decreases with greater category involvement. Customers who actively pay
   using money transfers submit about 40% more claims that get rejected
   than those who rely on more passive payment methods, such as autopay or
   direct debit. Marketing practitioners thus should reconsider frequent
   payment schedules and active payment options and monitor customer
   behavior after lump sum payments. For marketing research, this study
   opens a new research avenue, linking customer misbehavior and behavioral
   pricing research within a mental accounting framework.

AB Applying grounded theory, we comprehensively categorize capabilities
   needed for market-shaping and synthesize them into a conceptual
   framework that describes the process and its outcomes. We establish that
   in order to improve value creation in a market, market-shapers must
   consider a larger system of relevant stakeholders, recognize the
   institutional arrangements governing their behaviors, and foster new
   resource linkages within and across stakeholders. Based on our analysis,
   we identify eight triggering capabilities, which generate new intra- and
   inter-stakeholder resource linkages by directly influencing various
   characteristics of the market, and four facilitating capabilities, which
   enable market-shaping by discovering the value potential of new resource
   linkages and augment the impact of the triggering capabilities by
   mobilizing relevant resources. We show that triggering capabilities are
   context-specific, whereas facilitating capabilities are generic. We
   conclude that there are performance outcomes of market-shaping not only
   for the shaping firm, but also for other stakeholders, and at overall
   market level.

AB Loyalty programs (LPs) are marketing investments designed to foster
   behavioral loyalty among a firm's best customers and, ultimately,
   increase firm performance. Surprisingly, the effectiveness of
   introducing LPs on firm performance in the short and long term has not
   been thoroughly evaluated. This research examines the extent to which
   introducing an LP can increase both firm sales and gross profits.
   Leveraging data from 322 publicly-traded firms that introduced an LP
   between 2000 and 2015, the authors demonstrate that introducing an LP
   can increase sales and gross profits in the short term (within the first
   year), and these positive effects are sustained long term (for at least
   three years). However, the effects on gross profits do not become
   significant until the second quarter after LP introduction, and their
   overall impact on performance lags substantially behind sales.
   Complementing these primary findings, the results reveal that offering
   an LP with tiers or earning mechanisms can provide firms with
   significant increases in sales and gross profits. Taken together, this
   research demonstrates that introducing strategically designed LPs can
   dramatically increase firm performance in both the short and long term.

AB Drawing from the interactional psychology of personality and
   multitasking paradigm, we examine the contingencies of salesperson
   orientation ambidexterity in the exploration of new customers (i.e.,
   hunting) and the exploitation of existing customers (i.e., farming) to
   achieve sales growth and make time allocation decisions. The results
   from a field study and an experiment indicate that the impact of
   salesperson orientation ambidexterity is contingent on a salesperson's
   customer base characteristics. First, a salesperson's orientation
   ambidexterity in both hunting and farming leads to significantly higher
   (lower) sales growth when his or her existing customer base is large
   (small). Second, high levels of customer base newness in a salesperson's
   customer portfolio weaken the relationship between hunting time
   allocation at time t - 1 and hunting time allocation at time t,
   suggesting that salespeople are not subject to a success trap in
   hunting. However, salespeople are subject to a success trap in farming.
   These findings shed new light on how a salesperson's customer portfolio
   influences salesperson behaviors and performance, with implications for
   how to better manage ambidextrous behaviors in customer engagement.

   commercialization according to three goal orientations: learning,

   studies of a total of 387 supervisor-sales rep dyads revealed that
   supervisor-sales rep fit strongly affects the sales success of
   innovations but only negligibly influences the sales success of
   established solutions. Further investigations showed that this
   difference occurs because both supplementary and complementary
   relationships between supervisors' and sales reps' goal orientations can
   alter reps' role stress regarding innovation selling. Moreover, results
   reveal that firms can magnify the effects of supervisor-sales rep fit on
   innovation sales success by tying sales reps' variable compensation more
   closely to innovation sales. Results also show that firms interested in
   reducing the negative consequences of a problematic supervisor-sales rep
   match should facilitate and encourage supervisors' appreciative
   communication with the sales reps.

   promotional responses and (2) assess the effectiveness of promotional
   responses and how it varies across brand tiers. They find that though
   Toyota recalls induced competitive promotions of approximately $850 on
   average, the competitive promotional reactions did not significantly
   affect sales on average. However, the results differ substantially by
   brand tiers. While 50% of premium brands increased promotions, only 36%
   of nonpremium brands did so. Among premium brands, 86% benefited from
   promotional reactions; in contrast, the effects of promotions on sales
   were nonsignificant or even negative for most nonpremium brands. These
   findings suggest that well-established results on promotional behaviors

AB In managing today's customer base, firms need to consider not only
   interactions with customers but also interactions among customers. Much
   like the interactions between customers and firms, the interactions
   among customers are dynamic in nature and thus create a dynamic
   structure of preference interdependencies between customers. This
   research proposes a Bayesian spatio-temporal model that simultaneously
   captures the effects of the interactions between customers and the firm,
   the static interdependence due to customers' inherent similarities, and
   the dynamic interdependence arising from observed interactions among
   customers. The model is applied to a rich dataset of university alumni
   donation and event attendance spanning 27years. The results yield
   significant static and dynamic interdependence among the group as well
   as synergistic effects between static and dynamic structures. This
   research demonstrates that not accounting for such interdependence, when
   such interdependence exists, would provide a biased view of firms'
   marketing effectiveness, yield inferior prediction of customer behaviors
   in group settings, and miss opportunities to develop group marketing
   strategies.

AB Online interactions have emerged as a dominant exchange mode for
   companies and customers. Cultivating online relationshipsdefined as
   relational exchanges that are mediated by Internet-based
   channelspresents firms with challenges and opportunities. In lockstep
   with exponential advancements in computing technology, a rich and
   ever-evolving toolbox is available to relationship marketers to manage
   customer relationships online, in settings including e-commerce, social
   media, online communities, mobile, big data, artificial intelligence,
   and augmented reality. To advance academic knowledge and guide
   managerial decision making, this study offers a comprehensive analysis
   of online relationship marketing in terms of its conceptual foundations,
   evolution in business practice, and empirical insights from academic
   research. The authors propose an evolving theory of online relationship
   marketing, characterizing online relationships as uniquely seamless,
   networked, omnichannel, personalized, and anthropomorphized. Based on
   these five essential features, six tenets and 11 corresponding
   propositions parsimoniously predict the performance effects of the
   manifold online relationship marketing strategies.

AB In the context of two-sided markets, we propose hardware lifecycle as a
   key moderator of the impact of superstar and non-superstar software on
   hardware adoption. A hardware's earlier adopters are less price
   sensitive and have a higher preference for exciting and challenging
   software. In contrast, later adopters are more price sensitive and
   prefer simplicity in software. Superstar software tend to be more
   expensive and more complex compared to non-superstars. Therefore,
   earlier (later) adopters prefer superstars (non-superstars), which leads
   to higher impact of superstars (non-superstars) on hardware adoption in
   the early (later) stages of the hardware lifecycle. Using monthly data
   over a 12-year timeframe (1995-2007) from the home video game industry,
   we find that both superstar and non-superstar software impact hardware
   demand, but they matter at different points in the hardware lifecycle.
   Superstars are most influential when hardware is new, and this influence
   declines as hardware ages. In contrast, non-superstar software has a
   positive impact on hardware demand later in the hardware lifecycle, and
   this impact increases with hardware age. Findings reveal that eventually
   the amount of available non-superstar software impacts hardware adoption
   more than the amount of available superstar software. We provide several
   managerial implications based on these findings.

AB Despite cautionary advice against it, delighting consumers by offering
   them pleasant surprises is widely advocated. In this paper, using a
   low-price guarantee context, we show that retailers' attempts to use
   surprise gains to delight consumers might lead to subpar outcomes, if a
   countervailing cognition such as suspicion of retailer opportunism
   dominates consumers' thinking. In a low-price guarantee, retailers
   promise consumers refunds if consumers discover a lower price for a
   purchased product. We propose that providing a surprise component in the
   refund over and above the promised refund might boomerang, by increasing
   the likelihood of countervailing cognitions related to opportunistic
   signaling, in turn decreasing future purchase intentions. Over multiple
   studies, we provide evidence for this proposition, illustrate the
   underlying process, and identify boundary conditions.

AB To encourage customers' referral behavior and expand their customer
   base, providers of innovative products and services often use customer
   referral reward programs (CRPs), though not all CRPs deliver on their
   initial promise. With one field experiment and four online experiments,
   this research investigates the effectiveness of rewarded referrals for
   recruiting new customers for more innovative (versus less innovative)
   offerings and outlines the conditions in which public referral rewards
   have unintended ramifications and decrease customers' referral
   likelihood. In addition to establishing these effects for more
   innovative offerings, this research identifies some moderating
   consequences, such that the detrimental effect of referral rewards on
   referral behavior can be attenuated by not disclosing referral rewards
   (for recommenders) to referral recipients, increasing the referral
   reward size, and rewarding both recommenders and referral recipients.
   These findings have theoretical and managerial implications.

AB Digital goods are increasingly produced by average individuals in a
   serialized fashion. However, it is unclear whether users engage in
   herding in the consumption and purchase of such digital goods and what
   the moderators of the herding effect are. Thus, we propose a
   simultaneous equations model based on herding theory to theoretically
   examine users' potential herding behavior through two competing effects:
   the private signal effect and the sequential actions effect, which refer
   to the impact of the private signals and observed sequential actions of
   others on user quality inference and herding, respectively. The model is
   implemented in a hierarchical Bayes framework, and it is estimated using
   data from the top Chinese literature site. The empirical results suggest
   that users engage in rational herding in both digital book consumption
   and purchase on the focal site and that the herding bias is surprisingly
   stronger for purchasing. Product features significantly mitigate the
   herding bias, while the reputation of the producer and competition
   exacerbate the herding effect. The impact of this rational herding is
   also quantified. This study offers new insights and important
   theoretical and managerial implications for marketing researchers,
   amateur producers, marketing managers, and publishers.

   topic in academic research. Mentions of endogeneity and related
   procedures to correct for it have risen 5x across the field's top
   journals in the past 20years, but represent an overall small portion of
   extant research. Yet there is often substantial difficulty in
   reconciling issues of endogeneity with many of the substantive questions
   of interest to marketing strategy for both theoretical and/or practical
   reasons. This paper provides an overview of main causes of endogeneity,
   approaches to addressing it, and guidance to marketing strategy
   researchers to balance these issues as the field continues to move
   towards more methodological sophistication, potentially at the expense

AB This study explores how reflexivity contributes to the continuation of
   value creation for consumers throughout consumption journeys.
   Reflexivity is awareness of the self within the world. Our study
   establishes a framework for studying consumption journeys centered on
   progressive engagement with a practicein this case surfingover time. We
   discover that reflexivity manifests in consumption journeys in an
   iterative, recursive manneri.e., recursive reflexivitytacking between
   identity (mis)alignment (with dominant institutions) and reflexive
   outcomes, such as imitating, improving, adapting and reconciling. Our
   findings reveal that recursive reflexivity contributes to the
   continuation of value creation in consumption journeys by fostering
   practice continuityi.e., immersion, adaptation, innovation and/or
   dissolution of a practicewhich provides opportunities for enhanced
   consumption experiences and supports the evolution of identity projects.
   These findings deepen the understanding of how practices, identity, and
   institutions contribute to value creation. Implications from these
   findings suggest that firms should pay close attention to recursive
   reflexivity and practice continuity to cultivate value creation with
   consumers by (a) providing opportunities for enhanced consumption
   experiences, (b) aligning or misaligning brand identity with dominant
   institutions, and (c) sparking imagining, identity evolution, and
   practice innovation.

AB A cancer diagnosis can mark the beginning of one of the most
   resource-demanding experiences and traumatic journeys of one's life.
   Surprisingly, little is known about how consumers assign value, namely
   valorize, in these complex, extraordinary experiences. Using
   sociocultural trauma perspectives and a qualitative study of cancer
   health consumers, we demonstrate that consumers valorize through the
   (re)construction of trauma memories and use three strategies:
   metaphorical framing, flesh-witnessing, and commemorating. These enable
   consumers to construct an enduring life story, to claim authority and
   knowledge of witnessing trauma, and to honor and preserve meanings and
   memories. We demonstrate that consumer valorization in a non-hedonic
   context is fluid, continuous, and embedded in broader sociocultural
   contexts. These findings contribute to the literatures of value,
   extraordinary experiences, and trauma.

AB Recently, practitioners have begun appraising an effective customer
   journey design (CJD) as an important source of customer value in
   increasingly complex and digitalized consumer markets. Research,
   however, has neither investigated what constitutes the effectiveness of
   CJD from a consumer perspective nor empirically tested how it affects
   important variables of consumer behavior. The authors define an
   effective CJD as the extent to which consumers perceive multiple
   brand-owned touchpoints as designed in a thematically cohesive,
   consistent, and context-sensitive way. Analyzing consumer data from
   studies in two countries (4814 consumers in total), they provide
   evidence of the positive influence of an effective CJD on customer
   loyalty through brand attitudeover and above the effects of brand
   experience. Importantly, an effective CJD more strongly influences
   utilitarian brand attitudes, while brand experience more strongly
   affects hedonic brand attitudes. These underlying mechanisms are also
   prevalent when testing for the contingency factors services versus
   goods, perceived switching costs, and brand involvement.

   understand more fully the influences on and nature of the journey. We
   find that compliance is a liminal state of provisional actions shaped

   micro-individual factors, and interpretive sense-making practices. We
   contribute a novel, integrated, and nuanced journey framework beyond the

AB Consumers' interactions with smart objects have a relational nature, and
   extensive research has supported the "relationship metaphor" as a
   fruitful way to understand consumer responses to consumption objects.
   But, smart objects pose unique challenges for considering the emergence
   of consumer-object relationships, because their degrees of agency,
   autonomy, and authority lend them their own unique capacities for
   interaction. We present a new framework for consumer-object
   relationships based on the circumplex model of interpersonal
   complementarity and situated in assemblage theory and object-oriented
   ontology. Consumer-object relationship styles are defined in terms of
   two foundational dimensions of behavior, agency, and communion, based on
   the expressive roles played by consumer and object. The overlay of
   assemblage theory provides a conceptually rich understanding of the
   space of master-servant, partner, and unstable relationship styles,
   along with their concomitant positive (enabling) versus negative
   (constraining) consumer experiences. The model's underlying geometry
   supports extensive empirical work and provides a powerful managerial
   framework for measuring and tracking consumer-object relationships and
   the journeys they take over time.

AB New digital technologies not only support consumers in better fulfilling
   their own consumption needs but also enable them to create greater value
   for other consumers. These new consumer co-production activities,
   collectively referred to as the sharing economy, require firms to
   rethink their role in the marketing value creation process. Firms need
   to define new marketing actions that create value for consumers who are
   also co-producers. To address this challenge, we propose a two-layered
   conceptual framework of consumer co-production networks and the
   individual consumer production journeys therein. These concepts expand
   the traditional production model and consumer journey, respectively,
   explicitly taking into account consumer co-production activities. Within
   the framework, we draw on household production theory combined with
   insights from institutional design theory and consumer behavior research
   to analyze how marketing can support consumers' co-production
   activities. We discuss the managerial and consumer welfare implications
   of our analysis and outline new opportunities for further research.

AB The experience of romantic love is closely interlocked with consumption
   journeys-yet how and why consumers engage in romantic consumption is not
   fully understood. This research emphasizes romantic consumption as a
   novel scholarly domain of theoretical and substantive richness due to
   its fundamental importance to nearly every consumer's life and its
   considerable economic relevance. Specifically, we investigate how
   attachment styles influence romantic consumption across various
   contexts, from movies, books, and greeting cards to romantic gaming and
   online dating. Across six studies, we show that consumers with an
   avoidant attachment style are less likely to engage in romantic
   consumption, whereas consumers with anxious and fearful attachment
   styles are more favorable toward it and emulate the romantic consumption
   of consumers with a secure attachment style. We propose that this
   pattern is driven by the interaction between attachment avoidance and
   anxiety such that the negative effect of attachment avoidance is
   attenuated when attachment anxiety is high. These attachment style
   differences are mediated by a motive for emotional intimacy, suggesting
   that personal romantic consumption (e.g., reading a book) can serve as a
   surrogate to fulfill unmet relational needs. Notably, positioning
   products via types of romantic love serves as an important moderator:
   products positioned via companionate love are more appealing to securely
   attached consumers, products positioned via passionate love are more
   appealing to avoidant consumers, and anxious and fearful consumers find
   both equally appealing. Consistent with the notion of consumer-based
   strategy, we discuss how managers can leverage these insights in their
   segmentation, targeting, and positioning.

AB Consumers' use of social media websites can serve fundamentally
   different motives, from merely sharing entertaining content, filling up
   spare time, to observing what friends are doing on social media. The
   current work examines the downstream consequences of such social media
   use on consumers' subsequent product choices. Specifically, this work
   explores how exposure to Facebook compared to other major social media
   websites such as Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn enhances consumers'
   focus on others and the consequences of such temporary shifts in focus
   on consumers' subsequent preference for specific options. A large-scale
   field study and a series of experiments provide evidence that exposure
   to Facebook prior to a product configuration task enhances consumers'
   tendency to upgrade conventional as opposed to unconventional options,
   and we show that this effect is driven by a greater focus on others
   followed by a fear of negative evaluation from their peers. We show that
   this effect can be reversed if consumers believe that only a minority
   prefers a conventional target option. These findings provide novel

AB Firms struggle to manage touchpoints in their customer journey that
   consumers perceive as dissatisfying. Based on attribution theory and
   associative learning we examine branded outsourcing as a strategic means
   to reduce such touchpoints' negative impact on brand evaluations. We
   find in the field and in a series of experimental studies that brands
   can reduce the detrimental impact of dissatisfying touchpoints. This
   effect is reversed for satisfying touchpoints. Importantly, we find that
   the explanation for the effect of branded outsourcing goes beyond
   consumers' responsibility attributions. Rather, we find evidence that
   branded outsourcing reduces the extent to which consumers mentally
   associate the focal brand with the outsourced touchpoint, which results
   in a shift in brand evaluations. In an additional study we show that a
   strong third-party brand is not always more beneficial than a weak
   third-party brand, which further enhances the managerial relevance of
   our findings.

AB Information about ethical strengths and weaknesses of individual
   products (e.g., cause-related marketing, corporate social responsibility
   records) is increasingly available in the marketplace. However, market
   shares of ethical brands are still low, even though prior research
   indicates that ethical attributes influence brand choice. This research
   broadens the perspective of prior research by investigating the role of
   ethical attributes during earlier stages of the decision funnel, namely,
   consideration set formation. Four empirical studies demonstrate that
   brands' ethical strengths exert less impact on the consideration than on
   the choice stage. Specifically, brands that are not otherwise part of
   consideration sets benefit less from ethical strengths in larger
   assortments where consideration set formation plays a more important
   role. By investigating the screening rules that consumers apply, this
   study determines that while ethical strengths are subordinate, ethical
   weaknesses evoke asymmetric effects, such that misconduct exerts a
   stronger effect during screening processes than benefits do. To increase
   effects of ethical strengths on screening, firms can enhance the
   emotional intensity of ethical attributes and make them more salient and
   subjectively important.

AB Generating and maintaining consumers' engagement in online brand
   communities is critical for marketing managers to enhance relationships
   and gain customer loyalty. In this research, we investigate how the type
   of signal used to indicate user reputation can enhance (or diminish)
   consumers' community engagement. Specifically, we explore differences in
   perceptions of points (i.e., point accrual systems), labels (i.e.,
   descriptive, hierarchical identification systems), and badges (i.e.,
   descriptive, horizontally-ordered identification systems). We argue that
   reputation signals vary in the degree to which they can provide role
   clarity-the presence of user roles that deliver information about
   expected behaviors within a group. Across several studies, including a
   natural experiment using panel data, a survey of community members, and
   two controlled experiments, we show that signals that evoke a positive
   social role have the ability to drive greater engagement (i.e., creating
   discussions, posting comments, and future engagement intentions) than
   signals that do not provide role clarity. The effect is moderated by
   user tenure, such that new consumers' engagement is particularly
   influenced by signal type. These findings have important implications
   for marketers as they use reputation signals as a strategic tool when
   managing online communities.

   propose a new conceptualization of the domain and sub-domains of
   marketing strategy and employ them as a framework to assess the current
   state of research in marketing strategy. Based on an analysis of
   articles addressing marketing strategy related issues published in six
   leading marketing journals during the period 1999 to 2016, they
   highlight challenges and opportunities for creating new marketing
   strategy knowledge grounded in scholarly research, and propose an agenda
   for future research in marketing strategy. This commentary focuses on
   some of the findings relating to the theoretical underpinnings of
   research in marketing strategy that Morgan et al. report and discuss.
   They include (1) the dearth of indigenous marketing theories and
   reliance on theories developed in other disciplines, (2) research
   grounded in single versus multiple theories, and (3) the shift away from
   theory-based research to data-driven research. The commentary concludes
   with a brief discussion on the merits of organizing the accumulated body
   of knowledge on strategic marketing by distinguishing between research
   focusing on substantive issues in the domains of market strategy and
   marketing strategy.

AB Retail atmospherics is becoming an increasingly important strategic tool
   for stores and restaurants. Ambient music and background noise are
   especially important atmospheric elements given their ubiquity in retail
   settings. However, there is high variation in the volume of ambient
   music and background noise, with some stores/restaurants having very
   loud ambience and others having very quiet ambience. Given the variation
   in loudness levels at stores/restaurants, and the managerial ease of
   adjusting volume level, we investigate the consequences of ambient music
   (and background noise) volume on food choices and sales. A pilot study,
   two field experiments, and five lab studies show that low (vs. high or
   no) volume music/noise leads to increased sales of healthy foods due to
   induced relaxation. In contrast, high volume music/noise tends to
   enhance excitement levels, which in turn leads to unhealthy food
   choices.

AB It has been a widely held notion that firms can benefit from using
   preferential treatment in their customer relationship management
   strategies. For example, many firms provide select customers (i.e.,
   recipients) with exclusive promotional offers that they purposefully do
   not extend to other customers (i.e., non-recipients). However, today's
   empowered consumers are more socially aware than ever of such divisive
   practices (via social media, deal websites, etc.), and firms must now
   better account for the negative backlash from non-recipients that may
   ensue. In this research, we conceptually define exclusive promotions and
   outline how they differ from other more heavily-studied customer
   prioritization tools. We then take a divergent approach from the
   majority of the extant literature by focusing primarily on how and why
   non-recipients (rather than recipients) respond to exclusive promotions.
   Study 1a findings reveal that non-recipients have negative attitudes
   toward exclusive promotions, as well as negative attitudes and lower
   patronage intentions toward the firm using them. Perceived social
   exclusion was shown to underlie these unfavorable responses. In Study
   1b, we rule out an alternative equity-based explanation of our findings
   by assessing loyalty to the firm as a potential moderator. We then
   extend our investigation to a field setting in Studies 2 and 3. There we
   replicate our Study 1a results, and assess consumers' actual purchasing
   behavior in response to a real exclusive offer for enhanced
   generalizability. Lastly, in Studies 4 and 5 we empirically test two
   strategies that firms can potentially use to mitigate the negative
   effects of exclusive promotions documented here.

AB Prior research on object valuation ignores the effect of non-ownership
   physical possession types such as renting and borrowing. Evidence from
   four experiments demonstrates that the valuation (i.e.,
   willingness-to-pay) for rented objects is greater than the valuation for
   non-possessed or borrowed objects. Borrowed objects are not valued any
   differently than non-possessed objects. Psychological ownership mediates
   the relationship between valuation and non-ownership physical
   possession. Additionally, psychological ownership varies for different
   possession types (ownership, renting, and borrowing) as its contributing
   routes (control, self-investment, and knowledge) operate differently for
   each possession type. As further evidence of the psychological ownership
   based theoretical account, the research shows that rented objects are
   not valued higher than non-possessed objects if the control or
   self-investment routes of psychological ownership are suppressed. The
   moderating influence of product hedonism-utilitarianism and consumers'
   tightwad-spendthrift tendency on the valuation of rented and borrowed
   objects is also examined.

AB The availability of information and variety of online purchase options
   are increasing for consumers shopping for complex products (e.g., cars,
   real estate). This situation, and consumers' resulting sense of
   informedness, has led many to suggest that the need for
   business-to-consumer (B2C) salespeople is diminishing. Yet, despite
   these claims, many purchasesespecially those associated with high prices
   and, therefore, high consumer involvementstill require consumers to
   interact with salespeople. This interaction, between consumers (at
   varying levels of informedness) and B2C salespeople, is the focus of the
   current study. Merging theories of consumer informedness and adaptive
   interpersonal influence, we suggest that the interaction between
   salesperson influence attempts and consumer informedness plays an
   important role in purchase decisions. To study this notion, Study 1
   matches automobile shoppers' survey responses with objective purchase
   data from 480 sales interactions. Study 2 is a scenario-based experiment
   that investigates informedness and influence in a financial services
   setting. The findings of both studies suggest that understanding a
   consumer's informedness, and adapting the proper influence approach to
   it, is critical if salespeople are to influence modern consumers'
   purchase decisions and, thus, avoid irrelevancy.

AB We develop a framework to facilitate customer engagement in service
   (CES) based on the service-dominant (S-D) logic. A novel feature of this
   framework is its applicability and relevance for firms operating both in
   developed and emerging markets. First, we conduct a qualitative study
   involving service managers from multinational companies (MNCs) across
   the developed and emerging markets to understand the practitioner
   viewpoints. By integrating the insights from the interviews and the
   relevant academic literature, this framework explores how interaction
   orientation and omnichannel model can be used to create positive service
   experience. We also identify the factors that moderate the service
   experience, and categorize them as follows: offering-related,
   value-related, enabler-related, and market-related. Further, we also
   propose that perceived variation in service experience moderates the
   influence of service experience on satisfaction and emotional
   attachment, which ultimately impacts customer engagement (CE). From
   these factors, we advance research propositions that discuss the
   creation of positive service experience. One of the study's key
   contributions is that MNCs can focus their attention on the moderators
   to ensure consistency in positive service experience, in an effort to
   enhance CE.

AB Research addressing the micro-foundational theoretical entity of
   customer engagement (CE) has proliferated in recent years. In parallel,
   the macro-foundational theory of service-dominant (S-D) logic is
   thriving. While the fit of CE/S-D logic has been recognized, insight
   into this theoretical interface remains tenuous, as explored in this
   paper. We develop an integrative, S-D logic-informed framework of CE
   comprising three CE foundational processes, which are required (for
   customer resource integration), or conducive (for customer knowledge
   sharing/learning) CE antecedents. While customer resource integration,
   in some form, extends to coincide with CE, customer knowledge
   sharing/learning can also do so. We also identify three CE benefits
   (customer individual/interpersonal operant resource development,
   cocreation) as CE consequences, which can also coincide with CE.
   Deploying the framework, we revise Brodie et al.'s (Journal of Service
   Research, 14(3), 252-271, 2011) fundamental propositions of CE and apply
   these to customer relationship management. We conclude with theoretical
   and managerial implications, followed by future research avenues.

AB Many studies use variables from the Compustat database to measure
   various marketing constructs, yet no clear guidelines detail which
   metrics correspond with which constructs. Justifications rest mainly on
   the ready availability of easy-to-use measures that seem related to a
   particular construct. As a result, various metrics have been utilized to
   capture the same construct, and the same metricsuch as selling, general,
   and administrative expenses (SGA)has been applied to capture vastly
   different constructs. But using SGA inappropriately can lead to biased
   estimates, questionable support for the hypotheses, and potentially
   misleading implications for research and practice. To test the validity
   of SGA for multiple relevant marketing and sales constructs, this study
   gathers data on benchmark variables from alternative data sources and
   applies a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) approach. Results show that, in
   general, SGA has been applied too liberally in marketing contexts; SGA
   is an appropriate operationalization only for some constructs. This
   article provides guidelines for the proper conceptualization and
   operationalization of marketing constructs.

AB The marketing channel literature has paid limited attention to
   institutional environments that constrain buyer-supplier exchanges,
   though such institutions are fundamental determinants of transaction
   costs, and thus of the occurrence of opportunism in the buyer-supplier
   dyads. Drawing on transaction cost economics and institutional theory,
   this study uncovers the critical influence of formal and informal
   institutions (i.e., legal effectiveness and networking expenditure) on
   the use of governance in deterring opportunism, as well as the
   moderating role of government support on the efficacy of governance
   mechanism. The findings from a buyer-supplier dyadic survey and
   2secondary datasets reveal that legal effectiveness mitigates
   opportunism through increased use of both contractual and relational
   governance; in contrast, networking expenditure reduces opportunism
   through relational governance, yet increases opportunism via lowering
   contractual governance. In addition, contractual governance is more
   efficient in constraining opportunism when government support is high,
   whereas relational governance deters opportunism more when government
   support is low. These findings offer important implications for academic
   research and managerial practice.

AB A growing reliance on customer reviews prompts firms to develop
   strategies to encourage customers to post online reviews of their
   products. However, little research investigates the behavioral
   consequences of writing a review. The act of sharing personal opinions
   through reviews is a rewarding experience and makes customers feel
   socially connected. With an application of reverse alliesthesia theory,
   the current study predicts that such rewarding experiences drive online
   reviewers to seek other rewards, such as impulsive buying. Three
   lab-based and two field studies demonstrate such an emotional
   review-reward effect: sharing emotional information in the public realm
   of customer reviews, rather than forming similar opinions privately,
   drives participants to make more impulsive buying decisions.

AB Do customers feel better or worse after enacting revenge? Using a
   multimethod approach, we show that customers' post-complaint desire for
   revenge depends on whether they initially use direct or indirect revenge
   behaviors (RBs). Specifically, the current research makes three
   contributions. First, we find that the more customers use direct RBs,
   the more pronounced is the decrease in their post desire for revenge
   over time, whereas a strong engagement in indirect RBs is associated
   with higher post desire for revenge over time. A series of experiments
   also indicate that direct RBs lead to less post desire for revenge and
   more positive affect, compared to the indirect RBs condition. Second, we
   document the process underlying each effect. The beneficial effect of
   direct RBs is explained by justice restoration, while the deleterious
   effect of indirect RBs is mainly explained by public exposure. Third, on
   the basis of our findings, we test different managerial tactics to
   reduce avengers' post desire for revenge. For direct avengers,
   recoveries with full or overcompensation substantially reduce their
   negative responses because these customers are primarily driven by
   justice restoration. For indirect avengers, our prescription involves
   taking initiatives to change their focus from public exposure to justice
   restoration by using proactive social media tools. This switch makes
   these latter customers more amenable to most recoveries, even poor ones.

AB This article proposes two new donation strategies that focus on either
   the amount or the frequency of corporate donations, and verifies that
   consumers have very different perceptions of and behavioral responses to
   firms that adopt these different donation strategies. Through three lab
   experiments and two field studies with adult consumers, the authors show
   that an amount-focused donation strategy leads consumers to generate
   more resource- and capability-related associations about the firm's
   endeavor in helping charities, whereas a frequency-focused donation
   strategy leads consumers to generate more commitment- and
   persistence-related associations about a firm's endeavor in helping
   charities. Furthermore, consumers tend to perceive a donation as more
   instrumental in helping charities and are more likely to purchase from
   the donor firm, pay a higher price for the donor firm's products, and
   make referrals when the firm adopts a frequency-focused (vs.
   amount-focused) donation strategy to support an approach-oriented (vs.
   avoidance-oriented) charitable goal. The findings hold important
   implications for corporate donation strategies regarding how firms
   should allocate their philanthropic budgets and strategically
   communicate their donation efforts.

AB In many retail contexts, social interaction plays an important role in
   the shopping process. We propose a three-stage dynamic linear model that
   captures the influence of group discussion on shopper behavior within a
   hierarchical Bayes framework. The model is tested using a video tracking
   and transaction dataset from a specialty apparel store. The research
   reveals that group conversations have a significant impact on the
   shopper's department or zone choice, purchase likelihood, and spending
   over time. This group influence is magnified by the size of the group
   (particularly for zone penetration and purchase conversion), and is also
   moderated by group composition and cohesiveness. The conversations of
   mixed-age groups and groups who stay together while shopping have a
   significant influence on shopper behavior across all three stages, while
   discussions by adult groups exhibit a marginal carryover effect for
   purchase conversion. When shoppers have repeated discussions in a
   specific department, they are more likely to return to and buy from this
   department, while the cumulative number of discussions in the store
   drives higher spending levels. We also observe that group shoppers visit
   more departments than their solo counterparts; and mixed-age groups and
   solo shoppers are more likely to buy than adults-only or teen groups.
   This study has important implications for how retailers manage shopper
   engagement and group interaction in their stores.

AB Firms can substantially profit from customer referrals, but they must
   understand the different stages of the referral process to determine
   what drives the number of referrals (first stage), conversion (second
   stage), and average contribution margin per referral (third stage).
   Applying a framework that integrates perceptual and behavioral drivers,
   this study uses a financial services company's customer survey and
   transaction data to investigate how the effect of contribution margins
   of referring customers at all three stages depends on their perceived
   extraversion and opinion leadership. Extreme extraversion and opinion
   leadership diminish the positive effect of the contribution margins of
   referring customers on the number of referrals; their effect on the
   number of successful referrals is insignificant. In terms of the
   contribution margin of successful referrals, extraversion has a negative
   and opinion leadership a positive moderating effect.

AB In many industries, it is common practice to extend sales promotions ex
   post. That is, firms belatedly extend the initial deadline of a
   promotion shortly before or directly after the previously announced
   deadline, with the expectation of increased sales. Four experimental
   studies indicate both positive and negative effects of these ex post
   extensions. First, customers perceive an ex post extended promotional
   offer as less attractive, such that their repurchase intentions
   diminish. This negative effect arises consistently across different
   boundary conditions, such as different customer and product types.
   Second, the positive effect of ex post extensions stems from the
   possibility that the consumer can still use the promotional offer, so it
   emerges only for potential customers and existing customers of
   frequently bought products. Companies can mitigate the dark side of ex
   post extensions proactively, by designing the extensions to last for
   only a short time or offering an explanation for the extension that
   highlights the popularity of the initial promotion.

AB Researchers often struggle when applying golden rules of thumb' to
   evaluate structural equation models. This paper questions the notion of
   universal thresholds and calls for adjusted orientation points that
   account for sample size, factor loadings, the number of latent variables
   and indicators, as well as data (non-)normality. This research explores
   the need for flexible cutoffs and their accuracy in single- and
   two-index strategies. Study 1 reveals that many indices are biased;
   thus, rigid cutoffs can become imprecise. Flexible cutoff values are
   shown to compensate for the unique distorting patterns and prove to be
   particularly beneficial for moderate misspecification. Study 2 sheds
   further light on this gray' area of misspecification and disentangles
   the different sources of misspecification. Study 3 finally investigates
   the performance of flexible cutoffs for non-normal data. Having
   substantiated higher performance for flexible reference values, this
   paper provides to managers an easy-to-use tool that facilitates the
   determination of adequate cutoffs.

   decisions: brand identity change and brand strategy change. More

   brand identity change and brand strategy change have either strong or
   weak (even negative) influences on firm value. Specifically, the results
   from analyzing 215 rebranding announcements suggest that (1) rebranding
   decisions, on average, are associated with positive abnormal stock
   returns in the (-5, +5) event window, and (2) investors use cues, like
   the fit among rebranding dimensions, firm competitive position, and
   industry competitive intensity, to make informed evaluations of firm
   future cash flows.

AB Using a novel approach with video-recordings of sales interactions, this
   study focuses on a dynamic analysis of salesperson effectiveness in
   handling customer queries. We conceptualize salesperson behaviors,
   namely, resolving, relating, and emoting, as separate elements of
   customer query handling and empirically identify the distinct verbal and
   nonverbal cues that salespeople use to display these behaviors during
   sales interactions. We draw from compensation effects in social
   cognition theory to propose that customers' perceptions of a
   salesperson's effectiveness are prone to trade-offs between competence
   (resolving behaviors) and warmth (relating and emoting behaviors).
   Results, robust to endogeneity corrections, support the proposed
   tradeoffs such that the effectiveness of salesperson's resolving
   behavior is significantly curtailed, even neutralized, by the
   salesperson's relating and emoting behaviors. We situate these
   counterintuitive results within the extant theory and research on sales
   interactions, and outline implications for practice.

AB Salesforce compensation theory assumes that given proper design of the

   maximize returns to their firm and themselves. However, faced with large

   commit resources to opportunities with little or no chance of being won,
   to the exclusion of viable leads. This article theoretically explores
   and empirically tests this over-investment effect under four potentially
   moderating conditions using a large multinational corporation's
   industrial salesforce. The findings from this field study indicate that
   escalation of commitment is more likely to occur in non-strategic
   accounts and accounts not involving channel partners. In addition,
   salespeople with lower ability demonstrate greater escalation of
   commitment. The study indicates that without targeted managerial

   in-groups have a higher impact on niche music listening. Music listeners
   can cross in-group lines to listen to music, although the effect on

AB It is well established that consumer acceptance of a brand extension
   depends on how strongly it fits with its parental origins. Less
   appreciated is how this acceptance also depends on the mental
   association created in consumers' minds between the extension and its
   parent brand. Our investigation considers the gateway role played by
   this association's mental accessibility in allowing extensions to fully
   benefit from their parental heritage. Six studies examine the effect of
   reinstating an extension's association with its parent brand on
   extension evaluations. When reinstatement enhances the parental
   association's accessibility, it strengthens the parent brand's
   influence, leading to more or less favorable extension evaluations
   contingent upon the extension's fit with its parental origins. These
   reinstatement effects carry important implications for brand-extension
   managers and researchers.

AB Coupons research has typically focused on single-coupon redemption, with
   scant attention devoted to multiple, competing coupons. To bridge this
   gap, we observe supermarket shoppers who used their smartphones to scan
   products in-store, receiving both coupons for the scanned product and
   several others as a result. We model the determinants of redemption in
   this context, particularly net price range (NPR), coupon value, brand
   loyalty, and number of coupons. Latent class analysis uncovers two
   consumer segments: brand-focused shoppers (79.9%), who use internal
   reference prices, and deal-prone shoppers (20.1%), who use
   stimulus-based reference prices. Targeting by means of segment
   membership, NPR, and loyalty is indispensable: the same $0.50 coupon can
   have a redemption probability as low as 30% and as large as 80%,
   depending on these characteristics. Overall, the study sheds light on
   drivers of redemption under competition and provides managers with a
   blueprint to improve redemption rates by targeting shoppers with
   customized coupons.

AB Recent evidence about the central role played by perceptual constructs
   in driving performance outcomes has produced a renewed interest in
   studying customer mindset metrics (CMMs; e.g., satisfaction, service
   quality, and loyalty intentions). However, we still lack a proper
   understanding of how (i.e., process) and to what extent (i.e.,
   magnitude) these CMMs ultimately translate into profitability at the
   customer level. In this study, we integrate CMMs into an
   individual-level framework of customer behavior and profitability and
   provide a conceptual understanding of the process through which these
   metrics influence customer profitability. Specifically, we propose three
   mechanisms through which CMMs affect customer behavior and
   profitability: behavioral effect, marketing effectiveness effect, and
   marketing efficiency effect. We empirically test this framework across
   two distinct contexts, a B2B high-tech firm and a B2C telecommunications
   firm. The results demonstrate that these unobservable CMMs have a
   significant and multi-dimensional impact on customer behavior and
   customer profitability. Furthermore, we compute the increases in
   customer behavior and customer profitability that each firm can expect

AB A new product's success in the marketplace largely depends on salesforce
   actions. Many B2B salespeople display conservatism when confronted with
   new products in their portfolio, such that they maximize their efforts
   to sell existing products before engaging in efforts to sell the new
   product. So far, it is unclear whether this conservative selling
   behavior (CSB) is harmful to new product selling performance, and how
   this behavior can be managed. Building on perceived risk processing
   theory, and employing multi-level structural equation modeling on a
   multi-source dataset, the authors empirically substantiate that
   salespeople's CSB makes their effort to sell new products more
   effective. Remarkably, such effort is then valued less by sales
   managers. The authors also find that CSB is a result of a risk
   assessment and evaluation process, in which internal marketing efforts
   (i.e., providing salespeople with information on the new product)
   determine the weight of perceived performance risk (i.e., new product
   radicalness), social risk (i.e., managerial new product orientation),
   and financial risk (i.e., long-term rewards). Managers looking to
   control the levels of CSB in their salesforce should carefully align
   their information support activities with the perceived risk dimensions
   of the new product selling situation.

   proposed in this study addresses the nature of UD and pursues
   theoretical richness and computational advancements by integrating
   insights from other disciplines. This article makes three main
   contributions to the literature by (1) offering a unifying definition
   and conceptualization of UD in marketing; (2) bridging disjoint
   literature with an organizing framework that synthesizes various subsets
   of UD relevant for marketing management through an integrative review;
   and (3) identifying substantive, computational, and theoretical gaps in
   extant literature and ways to leverage interdisciplinary knowledge to
   advance marketing research by applying UD analyses to underdeveloped

AB Although professional sports are a major interest for consumers and a
   soaring contributor to economic growth, very little is known about how
   sports brands are built over time and what makes some sports clubs'
   market performance so much stronger than others. Based on a unique
   dataset of 40 German professional soccer brands tracked from 1963
   through 2014, this research studies how the value drivers recruitment,
   winning, and publicity feed sales-based brand equity (SBBE) and
   attendance. One of the novel findings is that not only do strong brands
   benefit from higher levels of SBBE, but they are also able to leverage
   SBBE more effectively the longer they are on the market, which widens
   the gap between strong and weak brands across time. We also find that
   the effect of the value drivers on attendance evolves from direct to
   indirect via SBBE. Overall, the increasing brand leverage effect yields
   important implications for marketing theory and for sports brand
   management.

AB Many new marketing strategies falter in the execution phase where
   managers fail to make frontline employees fully committed to
   implementing the new initiatives. While formal managers can apply
   transformational and transactional leadership behaviors to increase
   salespeople's strategy commitment, peers can also exert a great deal of
   informal influence on salespeople. Building on recent social network
   perspectives of leadership, this paper investigates the interplay
   between the sales manager's leadership styles and peer effects during
   the implementation of a new strategy in a large sales organization. The
   authors find that salespeople with high network centrality but low
   strategy commitment not only lower their peers' commitment but also hurt
   the effectiveness of a transformational manager. Specially, the
   influence of a central salesperson becomes stronger when the sales group
   has lower external connectivity. However, sales managers' transactional
   leadership can decrease the non-committed central salesperson's
   influence over peers.

   a firm's decision to have a CMO on its TMT is driven not only by
   contingency-reated considerations but also by social ones, as the
   decision is significantly influenced by industry peers. Empirical
   findings based on 505 large US firms from 2000 to 2012 indicate that
   firms' imitative behavior is a significant driver of CMO presence,
   especially when firm uncertainty is strong and inference uncertainty is
   low. Post hoc analyses indicate that this imitation behavior tends to be
   performance neutral at best.

AB Firms increasingly use games to interact with their customers. Yet,
   surprisingly little is known about whether, when, and how such
   "gamified" interactions engage consumers with a firm's brand, thereby
   facilitating self-brand connections. Building on flow theory, we show
   that gamified interactions that are highly interactive and optimally
   challenging facilitate self-brand connections, because such games lead
   to emotional and cognitive brand engagement. A field study and three
   experiments across various product domains and game designs support our
   theory. We also identify conditions under which consumers do not become
   engaged with a brand, namely when firms restrict their decisional
   control either to voluntarily participate in the game (i.e., compulsory
   play) or to spend as much time as desired playing the game (i.e., time
   pressure). Our findings advance existing knowledge about the use of
   games in marketing and provide important implications for how marketers
   can harness their potential to build self-brand connections.

AB Influence strategies (ISs) are a dominant topic in channel research.
   However, the literature lacks a consensus on when noncoercive and
   coercive strategies are more valuable or damaging to partnership
   quality, and their judicious applications remain unclear. Mainly based
   on social exchange perspectives, we review and conceptualize several
   contingency factors in the IS-partnership quality relationships in this
   metaanalysis. The moderating results generally suggest that the stronger
   positive impacts of noncoercive ISs result from a higher appreciation
   for supportive attempts, whereas the higher negative sensitivity to
   coercive ISs can be attributed to the low acceptability of forceful
   influences. We determine degrees of appreciation and acceptability by
   the perceived significance of benefits/damages, expectations, and
   tolerance levels for both strategies. Also, we synthesize and
   meta-analyze the key outcomes and antecedents of both strategies in an
   integrated framework. The direct-effect results indicate that the choice
   of effectively applying both strategies necessitates a tradeoff between
   goals and priorities.

AB Salespeople assume a key role in defending firms' price levels in price
   negotiations with customers. The degree to which salespeople defend
   prices should critically depend upon their leaders' influence. However,
   the influence of leadership on salespeople's price defense behavior is
   barely understood, conceptually or empirically. Therefore, building on
   social learning theory, the authors propose that salespeople might adopt
   their leaders' price defense behavior given a transformational
   leadership style. Furthermore, drawing on the contingency leadership
   perspective, the authors argue that this adoption fundamentally depends
   on three variables deduced from the motivation-ability-opportunity (MAO)
   framework, that is, salespeople's learning motivation, negotiation
   efficacy, and perceived customer lenience. Results of a multi-level
   model using data from 92 salespeople and 264 salesperson-customer
   interactions confirm these predictions. The first to explore
   contingencies of salespeople's adoption of their transformational
   leaders' price negotiation behaviors, this study extends marketing
   theory and provides actionable guidance to practitioners.

AB Four experiments investigate consumers' moral judgments of a firm's
   brand reputation when given information about an employee's
   non-workplace transgression. To the extent that the employee is
   perceived to have power in the firm (i.e., control over resources and
   decisions), the employee's offensive action damages the firm's
   reputation and decreases consumers' purchase intentions. These effects
   occur even though the action occurs in the employee's private life and
   is unrelated to product quality. The results replicate for three types
   of products and three types of offenses. The employee's perceived power
   in the firm provides the most consistent explanation of customers'
   negative responses and is a better predictor than the alternative
   explanations tested (e.g., perceived status). Results also show that
   after an offense comes to light, firm reactions that decrease or
   eliminate the employee's power in the organization-such as reducing
   decision-making responsibilities or firing the employee-can help restore
   the firm's reputation.

   metrics over two time periods, from a sample of 190 firms. While the
   effect of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) on innovation is enhanced by
   architectural marketing capabilities, the effect of innovation outcomes
   on profits is enhanced by specialized marketing capabilities.
   Ultimately, the pathway from EO to performance, mediated by innovation,
   is positively significant at higher levels of both marketing
   capabilities. The results uncovered using Bayesian conditional process
   modeling, are robust to alternate model specifications, endogeneity
   tests, and provide insights into the capabilities-based understanding of

AB Businesses often seek to leverage customers' social networks to acquire
   new customers and stimulate word-of-mouth recommendations. While
   customers make brand recommendations for various reasons (e.g.,
   incentives, reputation enhancement), they are also motivated by a desire
   for social empowerment-to feel an impact on others. In several
   multi-method studies, we show that facilitating sharing of social
   coupons (i.e., coupon sets that include one for self-use and one to be
   shared) is a unique marketing strategy that facilitates social
   empowerment. Firms benefit from social coupons because customers who
   share spend more and report greater purchase intentions than those who
   do not. Furthermore, we demonstrate that social coupons are most
   effective when the sharer's brand relationship is new versus
   established. For customers with an established relationship, sharing
   with a receiver who also has an established relationship maximizes
   potential impact. Together, these studies connect social empowerment to
   relationship marketing and provide guidance to managers targeting social
   coupons.

   a communication theory framework, we develop hypotheses concerning
   multiple interaction effects between culture and marketing strategies on

   consumer reviews of 260 movies in 25 country markets. In support of our
   hypotheses, we find that the cultural congruence between the product and
   the market improves consumer reviews, and that the effect is stronger in
   cultures characterized by collectivism, femininity, and uncertainty
   avoidance, as well as for products more heavily loaded with cultural
   content. In addition, we find that the negative effect of delay in
   product launch timing weakens for cultures characterized by long-term
   orientation, and that the positive effect of advertising spending on
   consumer evaluations is stronger in cultures characterized by high power
   distance belief. These results provide practical insights into how

   increases online brand search, while both attentional content elements
   decrease this effect. We find no support for the effect of emotional

AB Despite the clearly visible effects of analysts' pressures on C-level
   executives in the popular press, there is limited evidence on their
   effects on marketing spending decisions. This study asks two questions.
   First, how do analysts' pressures affect firms' short-term marketing
   spending decisions? Based on a sample of 2706 firms during 1987-2009
   compiled from Institutional Brokers Earning System, COMPUSTAT, and CRSP
   databases we find that firms cut marketing spending. Second, more
   importantly, we ask if firms which remained more committed in the past
   to marketing spending under analysts' pressures have higher longer-term
   stock market performance. We find that the stock market performance of
   firms more committed to marketing spending under past periods of
   analysts' pressures is higher. The findings are replicated for R&D
   spending and are robust across measures, controls, and methodologies.
   Consideration of two industry-based moderators, R&D spending and revenue
   growth, and one firm-based moderator, whether the firm is among the
   industry's top four market share or other lower share firms, reveals
   that the findings are stronger for high R&D and growth industries and
   lower market share firms. One key implication is that top executives
   respond to analysts' pressures by cutting marketing spending in the
   short term; however, if they can resist these pressures, longer-term
   stock market performance is higher.

   effects of a broad set of FOP icons on nutrition evaluations linked to
   health, accuracy of evaluations, and purchase intentions for a single
   product. Based on these findings, Studies 2 and 3 test the effects of
   two conceptually-different FOP icon systems in a retail laboratory in
   which consumers make comparative evaluations of multiple products at the
   retail shelf. While there are favorable effects of each system beyond
   control conditions with no FOP icons, results show that icons with an
   evaluative component that aid consumers' interpretations generally
   provide greater benefits (particularly in product comparison contexts).
   We offer implications for consumer packaged goods marketers, retailers,
   and the public policy and consumer health communities.

AB This research fills a gap in the retailing literature regarding physical
   proximity while shopping. Most research in this area examines perceived
   crowding or social presence and largely ignores issues of distance.
   Using four studies we explore the impact of the physical proximity of an
   employee to a shopper. Contrary to common belief, we show that such
   encroachments can increase consumers' acceptance feelings and their
   purchase intentions. We illustrate how these results are consistent with
   social identity theory. The results show a shopper can have higher
   purchase intentions the closer an employee physically gets to them due
   to an increase in feelings of acceptance. This result is strengthened
   when being included to an in-group is important to the shopper. The
   negative effects of feeling anxious in a purchase situation can also be
   buffered the closer an employee gets. Finally, the positive relationship
   of felt acceptance to purchase intentions is most critical when the
   product being purchased is perceived as less expressive. These results
   have important implications to our understanding of shopper behavior and
   reactions to physical proximity.

AB Many companies are increasingly selling hybrid bundles, which comprise
   one or more goods and one or more services. Hybrid bundle pricing
   depends on understanding consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for the
   bundle, which rests on trade-offs among the benefits from four key
   drivers: service autonomy, complementarity, service quality variability,
   and overall bundle quality (basic vs. premium). The effects of these
   drivers and their interactions on the WTP of hybrid bundles are unknown.
   The authors develop hypotheses and test them rigorously using
   incentive-aligned choice-based conjoint and hierarchical Bayesian
   analysis. The results offer important guidelines for developing
   appropriate hybrid bundles. If a typical firm under budget constraint
   has to offer either of two hybrid bundles, one with high complementarity
   or one with service autonomy, the results suggest that it should offer
   the bundle with high complementarity. Furthermore, contrary to the
   conventional wisdom of minimizing service quality variability for
   premium quality bundles relative to basic quality bundles, the results
   recommend lowering service quality variability for basic quality bundles
   but maintaining it for premium bundles.

AB Consumers can experience major life events (e.g., the birth of a child
   or retirement) that have key strategic managerial implications for firms
   in terms of creating new market segments as well as preventing defection
   from existing brands. Therefore, in the context of a consumer-based
   strategy, this study investigates whether life events change actual
   purchase behavior as well as how three important and managerially
   actionable consumer difference variables (consumer innovativeness, the
   variety seeking tendency, and price consciousness) mediate this link.
   Purchase records of an individual-level consumer panel, combined with
   demographic and survey data over a three-year period, indicate that
   there is a direct link between life events and changes in share of
   wallet (SOW) and share of units (SOU) for the preferred brand in a
   product category. Further, experiencing a life event leads to an
   increase in consumer innovativeness that, in turn, decreases SOW/SOU for
   the preferred brand for some purchases, while at the same time leading
   to a decrease in consumers' variety seeking tendency and price
   consciousness for others that, in turn, lead to an increase in SOW/SOU.
   These findings suggest a paradox of change that can both enhance and
   inhibit purchasing new brands. Finally, the effects of first-time life
   events (i.e., significant markers in the course of life that occur for
   the first time) are stronger than the effects of repeated life events,
   and life events with a positive economic impact have a strong negative
   effect on change in price consciousness.

AB A firm's strategic emphasis on value creation versus appropriation,
   which is typically reflected in its resource allocation between R&D and
   advertising, is a central corporate decision that significantly
   influences financial performance. However, the drivers of such decisions
   remain underexplored. This study identifies a significant predictor of
   strategic emphasis, namely, corporate managerial hubris, and reveals
   some of its boundary conditions. Leveraging a unique dataset based on
   text mining of press releases issued by over 400 firms across 13 years,
   the authors demonstrate that high corporate managerial hubris predicts
   low strategic emphasis on advertising relative to R&D. However, this
   effect is mitigated significantly by firm maturity, corporate
   governance, and industry-level strategic emphasis. The results provide
   novel insights into the effects of hubris on firm spending, the
   situations wherein marketing decisions tend to be subject to managers'
   psychological bias, the means of preventing over- or under-investment in
   marketing strategy, and the recruitment and training of managers.

AB In today's connected world, customer engagement behaviors are very
   important. Many companies launch initiatives to stimulate customer
   engagement. However, despite evidence that customer engagement behavior
   also matters to shareholders, academic research on the firm value
   consequences of customer engagement campaigns is limited. This study is
   the first to investigate the value-related consequences of
   firm-initiated customer engagement behaviors, using shareholder
   evaluations of the public announcements of such initiatives. We find
   that companies' customer engagement initiatives, on average, decrease
   market value, which is likely because the shareholders are sensitive to
   the risk of these initiatives backfiring. Nevertheless, initiatives that
   stimulate word-of-mouth are viewed less negatively than initiatives that
   solicit customer feedback, as are initiatives that are supported by
   social media. Companies that operate in a competitive environment or do
   not advertise much can create value by stimulating customer engagement,
   while companies with a strong corporate reputation are likely to not
   benefit from it.

AB This research examines the increasing use of online customer reviews in

   research on B2B decision making, we study a unique aspect wherein buyers
   draw on two sources: external reviews posted on online professional
   communities and internal reviews in the format of vendor scorecards.
   This method creates a conundrum: What happens when a buyer is confronted
   with conflicting reviews from two different sources? To shed light on
   this problem, we (1) interviewed 48 B2B buyers, (2) conducted a field
   experiment with 293 B2B buyers to examine the effect of review source,
   (3) conducted a second field experiment with 587 B2B buyers to examine
   the effect of conflicting reviews, and (4) solicited insights from 82
   B2B buyers regarding the findings. The results indicate that B2B buyers
   are driven to resolve differences in reviews rather than to dismiss
   negative reviews. In addition, even positive internal reviews prompt
   exploration to confirm that relational bias is not present.

AB This research investigates the impact of a sales team's entitativity-the
   extent to which a group of individuals is perceived as a unified single
   entity-on customer satisfaction. Four studies demonstrate that a sales
   team entitativity cue, either based on appearance (e.g., wearing the
   same outfit) or based on behavior (e.g., explicit coordination in
   service), leads to heightened perceptions of service quality, which
   subsequently enhances customer satisfaction. Further, these two
   entitativity cues are shown to have interactive effects. Specifically,
   when both cues indicate high entitativity, customer satisfaction with
   the sales team exceeds the average evaluation of individual team
   members. However, if at least one cue suggests low entitativity (e.g.,
   different outfits or no explicit coordination), the positive influence
   of the entitativity cue is undermined and customer satisfaction with the
   team's service is mitigated. Product category is identified as an
   important moderator of the main effect.

AB Although theoretical work has shown that end-of-season payment
   contracts, which allow suppliers and retailers to share the cost of
   unsold inventory, increase total profit, most suppliers and retailers
   today still use simple wholesale price contracts. In a series of
   experimental studies, we show that supplier preferences for wholesale
   price contracts can be explained by their concern that end-of-season
   payments contracts will disincentivize retailer marketing effort.
   Moreover, suppliers' pessimistic predictions regarding reduced retailer
   effort are confirmed by retailers' reduced investment in marketing
   effort in our experiments. Our results suggest that for suppliers and
   retailers to benefit from end-of-season payments contracts, retailers
   should publicize their demand-enhancing marketing practices.

AB Across the many studies of motion picture box office success, unresolved
   debates and untested assumptions about the contributing factors persist.
   Using an accessibility-diagnosticity framework and a meta-analysis of
   634 effect sizes from 150 studies, the current article seeks to clarify
   the relationships of star brand equity and product reviews (from
   consumers and critics) with box office success. The popularity of stars
   (market and media appeals) exerts a stronger impact on box office
   success than their artistic recognition (as per award nominations and
   wins) at the moment of a movie's release but not over its extended
   theatrical run. Whereas the impact of popular stars on box office
   success decreases over time, the influence of artistically recognized
   stars remains steady. The findings also identify a dual role for
   critics, who influence consumers' movie choice and predict box office
   performance by merely reflecting moviegoers' tastes. Finally, this study
   refutes the assumption that the impact of users' reviews strengthens
   over time, relative to critics' reviews.

AB When companies plan to build multi-category brands by adding new
   products to their product lines, two questions loom large: (1) whether
   and (2) when brand extensions perceived as distant (comparatively
   dissimilar) from the company's existing core line of products should be
   introduced. Since many real-world firms have introduced distant brand
   extensions, this paper focuses on the second question: when the company
   should introduce a distant extension within a series of other closer
   extensions-a decision for which there is little research-based guidance
   for managers. Building on theories of mental categorization, the authors
   argue that early (vs. late) introductions of distant brand extensions
   can be more beneficial for the brand. Three studies support this
   conclusion, demonstrating that early (vs. late) introductions of distant
   extensions can result in more positive final brand attitudes; that is,
   attitudes held after all the extensions have been introduced. This
   effect is driven by how easily the distant extension is integrated into
   consumers' brand concepts and is moderated by overall brand positioning.
   Importantly, this effect on final brand attitudes is shown to influence
   behavioral measures of product preference and brand engagement.

   influence customer tipping behavior at restaurants. A series of five
   studies shows that the color gold (as opposed to other colors) in a
   service atmosphere positively influences consumer tipping. First, a
   field experiment (Study 1) demonstrates that customers presented with a
   gold-colored (vs. black-colored) service prop (i.e., bill folder) leave
   larger tips. Study 2 further confirms this effect of the color gold by
   validating the findings of Study 1 with a different service prop (i.e.,
   tablecloth). Process evidence demonstrates the underlying mechanism of
   this effect, whereby a gold-colored service prop increases tipping by
   influencing status perceptions about the restaurant and the self (Study
   3). Additional studies further confirm this by ruling out novelty of the
   color in this mechanism (Study 4) and by highlighting the effect of
   status on tipping through status priming (Study 5). The findings of this
   research have implications for strategic use of color in servicescape

AB "Buzz" during the period leading up to commercial release is commonly
   cited as a critical success factor for new products. But what exactly is
   buzz? Based on an extensive literature review and findings from a
   theories-in-use study (consumer depth interviews and focus groups), the
   authors argue that pre-release consumer buzz (PRCB) is not just a
   catchword or a synonym for "word of mouth" but is a distinct construct
   for which a precise, shared conceptual understanding is notably absent.
   The authors define PRCB as the aggregation of observable expressions of
   anticipation by consumers for a forthcoming new product; they
   conceptualize the construct as being manifested in three distinct types
   of behaviors (communication, search, and participation in experiential
   activities) along two dimensions (amount and pervasiveness). PRCB is
   unique because prior to, versus after, a product's release, (1)
   differing information is available, (2) differing mental processes
   occur, and (3) consumers' behaviors have differing effects on other
   consumers, affecting diffusion differently. A quantitative study using
   secondary data for 254 new products illustrates the performance of the
   theory-based conceptualization.

AB Business cycles (BCs) may affect entire markets, and significantly alter
   many firms' marketing activities and performance. Even though managers
   cannot prevent BCs from occurring, marketing research over the last 15
   years has provided growing evidence that their impact on consumers, and
   hence on firm and brand performance, depends to a large extent on how
   firms adjust their marketing mix in response to these macro-economic
   swings. In this study, we review the growing marketing literature on how
   to attenuate or amplify the impact of BC fluctuations. Our discussion
   focuses on three key aspects: (1) the scope of, and insights from,
   existing BC research in marketing, (2) advancements in the methods to
   study various BC phenomena in marketing, and (3) some emerging trends
   that offer new challenges and opportunities for future BC research in
   marketing.

AB Experimentation is the sine qua non of consumer behavior research, and
   much of what is thought to be known about the behavior of consumers is
   based on findings from experiments. However, many articles that report
   consumer behavior experiments contain one or more results that are
   significantly insignificant. That is, one or more experimental results
   are so unusually weak or minuscule that they are unlikely to have come
   about by chance. As such, significantly insignificant results can be due
   to the "failure" of the theory underlying an experiment and/or the
   flawed design or implementation of an experiment. Consequently,
   significantly insignificant results have implications for the theories
   and methodologies employed in consumer behavior experiments, the quality
   of conclusions drawn from the experiments, and the credibility of the
   consumer behavior research discipline as a whole.

   Marketing Research (JMR)-and then conduct an in-depth analysis of 202
   survey-based studies published in JAMS. We focus on key issues in two
   broad areas of survey research (issues related to the choice of the
   object of measurement and selection of raters, and issues related to the
   measurement of the constructs of interest), and we describe conceptual
   considerations related to each specific issue, review how marketing
   researchers have attended to these issues in their published work, and

AB The management literature suggests that setting strategic goals
   facilitates the identification of appropriate business strategies and
   focuses management attention and available resources on their
   accomplishment, enabling subsequent goal realization. Yet the literature
   also indicates that firms often find it difficult to realize their
   strategic goals and may find it even more challenging to do so when
   operating in foreign markets. However, little is known empirically about
   the extent to which strategic goals enable desired strategic positions
   to be achieved and factors that may affect this relationship. We examine
   this important issue using primary data from a sample of exporting
   manufacturers. Results support the existence of previously theorized
   strategic goal-realized strategic position gaps and show that these
   negatively impact performance. Thus, simply setting strategic goals does
   not necessarily aid in accomplishing the desired outcomes, and any
   failure to do so is costly. Drawing on organization theory, we find that
   internal capabilities and knowledge, and external market factors play
   important roles in minimizing such strategic goal-realized strategic
   position gaps. Specifically, we show that businesses with stronger
   architectural capabilities, those with higher levels of
   internationalization, and those operating in less dynamic market
   environments are better able to realize their intended strategic
   objectives and thereby enjoy superior performance.

AB Many brands build market share by acting as a substitute when
   competitive brands become undesirable or difficult to obtain. Notably,
   prior research offers competing strategic recommendations for marketers
   hoping to encourage consumers to engage in substitution. Past research
   examining substitute selection-measuring consumers' beliefs about how
   well one product will substitute for another-suggests that marketers
   should offer replacements that are similar to the initially preferred
   product. In contrast, research examining substitute effectiveness-the
   consequences of substitution-suggests that differentiated brands will
   enjoy more long-term success. We integrate these two streams of
   research, explaining why there is a mismatch between substitute
   selection and substitute effectiveness, replicating and showing boundary
   conditions for the effects, and testing a managerial intervention that
   encourages consumers to choose more dissimilar (and more effective)
   substitutes.

   diversification and retailer performance in a global setting, where
   retailers as part of their geographic expansion process often employ
   format diversification. The dual strategies of geographic
   diversification and format diversification substantially complicate the
   diversification-performance relationship. Using a six year panel data
   set for leading global retailers, we find a positive impact for
   geographic diversification, a negative impact for format diversification
   and a negative interaction for the dual strategies, supporting a single

AB This article integrates relevant literature to develop a conceptual
   model on the potential avenues to achieve service excellence at low unit
   costs, which we term cost-effective service excellence (CESE). To gain a
   deeper understanding of these strategies, their applicability and
   interrelatedness, we analyze how 10 organizations have achieved CESE.
   Our findings show that CESE can be achieved through three core
   strategies. First, a dual culture strategy provides a comprehensive set
   of high-quality services at low cost, largely driven by leadership
   ambidexterity and contextual ambidexterity. Second, an operations
   management approach reduces process variability and thereby allows the
   increased use of systems and technology to achieve CESE. Third, a
   focused service factory strategy can enable CESE through a highly
   specialized operation, typically delivering a single type of service to
   a highly focused customer segment. The use of the three approaches
   ranges from "pure" (e.g., mostly pursuing a dual culture strategy) to
   combinations of the latter two approaches with the dual culture strategy
   (e.g., a focused service factory strategy combined with dual culture).
   Our conceptual model provides an integrated view of the strategic
   options available to organizations that aim to pursue a strategy of
   CESE.

AB The extant literature has studied the effects of a firm's service
   recovery efforts on the reactions of customers and employees following
   an individual service failure. However, the impact of recovery efforts
   on a firm's performance after a public and large service failure-such as
   a large-scale information breach-has received scant attention. To
   address this gap, this current research develops a framework and finds
   support for the impact of service crisis recoveries on a firm's
   performance, as measured by firm-idiosyncratic risk. Using a unique
   dataset of service crisis recoveries, the authors find that firms
   offering compensation (i.e., tangible redresses) or process improvement
   (i.e., improvements in organizational processes) show more stable
   performance (less idiosyncratic risk), from two quarters to two calendar
   years after the announcement of their recovery plan. In line with the
   documented dual effect of apologies, firms that offer apology-based
   recoveries display more volatile performance (higher idiosyncratic
   risk). Of note, this volatility increases with the number of affected
   individuals, and it remains unaffected even when the apology is
   expressed with high intensity.

AB Service firms are encouraged by historic evidence that loyal customers
   are less price sensitive. Yet, some research has challenged the
   assertion while others have demonstrated considerable heterogeneity
   within loyal segments. Aiming to reconcile this debate, we investigate
   the relationship between customers' behavioral loyalty and the
   importance they place on price relative to two managerially relevant
   service attributes: rewards and convenience. We also assess the
   moderating role of attitudinal loyalty resulting from superior service
   experience. Results from a longitudinal survey and transaction data from
   an airline carrier show that as customers' behavioral loyalty increases,
   they place more importance on price and less importance on rewards and
   convenience, revealing that behavioral loyalty causes a shift in
   emphasis toward price. As a result, behaviorally loyal customers spend
   less and revenue decreases. However, by improving attitudinal loyalty,
   firms achieve the desired outcome of reducing price sensitivity and
   increasing revenue. Specifically, after experiencing better service,
   behaviorally loyal customers focus less on price and instead shift their
   focus toward rewards and convenience, and this results in revenue gains
   for the firm. Overall, attitudinal loyalty from better service
   experience acts as a key mitigator of the positive link between
   behavioral loyalty and price sensitivity.

AB This research investigates the influence that social sources in the
   service environment exert on customer unfriendliness. Drawing on social
   norms theory, the authors demonstrate that descriptive norms (i.e., what
   most people are perceived to be doing in a certain situation), in the
   form of unfriendliness by service employees and fellow customers,
   predicts customers' unfriendliness toward employees. Injunctive norms
   (i.e., beliefs about which behaviors are approved by important others)
   and identification with fellow customers exert moderating effects.
   Specifically, strong injunctive norms can buffer the effect of
   descriptive norms. Furthermore, fellow customers influence a customer's
   unfriendliness only if he or she identifies either very strongly or very
   weakly with them. By clarifying the role of norms in service encounters,
   this study provides insights on when unfriendly customer behavior is
   likely to occur. Managerial implications for companies who want to
   diminish customer unfriendliness are discussed.

AB The services marketing literature has traditionally characterized
   intangibility as the most critical distinction between services and
   goods, but in practice service production and consumption often involve
   both intangible and tangible elements. While prior research has examined
   and debated service intangibility from the firm's perspective, what is
   missing is an understanding of how consumers weigh the relative
   importance of intangible versus tangible attributes in their service
   evaluation. Drawing on construal level theory, the authors propose that
   consumers with a high (vs. low) construal level rely more on intangible
   (vs. tangible) attributes in service evaluation. Furthermore, the effect
   of construal level on service evaluation is mediated by imagery
   vividness, with service type (e.g., experience vs. credence services)
   serving as a boundary condition. The authors conduct two field studies
   and two lab experiments and find that under a high construal level,
   consumers rely more on intangible attributes in their service evaluation
   and choice formation; under a low construal level, consumers rely more
   on tangible attributes in their service evaluation and choice. The
   findings not only offer new insights to help reconcile the disparate
   perspectives on service intangibility in the literature but also have
   practical implications on service firms' positioning strategies that
   vary across time (e.g., advance selling vs. on-site selling) and space
   (e.g., near vs. distant outlet), as well as which attributes to
   emphasize in their marketing communications.

AB This article examines the link between recovery time and customer
   compensation expectations for service failures that cannot be
   immediately redressed. First, we show that the relationship between
   recovery time and compensation expectations is nonlinear. Initially, in
   a recovery time zone of tolerance, compensation expectations do not
   increase. Beyond this zone, the relationship follows an inverted
   U-shape, such that compensation expectations first increase but decrease
   in the long run. Second, our results show that long recovery times are
   accompanied by additional negative effects, including lower satisfaction
   with the recovery and negative word of mouth, so postponing service
   recovery represents a poor option. Third, relationship strength
   functions as a moderator. First-time customers expect higher
   compensation earlier; relational customers display a recovery time zone
   of tolerance but claim considerably higher compensations afterwards.
   Fourth, communication initiatives like the separate provision of status
   updates or an explanation may limit increases in compensation
   expectations over time. Still, their joint usage creates a
   "too-much-of-a-good-thing" effect, suggesting that if the usage of
   communication initiatives is taken too far it may lead to negative
   outcomes such as increasing compensation expectations.

   functions as a mediator and also predicts customer decision comfort.
   Furthermore, the effect of spatial presence on utilitarian value

AB Advancements in technology are radically transforming service, and
   increasingly providing the underlying basis for service strategy. In
   this paper, we develop a typology and positioning map for service
   strategy, in the context of rapid technological change, and outline the
   process for firms to position or reposition their service strategies.
   Which strategy to choose is based on the degree to which customer demand
   is heterogeneous, and the degree to which potential customer lifetime
   value varies across customers. This results in four strategies: the
   McService strategy that is standardized and transactional, the
   Relational Service strategy that is standardized and relational, the
   Customized Transaction strategy that is personalized and transactional,
   and the Adaptive Personalization strategy that is personalized and
   relational. We provide firms a roadmap for identifying a "sweet spot"
   strategy in relation to a segment's realized or potential customer
   lifetime value, combined with the firm's technological capabilities.
   Because technological capabilities inevitably advance, firms will tend
   to move from standardized to personalized and from transactional to
   relational over time, implying that firms should be alert to
   technological opportunities to personalize their relationships with
   customers. Our strategic framework also produces a useful bridge from
   marketing practice to the conceptual evolution of the service
   literature, showing how the historical trends toward continuing customer
   relationships and co-productive personalization should drive strategic
   thinking in service.

AB It is widely recognized that business models can serve as important
   strategic tools in innovation and market formation processes.
   Consequently, business models should have a prominent position in the
   marketing literature. However, marketing scholars have, so far, paid
   little attention to the business model concept, perhaps because it lacks
   an established definition and clear theoretical foundation. This article
   offers a definition for the business model concept that, using a fractal
   approach, connects business models to technological and market
   innovation. Furthermore, the article questions several cornerstone
   strategic concepts by reconceptualizing business model development from
   a firm-centric activity that promotes owning key resources and altering
   sets of decision variables to one that highlights the facilitation of
   broad institutional change processes. As such, it takes the potentially
   controversial position of advocating a service-strategy-based
   understanding of business models for all of marketing strategy.

AB Extant service research considers several aspects of customer
   participation (CP) but lacks a clear and inclusive typology that
   delineates CP's domain, scope, or boundaries. To address this gap, the
   authors build on a review of extant literature and propose a typology to
   classify CP into three categories-mandatory, replaceable, and voluntary.
   They demonstrate how this proposed typology improves the conceptual and
   empirical clarity of CP research. More specifically, the authors (1)
   suggest using "customer participation" to replace other terminologies
   such as coproduction and cocreation to reduce confusion; (2)
   conceptualize CP, customer engagement, and customer innovation as
   related but distinct concepts; (3) use the proposed typology to extend
   existing conceptualizations, integrate prior empirical research, and
   reconcile conflicting findings. Building on the enhanced conceptual
   clarity, managerial implications and future research directions are
   discussed.

AB A product-harm crisis is a discrete event in which products are found to
   be defective and therefore dangerous to at least part of the product's
   customer base. Product-harm crises are not only dangerous for consumers;
   they also represent a major threat to the reputation and equity of
   brands or companies, which often struggle with how to best respond. The
   marketing literature has witnessed a surge in interest on the
   consequences of product-harm crises for a variety of stakeholders,
   including consumers, the brand or company itself, its investors, as well
   as competitors. This article offers a systematic review of research on
   product-harm crises in the marketing literature. We discuss the
   antecedents and consequences of product-harm crises, their moderators
   and mediators, and the theories and methodologies used. We identify
   commonalities and differences between the studies, as well as gaps in
   the literature and avenues for future research. Finally, we synthesize
   the managerial implications across studies.

AB Composite-based structural equation modeling (SEM), and especially
   partial least squares path modeling (PLS), has gained increasing
   dissemination in marketing. To fully exploit the potential of these
   methods, researchers must know about their relative performance and the
   settings that favor each method's use. While numerous simulation studies
   have aimed to evaluate the performance of composite-based SEM methods,
   practically all of them defined populations using common factor models,
   thereby assessing the methods on erroneous grounds. This study is the
   first to offer a comprehensive assessment of composite-based SEM
   techniques on the basis of composite model data, considering a broad
   range of model constellations. Results of a large-scale simulation study
   substantiate that PLS and generalized structured component analysis are
   consistent estimators when the underlying population is composite
   model-based. While both methods outperform sum scores regression in
   terms of parameter recovery, PLS achieves slightly greater statistical
   power.

AB This research examines the relationship between narcissistic personality
   characteristics in Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and firms' innovation
   outcomes. The authors argue that firms led by narcissistic CEOs are
   likely to exhibit a higher rate of new product introductions and a
   greater proportion of radical innovations in their new product
   portfolios, but they are also more likely to encounter product-harm
   crises. The impact of CEO narcissism on these innovation outcomes is
   partially mediated by firms' higher competitive aggressiveness. High
   power of the marketing department in the top management team, however,
   increases firms' customer orientation, which in turn weakens the
   relationship between CEO narcissism and product-harm crises. A
   longitudinal analysis of a sample of 395 publicly listed U.S. firms in
   the period 2006-2010 provides considerable support for the authors'
   hypotheses. This research underscores the importance of studying CEOs'
   personality traits as antecedents of firms' innovation outcomes,
   highlights the positive and negative impact of CEO narcissism on firms'
   innovation-related behavior, and delineates the process through which
   this impact takes place.

AB In this research, we look at the similarity between frontline service
   employees' nonverbal or expressive behavior and customers' receptivity
   of nonverbally expressed emotions (i.e., expressive similarity).
   Supported by evidence from four studies, we demonstrate that expressive
   similarity between customers and frontline service employees yields
   positive outcomes for both the employee and the organization under
   successful service delivery, but it can paradoxically backfire on the
   organization in service failures. In successful service encounters,
   higher expressive similarity between customers and employees enhances
   consumer satisfaction and promotes more direct compliments and positive
   word of mouth. In contrast, higher expressive similarity increases
   customer dissatisfaction and intent to engage in negative word of mouth,
   but it reduces customers' inclination to lodge direct complaints
   following a service failure (Study 1). Studies 2 and 3, both field
   experiments, provide external validation of the key findings on customer
   satisfaction and voice intentions (Study 2) as well as actual voice
   behavior (Study 3). Building on these findings, Study 4 reveals that
   while customer-perceived rapport and trait impressions of the service
   employee mediate the observed effects of expressive similarity on
   satisfaction, only rapport significantly explains the effects of
   expressive similarity on voice intentions. Theoretical and managerial
   implications, along with suggestions for future research, conclude the
   paper.

AB Corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities enhance firm value via
   strengthened stakeholder relationships. However, many firms are also
   involved in corporate social irresponsibility (CSI), which could lead
   stakeholders to judge CSR actions as insincere, subsequently damaging
   firm value. This study examines the pivotal role of CSI for CSR's firm
   value effects. As an initial finding, the results indicate that CSR's
   positive firm value effect is significantly attenuated by the presence
   of CSI. Offering a more fine-grained analysis, the authors elaborate on
   the effectiveness of CSR that relates to the same (SD-CSR) or other
   domains (OD-CSR) as CSI. All else equal, the results indicate that only
   OD-CSR enhances firm value. Depending upon the CSI context, however,
   SD-CSR destroys or benefits firm value and OD-CSR is more or less
   beneficial. By adding new aspects to the discussion about how to align
   doing good with doing well, the results speak to both theorists and
   practitioners.

AB Foods positioned as natural, all-natural, and 100% natural can be found
   across a wide variety of product categories. However, the FDA has not
   provided a formal definition of the term "natural," and this has
   resulted in a surge in class action lawsuits filed against manufacturers
   due to the potentially misleading use of natural claims. Activation
   theory and the inferential processing literature serve as the conceptual
   foundation for three studies that examine the effects of natural claims
   on consumers' attribute inferences and product evaluations. Results
   suggest that natural claims affect consumers' attribute inferences,
   which in turn influence product evaluations. Furthermore, findings show
   that the provision of objective information regarding the ambiguity of
   natural claims moderates the effects of these claims on consumers'
   attribute inferences and product evaluations. The implications for
   marketing management, those involved in litigation driven by potentially
   deceptive natural claims, and the policy community are discussed.

AB Shopping is sometimes a source of stress, leading to avoidance coping
   behavior by consumers. Prior research suggests that store-induced stress
   makes shopping an adverse experience and thus negatively affects
   consumers' purchase likelihood. We propose that consumers' response to
   shopping stress depends on their motivational orientation. The greater
   the in-store stress, the more likely task-oriented consumers are to
   abandon the trip without making purchases. However, recreation-oriented
   consumers will be, up to a point, less likely to end the trip. The
   results of four studies show that the functional relationship between
   shopping stress and purchase abandonment changes from monotonic and
   positive for task-oriented consumers to an inverted U-shape for
   recreation-oriented consumers. Evidence of goal changes provides a
   process explanation for the differing functional relationships. The
   results offer an alternative explanation for why people buy or not and
   suggest approaches to structuring the shopping environment to appeal to
   both types of consumers.

AB Marketing actions must create value for two key stakeholders: customers
   and investors. Nevertheless, these two stakeholders differ in their
   evaluations of firm actions in critical ways. As a result, most managers
   believe that there is a critical trade-off between serving customers and
   shareholders. Drawing upon the marketing-finance interface, the authors
   investigate how this trade-off unfolds to impact customer satisfaction
   and firm value in the context of innovation. Specifically, the present
   study demonstrates that creating value for customers and shareholders
   are not two completely distinct goals, as the business press and
   managers fear; innovation can create value for shareholders by
   satisfying customers. However, results also indicate that a crucial
   trade-off between satisfying consumers and creating value for investors
   is indeed present, as those same factors (i.e., firm's branding strategy
   and level of market dominance, industry-level competitive intensity)
   that enhance the effects of innovation on customer satisfaction depress
   the effects of innovation on firm value, and vice versa. The authors
   discuss the implications of these important findings for research and
   practice.

AB Work-family interface conflicts have typically been cast in a negative
   light due to their detrimental consequences. This study offers new
   insights by uncovering conditions under which such conflicts may produce
   both positive and negative effects on salesperson job-related behaviors
   in the context of B2B sales. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory as an
   overarching theoretical framework, the authors suggest that informal
   controls (i.e., professional control and self-control) have differential
   moderating effects in salespeople's primary and secondary appraisal
   processes when faced with work-family conflict and family-work conflict.
   Dyadic data from a matched salesperson-customer sample reveals that
   professional control amplifies, whereas self-control mitigates, the
   positive effect of work-family conflict on perceived stress.
   Professional control amplifies the positive effect of stress on in-role
   behavior, and self-control strengthens positive effects of stress on
   in-role behavior and customer-directed extra-role behavior while
   suppressing unethical behavior under high stress. Moreover, the two
   types of informal controls moderate the direct effects of family-work
   conflict on salesperson behaviors in an opposite fashion, such that
   under a strong professional control, family-work conflict reduces
   in-role and extra-role behaviors and induces unethical behavior, whereas
   a strong self-control alleviates such detrimental effects. These
   findings suggest that work-family interface conflicts should be viewed
   as a double-edged sword capable of producing both positive and negative
   consequences under certain conditions, offering new theoretical insights
   and important managerial implications for this prevalent phenomenon in
   sales management.

AB Manufacturers invest in customer solutions to differentiate their

   sales. Notwithstanding strong managerial and academic interest, an
   examination of whether and explanations for when and why solutions
   translate into superior performance are lacking. We test hypotheses
   developed from the resource-based theory and transaction cost economics,
   supplemented with in-depth theory-in-use interviews, on primary and
   secondary data collected from 175 manufacturers. From a model that
   corrects for endogeneity, the findings suggest that, compared with other
   service offerings, solutions are associated with increased return on
   sales. This positive profitability effect is enhanced in firms with
   greater sales capabilities; it is stronger in industries with greater
   buyer power but weaker in technology-intensive industries. These results
   caution against the simplistic view of solutions as a universal route to
   gaining competitive advantage and aid in better identifying the role of
   solutions in a manufacturer's offering portfolio.

   market returns to an NPPA and the post-launch new product performance
   under various industry and firm conditions. Findings based on a dynamic
   panel data analysis of 208 NPPAs in the U.S. automotive industry between
   2001 and 2014 reveal that stock returns associated with an NPPA are not
   an appropriate forward-looking measure of future product performance.
   However, under specific conditions (i.e., when the preannouncement is
   specific, the preannounced new product has low innovativeness, the
   preannouncing firm has a high reputation and invests heavily in
   advertising, and the preannouncement environment is less competitive),
   abnormal stock returns to NPPAs actually predict the future performance
   of new products. Thus, this study extends the marketing-finance and
   innovation literature with its focus on the conditions that affect the
   predictive power of immediate stock returns for the future performance
   of new products.

AB It is widely accepted, and demonstrated in the marketing literature,
   that negative online word of mouth (NOWOM) has a negative impact on
   brands. The present research, however, finds the opposite effect among
   individuals who feel a close personal connection to the brand-a group
   that often contains the brand's best customers. A series of three
   studies show that, when self-brand connection (SBC) is high, consumers
   process NOWOM defensively-a process that actually increases their
   behavioral intentions toward the brand. Study 1 demonstrates this effect
   using an experimental manipulation of SBC related to clothing brands,
   and provides process evidence by analyzing coded thought listings. Study
   2 provides convergent evidence by measuring SBC associated with
   smartphones, and followup analyses show that as SBC increases, the
   otherwise negative effect of NOWOM steadily transforms to become
   significantly positive. Study 3 replicates these results using a
   combination of a national survey conducted by J.D. Power investigating
   hotel stays and data drawn from TripAdvisor. Results of all three
   studies, set in product categories with varying levels of identity
   relevance, support the positive effects of NOWOM for high-SBC customers
   and have implications for both managers and researchers.

AB For suppliers to secure a positive return on their investment in the
   creation of component innovations, they must ensure that original
   equipment manufacturers (OEMs) implement these component innovations.
   The objectives of this study are to (1) identify the activities that
   suppliers undertake to foster innovation implementation, (2) articulate
   the theoretical mechanisms that mediate the impact of these activities
   on innovation implementation, and (3) establish the inter-related
   effects of these mediating theoretical mechanisms on innovation
   implementation. The results from a survey of 173 supplier-OEM dyads
   reveal that functional advantage is the theoretical mechanism that
   mediates the impact of two supplier actions-knowledge acquisition and
   installation support-on innovation implementation. The results also show
   that reputational advantage mediates the effect of innovative OEM
   endorsement and that relational advantage mediates the effects of
   supplier asset specificity and supplier innovativeness on innovation
   implementation. In terms of the inter-related effects of the mediating
   mechanisms on innovation implementation, the results indicate that
   relational advantage complements the positive impact of functional
   advantage on innovation implementation. In addition, the results reveal
   that innovation implementation has a positive impact on the financial
   performance of component innovations.

AB A top priority among retailers is enhancing the consumer's shopping
   experience. With the number of private label products increasing at the
   same time retailers are shedding slower moving products, understanding
   how private labels impact the consumer's experience at the retail shelf
   becomes critical. While one might think that private labels, in
   particular those that look similar to their national brand counterparts
   (i.e., copycat private labels), may hinder the shopping experience by
   making it more difficult for consumers to choose a product, we find the
   exact opposite. Adopting a fluency perspective, we show that when
   copycat private labels are included in a shelf set, consumers with high
   knowledge of the category experience greater choice ease, and as a
   result they subsequently evaluate their chosen product more favorably.
   Importantly, the choice ease and evaluations of novice consumers are
   found to be unaffected. Consequently, this research provides insights
   for retailers and manufacturers on how and why copycat private labels
   positively impact an important aspect of the consumer's shopping
   experience (i.e., choice ease).

AB Customer equity drivers (CEDs)-value equity, brand equity, and

   effect varies across industries and firms. We empirically examine
   potential industry and firm characteristics that explain why the
   CEDs-loyalty link varies across services industries and firms in the
   Netherlands. The results show that (1) some previously assumed industry
   and firm characteristics have moderating effects while others do not and
   (2) firm-level advertising expenditures constitute the most crucial
   moderator because they influence all three loyalty strategies
   (significant for value equity and brand equity; marginally significant
   for relationship equity), while three industry contexts (i.e.,
   innovative markets, visibility to others, and complexity of purchase
   decisions) each influence two of the three loyalty strategies. Our
   results clearly show that specific industry and firm characteristics
   affect the effectiveness of specific loyalty strategies.

AB This research attempts to challenge the resource-engagement and
   engagement-performance linkage of the job demands-resources model by
   testing these links under the moderating role of two climates:
   performance-focused and service failure recovery. Two studies test a
   model on the boundary conditions of the linkages across four service
   industries. The results suggest that whether a resource (i.e.,
   self-efficacy and job autonomy) positively or negatively affects
   engagement depends on whether (1) a climate is appraised as a challenge
   or hindrance demand and (2) a climate is deemed a complementary or
   compensatory resource. Using multi-respondent data from customer service
   employees and their supervisors in the health care industry, Study 1
   conceptualizes climate as organizational climate and finds that
   performance-focused climate strengthens (weakens) the positive effect of
   self-efficacy (job autonomy) on engagement while service failure
   recovery climate weakens the positive impact of self-efficacy on
   engagement. Study 2 generalizes the findings from Study 1 and provides
   broad support by testing the model using psychological climate in the
   financial services, tourism and hospitality, and retailing industries.
   This study closes with a configuration approach to climate research by
   discussing when multiple climates can co-exist under different types of
   resources.

AB In this study, we highlight the need and develop a framework for
   customer engagement (CE) by reviewing the marketing literature and
   analyzing popular press articles. By understanding the evolution of
   customer management, we develop the theory of engagement, arguing that
   when a relationship is satisfying and has emotional connectedness, the
   partners become engaged in their concern for each other. As a result,
   the components of customer engagement include both the direct and the
   indirect contributions of CE. Based on the theoretical support, our
   proposed framework elaborates on the components of CE as well as the
   antecedents (satisfaction and emotion) and consequences (tangible and
   intangible outcomes) of CE. We also discuss how convenience, nature of
   the firm (B2B vs. B2C), type of industry (service vs. product), value of
   the brand (high vs. low), and level of involvement (high vs. low)
   moderate the link between satisfaction and direct contribution, and
   between emotions and indirect contribution of CE, respectively. Further,
   we show how customer engagement can be gained and how firm performance
   can be maximized by discussing relevant strategies.

AB Serving as mental models, psychological contracts guide consumers'
   service interactions with their service providers. This study
   incorporates a psychological contract perspective into the relationship
   marketing literature, exploring service customers' beliefs about the
   terms and conditions of the resource exchange process and the types of
   relationships they form with service providers. It provides new insights
   that explain why and how some customers respond favorably to a company's
   relationship overtures and investments while others do not. A latent
   class analysis on a sample of 700 consumers across three different
   service industries reveals that consumers form four distinct types of
   psychological contracts: relational, standard, transitional, and
   captive. To further validate the differences between the contract types,
   open-ended responses from the respondents were sorted by each class. The
   distinctive themes that emerged provide a richer understanding of the
   characteristics of each class beyond those inferred from the
   quantitative results. Each contract type is also profiled against its
   underlying level of trust, satisfaction, and commitment to understand
   the relationship between the contract types and these traditional
   relationship marketing variables. Marketers can differentiate their
   relationship marketing strategies and allocate their resource
   investments more effectively by segmenting consumers according to their
   psychological contract type.

AB Although research continues to debate the future of the marketing
   concept, practitioners have taken the lead, appraising customer
   experience management (CEM) as one of the most promising marketing
   approaches in consumer industries. In research, however, the notion of
   CEM is not well understood, is fragmented across a variety of contexts,
   and is insufficiently demarcated from other marketing management
   concepts. By integrating field-based insights of 52 managers engaging in
   CEM with supplementary literature, this study provides an empirically
   and theoretically solid conceptualization. Specifically, it introduces
   CEM as a higher-order resource of cultural mindsets toward customer
   experiences (CEs), strategic directions for designing CEs, and firm
   capabilities for continually renewing CEs, with the goals of achieving
   and sustaining long-term customer loyalty. We disclose a typology of
   four distinct CEM patterns, with firm size and exchange continuity
   delineating the pertinent contingency factors of this generalized
   understanding. Finally, we discuss the findings in relation to recent
   theoretical research, proposing that CEM can comprehensively systemize
   and serve the implementation of an evolving marketing concept.

AB Increasingly, knowledgeable business-to-business (B2B) customers and
   evolving customer needs are leading to seismic shifts in vendor-client
   interactions. Across industries, sellers are changing their business
   models from a simple goods orientation to a hybrid goods-services model,
   placing greater emphasis on delivering complete customer solutions. In
   such an environment, companies must find ways to prioritize investments
   in resource development. The service-dominant (S-D) logic framework
   offers significant insights into this challenge; however, these effects
   have not been tested quantitatively. This study addresses that gap,
   examining the influence of various seller resources on buyer
   satisfaction. An empirical analysis of buying organizations that
   purchased and implemented business intelligence systems finds that
   "augmented" operant resources that the buyers ascribe to the software's
   sellers-resources that go above and beyond expectations-are the most
   significant predictors of both successful technology assimilation and
   overall customer relationship quality. In particular, an augmented
   operant resource reflecting a seller's ability to see value creation
   opportunities from the buyer's perspective (value mindset) has up to
   three times the effect on relationship satisfaction as "core" operant
   resources such as product-specific expertise or basic interpersonal
   service skills. These results can help sellers prioritize resource
   investments.

AB Although the literature debates the sophistication and contributions of
   statistical/econometric models to strategic findings, there is a lack of
   understanding of how different model types contribute to the impact of
   strategic marketing research. We collected data from 485 studies
   published in top-tier marketing journals over the last 50 years to
   assess the influence of core strategy areas, and the moderating roles of
   models, journals, and estimation approaches on the impact of strategic
   marketing research, measured in terms of citations of the articles.
   Using descriptive and regression analyses, we find that strategy
   research focusing on the "customer" and "other areas" had a relatively
   greater impact, whereas "sales" had a relatively lesser impact on
   citations than the "4Ps strategy area." Linear regression, multivariate
   analysis, and structural equation models had a significantly higher
   impact on citations than other models. We also find that linear models
   and SEM positively and analytical models negatively moderate the
   relationship between strategy research focusing on "customer" and
   citations. Further, linear, analytical models and multivariate analyses
   negatively moderate the relationship between "sales" and citations.
   While strategy-focused journals positively moderate the relationship
   between strategic research focusing on "other area" and citations, it
   has a negative impact on the relationship between strategic research
   focusing on "sales" and citations. Relationship between strategy
   research focusing on "customer" and "other areas" and citations
   respectively is positively moderated by the estimation approach. Our
   study provides a perspective to the "rigor vs. relevance" debate in

   news of a major customer data breach at a U.S. retail firm is likely to
   decrease other U.S. retailers' shareholder value. Using the massive data
   breach at Target Corporation as their empirical context, and an event
   study of 168 publicly listed U.S. retailers as their methodology, the
   authors find considerable support for their framework. Results indicate
   that the Target data breach resulted in negative abnormal returns for
   other U.S. retailers, and that the strength of this contagion effect was
   moderated by factors related to retailers' (a) size and product market
   similarity with Target, (b) governance-related tie-strength with Target,
   (c) information technology-related ability to prevent a similar breach,
   (d) marketing ability to respond effectively in the aftermath of a
   similar breach, and (e) corporate social responsibility. The authors
   show that although a major retail data breach may result in an
   intra-industry spillover, managers can use factors related to

AB The classic model of loyalty proposed by Dick and Basu (1994) assumes
   that customers can be naturally classified in four loyalty conditions.
   This model has been tested with cross-sectional data and measures of
   recalled or retrospective consumer loyalty. Therefore, these studies
   could not examine whether and why customers move across different
   loyalty conditions over time, and offer guidance to managers on how to
   shift customers to the more desirable loyalty conditions. In this paper,
   we conduct an empirical test of this model and examine the key drivers
   of shifts in consumers' loyalty conditions over six annual time periods.
   Based on data from 6,109 households and 23 stores, we find customers can
   be classified in three loyalty conditions only: (1) the no loyalty, (2)
   the latent loyalty, and (3) the true loyalty conditions. The spurious
   loyalty condition is not supported, probably because switching costs are
   negligible in the grocery retailing industry. However, we find that
   marketing actions, i.e., private label policy, feature advertising,
   end-of-aisle product display, and store pricing policy, influence
   customer transition across loyalty conditions.

AB Many businesses increasingly use strategic partnerships to manage
   corporate environmental agendas. However, how value is created in green
   partnerships remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, the
   authors examine the effects of announcements of green partnerships
   (marketing versus technology) on shareholder value. It is argued that in
   green partnerships firms leverage marketing and technology-related
   capabilities for value-enhancing purposes. The results show that
   announcements of green marketing partnerships have an immediate positive
   and significant effect on shareholder value, whereas announcements of
   green technology partnerships produce an immediate negative and
   significant effect. Nevertheless, green technology partnerships can
   accrue positive returns, but over a longer-term (1 year) period. In
   "dirtier" industries, it is more difficult to generate positive returns
   to green partnerships. Counterintuitively, though, in high-polluting
   industries, firms having a history of positive environmental performance
   experience lower financial gains from announcements of green
   partnerships than firms that were less environmentally responsible in
   the past.

   and empirical findings about data and information privacy grouped
   according to privacy's role in society, the psychology of privacy, and
   the economics of privacy. Although a coherent subset of research themes
   provide deep understanding, theoretical and empirical findings show this
   narrow focus also has constrained our view of privacy to consumer,
   organizational, ethical, or legal silos. In response, we take a
   necessary step toward expanding the privacy domain across these borders,
   emphasizing the compelling synergies that span multiple interests. We
   conclude by highlighting future research themes that embody a
   multidimensional approach, which blends the many interconnected concerns
   that feature in contemporary privacy questions in marketing. Since
   internal and external stakeholders are affected in multiple and
   potentially unforeseen ways by data privacy issues, additional work in
   this space remains critical and needed.

AB As social media gains more importance, managers are challenged to
   quantify its return on sales. The academic understanding in the
   effectiveness of social media is limited, and in fact the synergistic
   effects between social media and traditional marketing efforts have
   rarely been investigated. Despite the dynamics in marketing
   effectiveness on sales, the time-varying effectiveness of social media
   has never been studied either. In this study, we capture the
   time-varying effects of social media and the time-varying synergistic
   effects of social media and traditional marketing with a time-varying
   effect model (TVEM) approach. The empirical analyses of a large U.S.
   ice-cream brand sales reveal that a) the effectiveness of social media
   and traditional marketing vary over time, b) the synergistic effects
   vary over time for social media with product sampling and with in-store
   promotions, c) the proposed TVEM approach has a higher predictive
   accuracy than the benchmark models, and d) the proposed TVEM approach
   saves marketing costs by $0.4 million per year, compared to the
   time-invariant benchmark model. Overall, this study enables managers to
   not only better understand the synergistic effects of social media
   marketing and traditional marketing, but also the time-varying
   effectiveness of their marketing efforts with TVEM approach for better
   resource allocation.

AB The ability of a firm's managers to understand how its customers view
   the firm's offerings and the drivers of those customer perceptions is
   fundamental in determining the success of marketing efforts. We
   investigate the extent to which managers' perceptions of the levels and
   drivers of their customers' satisfaction and loyalty align with that of
   their actual customers (along with customers' expectations, quality,
   value, and complaints). From 70,000 American Customer Satisfaction Index
   (ACSI) customer surveys and 1068 firm (manager) responses from the
   ACSI-measured companies, our analyses suggest that managers generally
   fail to understand their firms' customers in two important ways. First,
   managers systematically overestimate the levels of customer satisfaction
   and attitudinal loyalty, as well as the levels of key antecedent
   constructs such as expectations and perceived value. Second, managers'
   understanding of the drivers of their customers' satisfaction and
   loyalty are disconnected from those of their actual customers. Among the
   most significant "disconnects," managers underestimate the importance of
   customer perceptions of quality in driving their satisfaction and of
   satisfaction in driving customers' loyalty and complaint behavior. Our
   results indicate that firms must do more to ensure that managers
   understand how their customers perceive the firm's products and services
   and why.

   effects when theoretically relevant moderators were included in the
   analysis. The most positive attitudinal effect appeared for male actors
   who match well with an implicitly endorsed object (d = .90). The most
   negative effect was found for female models not matching well with an
   explicitly endorsed object (d = -.96). Furthermore, celebrity
   endorsements performed worse compared to endorsements of quality seals,
   awards, or endorser brands. No publication bias was detected. The study
   has theoretical and practical implications, and provides an agenda for

AB Investigating Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) tenure through a
   longitudinal study of the antecedents of CMO turnover, the authors find
   that CMO turnover increases if firms' sales growth is poor, while
   profitability has a similar though smaller effect when a new CEO is
   appointed, highlighting marketing's contextual role vis-A -vis
   performance metrics. Coupled with other results related to industry
   sales growth and stability that make CMO turnover less likely, these
   findings underscore marketing's demand- or customer-facing role in the
   firm. The authors also show that some of these results are distinct to
   turnover among CMOs compared to other top management team (TMT)
   executives. While this research does show support for extant theory, its
   focus on the CMO within the TMT results in important contributions to
   the turnover literature. These include the inverted-U effect of TMT
   marketing experience on CMO turnover and the nuanced attenuation by CMO
   insider-ness of a similar relationship between CMO tenure and turnover.
   Overall, the results lead to important practical implications for
   managing CMO turnover.

AB Consumers' existing habits are a key driver of resistance to new product
   use. In an initial survey to identify this role of habit, consumers
   reported on products that they had purchased intending to use. They also
   reported whether or not they actually used them. For one-quarter of the
   products they failed to use, consumers slipped back into old habits
   despite their favorable intentions. However, consumers effectively used
   new products when integrating them into existing habits. A four-week
   experiment with a new fabric refresher confirmed that habit slips
   impeded product use, especially when participants thought minimally
   about their laundry and thus were vulnerable to habit cues. However,
   slips were minimized when the new product was integrated into existing
   laundry habits. Thus, in launching new products, managers will want to
   consider consumer habits that conflict with product use as well as ways
   to embed products into existing habits.

AB Extant research confirms the importance of cocreating value with
   customers in service marketing, yet little is known about the impact of
   service agents' work experiences on customers' service perceptions. This
   research examines how service agents' workplace ostracism from different
   sources (supervisors versus coworkers) influences customers' perceived
   coproduction value, perceived service performance, and actual purchases.
   Three laboratory experiments and one survey reveal a double-edged sword
   effect of workplace ostracism and its contingency such that (1)
   supervisor ostracism reduces customers' perceived control value in
   customer-agent coproduction through threatening service agents' efficacy
   needs when the agents experience low servicing empowerment; (2) coworker
   ostracism enhances customers' perceived relational value in coproduction
   through threatening service agents' relational needs when they expect a
   long-term relationship with customers; and (3) customers' perceived
   control and relational values increase their perceived service
   performance, and customer relational value also increases the amount of
   purchases. Our findings reveal that service agents' workplace ostracism
   may actually help or harm customers' service perceptions, depending on
   the source of ostracism. The results provide significant implications
   for how organizations can better manage employees' perceived ostracism
   in the workplace and strategically improve customers' experience in
   service coproduction with excluded agents.

AB In many product categories, consumers show divided loyalty to more than
   one product. There are two key gaps in the extant literature regarding
   divided loyalty. First, previous studies have focused on the behavioral
   aspect while ignoring the attitudinal aspect of divided loyalty. Second,
   not much is known about how firms deal with consumers that show divided
   attitudinal loyalty. We conduct two studies to address these gaps. In
   Study 1, we (a) offer two explanations for divided attitudinal loyalty
   based on customer value and brand equity theories, (b) provide a
   boundary condition that attributes the explanations to the nature of
   competition faced by the firm, (c) evaluate firms' reaction to customers
   that show divided loyalty and (d) examine dealers role in extraction of
   higher value from divided loyal customers. In Study 2, we examine the
   relative strength of alternative strategies-end customer value creation
   versus monetary incentives-that firms (suppliers) can use for
   encouraging dealers to intervene on their behalf with end customers.
   Both studies use multiple source data in a B2B setting. Results suggest
   that dealer recommendation can increase lifetime value of divided loyal
   customers and that a customer value creation strategy adopted by the
   supplier with the dealer will likely enhance the dealer's willingness to
   intervene on behalf of the supplier.

   theory, Studies 1a & 1b reveal that brand attitude declines over time
   after purchase. This research further identifies moderators that
   counteract post-purchase brand attitude decline. In the first two
   studies, long-term (versus short-term) temporal orientation is
   associated with relatively more positive post-purchase brand attitudes.
   In Studies 2 and 3, brand singularization exerts a similar effect. These
   studies also point to an important congruence effect such that brand
   attitude change is relatively more positive when consumers' long-term
   (short-term) time orientations are concordant with affiliative
   (autonomous) brand singularization. The positive congruency effect is
   mediated by self-brand connections. Overall, our study results advance
   theoretical and applied understanding of the understudied area of

AB High-pressure sales tactics may result in short-term increases in sales;
   however, the long-term effect of employing these tactics on the
   relationships among the customer, the salesperson, and the firm is
   generally negative. Despite this widely held view, research on sales
   pressure has been limited to examining the selling orientation of the
   salesperson and/or the firm. As such, consumer perceptions of sales
   pressure have been neglected, and how the consumer experiences and
   reacts to pressure is not well understood. A structural model of
   antecedents and outcomes of perceptions of sales pressure is tested
   using a quota sample of consumers. To facilitate this test, the authors
   develop and validate a scale to measure consumer perceptions of sales
   pressure. The resulting scale consists of two factors, aggressive sales
   pressure and directive sales pressure. While aggressive sales pressure
   results in negative satisfaction and trust outcomes, directive sales
   pressure does not. These results underscore the assertion that some
   perceived pressure on the part of the buyer, assuming there is a
   directive element present, may not result in negative results for the
   salesperson and firm.

AB Integrating sustainability aspects into product development has long
   been recognized as a strategic priority for practitioners. Yet the
   literature reports mixed results on the product development
   effectiveness outcomes of sustainable product development strategies,
   while scant research has investigated how companies integrate
   environmental aspects into product development. This study develops a
   model that integrates effectiveness-enhancing outcomes and
   organizational inputs of eco-friendly product development strategies.
   Using questionnaire responses from firms from multiple industries,
   supplemented with lagged primary product development performance data,
   we find that top management commitment and corporate environmental
   support policies can facilitate eco-friendly product development
   strategies, while environmental performance incentives do not. In turn,
   the adoption of such strategies has a positive effect on firms' product
   development effectiveness. This effect weakens when business conditions
   are highly complex but tends to become stronger with increasing levels
   of munificence in the business environment. These findings have
   important implications for practitioners and researchers that are
   discussed.

AB Although companies receive a staggering amount of ideas from consumers,
   only a small fraction of the ideas are actually usable, with as many as
   98% being rejected. This research examines the influence of firms'
   responses to consumer-generated ideas on consumers' self-perceptions of
   face and their tendency to return in the future with more ideas.
   Specifically, we examine the impact of firm response to consumers'
   rejected ideas. The results show that consumers respond to a rejected
   idea with an increased of face threat, leading to a decrease in future
   idea sharing. However, the presence of face enhancement reduces these
   negative effects. Recognizing managers' dilemma, we identify three
   buffering responses that may drive perceptions of face enhancement and
   thus buffer the negative repercussions of face threat from rejecting
   consumer ideas: (1) considering consumers' past experiences
   (success/failure) with submitting ideas, (2) creating a unique group
   identity, and (3) offering an excuse. We also show the impact of a
   public versus private firm acknowledgment of consumer ideas on both
   consumers' perceptions of face and future idea sharing behaviors.

AB Studies show that service employees are among the most disengaged in the
   workforce. To better understand service employees' job engagement, this
   study broadens the scope of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model to
   include power distance orientation (PDO). The inclusion of PDO enriches
   the JD-R model by providing a key piece of information that has been
   missing in prior JD-R models: employees' perceptions of the source of
   job demands (i.e., supervisors) or employees' views of power and
   hierarchy within the organization. Study 1 uses a survey-based field
   study to show that employees with a high (compared to low) PDO feel more
   burnout due to supervisors when they are closely monitored by their
   supervisors. Study 1 further supports the finding that employees with
   high (compared to low) PDO feel less disengagement despite burnout due
   to supervisors. Study 2, using a lab experiment, and Study 3, relying on
   a survey-based field study, unveil why these effects were observed.
   Stress and job satisfaction emerge as mediators that explain the
   findings from Study 1. Implications of the role of PDO are discussed to
   improve the current understanding of how job engagement can improve
   customer service performance.

AB This paper seeks to understand how marketers might capitalize on
   consumers' increasing time spent online and convert online
   procrastination tendencies into purchase behavior. More specifically,
   the authors explore whether the propensity to use the Internet to avoid
   work tasks (online procrastination) leads to purchase behavior, and if
   so, what the mechanism underlying such an effect might be. Through two
   studies, the authors find that online procrastination positively impacts
   purchase, which in turn is indirectly affected by the consumers'
   propensity to delay their decisions. The authors further find different
   likelihoods of purchase based on degrees of tendency to delay decisions,
   online users' age, and type of online activities. Implications of these
   findings for informing managers about the ways to increase purchases for
   decisive and indecisive consumers who waste time online and raising
   online procrastinators' awareness about their vulnerability to marketers
   are discussed.

AB The literature that focuses on acquisitions from the consumer
   perspective has generally neglected the brand strategy of cross-border
   acquisitions in an emerging market by a developed country brand.
   However, research in this field appears necessary, considering the high
   failure rate of M&As, the common practice of Western/global companies of
   augmenting their brand portfolio through local acquisitions, and the
   sensitivity of emerging market consumers to foreign brands. The present
   study is an initial attempt to understand the loyalty of consumers
   toward the acquired brands. Moreover, we investigate how such an
   acquisition affects the relationship between quality and loyalty, as
   well as between price and loyalty. For fast-moving consumer goods brands
   in China, the findings indicate that from a customer's perspective
   acquiring a local brand is not an advisable strategy for foreign brand
   conglomerates, because such an international takeover may decrease
   consumer loyalty. Additionally, consumers tend to expect higher quality
   after the takeover but may not want to pay more for the quality
   increase.

   this study proposes that the increased effort required to process

   If the advertised price offer represents a good value, it can enhance

AB This research builds foundational theory in a new domain of marketing:
   animated visual brand elements. It focuses on agent animation, which
   conveys a sense that the brand element, such as a logo, moves of its own
   volition, as distinguished from object animation, which does not. Given
   limited marketplace utilization (pilot study), animated logos represent
   new opportunities for branding and promotion. However, the influence of
   agent animation on attitude toward the firm or brand is contingent on
   the fluent processing of the animation in the context it is used. As
   compared with object-animated or static logos, agent animation
   encourages more favorable attitudes toward dynamic firms but less
   favorable attitudes toward stable firms (Studies 1 and 2). Further, more
   favorable attitudes arise when the brand personality suggested by the
   animation is consistent with other brand cues, such as brand slogans
   (Study 3) or the logo graphic (Study 4). Finally, the effects are
   replicated with choice behavior using established brands (Study 5).

   impact of the company's corporate social responsibility (CSR) reputation
   and a negative moderating effect of company-cause fit on the donation
   amount-perceived price fairness relationship. The timing of the price
   increase also plays a key moderating role on this link. All four studies
   also provide insights into the underlying process of these moderating
   effects in terms of attributed company motives.

AB Retailers increasingly recognize that environmental responsibility is a
   strategic imperative. However, little research has investigated or
   identified the factors that facilitate the successful implementation of
   environmentally responsible strategies across a network of
   customer-facing sales units (stores). We propose that a store manager's
   ability to lead by example facilitates this process by fostering a
   supportive climate for store environmental stewardship (SENS-climate).
   By examining the influence of store managers' actions on sales
   associates' perceptions of the SENS-climate, as well as the subsequent
   impact on their performance-measured by margins, as well as sales of
   green and regular products-this study demonstrates that store managers
   can foster a SENS-climate by articulating their prioritization of
   environmental responsibility in their operational decisions. These
   positive effects are sustained by relational factors, such as the
   moderating effect of the store manager-sales associate dyadic tenure. In
   contrast, when store managers display high variability in their
   environmental orientation, it hinders the development of SENS-climate
   perceptions among sales associates. If sales associates perceive an
   enabling SENS-climate, they achieve higher margins and more green but
   fewer regular sales.

   and customer involvement as innovators (CIN). We propose that the three
   forms of customer involvement employ different ways of utilizing
   customer knowledge and thus are influenced differently by the nature of
   customer knowledge, the firm's knowledge management strategy, and
   organizational support for knowledge management implementation. Using
   primary data from multiple industries, we test a set of drivers along
   these three dimensions and find that the three forms of customer
   involvement are driven by different factors. Furthermore, the impact of
   customer involvement on product performance is contingent upon the
   firm's technological capability, and the contingent effect also varies
   across different forms of customer involvement. These findings provide
   important theoretical implications as well as practical guidance for
   adopting and managing customer involvement in innovation.

AB Strategic marketing ambidexterity (SMA), the blend of a firm's
   exploitation of existing competencies and exploration of future
   capabilities in strategic marketing activities, represents a dynamic
   capability that is vital in achieving superior performance. Given its
   criticality, the authors examine how firm antecedents and industry
   contexts affect the shift in a firm's SMA over time (movement in the
   blend of exploitation and exploration). In addition, the authors examine
   SMA's influence on firm financial outcomes, i.e., risk and return. Using
   data from 1999 to 2011 on publically traded firms, the authors show that
   firm maturity and slack (financial and strategic) are key determinants
   of SMA. Specifically, increased firm maturity and strategic slack result
   in a shift toward exploitation, whereas increased financial slack
   results in a shift toward exploration. Industry competitiveness
   moderates these effects. In terms of the financial performance
   implications of SMA, the authors find that shifts in SMA toward
   exploitation increase return, but they also increase firm-idiosyncratic
   risk. The authors conclude with implications for theory and managerial
   practice.

AB In business-to-business markets, hunting for new customers and farming
   existing customers are critical to achieve sales goals. Although
   practitioners suggest that salespeople have a preference for either
   hunting or farming, academic research has yet to examine when and why
   salespeople become oriented toward hunting or farming, and whether a
   simultaneous engagement in both (i.e., being ambidextrous) is efficient
   or damaging. In Study 1, the authors identify the link between
   regulatory focus and salesperson hunting and farming orientations. In
   Study 2, they demonstrate that (1) a promotion (prevention) focus is
   more strongly related to salesperson hunting (farming) orientation than
   is a prevention (promotion) focus, and (2) ambidextrous salespeople
   generate higher profits when they are customer oriented. In Study 3, the
   authors show that salesperson expectations about hunting success and the
   extent to which compensation plans are based on customer acquisition
   activities can change the direction of the relationship between
   regulatory focus and salesperson hunting and farming orientations. The
   authors discuss the implications of these findings for research and
   management of customer acquisition and retention at the salesperson
   level.

AB This study investigates the effects of consumer activity in online media
   (paid, owned, and earned) on sales and their interdependencies with the
   traditional marketing mix elements of price, advertising and
   distribution. We develop an integrative conceptual framework that links
   marketing actions to online consumer activity metrics along the
   consumer's path to purchase (P2P). Our framework proposes that the path
   to purchase has three basic stages-learning (cognitive), feeling
   (affective), behavior (conative)-and that these can be measured with
   novel online consumer activity metrics such as clicking on a paid search
   ads (cognitive) or Facebook likes and unlikes of the brand (affective).
   Our empirical analysis of a fast moving consumer good supports a
   know-feel-do pathway for the low-involvement product studied. We find,
   for example, that earned media can drive sales. However, we find that
   the news is not all good as it relates to online consumer activity:
   higher consumer activity on earned and owned media can lead to consumer
   disengagement in the form of unlikes. While traditional marketing such
   as distribution (60%) and price (20%) are the main drivers of sales
   variation for the studied brand, online owned (10%), (un)earned (3%),
   and paid (2%) media explain a substantial part of the path to purchase.
   It is noteworthy that TV advertising (5%) explains significantly less
   than online media in our case. Overall, our study should help strengthen
   marketers' case for building share in consumers' hearts and minds, as
   measured through consumer online activity and engagement.

AB Retailers are increasingly using round prices, a trend at odds with the
   marketing belief in the superiority of just-below prices. However,
   conclusive empirical evidence on the effectiveness of different price
   endings is still missing. Addressing this void, this paper presents four
   field-experimental studies with a broad array of samples revealing the
   central role of convenience in the context of price endings. Findings
   indicate that consumers perceive round prices as more convenient because
   their high cognitive accessibility saves time and effort during
   transactions, which is corroborated using a reaction time measure.
   Accordingly, round prices increase sales in purchase situations
   characterized by a high importance of convenience. Further, consumers'
   convenience consciousness explains preferences for different price
   endings. This research thus contributes to the behavioral pricing
   literature by challenging traditional marketing beliefs and providing
   convincing evidence of the superiority of round prices in a complex
   world where many customers attach great importance to convenience.

AB Both ad creativity and ad repetition play a pivotal role in advertising
   strategy. It is therefore of practical and theoretical importance to
   understand how they interact with one another on advertising
   effectiveness. After reviewing existing theories, we predict three-way
   interactions among: divergence, relevance, and repetition over six
   important dependent variables. Using a 2x2x3 between-subjects
   experimental design, we find that the classic inverted U-Shape
   (repeatedly found in previous repetition research) is observed only for
   ads with low divergence and relevance. In contrast, creative ads (high
   divergence and relevance) wear in immediately and show little sign of
   wearing-out even over repeated exposures. Mixed levels of divergence and
   relevance produce immediate wear-in but do show wearing-out over
   repeated exposures. Implications for advertising management and media
   programming are discussed.

AB This article offers a new perspective on customer-company identification
   (CCI) by focusing on CCI's underlying self-motives: self-uncertainty and
   self-enhancement. More precisely, an operationalization is proposed in
   which cognitive (CCICog) and affective (CCIAff) dimensions of CCI are
   driven by different self-motives: CCICog by self-uncertainty and CCIAff
   by self-enhancement. Focusing on these self-motives reveals that CCICog
   and CCIAff affect some customer attitudes and behaviors in opposite ways
   but affect other attitudes and behaviors similarly. A cross-sectional
   survey that examines outcomes of CCICog and CCIAff supports the proposed
   conceptualization of CCI and suggests the dimensions differ in how each
   impacts customer-company relationships. Furthermore, the study suggests
   that combining the dimensions together in higher order constructs or
   examining only one dimension can lead to misleading conclusions.

AB Firms struggle with salesforce control, particularly as typical
   piecemeal approaches overlook the nuance that the effect of a control is
   amplified or muted by a context created by other simultaneously deployed
   controls. Recent studies showing interactions between formal controls
   caution that control mechanisms must be examined as a portfolio. This
   study takes the next step in addressing how widely-studied formal
   controls interact with understudied input control and informal control
   in a salesforce control portfolio. We introduce the idea of sequential
   complementarity-when deploying a control mechanism enhances marginal
   returns from increasing a temporally preceding one-within a control
   portfolio to explain those interactions. We use data from 120 apparel
   manufacturers and 94 retailers to show that the performance benefits of
   formal control mechanisms depend on precedence by input control. These
   effects flip in the presence of informal control. Our unique
   contribution is theoretically introducing temporality into "holochronic"
   control theory to explain interactions of formal with informal control
   mechanisms.

AB From a Service-Dominant Logic (S-DL) perspective, employees constitute
   operant resources that firms can draw to enhance the outcomes of
   innovation efforts. While research acknowledges that frontline employees
   (FLEs) constitute, through service encounters, a key interface for the
   transfer of valuable external knowledge into the firm, the range of
   potential benefits derived from FLE-driven innovation deserves more
   investigation. Using a sample of knowledge intensive business services
   firms (KIBS), this study examines how the collaboration with FLEs along
   the new service development (NSD) process, namely FLE co-creation,
   impacts on service innovation performance following two routes of
   different effects. Partial least squares structural equation modeling
   (PLSSEM) results indicate that FLE co-creation benefits the NS success
   among FLEs and firm's customers, the constituents of the resources
   route. FLE co-creation also has a positive effect on the NSD speed,
   which in turn enhances the NS quality. NSD speed and NS quality
   integrate the operational route, which proves to be the most effective
   path to impact the NS market performance. Accordingly, KIBS managers
   must value their FLEs as essential partners to achieve successful
   innovation from an internal and external perspective, and develop the
   appropriate mechanisms to guarantee their effective involvement along
   the NSD process.

AB The surge in academic and practical interest in the topic of value
   co-creation (VCC) highlights an equivocal understanding of its
   conceptual boundaries and empirical constituents. Our search of the
   diverse scholarly literature on VCC identified 149 papers, from which we
   extract the two primary conceptual VCC dimensions of co-production and
   value-in-use. Though the combination of these two distinct dimensions is
   theoretically necessary to describe VCC, 79% of the studies in our
   dataset consider only one or the other. Such underlying theoretical
   ambiguity may explain conflicting results in earlier studies and
   motivates our effort to offer four contributions to the literature.
   First, we conduct a rigorous review, integrating existing work to expose
   the theoretical core of VCC. Second, we utilize the results from our
   review to isolate the two main theoretical dimensions of VCC and expose
   the three conceptual elements which underlie each dimension. Third, we
   apply our theoretical findings to derive empirical measurement
   constructs for each dimension. Fourth, we refine, analyze, and test the
   resulting measurement index in an investigation into consumer
   satisfaction.

AB The present research leverages the "irrational options" theoretical
   framework to explore options rationality differences between salespeople
   and non-salespeople. Specifically, the reported research first examines
   (Study 1) whether or not salespeople are more likely to place a higher
   value on diminishing options than individuals who do not work in sales.
   Two follow-up studies embed a potential internal moderator (salesperson
   thinking style; Study 2) and a potential external moderator
   (performance-based incentives; Study 3) of salesperson valuations of
   diminishing options. The method employed in all three studies is an
   experimental design tailored after Shin and Ariely's (Management Science
   50(5):575-586, 2004) seminal work on irrationality and options
   availability. The results demonstrate that, compared to non-salespeople,
   salespeople are more inclined to value option availability (Study 1),
   with this effect being especially pronounced for rule-bound thinkers
   (Study 2) and those operating under incentive-based compensation plans
   (Study 3). The article concludes by highlighting key managerial and
   theoretical implications, while acknowledging limitations and proposing
   directions for related, future work.

AB Capturing the value of industrial services is an issue of growing
   concern as services increasingly define manufacturing companies'
   competitive market positions. In business markets, suppliers often
   create customized service packages (CSPs) to avoid difficult pricing
   decisions or tedious negotiations. However, using a unique dataset of
   responses from more than 450 managers collected through
   telephone-assisted online questionnaires, this study shows that the
   managerial practice is suboptimal. Customers' willingness to pay for
   CSPs is almost 5% lower than it would be with separate assessments of
   the same service elements, which represents substantially lower value
   capture potential. Buying firms with strong purchasing power demand
   greater price discounts for CSPs, though the presentation format has
   less influence among large and experienced buyers, as long as services
   support customer processes. Switching from CSPs to separate service
   offerings can enhance supplier profitability, but it requires advanced
   marketing capabilities to understand, document, and communicate customer
   value in business markets.

AB In business-to-business relationships, sellers are often faced with
   instances of contractual breaches by buyers. In many cases, relationship
   factors preclude legal enforcement of contract terms, requiring sellers
   to explore alternate resolution options. Literature on contractual
   breaches has primarily focused on enforcement options based on terms
   specified in the contract. However, little is known about how companies
   deal with contractual breaches by their customers when legal enforcement
   is not a viable option. The authors use a grounded theory approach to
   investigate this important issue. Based on in-depth interviews with 40
   supplier managers and executives in multiple industries, the authors
   identify: (a) types of out-of-contract alternatives for resolving
   breaches, (b) factors that lead to use of enforcement options outside
   the terms specified in the contract, (c) contextual influences, and (d)
   individual and firm-level consequences of outside-of-contract
   enforcement.

AB Interest in customer reacquisition has increased as firms embrace the
   concept of customer relationship management. Using survey and
   transactional data from defected subscribers of a publishing company, we
   investigate how defected customers evaluate their propensity to return
   to the company prior to any win-back offer. We introduce a new variable
   for relationship marketing, general willingness to return (GWR), and
   show that it is strongly and positively related to the actual return
   decision and the duration of the restarted relationship. Combining
   attribution theory elements with existing win-back explanations, which
   focus on economic, social, and emotional value perceptions, provides a
   more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence the GWR
   to a former relationship. Importantly, we learn that regardless of whose
   fault it is, if the reasons for the relationship termination can change
   or are preventable and the firm can control those changes, then the
   defected customer has a higher general willingness to return to the
   former relationship. Also, we show that the duration of time absence
   before relationship revival moderates the impact of GWR on second
   relationship duration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that satisfaction
   prior to defection and the length of time absence provide a reasonable
   basis for distinguishing defected customers who differ in their GWR. By
   applying our findings, we derive recommendations for firms on how to
   position marketing communications to recapture defected customers
   according to their general willingness to return.

AB This research investigates the buyer and seller characteristics that
   impact overbidding in electronic auctions. Specifically, the empirical
   analysis shows that customers with more total experience are less likely
   to overbid and that overbidding is less frequent for auction items with
   higher face values. When bidder experience pertains to the same product
   category, the frequency and magnitude of overbids are further reduced.
   This research also finds that consumers are more likely to overbid as
   the bidding environment becomes more competitive. Furthermore, auction
   item attributes, such as starting price, day/time of the auction, and
   shipping fees, are shown to impact the propensity to overbid and the
   magnitude of overbidding. The empirical results have important
   implications for understanding bidder behavior and for assisting online

   strategies beyond the branded house (e.g., Boeing and IBM) and
   house-of-brands (e.g., P&G with Tide and Cheer), and recognition that in
   practice these strategies are very different, there is still a need for
   research on how financial markets value the full range of brand
   architecture strategies pursued by firms. We replicate and extend Rao et
   al.'s (Journal of Marketing, 68(4), 126-141, 2004) investigation of
   brand portfolio strategy and firm performance by (1) adding sub-branding
   and endorsed branding architectures, (2) clarifying the "mixed"
   architecture to constitute a BH-HOB hybrid and remove sub-and endorsed
   branding variants, and (3) quantifying the impact of a company's brand
   architecture strategy on stock risk in addition to returns. To explore
   the risk profiles of these five different strategies, we offer a
   brand-relevant conceptualization of the sources of idiosyncratic risk
   that may be exacerbated or controlled through brand architecture
   strategy: brand reputation risk, brand dilution risk, brand
   cannibalization risk, and brand stretch risk. We demonstrate superior
   results in terms of model performance using the expanded five-part
   architecture categorization and conclude with implications for practice.
   Our results show that risk/return tradeoffs for sub-branding, endorsed
   branding, and the BH-HOB hybrid differ significantly from what common
   wisdom suggests.

AB Despite a growing interest in the phenomenon of open innovation (OI),
   empirical evidence documenting the link between new product development
   capabilities, OI practices, and new product innovativeness is scarce.
   Eminent scholars have called for large-scale studies that systematically
   investigate the OI paradigm. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the
   firm, new product development, and NPD capabilities literature streams,
   we conceptualize a framework in which OI practices are disentangled
   according to the stage of the new product development process in which
   they occur (development stage or commercialization stage). We identify
   two major types of OI practices: development-centric OI (which occurs in
   the development stage) and commercialization-centric OI (which occurs in
   the commercialization stage). Specific types of NPD capabilities-R&D,
   market information management, and launch-are expected to both influence
   the extent to which each OI practice is implemented and moderate the
   effect of each OI practice on product portfolio innovativeness and firm
   performance. The empirical analysis combines primary data from a survey
   of 239 firms with secondary data on innovation and financial outcomes.
   Our results support our hypotheses and indicate a need to differentiate
   among the different kinds of OI practices while elaborating on the
   complex role played by NPD capabilities in influencing OI practices.

AB Building on the meta-analytic model suggested by Palmatier et al.
   Journal of Marketing, 70, 136-153, (2006), this study extends the
   relationship marketing framework to the domain of online retailing to
   identify what strategies help build relationships with online customers.
   Specifically, this meta-analytic study identifies key antecedents and
   consequences of relationship marketing in online retailing. The study
   also examines the relationship between the four mediators-trust,
   commitment, relationship quality, and relationship satisfaction-and the
   antecedents and consequences of relationship marketing. Similarity and
   seller expertise were found to have the strongest impact on relational
   mediators, and word of mouth was the most critical outcome of
   relationship marketing efforts. The model proffered in this study will
   motivate hypotheses to be examined by future researchers. The model also
   helps managers to identify the key drivers of relationship marketing in
   online retailing.

AB In this digital era, marketing theory and practice are being transformed
   by increasing complexity due to information availability, higher reach
   and interactions, and faster speeds of transactions. These have led to
   the adoption of intelligent agent technologies (IATs) by many companies.
   As IATs are relatively new and technologically complex, several
   definitions are evolving, and the theory in this area is not yet fully
   developed. There is a need to provide structure and guidance to
   marketers to further this emerging stream of research. As a first step,
   this paper proposes a marketing-centric definition and a systematic
   taxonomy and framework. The authors, using a grounded theory approach,
   conduct an extensive literature review and a qualitative study in which
   interviews with managers from 50 companies in 22 industries reveal the
   importance of understanding IAT applications and adopting them. Further,
   the authors propose an integrated conceptual framework with several
   propositions regarding IAT adoption. This research identifies the gaps
   in the literature and the need for adoption of IATs in the future of
   marketing given changing consumer behavior and product and industry
   characteristics.

AB This paper develops a theoretical framework to address how dynamic
   competitive interactions and customer preferences change the observed
   relationship between market price and quality, and it offers an
   empirical framework to study these phenomena. Our framework proposes
   that price-quality relationships in a market (the fair value line)
   evolve according to several processes. We define and discuss these
   processes, including: (1) line formation, (2) line evolution (comprised
   of line elevation, erosion, steepening, flattening, blurring,
   tightening, extension and contraction), and (3) line replacement, which
   involves redefining price or quality in the marketplace. Instead of
   assuming that prices are a stable function of observable product
   attributes only (the static equilibrium view), our framework generalizes
   to dynamic disequilibrium patterns observed in many industries. These
   patterns are empirically assessed and explained by customer,
   competitive, and technology forces analyzed in marketing and strategy
   literatures. For managers, we discuss how they should react to these
   processes or, even better, set them in motion. For marketing
   researchers, we specify several hypotheses on the processes' antecedents
   and consequences, testable with readily available datasets.

AB This research provides insights into the following questions regarding
   the effectiveness of mobile adaptive personalization systems: (1) to
   what extent can adaptive personalization produce a better
   service/product over time? (2) does adaptive personalization work better
   than self-customization? (3) does the use of the customer's social
   network result in better personalization? To answer these questions, we
   develop and implement an adaptive personalization system for
   personalizing mobile news based on recording and analyzing customers'
   behavior, plus information from their social network. The system learns
   from an individual's reading history, automatically discovers new
   material as a result of shared interests in the user's social network,
   and adapts the news feeds shown to the user. Field studies show that (1)
   repeatedly adapting to the customer's observed behavior improves
   personalization performance; (2) personalizing automatically, using a
   personalization algorithm, results in better performance than allowing
   the customer to self-customize; and (3) using the customer's social
   network for personalization results in further improvement. We conclude
   that mobile automated adaptive personalization systems that take
   advantage of social networks may be a promising approach to making
   personalization more effective.

AB Despite significant attention from practitioners and broad claims of the

   incremental direct effects on outcomes relevant to professional selling
   has been disappointing. However, little research has included relevant
   contextual variables or the potential interactions of EI with contextual
   variables when considering its effects. This contingency view of EI
   maintains that EI is important in work settings, but only under certain
   conditions. Drawing on the appraisal theory of emotions, the authors
   develop a contingency model, which proposes that salesperson EI
   moderates the harmful effects of role stress on three work
   outcomes-emotional exhaustion, customer-oriented selling, and sales
   performance. Using three matched data sources from multiple professional
   selling workgroups in a business-to-business sales setting, the authors
   find that EI moderates the relationship between role ambiguity and all
   three outcome variables.

AB Loyalty programs are a ubiquitous marketing tactic, yet many of them
   perform poorly and the reasons for loyalty program failure remain
   unclear to both marketing managers and researchers. This article
   presents three studies-two experiments and one survey-in support of the
   notion that a greater understanding of loyalty program performance
   demands an expanded theoretical framework. Specifically, researchers and
   managers must account for loyalty programs' effects on both target and
   bystander customers in the firm's portfolio, the simultaneous effects of
   three performance-relevant mediating mechanisms (gratitude, status,
   unfairness), and the contingent effects of program delivery (rule
   clarity, reward exclusivity, reward visibility) on specific mediating
   linkages. The results provide insights into why and when loyalty
   programs fail and into the complex trade-offs managers face. Loyalty
   programs have opposing effects on target and bystander customers'
   loyalty and sales. While rule clarity suppresses both negative bystander
   as well as positive target effects, reward visibility enhances both
   types of effects. Exclusive rewards offer a means to alleviate negative
   bystander effects without affecting targets. The article both
   conceptually and empirically establishes a comprehensive analysis
   framework that can help marketing managers and researchers evaluate and
   improve loyalty program effectiveness.

AB The results of this research suggest a new mandate for discriminant
   validity testing in marketing. Specifically, the authors demonstrate
   that the AVE-SV comparison (Fornell and Larcker 1981) and HTMT ratio
   (Henseler et al. 2015) with 0.85 cutoff provide the best assessment of
   discriminant validity and should be the standard for publication in
   marketing. These conclusions are based on a thorough assessment of the
   literature and the results of a Monte Carlo simulation. First, based on
   a content analysis of articles published in seven leading marketing
   journals from 1996 to 2012, the authors demonstrate that three tests-the
   constrained phi (Joreskog 1971), AVE-SV (Fornell and Larcker 1981), and
   overlapping confidence intervals (Anderson and Gerbing 1988)-are by far
   most common. Further review reveals that (1) more than 20% of
   survey-based and over 80% of non-survey-based marketing studies fail to
   document tests for discriminant validity, (2) there is wide variance
   across journals and research streams in terms of whether discriminant
   validity tests are performed, (3) conclusions have already been drawn
   about the relative stringency of the three most common methods, and (4)
   the method that is generally perceived to be most generous is being
   consistently misapplied in a way that erodes its stringency. Second, a
   Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to assess the relative rigor of the
   three most common tests, as well as an emerging technique (HTMT).
   Results reveal that (1) on average, the four discriminant validity
   testing methods detect violations approximately 50% of the time, (2) the
   constrained phi and overlapping confidence interval approaches perform
   very poorly in detecting violations whereas the AVE-SV test and HTMT
   (with a ratio cutoff of 0.85) methods perform well, and (3) the HTMT.85
   method offers the best balance between high detection and low arbitrary
   violation (i.e., false positive) rates.

AB Service-dominant logic continues its evolution, facilitated by an active
   community of scholars throughout the world. Along its evolutionary path,
   there has been increased recognition of the need for a crisper and more
   precise delineation of the foundational premises and specification of
   the axioms of S-D logic. It also has become apparent that a limitation
   of the current foundational premises/axioms is the absence of a clearly
   articulated specification of the mechanisms of (often massive-scale)
   coordination and cooperation involved in the cocreation of value through
   markets and, more broadly, in society. This is especially important
   because markets are even more about cooperation than about the
   competition that is more frequently discussed. To alleviate this
   limitation and facilitate a better understanding of cooperation (and
   coordination), an eleventh foundational premise (fifth axiom) is
   introduced, focusing on the role of institutions and institutional
   arrangements in systems of value cocreation: service ecosystems.
   Literature on institutions across multiple social disciplines, including
   marketing, is briefly reviewed and offered as further support for this
   fifth axiom.

AB Aesthetic labor practices involve strategically controlling human
   aesthetics in an effort create a predefined physical appearance profile
   that becomes part of the value proposition. Retail and service
   management often implements aesthetic labor by trying to create a
   matching look among all visible service providers. Social comparison
   theory provides a general theory that helps explain the way consumers
   may react to more or less similarity in appearance among service
   providers. Three studies examine aesthetic labor in service settings.
   Study 1 tests a theoretical structure suggesting a process by which
   aesthetic labor in the form of a similar appearance among service
   providers affects outcomes including self-congruence, affect, hedonic
   value and future patronage intention. Study 2 adds explanatory power to
   Study 1 by demonstrating the important role played by authentic fit
   among service providers. Study 3 explores the impact of uniforms as an
   aesthetic labor tool and suggests that uniforms may not always enhance
   perceptions that employees belong together. The research overall
   demonstrates some counter-intuitive findings including the fact that
   looking alike is only an effective aesthetic labor strategy to the
   extent that it drives perceptions of genuine belonging.

AB The authors conduct a meta-analysis to examine dependence and
   interdependence in marketing relationships. Analyses reveal that
   dependence affects performance primarily through relationship quality
   and cooperation, while interdependence has substantial direct effects as
   well as effects mediated through relationship-specific investments and
   cooperation. Regarding relationship context, effects of dependence are
   stronger in channel relationships than end-user relationships and for
   services than goods; interdependence does not display the same pattern.
   Regarding methodological context, dependence measures that emphasize
   relationship value versus switching costs have different moderating
   effects; greater general dependence content is associated with weaker
   effect sizes for dependence but conversely greater effect sizes for
   interdependence. These results suggest that new insights can be gained
   by distinguishing relationship value and switching cost components of
   dependence and by investigating the possibility that the conceptual
   domain of interdependence differs from that of dependence. Future
   research that strives for greater precision in the measurement of
   dependence and interdependence constructs and that simultaneously
   examines dependence and interdependence is recommended.

AB CRM, CLV, and loyalty programs emphasize carefully targeting promotions
   to select consumers. However, with websites actively disseminating
   promotions to the untargeted, keeping targeted promotions from
   untargeted consumers is increasingly difficult. Spillover of targeted
   promotions to untargeted consumers can be a boon or a curse, depending
   on how the firm manages promotions' features and characteristics. Extant
   literature provides little guidance on how firms can shape targeted
   promotions to strategically encourage participation or abstention by the
   untargeted. Drawing on equity theory and scarcity theory, we analyze
   1,000 promotions discussed by members of the highest traffic "deals"
   website. We find: (1) untargeted consumers readily access promotions not
   targeted to them; (2) untargeted consumers find such offers more
   attractive than untargeted promotional offers; and (3) knowledge of
   prior promotions' pricing, "may not be for you" language, and
   quantity/time limits influence evaluations. We discuss how managers can
   shape promotions to better manage untargeted consumers' responses.

AB Through six studies set in a range of service contexts, we show that
   consumers perceive the passage of wait time through intrinsic changes in
   the service experience. Changes, either in service progress speed or in
   activities within service experiences, consistently influence the
   perception of wait time. Further, the effects of change on time
   perception depend on whether the judgment is made prospectively or
   retrospectively. Results relating to change in progress speeds (Studies
   1-3) demonstrate that faster progress during the start of an event
   shortens prospective time judgments; conversely, quicker progress at the
   end of a service experience shortens retrospective time judgments. We
   also demonstrate that prospective time judgments decrease, and
   retrospective judgments increase, when there is greater change in
   activities during the service experience (Studies 4-5). Extending this
   line of inquiry, we explore how within-experience activity change-in
   terms of the number of segments and how similar the segment activities
   are-impact retrospective time judgments (Study 6). Taken together, our
   findings therefore suggest a means (by managing changes in speed or
   activity within a service experience) of prolonging or quickening time
   perceptions that can be applied to service contexts to manage consumers'
   wait time judgments.

AB The vast number of channel types and broad range of possible channel
   configurations makes identifying a product's most efficient route to
   end-users challenging for today's managers. This study analyzes drivers
   of a firm's distribution intensity and their respective effects on
   performance. The simultaneous analysis of the two dimensions of
   distribution intensity (i.e., the variety of channels and the degree of
   channel usage) reveals the two decisions to be positively interrelated,
   reflecting a firm's intention to achieve market coverage. Moreover,
   firms align their distribution intensity to their individual context
   (their business strategy and environmental conditions), leading to
   efficient intensity levels. Inefficient intensity levels get penalized
   by market mechanisms. The results reveal that more is not necessarily
   better: a more offensive-minded intensity of distribution particularly
   creates a positive performance effect when complex products are being
   offered and even more so when the customer base contains a large share
   of demanding key accounts.

   dissatisfaction is such an overlooked downsizing outcome. Using
   longitudinal data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI),
   Compustat, and a consumer survey this study analyzes satisfaction
   outcomes of downsizing. It extends research in this domain to B2C
   markets and explicitly addresses environmental influences on the
   downsizing-satisfaction link. Results indicate that there is a negative
   effect of downsizing on customer satisfaction. It is particularly
   pronounced for companies (1) with little organizational slack, (2) with
   high labor productivity, or (3) in industries with high R&D intensity.
   Moreover, downsizing has a stronger negative impact on customer
   satisfaction in product categories with (4) high risk importance and (5)
   low probability for consumer errors as well as (6) low level of brand
   consciousness. Furthermore, customer satisfaction mediates the effect of
   downsizing on financial performance. The results provide an explanation
   for why so many downsizing projects fail and what managers can do to
   prevent adverse effects of downsizing on customer satisfaction and
   financial performance.

AB Achieving customer loyalty is a primary marketing goal, but building
   loyalty and reaping its rewards remain ongoing challenges. Theory
   suggests that loyalty comprises attitudes and purchase behaviors that
   benefit one seller over competitors. Yet researchers examining loyalty
   adopt widely varying conceptual and operational approaches. The present
   investigation examines the consequences of this heterogeneity by
   empirically mapping current conceptual approaches using an item-level
   coding of extant loyalty research, then testing how operational and
   study-specific characteristics moderate the strategy -> loyalty ->
   performance process through meta-analytic techniques. The results
   clarify dissimilarities in loyalty building strategies, how loyalty
   differentially affects performance and word of mouth, and the
   consequences of study-specific characteristics. Prescriptive advice
   based on 163 studies of customer loyalty addresses three seemingly
   simple but very critical questions: What is customer loyalty? How is it
   measured? and What actually matters when it comes to customer loyalty?

AB Brand and innovation management have become increasingly important
   priorities for firms over the last few decades. Firms rely on strong
   brands and product innovations to gain competitive advantage and fuel
   growth. Although academic research has addressed a number of different
   areas and topics that have collectively advanced our understanding, the
   interrelationship between branding and innovations is still relatively
   under-researched. Brand and innovation management need and benefit from
   each other, suggesting a need for a deeper integration between the two.
   Towards that goal, this article presents a conceptual framework to help
   structure the interrelationship and suggests a number of future research
   directions.

AB This paper focuses on managers' marketing decision making during
   performance decline. Drawing on the reconciliation of theories of
   failure-induced change and threat-rigidity by Ocasio (1995), we examine
   how performance decline may result in a rigid decision-making process
   and decision characteristics that reflect the narrowing of attention and
   increased risk seeking. Furthermore, drawing on managerial compensation
   research, we consider how incentive pay may affect the marketing
   decision-making process and decision characteristics of managers during
   performance decline. Using a simulation game with experienced Chinese
   managers, our results indicate that performance decline decreases
   marketing strategy process comprehensiveness but increases reliance on
   short-term marketing decisions, strategic change, and strategic risk
   taking. Moreover, incentive pay attenuates the rigid decision-making
   process of managers but accentuates their heightened risk seeking during
   performance decline. This paper offers unique behavioral insights into
   how managers make marketing decisions.

AB Although marketers often introduce product innovations using line
   extensions, extant research provides little empirical evidence on
   whether and how this product strategy pays off. The objective of this
   study is to examine the effects of innovation and the relative roles of
   brand and marketing mix variables in the success of new line extensions.
   Using data from 196 new line extensions across 23 consumer packaged
   goods categories, the authors employ a two-stage approach to assess how
   innovation and parent brand strength impact line extension trial
   purchase. The authors find that innovative line extensions tend to have
   a higher level of average trial probability. The strongest marketing
   driver for successful innovative line extension introductions is parent
   brand strength. Non-innovative line extensions gain higher trial from
   greater distribution. The results offer guidance on how managers can
   better utilize brand strength and the marketing mix when employing a
   line extension strategy.

AB Introducing access as an alternative consumption mode next to ownership
   constitutes a major business model innovation. Managers need to better
   understand how to brand these new access offers and how this innovation
   affects current customers of the parent brand. In a series of
   experiments, we show that the product brand affects consumers' access
   attitude less strongly than the offer's service convenience in the
   carsharing context. However, in the fashion context, we find that brand
   prestige becomes essential for consumers' access attitude. Regardless of
   the context, we repeatedly find that owners of a prestige brand evaluate
   new access offers more favorably than non-owners. In the carsharing
   context, this effect reverses for value brand owners. Furthermore, we do
   not find evidence that the access offer affects the parent brand
   negatively. Instead, we find that the parent brand is considered more
   innovative when a new access offer is introduced.

AB In order to sustain and grow brand equity, brand managers are faced with
   balancing the preservation of existing brand identity through
   consistency with the need to maintain relevance, which requires change
   and innovation. In this paper we build upon the concept of
   organizational ambidexterity (March 1991), arguing that design
   thinking-the logics and practices associated with designers-can serve as
   a mechanism which promotes and enables the integration of brand
   consistency and relevance. Drawing on cases of innovation at firms
   across a range of industries, we show how design thinking can trigger
   brand ambidexterity across a three-stage process. We identify eight
   practices and examine how designers enable brand managers to address
   enduring consistency-relevance tensions in ways that ensure innovations
   renew or revitalize the brand without undermining its essence.

AB Business-to-business electronic markets have emerged as robust,
   legitimate channels for conducting transactions, where firms participate
   in these markets according to their investments in the channel, such
   that they might participate as an expert, explorer, or passive firm.
   Over time, repeated interactions with the same trading partners can
   result in virtual interorganizational relationships even in an
   environment predicated to promote transactional exchange. We suggest
   that the nature of firm participation should moderate the influence of
   organizational interdependence-which comprises both total
   interdependence and interdependent asymmetry-on relational outcomes such
   as trust and satisfaction for virtual interorganizational relationships
   that arise in the electronic market. Results from analysis of data
   collected from a survey of participant firms in an electronic market
   confirm the moderating role of the nature of participation. Across the
   three participation states, total interdependence enhances relational
   outcomes at a diminishing rate. In contrast, interdependence asymmetry
   does not influence relational outcomes for expert firms, diminishes them
   at an increasing rate for explorer firms, and increases trust at a
   decreasing rate for passive firms. The interaction between total
   interdependence and interdependence asymmetry increased satisfaction for
   expert firms and decreased trust and satisfaction for explorer firms.

AB Whereas past research has focused on negative outcomes that can transfer
   from one firm to another, this paper examines conditions under which a
   service failure by one firm creates an opportunity to enhance customer
   evaluations of a different firm in a contiguous service experience.
   Thus, a new external service recovery phenomenon is demonstrated in
   which consumers have more favorable perceptions of a firm when there was
   a previous failure with a different firm compared with no previous
   service failure. Study 1 tests hypotheses related to consumers'
   perceptions of a hotel's external service recovery after an airline's
   service failure. Study 2 examines an external recovery effort in the
   hotel industry that follows a service failure from an unrelated hotel,
   an affiliated hotel, and the same hotel. Study 3 utilizes a laboratory
   experiment to assess the effects of external recovery in a restaurant
   setting. Results from all three studies suggest external recovery leads
   to appreciable gains for the recovering firm but only when it is not
   affiliated with the failing firm. Implications for service managers
   suggest several simple and relatively low cost tactics can be
   implemented to capitalize on other firms' failures. In particular, this
   research highlights strategies that encourage frontline employees to
   listen to customers and, if a prior failure is detected, make simple
   gestures of goodwill.

AB Behavioral research shows that reasons for and reasons against adopting
   innovations differ qualitatively, and they influence consumers'
   decisions in dissimilar ways. This has important implications for
   theorists and managers, as overcoming barriers that cause resistance to
   innovation calls for marketing approaches other than promoting reasons
   for adoption of new products and services. Consumer behavior frameworks
   in diffusion of innovation (DOI) studies have largely failed to
   distinctly account for reasons against adoption. Indeed, no study to
   date has tested the relative influence of adoption and resistance
   factors in a single framework. This research aims to address this
   shortcoming by applying a novel consumer behavior model (i.e.,
   behavioral reasoning theory) to test the relative influence of both
   reasons for and, importantly, reasons against adoption in consumers'
   innovation adoption decisions. Based on two empirical studies, one with
   a product and a second with a service innovation, findings demonstrate
   that behavioral reasoning theory provides a suitable framework to model
   the mental processing of innovation adoption. Implications for managers
   and researchers are discussed.

AB This conceptual paper argues that the marketing discipline should move
   away from its rather restrictive focus on customers toward a view of
   marketing that acknowledges the interrelatedness of stakeholders.
   Building on multiplicity theory, this paper presents stakeholder
   marketing as a revised perspective on marketing that views stakeholder
   networks as continuous instead of discrete multiplicities. This revised
   perspective offers a better understanding of stakeholder networks where
   (1) value exchange has become complex rather than dyadic, (2) tension
   between stakeholder interests has become explicit rather than implicit,
   and (3) control over marketing activities has become dispersed rather
   than centralized. The paper conceptualizes capabilities required by
   firms for dealing with each of these three transitions: systems
   thinking, paradoxical thinking, and democratic thinking. The paper
   discusses implications for firm performance, marketing theory, empirical
   research, and marketing practice and argues that embracing stakeholder
   marketing helps to reclaim territory for marketing in academia and
   business.

AB As the roles of customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders,
   regulators, and communities become more significant in today's business
   environment, a precise understanding of the organization's internal
   drivers in delivering value to its stakeholders is critical. To this
   end, this study integrates stakeholder theory and the organizational
   learning literature to propose that stakeholder-focused organizational
   learning drives organizations to respond to their stakeholders. Using a
   sample of 349 organizations, we introduce three stakeholder-focused
   knowledge acquisition mechanisms (experiential, vicarious, and contact)
   and, along with the other organizational learning processes (information
   distribution, information interpretation, and organizational memory),
   examine their influence on the behavioral actions of stakeholder-focused
   responsiveness, innovation, and imitation. Subsequently, we assess the
   impact of these behavioral actions on organizational performance.
   Overall, the results show that stakeholder-focused organizational
   learning is positively associated with responsiveness. More uniquely,
   the propensity to employ innovative or imitative stakeholder practices
   is found to be influenced by the way the organization acquires
   information about stakeholders. Lastly, the findings suggest that simply
   responding to stakeholders does not guarantee superior performance, but
   the manner in which the organization responds matters just as much.

AB Firms are increasingly collaborating with their competitors for new
   product development (NPD), yet the literature is almost silent on stock
   market reactions to these horizontal collaborations. Given the different
   skills and activities needed in each NPD phase, we analyze the
   differential stock market reactions to horizontal collaborations in the
   initiation, development, and commercialization phases of NPD. Analyses
   of a unique and comprehensive dataset with 831 NPD announcements of
   horizontal collaborations over 12 years reveal that, on average, the
   stock market reacts favorably to NPD-related horizontal collaboration in
   the initiation phase, but unfavorably in the development and
   commercialization phases. Further, these effects are asymmetrically
   moderated by the innovativeness of the new product and the collaborating
   competitor's relative market and technological powers. Overall, our
   results highlight that failing to examine the specific NPD phase leads
   to an incomplete understanding of stock market reactions to horizontal
   collaboration for NPD. We offer theoretical and managerial implications
   regarding horizontal collaboration for each NPD phase, along with the
   relevant NPD project and competitor contingencies.

AB Capitalizing on a large-scale field experimental dataset involving 1,254
   airline customers, this study introduces customer inoculation as a new,
   proactive strategy for mitigating the negative consequences that service
   failures have on customer satisfaction. Results confirm that customer
   inoculation eases the decrease in satisfaction when customers experience
   a service failure. Additional analyses indicate that customer
   inoculation does not harm customer satisfaction if no service failure
   occurs. This finding sets inoculation apart from expectation management
   and underscores the potential inoculation has for marketing practice.
   Furthermore, contrary to traditional recovery strategies for addressing
   service failures, customer inoculation operates in advance of a service
   failure and thereby circumvents potential drawbacks of traditional
   strategies. In sum, customer inoculation represents a novel strategy for
   addressing service failures with respect to existing marketing
   literature and expands the scope of action for companies when they
   cannot avoid offering occasionally flawed services.

AB A growing body of empirical research has investigated various aspects of
   control in exchange relationships; however, understanding of this
   phenomenon is still in its infancy. The objective of our research is to
   review this literature quantitatively with meta-analysis to derive some
   empirical generalizations and reconcile the contradictory results about
   the effects of organizational control in marketing exchange
   relationships. This study finds that process and output control
   generally produce positive outcomes, especially when used jointly. It
   also finds that, because control encompasses more than monitoring alone,
   the former is generally more effective in producing positive outcomes.
   Our research also finds that organizational control can have either
   positive or negative consequences depending on the organizational
   setting (i.e., interorganizational vs. intraorganizational context).

AB This study fills extant gaps in the marketing literature by further
   probing the multi-faceted impact of a company's corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) practices on customer relationships, and it marks
   the first systematic marketing study devoted to investigating CSR as a
   bivalent mechanism that encompasses both motivation and hygiene
   properties. Via a field study utilizing three separate samples of
   customer survey data (combined n = 2,408) collected over three seasons
   from a professional basketball team, results support a moderated
   mediation model wherein CSR is shown to be a necessary and sufficient
   mechanism for stronger customer relationships. While business leaders
   typically support the notion of CSR for largely altruistic reasons, our
   research brings new understanding as to how CSR operates in customers'
   minds and suggests that CSR is not only something that a company should
   engage in based on principled grounds but also something that a company
   must practice for strategic reasons as their customers demand it and
   place relational value on it.

AB We investigate the mediating role of moral emotions and their
   contingency on individual characteristics in consumer responses to
   corporate green and non-green actions. Two between subjects experiments
   were conducted to test our hypotheses on samples of adult consumers. The
   results show that, for corporate non-green actions, various individual
   difference characteristics (social justice values, empathy, moral
   identity, self-concept) moderate the elicitation of negative moral
   emotions (contempt, anger, disgust), which, in turn, lead to consumer
   negative responses (negative word of mouth, complaint behaviors,
   boycotting). Moreover, for corporate green actions, empathy moderates
   elicitation of positive emotions on gratitude, which, in turn,
   influences consumer positive responses (positive word of mouth,
   resistance to negative information, identification with the company,
   investment). This study adds to extant research by examining
   understudied "hot" moral emotional processes underlying consumer
   reactions toward corporate environmental responsibility and
   irresponsibility. Implications for marketing communication and
   segmentation decisions are considered.

AB Sweepstakes that offer more identical prizes do not necessarily attract
   more participants. When deciding whether to participate in a sweepstakes
   presented in isolation (typical case), most consumers cannot evaluate if
   the number of prizes offered is "good" or "bad" within a certain range
   (1-10 prizes), because of the low evaluability of this attribute.
   Therefore, they do not perceive their odds of winning as better with
   more prizes, nor are they more likely to participate. Five studies
   detail this process and illustrate which individual and contextual
   factors (participation frequency in sweepstakes, availability of
   information about the usual number of prizes for comparable sweepstakes,
   visual reinforcement of the number of prizes by a consistent number of
   pictures) increase the evaluability of the number of prizes, which can
   reduce magnitude insensitivity. This study in turn provides managerial
   insights into how to design and advertise efficient sweepstakes.

AB Whereas current literature emphasizes the positive consequences of
   co-creation, this article sheds light on potential risks of co-created
   services. Specifically, we examine the implications of customer
   co-creation in service failure episodes. The results of four
   experimental studies show that in a failure case, services high on
   co-creation generate a greater negative disconfirmation with the
   expected service outcome than services low on co-creation. Moreover, we
   examine the effectiveness of different service recovery strategies to
   restore customer satisfaction after failed co-created services.
   According to our results, companies should follow a matching strategy by
   mirroring the level of customer participation in service recovery based
   on the level of co-creation during service delivery. In particular,
   flawed co-creation promotes internal failure attribution which in turn
   enhances perceived guilt. Our results suggest that in such case customer
   satisfaction is best restored by offering co-created service recovery.

   conflict impact the collection and use of individual competitive
   intelligence (ICI) and how this impacts individual performance. In
   addition, we look at the impact of managerial recognition and autonomy
   on these relationships. Tests across two firms using hierarchical linear
   modeling provide support for the hypothesized relationships. We conclude
   that firms can create an environment which facilitates the collection

AB This research provides an empirical test of the "Twitter effect," which
   postulates that microblogging word of mouth (MWOM) shared through
   Twitter and similar services affects early product adoption behaviors by
   immediately disseminating consumers' post-purchase quality evaluations.
   This is a potentially crucial factor for the success of experiential
   media products and other products whose distribution strategy relies on
   a hyped release. Studying the four million MWOM messages sent via
   Twitter concerning 105 movies on their respective opening weekends, the
   authors find support for the Twitter effect and report evidence of a
   negativity bias. In a follow-up incident study of 600 Twitter users who
   decided not to see a movie based on negative MWOM, the authors shed
   additional light on the Twitter effect by investigating how consumers
   use MWOM information in their decision-making processes and describing
   MWOM's defining characteristics. They use these insights to position
   MWOM in the word-of-mouth landscape, to identify future word-of-mouth
   research opportunities based on this conceptual positioning, and to
   develop managerial implications.

   is known about how an organization can develop strong emotional ties
   with consumers. Our research addresses one aspect of this gap by showing
   that in atmosphere dominant service firms, sense of place leads to place
   attachment, which in turn plays a critical role in driving desirable
   customer behaviors. In Study 1 we demonstrate that sense of place
   influences the strength of consumers' attachment to a service location,
   which ultimately has positive effects on consumers' behaviors. In Study
   2, we identify characteristics that influence the sense of place
   dimensions and extend the model to better account for the dynamics of
   social relationships that develop within a service firm. This research
   provides an initial investigation into how organizations can better
   manage the service place and provides a rich framework for future
   research on managing attachment with service consumers.

   international vision, early internationalizing firms employ a dual
   subsystem of dynamic capabilities: a market subsystem consisting of
   market-focused learning capability and marketing capability, and a
   socio-technical subsystem comprised of network learning capability and
   internally focused learning capability. We argue that innovation
   mediates the proposed relationship between the dynamic capability
   structure and early internationalization. We conduct case studies to
   develop the conceptual framework and test it in a field survey of early
   internationalizing firms from Australia and the United States. Our
   findings indicate a complex interplay of capabilities driving innovation
   and early internationalization. We provide theoretical and practical

AB Qualitative field research based on long depth interviews with
   business-to-business customers who defected from a supplier relationship
   is used to develop an integrated theoretical framework explaining how
   the defection decision process unfolds over time in business-to-business
   relationships. The authors develop a taxonomy of events, both internal
   and external to the relationship, that are proposed to create "defection
   energy," or the motivation to move a customer from relationship status
   quo toward a defection decision. The framework illustrates how these
   internal and external events interact with the organization's and the
   individual decision maker's goals, practices, and values to engage a
   dynamic anchoring and updating mechanism based on accumulated defection
   energy that drives the process toward a decision threshold. The research
   offers marketers insights to improve defection management, including an
   understanding of how organizational and individual customer needs shape
   relationships; that defection decisions build as a result of multiple
   events over time, requiring a longer-term perspective on defection; and
   that defection decisions can be influenced by events outside the core
   product or service delivery process, suggesting that these decisions
   need to be understood within the broader context of the overall

AB This paper presents an eight-firm study, conducted from the
   service-dominant logic perspective, which makes a contribution regarding
   knowledge of the anatomy of value propositions and service innovation.
   The paper suggests that value propositions are configurations of several
   different practices and resources. The paper finds that ten common
   practices, organized in three main aggregates, constitute and fulfill
   value propositions: i.e. provision practices, representational
   practices, and management and organizational practices. Moreover, the
   paper suggests that service innovation can be equated with the creation
   of new value propositions by means of developing existing or creating
   new practices and/or resources, or by means of integrating practices and
   resources in new ways. It identifies four types of service innovation
   (adaptation, resource-based innovation, practice-based innovation, and
   combinative innovation) and three types of service innovation processes
   (practice-based, resource-based, and combinative). The key managerial
   insight provided by the paper is that service innovation must be
   conducted and value propositions must be evaluated from the perspective
   of the customers' value creation, the service that the customer
   experiences. Successful service innovation is not only contingent on
   having the right resources, established methods and practices for
   integrating these resources into attractive value propositions are also
   needed.

   and (3) analyzing these effects for functional versus hedonic and low-

   effects of income on individual price perception and behavior, we

   address different price roles. A survey conducted in Germany and Poland
   reveals several cross-national differences in price-role orientations

   view and data from a survey of 228 firms, this study proposes a model of
   how frequent dynamic capability utilization, assessed through its

   and technological capabilities, as well as how market, technological,
   and competitor turbulence might affect these relationships. The results
   show that frequent sensing and reconfiguring have stronger positive
   effects in environments characterized by high competitor turbulence;
   however, frequent sensing can have negative relationships with marketing

   marketing capabilities are positively associated with firm performance
   in highly competitive environments, whereas technological capabilities
   enhance performance in stable competitive environments.

   stakeholders evaluate IPO issuers. We investigate how a multitude of
   cues influence underwriter prestige and price shortfall. In addition, we
   draw on cue utilization theory and the attention-based view of the firm
   to hypothesize contrasting uses of cues by underwriters and
   institutional investors. An empirical examination of 119 IPOs using 2SLS
   identifies cues that help increase underwriter prestige and reduce price
   shortfall. Furthermore, our estimation reveals important differences
   between the two early stage stakeholders-whereas underwriters rely more
   on intrinsic cues to evaluate the attractiveness of IPO issuers,
   institutional investors rely more on extrinsic cues. These findings have
   important theoretical implications as well as normative implications for
   marketing an IPO issuer in early stages of the IPO process.

   marketing's perceived influence within the firm. We also investigate
   marketing's influence on customer responsiveness, along with three
   distal outcomes: marketing strategy implementation success, relationship
   portfolio effectiveness, and business unit performance. Our findings
   reveal that marketing's influence may actually heighten or diminish,
   depending on the form of marketing capability dispersion. Further, we
   contribute to findings regarding marketing's influence on business unit
   performance. The results provide a new lens for scholars to view and
   measure marketing dispersion and offer guidance to practitioners.

AB Researchers from diverse disciplines have examined the many factors that
   contribute to the influence of published research papers. Such influence
   dynamics are in essence a marketing of science issue. In this paper, we
   propose that in addition to known established, overt drivers of
   influence such as journal, article, author, and Matthew effects, a
   latent factor "citability" influences the eventual impact of a paper.
   Citability is a mid-range latent variable that captures the changing
   relationship of an article to a field. Our analysis using a discretized
   Tobit model with hidden Markov processes suggests that there are two
   states of citability, and these dynamic states determine eventual
   influence of a paper. Prior research in marketing has relied on models
   where the various effects such as author and journal effects are deemed
   static. Unlike ours, these models fail to capture the continuously
   evolving impact dynamics of a paper and the differential effect of the
   various drivers that depend on the latent state a paper is in at any
   given point of time. Our model also captures the impact of uncitedness,
   which other models fail to do. Our model is estimated using articles
   published in seven leading marketing journals during the years
   1996-2003. Findings and implications are discussed.

AB Although research and managerial practice have demonstrated great
   interest in the role of marketing departments within firms and have
   raised repeated concerns that their influence is in sharp decline, prior
   research has not analyzed whether marketing departments are truly losing
   ground. To do so, we build on the work of Homburg et al. (1999), which
   assessed the influence of the marketing department two decades ago.
   Drawing on structurally equivalent data, the results demonstrate that
   the marketing department has indeed lost significant influence.
   Additionally, we analyze which department has benefited from this loss
   of influence. Interestingly, it is the sales department that has gained
   influence, rather than the finance department, as one might assume. We
   also study the performance consequences of the intraorganizational
   distribution of influence among the marketing, sales, R&D, operations,
   and finance departments. Our results are alarming because an influential
   marketing department makes the greatest contribution to company
   performance.

AB Academics and business practitioners increasingly recognize the
   importance of organizational structure in marketing. Yet research
   examining the effects of different organizational structure design
   elements on marketing outcomes remains fragmented and scarce.
   Accordingly, this article seeks to synthesize and extend understanding
   of how firms use their organizational structural elements to achieve
   marketing objectives, and to offer a new perspective of structural
   marketing. In support of this research goal, a cross-disciplinary review
   of organizational structure, its types, and its characteristics, in
   combination with theories relevant to the field of marketing, informs an
   assessment of empirical findings from marketing literature. This
   synthesis introduces the concept of structural marketing; the article
   offers both theoretical tenets and testable propositions in support of
   an initial framework for using organizational structure design elements
   as strategic marketing variables. Illustrative business cases reinforce
   these tenets, conceptual arguments, and managerial insights.

AB Discriminant validity assessment has become a generally accepted
   prerequisite for analyzing relationships between latent variables. For
   variance-based structural equation modeling, such as partial least
   squares, the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the examination of
   cross-loadings are the dominant approaches for evaluating discriminant
   validity. By means of a simulation study, we show that these approaches
   do not reliably detect the lack of discriminant validity in common
   research situations. We therefore propose an alternative approach, based
   on the multitrait-multimethod matrix, to assess discriminant validity:
   the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations. We demonstrate its
   superior performance by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study, in
   which we compare the new approach to the Fornell-Larcker criterion and
   the assessment of (partial) cross-loadings. Finally, we provide
   guidelines on how to handle discriminant validity issues in
   variance-based structural equation modeling.

AB Mainstream marketing's view on markets builds on neoclassical economics.
   By integrating mainstream marketing thinking with the emergent marketing
   literature that acknowledges a set of shortcomings related to the
   neoclassical-based market conceptualization, this paper aims to provide
   a market conceptualization that captures complexity. Grounded on the
   etymology of the word market, we review literature and identify two
   market dimensions: market-as-noun and market-as-verb; and four distinct
   themes: market entities (referring to which actors are involved), market
   representation (regarding how markets are signified), market performing
   (referring to what actions are carried out), and market sense-making
   (concerning how markets emerge and evolve). Each theme has several
   elements. The proposed market conceptualization allows market complexity
   to be addressed by integrating conventional and new market forms. It
   also offers new avenues for research and invites managers to emancipate
   themselves from product-based market thinking, to create subjective
   market definitions and to think in terms of non-predictive strategies.

AB As emerging economies experience unprecedented market and institutional

   marketing challenges: network-based resources (e.g., managerial ties) or
   market-based capabilities? Building on institutional theory, this study
   examines the evolving roles of managerial ties and firm capabilities, as
   well as their interplay, in China. A longitudinal survey of 166 Chinese
   firms reveals that over time, the positive role of ties with the
   government (i.e., political ties) declines, whereas the positive effect
   of ties with the business partners (i.e., business ties) persists;
   marketing capability has a persistent effect, and technology capability
   exerts a stronger impact on performance. Moreover, as market development
   progresses, marketing capability positively interacts with business
   ties, whereas technology capability positively interacts with political
   ties, in fostering performance.

AB Service memberships are commonly used to support consumer relationships,
   yet the mechanisms for consumers' membership decisions are poorly
   understood. This paper develops a model of consumers' decision to modify
   (upgrade or downgrade) a service membership conditional on their
   decision to renew. Bridging insights from relationship marketing and
   consumer behavior, the proposed model conceptualizes how relational
   drivers differentially influence the upgrade/downgrade decision while
   also modeling the effect of transactional, membership and
   socio-demographic variables. The posited hypotheses are tested with a
   multinomial logit model with selection using multi-source (archival and
   survey) consumer-level data related to renewable service memberships in
   a not-for-profit context. Results suggest that modification decisions
   are driven by relational payoffs from ongoing experiences such that
   upgrade decisions evidence a "motivator" effect of consumer trust
   (quadratic), while downgrade decisions indicate a negative influence of
   consumer trust conditional on perceived knowledge. Managerially, the
   study indicates that, while membership modification and renewal are
   disparate decisions with remarkably divergent mechanisms, to examine and
   analyze them as independent decisions is to risk misjudgments about
   their determinants and waste resources in investments that are unlikely
   to yield desired return.

AB The Internet has revolutionized the retailing landscape and how goods
   and services are sold and distributed to consumers. One avenue of
   significant growth in online selling comes from multichannel retailers
   who offer products in stores as well as over the Web. These hybrids may
   leverage their "brick" locations by allowing customers to pick up or
   return orders purchased online at retail stores. This option lets
   Web-based buyers avoid added shipping costs and long package carrier
   lead times, albeit at a cost to retailers. To examine the viability of
   this strategy, we develop a mathematical model that examines the cost
   and value of providing in-store pickup and return. The model is used to
   determine the best subset of brick-and-mortar stores to handle in-store
   pickup and return demand. One of the principal takeaways is that not all
   retail stores should be offering in-store pickups and/or returns. Our
   computational results show optimizing the set of pickup and return
   locations may reduce system cost over baseline marketing policies where
   these services are set up at all or none of a retailer's stores. In
   addition, we show that retailers can significantly improve some consumer
   benefits at little extra cost.

AB Frontline service employees often vary in their delivery of the brand
   promise, leaving service firms with less direct control on other
   stakeholders' brand perceptions. Internal branding efforts have been
   suggested as a way to improve employee performance. With this in mind,
   we develop a two-process model based on identification and
   internalization theories to explain how internally disseminating
   brand-relevant information to frontline employees enhances performance.
   Using multi-source data from the employees, managers, and customers of a
   business-to-business firm in the hospitality industry, we find that
   providing brand-specific information directly to frontline employees
   increases their identification with the brand (as evidenced in
   perceptions of firm authenticity) and enhances their internalization of
   brand values. Additional results suggest that firms should make an extra
   effort to communicate brand-specific information to frontline employees
   if they desire brand-consistent performance that is observable to
   managers and customers alike.

AB Drawing on information processing theory, this study integrates the

   sales research: When do sales team task and relationship conflicts
   influence sales team performance, and what is the underlying process by
   which this occurs? Although there is burgeoning interest in sales
   research at the team level, very few empirical studies have shed light
   on sales team dynamics such as conflict and how they impact sales team
   performance. This study attempts to address this gap by developing a
   mediated moderation model and finds that (a) task and relationship
   conflicts have negative impacts on sales team performance, (b) team
   information exchange and information interpretation/implementation
   mediate the negative relationship between task and relationship
   conflicts and sales team performance, and (c) task and relationship
   conflicts stifle sales team performance when the team makes little use
   of a collaborative conflict handling style because this interactive
   combination (task/relationship conflict-low collaborative conflict
   handling style) hinders team information exchange and
   interpretation/implementation. Implications for conflict management in

AB Composite branding extensions, wherein two existing brands ally
   themselves to create a composite brand name and enter a different
   product category, have become a common way to introduce a new product.
   An important managerial issue is deciding how to position the two brand
   names within the expression to communicate this alliance to consumers.
   Drawing on linguistic theories, this research explores how consumers may
   interpret different composite brand expressions relative to the
   positions of the two brand names in the expressions. We find that the
   brand in the initial position of most expressions is perceived as more
   closely associated with, and more responsible for the extension product
   than the other brand in the alliance. This perceived responsibility is
   also influenced by the perceived relative brand strengths, or the

   few empirical studies have assessed hedonic shopping motivation effects
   in utilitarian shopping environments. Combining a field survey (Study 1)
   with observation using video ethnography (Study 2), our research
   addresses this issue. Our results empirically reveal how, through both
   psychological and behavioral routes, hedonic shopper motivation affects
   purchases in a utilitarian shopping environment, specifically a section
   of a superstore selling predominantly utilitarian products. Hedonic
   shopping motivation is found to induce consumer impulsiveness
   (psychological route) while also encouraging shoppers to stay longer in
   a store (behavioral route), which when combined result in greater
   consumer purchases than either route alone. Additionally we observe a
   moderating effect of co-shopper influences on these two routes.
   Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB This paper examines how odd-ending pricing influences consumption of
   hedonic and utilitarian products. Four studies test the hypothesis that
   the discount image associated with odd-ending prices reduces anticipated
   guilt and provides justification for hedonic consumption - an effect the
   authors label the odd-ending price justification effect (OPJE). Study 1
   reveals people are more likely to choose hedonic over utilitarian
   products when they have odd-ending prices. Study 2 finds that the effect
   of odd-ending prices on hedonic consumption is mediated by guilt
   reduction. Study 3 reveals a boundary condition for the OPJE - purchase
   likelihood of hedonic products increases only when monetary, not
   nonmonetary, guilt is reduced. Study 4 suggests the OPJE operates at an
   unconscious level, as consumers who are made aware of the trivial
   difference between odd- and round-ending prices are no longer influenced
   by odd-ending prices. The theoretical, practical, and research
   implications of these findings are discussed.

   approach, as this methodology has been shown to be particularly
   effective at uncovering the collective cognitive maps on which
   executives' decisions and behaviors are based. Executives identified a

AB Studies have shown that the fit between a sponsoring brand and the

   awareness and image. This research adds the role of sponsor-sponsee
   similarity to the discussion of fit. The authors argue that similarity
   interacts with fit when conditions evoke suspicion or disrupt typical
   inferences regarding sponsorship relationships. Interaction is
   particularly important when the sponsor seeks to develop its image by
   association with a cause, and is also of consequence for the cause in
   terms of its branding. Three studies test sponsorship effects with
   respect to blood donation and cancer prevention organizations. Results
   support the predicted moderated mediation model, showing that similarity
   between a corporate sponsor and a sponsored cause can interact with fit,
   influencing sponsorship evaluations directly and shaping attitudes and
   behavioral intentions toward constituents indirectly. This work reveals
   a counterintuitive effect of similarity for some sponsorship
   relationships.

AB Building on social capital theory, we view the marketing and sales
   interface as a set of inter-group ties and investigate how
   cross-functional relationships may facilitate the development of social
   capital associated with value creation. Our findings suggest that social
   capital embedded in marketing and sales relationships can inhibit a
   firm's performance depending on the characteristics of its customers.
   Our results also demonstrate that managing the marketing and sales
   interface at different levels of customer concentration is critical to
   the success of a firm's performance.

AB Drawing on empowerment theory, this study examines the effect of
   empowering leadership on frontline employees' service-oriented
   citizenship behaviors and the process by which this effect occurs. The
   authors conceptualize empowering leadership at two levels: individual
   level and group level. Using multi- and cross-level modeling based on
   multi-source data (frontline employees and their supervisors) from a
   national automobile dealership at two different time points, this study
   finds that group-level empowering leadership explains unique variance in
   service-oriented citizenship behaviors above and beyond what is
   explained by individual-level empowering leadership. Further,
   psychological empowerment and customer learning climate partially
   mediate the empowering leadership-service-oriented citizenship behaviors
   relationship at the individual and group levels, respectively. Finally,
   the results indicate that a climate for customer learning accentuates
   the positive effect of psychological empowerment on service-oriented
   citizenship behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications for
   improving frontline employee's service-oriented citizenship behaviors
   are discussed along with directions for future research.

AB Item response modeling (IRM/IRT) has been known to marketing scholars
   for a number of years. However, with the exception of some notable and
   important applications in international (cross-cultural) marketing and
   consumer behavior, even a cursory reading of marketing journals reveals
   a general lack of interest in applying IRM, despite its ability to
   provide highly useful measurement-related information. To address and
   hopefully remedy the paucity of adoption, we offer an
   application-oriented discussion of the utility of IRM for marketing and
   related business research to enable researchers to utilize the strengths
   and realize the benefits of this methodology in their empirical work.
   After a short discussion of the history of IRM, we focus on its
   fundamentals within a modern statistical framework based on the
   generalized linear model and closely related non-linear factor analysis.
   We then engage major concepts of IRM, including item characteristic
   curve, local independence, and dimensionality, as well as parameter
   estimation and information functions. The popular one-and two-parameter
   logistic models are next discussed, as is the issue of model selection.
   Several polytomous item response models are subsequently dealt with,
   followed by a discussion of multidimensional IRM and data illustrations
   of item response models using widely available software. References to
   exemplar marketing applications are provided along the way, and a
   discussion of limitations of IRM concludes the article.

AB The incentive dilemma refers to a situation in which incentives are
   offered but do not work as intended. The authors suggest that, in an
   interorganizational context, whether a principal-provided incentive
   works is a function of how it is evaluated by an agent: for its
   contribution to the agent's bottom line (instrumental evaluation) and
   for the extent it is strategically aligned with the agent's direction
   (congruence evaluation). To further understand when incentives work, the
   influence of two key contextual variables-industry volatility and
   dependence-are examined. A field study featuring 57 semi-structured
   depth interviews and 386 responses from twin surveys in the information
   technology and brewing industries provide data for hypothesis testing.
   When and whether incentives work is demonstrated by certain conditions
   under which the agent's evaluation of an incentive has positive or
   negative effects on its compliance and active representation. Further,
   some outcomes are reversed in the high volatility condition.

AB Extant research provides valuable knowledge about how firms can satisfy
   their customers. However, it is unclear how customers themselves
   contribute to their satisfaction. From a basis in the job
   demands-resources model, the authors propose a customer
   demands-resources model. In this model, customer demands (negative
   customer behaviors) and customer resources (positive customer behaviors)
   affect customer satisfaction through frontline employees'
   customer-oriented attitudes and customer-oriented behaviors. Using
   dyadic data from 141 frontline employees and 375 customers, this study
   identifies customer behaviors as an important source of customer
   satisfaction. Customer demands impede frontline employees'
   customer-oriented attitudes and customer satisfaction through frontline
   employees' emotional exhaustion, whereas customer resources indirectly
   increase customer satisfaction. Customer resources also buffer the
   negative effect of customer demands on frontline employees'
   customer-oriented attitudes.

   capability. In contrast with previous research, which conceptualizes
   marketing capability as the deployment of marketing resources to achieve
   sales, this study conceives marketing capability as the deployment of
   marketing resources to achieve the ultimate objectives of customer
   satisfaction and brand equity (i.e., customer-oriented marketing
   capability [COMC]). Thus, this research disentangles the dynamic
   relationships among marketing resources, sales, customer satisfaction,
   and brand equity through the use of network Data Envelopment Analysis to
   capture COMC. According to what the value relevance perspective
   proposes, COMC positively influences the growth of Tobin's q and
   improves the growth of analysts' recommendations. These findings remain
   robust and consistent with the use of additional measures and methods
   common to the marketing and financial literatures. Our study provides
   tools and a framework for analysis for managers to maximize their
   ability to use marketing strategy to drive performance.

AB Despite the importance of customer value, considerable divergence of
   opinion exists on how to adequately conceptualize and measure this
   construct. In this study, four commonly used methods for measuring
   customer value (i.e., the methods proposed by Dodds et al. (1991), Gale
   (1994), Holbrook (1999) and Woodruff and Gardial (1996)) are compared.
   First and foremost, the psychometric properties of the different methods
   are evaluated. Next, the authors compare the predictive ability of the
   different methods with respect to key outcome variables (i.e.,
   satisfaction, word of mouth, repurchase intention). Finally, the methods
   are compared based on their relative practicality and actionability. The
   authors' findings show that each method has its own benefits and costs
   and should be used based on its suitability for a particular
   application. The paper culminates with a prescriptive flowchart that
   summarizes the main findings and provides direction for choosing the
   optimal value measurement method.

AB Ideally, a product's price should strike a balance between extracting
   value for a firm and sharing some of that value with customers. Charging
   less than what is warranted by a product's value "leaves money on the
   table", but far greater long-run harm to the brand is caused when
   managers charge more than what is justified by the product's benefits.
   This study examines the effect of environmental- and firm-level factors
   on managers' judgment when setting prices. Using data collected from
   brand managers of major consumer goods companies, we found that managers
   are more inclined to charge unjustified prices in environments with less
   intense competition and in business units with a strong technological
   orientation. Brand strength is also positively related to the propensity
   to overprice, but this relationship diminishes as the brand becomes
   stronger.

   methodologies as sophisticated as any in the social sciences, and a
   large and rich literature, opinion and evidence suggest that academic
   marketing is the least influential of the mainstream academic business
   disciplines. Nevertheless, marketing's decline is not inexorable. The
   purpose of this paper is to evaluate this perplexing situation by: (1)
   assembling and evaluating a number of expert opinions from within
   marketing; (2) exploring relations and patterns of influence among the
   leading academic journals in accounting, finance, management, and
   marketing and evaluating the position and influence of each field; (3)
   attempting to understand marketing's problems; and (4) exploring avenues
   to move marketing back to its once prominent position among the business

AB The degree to which the research and development (R&D) department is
   regarded as more important for product innovativeness than is marketing,
   with greater potential to influence innovation decisions, appears
   ambiguous. This study examines how R&D's level of power, relative to
   marketing's, affects product program newness and meaningfulness, and
   thus market and financial performance. Relying on the motive of
   enhancement, this study reveals two underlying mechanisms to explain
   considerations of R&D and marketing depending on R&D's power. A
   multi-informant sample of top executives and subordinates from 229 firms
   indicates distinct effects of R&D's relative power on product program
   newness and meaningfulness. Specifically, R&D power exhibits a positive
   linear relationship with product program newness but a nonlinear effect
   with meaningfulness. To expand market and financial performance, firms
   should seek to generate meaningful product innovations through a
   moderate level of relative R&D power, particularly when their
   environments are characterized by high competitive intensity.

AB We advance a broadened conceptualization of advertising context effects
   by considering how consumer response is influenced by the competitive
   advertising context. This contextual variable reflects how typically or
   atypically advertising tactics are employed by brands in a product
   category. Study 1 demonstrates that employing an advertising tactic that
   is perceived by consumers as atypical in a category undermines its
   influence on brand attitudes. Study 2 shows that this persuasion penalty
   is circumvented by innovative brands through a phenomenon we refer to as
   advertising flexibility that enables innovative brands to successfully
   employ advertising tactics under a wider range of conditions than
   non-innovative brands. A final study provides process evidence for this
   effect by showing that brand attitudes are determined by advertising

   matches the spoken language-can enhance advertising effectiveness for
   television commercials on normal viewing audiences outside of
   foreign-language or deaf-viewer contexts. A preliminary eye-tracker
   study shows that same-language subtitles capture disproportionate visual
   attention, and a first study highlights that same-language commercial
   subtitles can increase brand recall and memory of other verbal ad
   information. Three further studies using 12 additional ads reinforce the
   positive effects of subtitles and show how same-language subtitle
   effectiveness varies with changes in visual and verbal ad complexity. In
   addition to showing how subtitles can increase behavioral intent,
   results also highlight how varying subtitle content affects memory gains
   and illustrate how subtitles can lead to negative effects in the
   uncommon situation that brand information is missing from the audio. As
   the efficacy of television advertising becomes increasingly debated,
   same-language subtitling is a simple way to boost advertising
   effectiveness.

AB Customer satisfaction is generally acknowledged as a key determinant of
   the value a customer contributes to a firm. Following the widespread
   recognition that the relationship is nonlinear and possibly even
   asymmetric, the authors develop a framework for understanding and
   predicting functional differences across consumers and situations. The
   resultant conceptualization proposes two general categories of
   moderating factors: Type I moderators, which induce functional changes
   by impacting the underlying comparison standards employed in the CS
   formation process, and Type II moderators, which cause the function to
   change by altering the interplay of cognitive and affective modes of the
   satisfaction experience. The authors employ firm reputation as an
   example of a Type I moderation and customer involvement as an example of
   a Type II moderation to illustrate differences between these types of
   moderation and to highlight how exactly each type of moderation changes
   the functional nature of the focal relationship. Specifically, a firm
   with a strong reputation benefits from a broader zone of tolerance than
   a firm of minor reputation, and highly involved customers react more
   intensively to extreme changes in satisfaction than do low involvement
   consumers.

AB Firms' spending on R&D, advertising, and inventory holding affect firm
   performance, which in turn affects future spending in each of these
   three areas. Effective allocation of resources across R&D, advertising,
   and inventory holding is challenging since an understanding of their
   dynamic inter-relationships is necessary. Past research has not examined
   these spending issues simultaneously. We estimate inter-relationships
   among the effects of firms' R&D spending, advertising spending, and
   inventory holding on sales and firm value (as measured by its Tobin's Q)
   using a vector auto regression model of a panel of publicly listed U.S.
   high technology manufacturing firms. Insights from the computation of
   long-term effects indicate that advertising spending and inventory
   holding increase sales, while R&D spending does not, and advertising and
   R&D spending increase firm value, while inventory holding does not. In
   addition, firm spending in all three functions is positively affected by
   sales but negatively by firm value. We discuss the implications of the
   study for marketing literature and managerial practice.

AB Drawing on social exchange theory, this study develops a longitudinal
   theoretical framework of supplier participation in buyers' new product
   development (NPD) activities. The study focuses on the longitudinal
   temporal dynamics of supplier involvement in buyers' new product
   development and postulates that working relations and inter-dependence
   impact suppliers' attitudes toward co-innovation and suppliers'
   co-innovation behaviors. Applying this framework to a 10-year
   longitudinal dataset from the North American automotive industry, the
   drivers of the escalation of supplier involvement in buyers' NPD over
   time and the effect of this involvement on innovation performance, buyer
   sales performance, and supplier sales performance are identified. The
   results indicate that buyer-supplier communication, suppliers'
   anticipated long-term returns, suppliers' trust of a buyer, and
   supplier-buyer inter-dependence all play a significant role in changing
   supplier attitudes toward co-innovation and supplier involvement in a
   buyer's NPD. Further, the study also shows that supplier involvement in
   buyer new product development is mutually beneficial for both the buyer
   and the supplier as it increases performance of both parties.
   Performance returns are actually greater for suppliers than for buyers.
   As such, this study contributes to both relationship management and new
   product development literature streams, as well as providing practical
   direction to manufacturers as to how they can increase suppliers'
   involvement in their NPD to benefit both parties.

AB As customers' repurchase behavior leads to long-term corporate
   profitability, managers should know the success factors influencing
   repurchase intent. Knowledge of gender differences in these success
   factors would enable managers to separately optimize repurchase intent
   for men and women. This research thus develops original hypotheses on
   gender differences in the formation of repurchase intent. Based on
   hierarchical linear modeling of data from five countries and ten
   industries, this research finds that public brand image more strongly
   influences customer satisfaction and repurchase intent for women than
   for men. Perceived value has a weaker effect on repurchase intent for
   women than for men. The analyses do not detect any gender difference in
   the influence of customer satisfaction on repurchase intent. Contrary to
   conventional wisdom, relational switching costs more strongly influence
   repurchase intent for men than for women. Further analyses illustrate
   moderating effects of country differences in gender egalitarianism and
   of contextual differences between products and services.

AB This article presents a meta-analysis of the antecedents of buyers'
   perceived switching costs and switching. The authors synthesize results
   from 170 independent samples in 152 manuscripts and test several
   moderator effects and a causal meta-analytic model. The major findings
   are as follows: (1) Of all antecedents, market-related variables (i.e.,
   alternatives and competition) have the strongest influence on switching
   costs; they reduce these costs via affecting buyers' quality perception
   of a relationship and offerings. Firm-related variables (e.g., seller
   investments) play a minor role as a driver of switching costs and
   switching, indicating a limited influence of firms' activities on
   switching costs. (2) Switching costs have only a weak negative influence
   on switching. (3) A moderator analysis reveals that most of the effects
   are context specific. For instance, services (versus goods) decrease and
   B2C (versus B2B) settings increase the relationship between antecedents
   and switching costs. Further, the moderating influence of year and
   culture indicate fundamental market changes and variations across
   countries. The study provides several implications for relationship
   research and management.

AB The valuation of extension rights is critical for entertainment brands
   such as bestseller books. Building on brand extension research, we argue
   that accounting for the reciprocal spillover effect (i.e., the influence
   of an extension product on a parent brand) is important for determining
   the value of extension rights. We develop a contingency model of the
   reciprocal spillover effect for category extensions of entertainment
   products that are characterized by short life cycles and satiation
   effects. In the discussion of moderating factors, we pay particular
   attention to the new concept of backward integration, which accounts for
   the reaction of a parent to the introduction of an extension. Using data
   from all 446 literature adaptations produced for the big screen and
   theatrically released in North American theaters between 1998 and 2006,
   we provide evidence that extension success and marketing support impact
   the sales of the parent book and for several postulated moderating
   effects, including those of backward integration. Through simulation
   analyses, we demonstrate how considering the reciprocal effect in the
   managerial decision-making process can help entertainment managers to
   avoid biased estimations of category extension rights.

AB Cobranding, the strategy of marketing brands in combination, has
   received increasing attention from academics and practitioners alike.
   This study examines two cobranding decisions facing a firm: the
   cobranding structure and the selection of a partner. Propositions rooted
   in the theories of attribution and categorization posit (a) how the
   levels of cobranding integration, exclusivity, and duration influence
   brand evaluation and consideration and (b) how consistency with the
   partner brand in hedonic attributes, complementarity in functional
   attributes, and brand breadth moderate the effect of partnership
   structure. Higher integration or longer duration likely has a greater
   impact on evaluation and consideration; an exclusive arrangement has a
   greater effect on evaluation but lowers consideration. For managers,
   these propositions are directly applicable; the outcomes of brand
   evaluation and consideration map onto the strategic goals of brand
   development and market development, respectively.

   develops and supports a framework suggesting that firms with positive
   changes in customer satisfaction are more attractive to transient

   We also find that the impact of customer satisfaction on transient
   institutional investor holdings is contingent upon firm intangible asset
   intensity, product-market demand uncertainty, and financial market
   volatility. In addition, transient institutional investor holdings at
   least partially mediate the effects of changes in customer satisfaction
   on firm abnormal return and idiosyncratic risk. Thus, transient
   institutional investor investments represent a mechanism through which
   customer satisfaction affects firm value.

AB Prior research on impulse buying focuses mostly on goods, ignoring its
   incidence in services despite growing evidence about the prevalence of
   impulsive behaviors across diverse consumption contexts. This paper
   introduces an integrative conceptual framework to study impulse buying
   in both goods and services by using perceived risk as a focal construct
   in the impulse buying process and reports findings from two empirical
   studies. The first study uses a mall-intercept survey to show that
   perceived risk is lower and likelihood of impulse buying is greater for
   services with higher tangible (vs. intangible) attributes and higher
   search (vs. experience and credence) properties. The second study uses a
   lab-experiment to show significant differences in the influence of three
   relevant consumer traits (consumer impulsiveness, optimum stimulation
   level, and self-monitoring) on the level of perceived risk and
   impulsiveness in purchase decisions for six different services with
   varying levels of attributes (tangible vs. intangible) and evaluation
   properties (search, experience, and credence). Overall, the two studies
   provide substantial evidence of the presence of impulse buying in
   services and useful insights for researchers and services marketers.

   certain benefits to the salesperson, they may also have a dark side.
   This research examines the impact of number product lines handled by the
   salespeople on their performance, role stress, and job satisfaction.
   Based on role and schema theories, we test a series of curvilinear and
   conditional effects, using data collected from salespeople across
   multiple industries. Our analysis indicates non-linear relationships
   between number of product lines handled by the salesperson and
   salesperson performance and role stress. Further, these relationships
   are contingent on the complexity of products, complementarity of product
   lines, and lines acquired through mergers and acquisitions. These
   results show the complex effects of product lines on the salesperson and
   recognize both the benefits and drawbacks of product line breadth.

AB Our research explores the amplifying effect of materialism on the

   Israeli field study and a U.S. national survey. Our field study assesses
   the moderating impact of materialism upon both traumatic stress and
   maladaptive consumption among participants from an Israeli town under
   terrorist attack vs. participants from an Israeli town not exposed to
   hostilities. Our survey examines the possible underlying processes
   behind these effects among a nationally representative sample of
   Americans. The Israeli study reveals that, when faced with a mortal
   threat such as a terrorist attack, highly materialistic individuals
   report higher levels of post-traumatic stress, compulsive consumption,
   and impulsive buying than their less materialistic counterparts. Our U.
   S. study suggests that these effects are likely due to the fact that
   materialistic individuals exhibit lower levels of self-esteem, which
   reduces their ability to cope with traumatic events. Thus, our results
   indicate that, in addition to its well-documented harmful direct effect
   on psychological well-being, materialism also exerts an indirect
   negative effect by making bad events even worse.

AB Organizational culture is a strategic resource that influences a range
   of activities within firms, and empirical evidence from management and
   marketing demonstrates that it impacts performance. In this study, we
   investigate how organic types of organizational culture (i.e., adhocracy
   and clan) serve as a strategic resource to influence marketing
   effectiveness and performance in an emerging economy, using an extended
   form of the resource-based view as our theoretical framework. We posit
   that organic cultures, which are relatively dominant in emerging-nation
   firms, serve as antecedents of competitive advantage and superior
   performance. We selected China as the context to test the veracity of
   our model and use multiple informants and archival performance data to
   minimize common method variance. Our results support the proposed model
   and demonstrate that organic cultures impact market responsiveness,
   while confirming the critical roles of market responsiveness and product
   strategy change in producing superior performance. We further
   demonstrate a direct effect between clan culture and product strategy
   change, in addition to its indirect effect. Importantly, our results
   uncover that, although individually either adhocracy or clan culture can
   significantly improve the firm's responsiveness, their combined effect
   does not enhance market responsiveness; that is, their interaction
   yields a negative coefficient. Additionally, the influence of organic
   cultures on market responsiveness varies across different industry
   types. These important differences, along with theoretical contributions
   and managerial implications of our findings, are discussed, and several
   avenues for future research are proposed.

   largely neglecting important interpersonal identification processes at

   from sales managers and salespeople as well as company data on customer
   satisfaction and sales performance, the authors make a first attempt to
   address this neglect by exploring important phenomena of interpersonal
   identification in the sales manager-salesperson dyad. Results show that
   initial increases in the level of identification congruence between
   sales managers and their respective salespeople yield positive
   incremental effects on sales performance and customer satisfaction.
   Findings also show that interpersonal over-identification and
   identification incongruence are negatively related to both outcomes.
   Results demonstrate how sales managers could mitigate these negative
   effects.

   Therefore, it is no surprise that firms seek to build an innovation
   base-a reservoir of inventions, ideas, and discoveries that serve as a
   platform for their innovation efforts. One approach for building an
   innovation base is acquisitions, though extant research reveals an
   equivocal verdict on whether acquisitions influence post-acquisition
   inventions. In this research, the authors focus on type of acquisition,
   acquisition behavior over time, and invention characteristics to
   investigate how acquisition behavior influences post-acquisition
   inventions. Analysis of 352 firms across five industries and 17 years
   reveals that firms who make acquisitions produce a stronger innovation
   base than those who make no acquisitions. Moreover, comparing effects
   across vertical and horizontal acquisitions, results indicate that the
   acquiring firm's knowledge breadth plays an important role in
   determining which type of acquisition behavior generates the strongest
   influence on a firm's innovation base.

AB We present a two-sided matching framework to investigate the entry-level
   marketing assistant professor job market. Under this framework,
   candidates' and departments' decisions to mutually choose one another
   are driven by the matching value produced by the pair, which is in turn
   determined by observable department brand cues and candidates' human
   brand cues such as field of research, research productivity, and ranking
   status. Our results suggest that matches between candidates and faculty
   trained in the same field do not always generate the highest matching
   value. Candidates' publications in top marketing journals enhance their
   likelihood of matching with research-oriented hiring departments, and
   this effect is moderated by their field of research. In general, the
   ranking status of candidates boosts their chance of being matched with
   research-oriented hiring departments. However, this effect differs
   across fields, and it also interacts with candidates' own research
   productivity. In particular, publications by candidates from top-ranked
   degree-granting departments are taken as three to four times more
   valuable by research-oriented hiring departments. Our work extends the

AB Inertia reflects a firm's inability to change or innovate and may be
   fostered by many sources. Though researchers have focused on internal
   inertia factors, we examine inertia factors within a firm's customer
   base: switching costs, customer preference stability, and network
   externalities. New products at 279 firms are examined to assess the role
   of these demand-side inertia factors in determining innovativeness and,
   ultimately, financial performance. The inertia factors are hypothesized
   to have differential innovativeness effects for early and late entrants.
   Overall, demand-side factors affect innovativeness positively,
   contrasting with firm-based factors (e.g., routines or assets), which
   typically inhibit innovativeness. Consumer preference stability is the
   only factor negatively related to innovativeness, though only for early
   entrants. Network externalities and switching costs increase
   innovativeness (particularly for early entrants). Demand-side inertia
   factors are critical determinants of innovativeness and may now be
   placed within the previously internally focused set of factors
   engendering early mover advantage.

AB Referral reward programs have been shown in past research to stimulate
   referrals and also to contribute positively to customer lifetime value
   and firms' profitability. In this paper we examine whether, how, and
   under what conditions providing a reward for a referral affects
   receivers' responses to the referral. Based on a multiple motives
   inference framework, we propose that rewards adversely affect responses
   because they lead receiving consumers to infer ulterior motives for the
   referral. Using experiments and a survey, we find support for this
   hypothesis and show that this effect is stronger for unsolicited and
   weak tie referrals. We also demonstrate that rewarding both the referral
   provider and receiver or providing symbolic rewards can eliminate the
   negative effect of rewarded referrals. The paper makes conceptual
   contributions to the literature on referral reward programs,
   word-of-mouth, and motive inferences. The work has implications for
   managers considering ways to construct referral programs and design
   marketing activities to increase referrals.

AB We examine social- and self-motives as drivers of Word of Mouth (WOM).
   The main proposition is that the transmitter expects to gain personal
   and social benefits from sharing his opinion about a brand. The gains
   are in the form of expected satisfaction of self- and social-needs. In
   the research model, self-needs (i.e., self-enhancement and
   self-affirmation) are considered the initial driver of WOM. The desire
   for their satisfaction through WOM results in an intended social
   interaction, which in turn triggers social-motives: social-needs (i.e.,
   social comparison and social bonding) and social-intentions (i.e.,
   helping others and providing social information). WOM is the outcome of
   the intention to engage in a social interaction that is initiated by the
   intention to satisfy self-needs. Through an empirical analysis, we
   examine how the underlying mechanism varies for positive and negative
   WOM. Positive WOM is motivated primarily by the need for
   self-enhancement, and negative WOM is motivated by the need for
   self-affirmation. The need for social comparison affects both valences
   of WOM, the need for social bonding affects only positive WOM, and
   intention to help others and share social information affect only
   negative WOM. The findings suggest that discussing brands can be a
   mechanism for acquiring personal and social benefits, and consequently,
   promotional campaigns should highlight the gains customers accrue
   through WOM.

AB Movies are experiential products that include a myriad of cultural cues,
   and their box office performance varies across countries with different
   cultural backgrounds. The profusion of studies on the motion picture
   industry notwithstanding, this aspect has been largely ignored in the
   literature. Drawing on signaling theory, this study examines how a
   country's cultural fabric moderates the impact of movie-related signals
   on the opening weekend box office performance. We test our hypotheses
   using a multilevel model and a comprehensive dataset of 1,116 movies
   released in 27 countries between 2007 and 2011. Results reveal that the
   impact of star power on box office performance is amplified in high
   uncertainty avoidance and indulgent cultures, while it is attenuated in
   high power distance cultures. Moreover, the positive relationship
   between sequels and performance wanes in individualist cultures. Movies
   with high production budgets perform better in culturally open
   countries, while critics' reviews are more instrumental in high
   uncertainty avoidance cultures.

AB The viability of online dynamic pricing, or differential pricing for the
   same product from the same seller, is still debatable given the
   contradictory findings reported in both modeling and behavioral price
   research. This paper examines tactical ways for online merchants to
   mitigate consumers' negative reactions when adopting dynamic pricing
   strategies. In three experiments, we show that using various
   price-framing tactics, compared to no framing, can induce
   price-disadvantaged consumers to perceive their ostensibly similar
   transactions differently relative to their comparative other parties. As
   the degree of perceived transaction dissimilarity increases,
   price-disadvantaged consumers' perceived price fairness, trust, and
   repurchase intentions are enhanced. We further compare different price
   framing tactics and demonstrate that they have different effects on
   consumers across different product price levels, customer segments, and
   framing formats. The paper concludes with theoretical and managerial
   implications of the research.

AB This study examines how frontline service employees (FSEs) can learn
   from recovery services and improve their performance accordingly. While
   research recognizes that FSEs can fulfill an innovation role by sourcing
   customer knowledge and developing ideas for performance improvement, it
   remains unclear whether such a role benefits or impairs the FSE's
   primary recovery service role of providing efficient and thorough
   solutions to customer problems. This research models both FSE roles and
   explores under which conditions it is beneficial for FSEs to engage in
   an additional innovation role. The model is tested using survey and
   objective data from 134 FSEs. PLS results reveal that the innovation
   role is detrimental because sourcing knowledge from customers takes time
   and effort, but also beneficial because knowledge sourcing triggers FSEs
   to develop ideas for improvement, which positively influence their
   recovery speed and recovery quality. Managers can strengthen these
   positive effects of knowledge sourcing by optimizing an FSE's service
   portfolio (i.e., the combination of products, customers, and failures an
   employee is responsible for), which leverages the effects of knowledge
   sourcing on ideas for improvement.

   use across business suppliers, retailers, and consumers. After
   developing and validating social media usage measures at three
   levels-supplier, retailer, and customer-the authors test social media
   contagion effects and their ultimate impact on multiple performance
   measures. The conceptual framework and empirical results offer new
   insights into the contagion effects of social media usage across the
   channel of distribution as well as important social influence mechanisms
   that enhance these effects. Consistent with the predictions, social
   media use positively contributes to brand performance, retailer
   performance, and consumer-retailer loyalty. Also, the effect of supplier
   social media usage on retailer social media usage and in turn on
   customer social media usage is moderated by brand reputation and service
   ambidexterity. With the ever-increasing growth and adoption of social
   media applications and similar technologies, this research provides a
   framework to promote usage by supply channel partners which ultimately

AB Multi-unit franchisees (MUFees; i.e., franchisees that operate more than
   one outlet within a franchise system) represent a pervasive and even
   dominant form of franchise ownership in many sectors. However, much of
   the franchising literature has been developed with a focus on
   single-unit franchisees (SUFees). The goals of this article are to
   introspectively compare MUFees and SUFees in terms of (1) the factors
   franchisees consider important when initially buying a franchise, (2)
   how these considerations change when SUFees become MUFees, and (3) how
   SUFees and MUFees characterize their relationships with their
   franchisors in terms of relational constructs. Our data reveal
   significant differences between these two groups in terms of purchase
   motivations as well as relational sentiments. Importantly, franchisor
   preferences for multi-unit franchising notwithstanding, it is the SUFees
   that characterize their dyadic relationships with their franchisors as
   more relational as compared to their MUFees counterparts.

AB Country-of-origin (COO) research typically regards COO cue usage as a
   conscious and controlled process dependent on consumers' intention to
   use COO information. However, emerging evidence indicates that country
   stereotypes can affect consumers' brand evaluations regardless of
   intention. In three complementary experiments, this study investigates
   how the mere presence of country cues can trigger different kinds of
   country stereotypes (functional vs. emotional) which subsequently
   automatically influence consumers' cognitive and affective brand
   evaluations as well as brand-related behavior. Findings confirm the
   automatic influence of country stereotypes and suggest that brand
   evaluations and brand-related behavior are enhanced when the underlying
   country stereotype matches the advertising execution format. On the
   other hand, mismatches can result in adverse effects. A follow-up study
   further reveals that cognitive and affective brand evaluations mediate
   COO effects on brand-related behavior. Theoretical and managerial
   implications of the findings are considered and future research

AB While customer management has become a top priority for practitioners
   and academics, little is known about how managers actually make customer
   management decisions. Our study addresses this gap and uses the adaptive
   decision maker as well as the fast and frugal heuristics frameworks to
   gain a better understanding of managerial decision making. Using the
   process-tracing tool MouselabWEB, we presented sales managers in retail
   banking with three typical customer management prediction tasks. The
   results show that a majority of managers in this study are adaptive in
   their decision making and that some managers use fast and frugal
   heuristics. Usage of adaptive decision making seems to be mainly driven
   by low objective task difficulty, the use of fast and frugal heuristics
   by experience. While adaptive decision making does not impact predictive
   accuracy, usage of fast and frugal heuristics is associated with
   proportionally greater use of high predictive quality cues and a
   significant increase in accuracy. Hence, the existing skepticism
   concerning heuristics should be questioned.

AB This research examines whether preference for certain price
   presentations observed in past research could be explained by either
   consumers' math anxiety or their math abilities. Previous research
   suggests that math anxiety not only increases tendencies to make
   computational errors but also influences cognitive abilities to make
   numerical judgments. In four studies we document an effect of math
   anxiety whereby price promotions, whose net prices are simply derived,
   like those in a dollars-off format, were preferred over a competing
   percentage-off format. We explain this effect in terms of consumers'
   inability to expend cognitive resources due to their math anxiety rather
   than their math ability. We also identify a boundary condition with such
   effects of math anxiety occurring when price information is presented in
   a computationally complex manner and when consumers are making important
   product judgments.

AB In recent years, firms have invested considerably in programs to raise
   their innovativeness by inspiring employees with an innovation-oriented
   corporate culture. However, extant literature is inconclusive on how an
   innovation-oriented culture leads to increases in product program
   innovativeness (PPI). This study investigates this question by analyzing
   a multilayer model of innovation-oriented corporate culture, using data
   from three different informants: marketing managers, R&D managers, and
   customers. The effects of innovation-oriented values and norms on PPI
   are fully mediated by cultural artifacts. Therefore, values and norms
   must be transformed into specific artifacts to exert an influence on
   innovativeness. Furthermore, market dynamism and technological
   turbulence have opposite moderating effects on the relationship between
   innovation-oriented artifacts and PPI. Market dynamism weakens this
   relationship, whereas technological turbulence strengthens it.

AB Marketing strategists should create, maintain, and arrest the decay of
   causally ambiguous resource competences that lead to competitiveness and
   thus performance. However, competence causal ambiguity, which helps
   create competitiveness, is also implicated in competitiveness decay. In
   this study we test a model of specialization-competitiveness-performance
   using primary and secondary data from 169 public respondents/firms, to
   examine the effects of negative internal barriers to replication and
   adaptation. These barriers develop due to resource lock-in arising from
   the same specialization processes that lead to the positive barriers to
   imitation that deter competitors. Results suggest that commitment to
   learning can mitigate resource lock-in problems with internal competence
   causal ambiguity, competence causal ambiguity among competitors appears
   more essential to competitiveness in more competitive markets,
   competitiveness positively relates to both shareholder value and new
   product performance, and an increased differential focus on marketing
   versus operations in the organization strengthens the positive bridge
   between organizational competitiveness and shareholder return.

AB Purchase likelihood typically declines as the length of time since the
   customer's previous purchase ("recency") increases. As a result, firms
   face a "recency trap," whereby recency increases for customers who do
   not purchase in a given period, making it even less likely they will
   purchase in the next period. Eventually the customer is effectively lost
   to the firm. We develop and illustrate a modeling approach to target a
   firm's marketing efforts, keeping in mind the customer's recency state.
   This requires an empirical model that predicts purchase likelihood as a
   function of recency and marketing, and a dynamic optimization that
   prescribes the most profitable way to target customers. In our
   application we find that customers' purchase likelihoods as well as
   response to marketing depend on recency. These results are used to show
   that the targeting of email and direct mail should depend on the
   customer's recency and that the optimal decision policy enables the
   average high recency customer, who currently is virtually worthless to
   the firm, to become profitable.

AB Many service interactions require customers to actively participate, yet
   customers often do not participate at levels that optimize their
   outcomes, particularly in health care. To gain insight into how
   customers shape a service experience with highly uncertain outcomes, we
   construct a model on the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions.
   The model is used to empirically assess how situation-specific emotions
   and customer participation during a health care service experience
   affect perceptions of the service provider. The model is tested using
   data from 190 medical clinic customers. Consistent with theory, results
   reveal that as customers' relative affect levels become more positive,
   levels of participation increase as well. In turn, higher levels of
   positivity and participation improve customer perceptions of the quality
   of the service provider and satisfaction with the co-produced service
   experience. Implications of this research focus managers on designing
   services to help clients manage their emotions in ways that facilitate
   positivity and participation and thus improve service perceptions.

AB This paper inductively develops an extension to brand positioning theory
   to understand how individuals seeking work in established organizational
   fields can effectively position themselves. It does so by analyzing
   qualitative data on the practices of people in one job category (fashion
   models) in an established organizational field (fashion), examining them
   through the lens of concepts adapted from work by Pierre Bourdieu. Four
   brand positioning practices are identified as relevant for models vying
   for work in the fashion field: crafting a portfolio, cultivating and
   demonstrating upward affiliations, complying with occupation-specific
   behavioral expectations, and conveying field-conforming tastes. Drawing
   on Bourdieu, we argue more generally that person brand positioning
   within established organizational fields happens through processes that
   help to portray a person as having field-specific social and cultural
   capital that allows them to "stand out," while acquiring the habitus
   that allows them to comply with field- and occupation-specific
   expectations in order to "fit in." Standing out and fitting in have
   parallels with-but are not identical to-the processes of establishing
   and reinforcing points of differentiation and points of parity for
   product brands. Our study implies that scholars interested in person
   branding should further develop theories that illuminate variations in
   brand positioning practices between products and persons. It also
   suggests that people building person brands should be sensitized to the
   valued forms of capital and normative expectations in their field that
   enable them to stand out while fitting in.

AB Growing concern about the sustainability of the natural environment is
   rapidly transforming the competitive landscape and forcing companies to
   explore the costs and benefits of "greening" their marketing mix. We
   develop and test a theoretical model that predicts (1) the role of green
   marketing programs in influencing firm performance, (2) the impact of
   slack resources and top management risk aversion on the deployment of
   such programs, and (3) the conditioning effects that underpin these
   relationships. Our analyses show that green marketing programs are being
   implemented by firms, and we find evidence of significant performance
   payoffs. Specifically the results indicate that green product and
   distribution programs positively affect firms' product-market
   performance, while green pricing and promotion practices are directly
   positively related to firms' return on assets. In addition,
   industry-level environmental reputation moderates the links between
   green marketing program components and firms' product-market and
   financial performance. Finally, we find that slack resources and top
   management risk aversion are independently conducive to the adoption of
   green marketing programs-but operate as substitutes for each other.

AB Despite widespread pro-green attitudes, consumers frequently purchase
   non-green alternatives. One possible explanation for this value-action
   gap is the tradeoffs that green products often force on their users:
   higher prices, lower quality, and/or reduced performance. The current
   study uses conjoint analysis to uncover the attribute preferences of car
   and TV buyers when green attributes are negatively correlated with
   conventional attributes. These attribute preferences are then used to
   predict choice among sets of green and less green alternatives currently
   sold in the marketplace. Strong preferences for green products are found
   when tradeoffs are not apparent, but preference shifts significantly to
   less green compromise alternatives when the actual attribute tradeoffs
   are considered. Although general preference is reduced by tradeoffs, a
   green product offering some compensatory advantage on a conventional
   attribute does attract a broader spectrum of consumers, while only "dark
   green" consumers are willing to pay the price to go green when the
   product offers few compensatory qualities. In all cases, however,
   predicted buyers of the greenest technologies offset some of their
   environmental benefits by choosing more energy-thirsty specifications on
   negatively correlated conventional attributes. Managerial and public
   policy implications of the findings are then discussed.

AB The interaction between market orientation and facets of the environment
   is theoretically compelling and is hence the primary interaction studied
   in market orientation literature. Yet empirical literature offers mixed
   findings regarding these interaction effects. We suggest that these
   mixed findings may result from the failure of extant research to control
   for unobserved heterogeneity that may mask the true relationships among
   market orientation, facets of the environment, and firm outcomes. Such
   unobserved heterogeneity might arise due to presence of higher order
   (e.g., three-way, four-way) moderators (e.g., firm size and
   innovativeness). To illustrate our assertions on unobserved
   heterogeneity and the role of firm size and innovativeness, we present
   two studies that use firm performance or new product performance as the
   outcome variable; the studies (1) include market orientation, two facets
   of the environment (technological turbulence and market dynamism), and
   the interactions between market orientation and facets of the
   environment as explanatory variables, (2) employ finite mixture
   regression models to estimate the relationships of interest while
   explicitly accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in the form of latent
   regimes (segments), and (3) use firm size and innovativeness as
   concomitant profiling variables in the finite mixture model
   specification. The results indicate that disaggregate models (i.e.,
   multi-regime solutions) offer the best fit in both studies. The effects
   across the latent regimes differ, demonstrating the possibility of an
   aggregation bias in empirical literature and suggesting the need for
   using disaggregated analyses to study important marketing phenomena. In
   theoretical terms, these results also suggest the possibility of
   developing theories that incorporate unobserved heterogeneity and
   perhaps higher order (e.g., three-way) interaction effects.

AB The extant literature contends that a new product extension's success is
   an increasing function of the parent brand's quality and the degree of
   fit between the parent brand and extension. We develop theory to explore
   relationships between parent quality, image fit and functional fit. Each
   of these components should trigger positive pre-purchase associations
   from the parent. However, at the point of sale, high levels of
   functional fit are expected to increase the probability of substitution
   between parent and extension. To test this and related assertions, we
   augment UPC scanner data with perceptual measures for 42 matched
   parent-extension pairs. Findings confirm that high parent quality
   negatively impacts an extension's sales when functional fit is high.
   Equally telling, low parent quality can actually increase an extension's
   sales in some cases. We use our fitted model to present counter-factual
   experiments to show the magnitude of these increases or decreases under
   combinations of our key variables and extension type, line or brand. The
   combinations we explore occur frequently in-market.

AB Because extant literature on the service logic of marketing is dominated
   by a metaphorical view of value co-creation, the roles of both service
   providers and customers remain analytically unspecified, without a
   theoretically sound foundation for value creation or co-creation. This
   article analyzes value creation and co-creation in service by
   analytically defining the roles of the customer and the firm, as well as
   the scope, locus, and nature of value and value creation. Value creation
   refers to customers' creation of value-in-use; co-creation is a function
   of interaction. Both the firm's and the customer's actions can be
   categorized by spheres (provider, joint, customer), and their
   interactions are either direct or indirect, leading to different forms
   of value creation and co-creation. This conceptualization of value
   creation spheres extends knowledge about how value-in-use emerges and
   how value creation can be managed; it also emphasizes the pivotal role
   of direct interactions for value co-creation opportunities.

AB This paper addresses the question of how an established firm can
   successfully defend its market against current and future competitors.
   Previous studies on this issue are surprisingly scarce and typically
   concentrate on only a single generic defense strategy. Thus, little is
   known about the degree and the manner in which different generic defense
   strategies, such as a deterrence strategy (pursued before competitor
   market entry) and a shakeout strategy (pursued after competitor market
   entry), differ in effectiveness and efficiency and about the
   corresponding role of product and market conditions. As these strategies
   tend to be costly, an established firm must decide which of these
   strategies to focus its scarce resources on. Drawing on evolutionary
   game theory and an empirical calibration and validation study, this
   paper seeks to fill these research gaps. While both strategies turn out
   to be viable options for market defense, the authors find that in
   general, a shakeout strategy tends to be superior to a deterrence
   strategy. However, the authors also identify product and market
   conditions under which an established firm is better off focusing on a
   deterrence strategy. In methodological respects, the paper contributes
   to the marketing discipline by introducing evolutionary game theory,
   which has not been used previously for analyzing marketing issues, as
   well as an evolutionary approach to research on market defense.

AB This study examines the dynamics of consumer-brand identification (CBI)
   and its antecedents in the context of the launch of a new brand. Three
   focal drivers of CBI with a new brand are examined, namely: perceived
   quality (the instrumental driver), self-brand congruity (the symbolic
   driver), and consumer innate innovativeness (a trait-based driver).
   Using longitudinal survey data, the authors find that on average, CBI
   growth trajectories initially rise after the introduction but eventually
   decline, following an inverted-U shape. More importantly, the
   longitudinal effects of the antecedents suggest that CBI can take
   different paths. Consumer innovativeness creates a fleeting
   identification with the brand that dissipates over time. On the other
   hand, company-controlled drivers of CBI-such as brand positioning-can
   contribute to the build-up of deep-structure CBI that grows stronger
   over time. Based on these findings, the authors offer normative
   guidelines to managers on consumer-brand relationship investment.

AB Considerable research explores advertising's role in influencing
   consumer perceptions and behavior. However, advertising's impact on
   another key audience-the sales force-has been largely overlooked.
   Drawing from social identity and expectancy theories, and using survey
   and objective performance data across multiple wholesalers, the authors
   demonstrate that a salesperson's perception of brand advertising has a
   significant effect on salesperson effort and performance by positively
   influencing the extent to which the salesperson identifies with the
   brand and his or her expectancy that such effort will generate results.
   These effects are moderated by internal communications and brand size.
   Model results suggest that advertising's role may extend beyond "pull"
   to "push" by motivating salespeople to exert more effort on behalf of a
   brand. As a result, firms should take steps to proactively manage
   salesperson perceptions of brand advertising while also considering this
   dual role when assessing advertising effectiveness and efficiency.

   performance-as consequences of a sales team's customer knowledge

   managers and sales team members, the authors find general support for

   leadership has a positive effect on a sales team's customer knowledge
   creation capability. However, the results also suggest that the positive
   effect of empowering leadership on a sales team's customer knowledge
   creation capability is mitigated when either outcome interdependence or
   both task and outcome interdependence are high. Further, as outcome
   interdependence and the interaction between task and outcome
   interdependence increases, a sales team's customer knowledge creation
   capability also increases, which suggests that outcome interdependence
   and the combination of task and outcome interdependence replaces the
   role of empowering leadership. The study also finds that the greater a
   sales team's customer knowledge creation capability is, the higher its
   customer relationship performance and sales team financial performance
   will be. Implications for customer knowledge creation in sales teams in
   the presence and absence of empowering leadership are discussed.

AB Cross-selling offers tremendous benefits for both vendors and customers.
   However, up to 75% of all cross-selling initiatives fail, usually for
   sales force-related reasons. Yet prior research has largely ignored the
   role of salespeople in the field of cross-selling. Using a
   motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) framework, this research addresses
   factors that determine a salesperson's cross-selling performance,
   including the predominant role of the selling team as a social
   environment in which individual behavior occurs. A dataset of 231
   industrial salespeople working in 55 teams reveals that 37% of overall
   variation in behavior is caused by differences across teams. The
   team-specific hypotheses, based on social norms and reputation theory,
   are tested with a hierarchical linear modeling approach with matched
   data from three sources. Individual cross-selling motivation has a
   stronger effect when a selling team has strong cross-selling norms, and
   in the specific context of cross-selling, selling team reputation can
   constrain individual behavior that might damage that reputation.
   Salespeople also develop beliefs about the reasons for their team
   reputation, including its cross-selling ability, which can reduce an
   individual salesperson's reputational concerns and hence reinforce
   individual cross-selling behavior. These results have significant
   theoretical and managerial implications.

AB Sales control systems represent an important managerial tool in
   directing the sales force for desired organizational objectives.
   However, the majority of prior sales control research has focused only
   on the main effects of sales control systems without explicitly
   considering their interactive effects and associated intervening
   mechanisms. Drawing on job demands-resources theory, the authors
   theorize differential interactive effects of outcome control, activity
   control, and capability control on job engagement (i.e., adaptive
   selling behavior and selling effort) and job stress (i.e., role
   ambiguity and role conflict), which subsequently affect salesperson
   performance. Empirical results using a sample of industrial salespeople
   find that (1) outcome control and capability control have positive
   interactive effects on adaptive selling behavior and selling effort
   while suppressing role conflict, (2) activity control and capability
   control have a negative interactive effect on role ambiguity, and (3)
   outcome control and activity control have a positive interactive effect
   on selling effort but negative interactive effects on adaptive selling
   behavior and role clarity. These results indicate that sales control
   researchers can benefit from considering the complex interactive effects
   of various control styles as well as the intervening processes, which
   provide a more refined understanding of this important managerial tool.

AB This study explores the generation and use of competitive intelligence
   (CI) within the buyer-seller exchange process and its influence on
   salesperson performance. Using the concept of social capital as a
   theoretical foundation and multilevel data collected at three time
   points from 686 customer-salesperson dyads, the authors empirically test
   a conceptual framework that proposes both antecedents and consequences
   of CI sharing between customer and salesperson. The results of the study
   demonstrate that CI sharing by customers is a function of salesperson
   customer orientation, customer-centric extra-role behaviors, and
   relationship quality. CI sharing translates into increased perceived
   value, share-of-wallet, and profit margins when the salesperson utilizes
   the information to position and differentiate his or her product;
   however this occurs only when the salesperson has strong adaptive
   selling skills. Surprisingly, CI negatively influences these outcomes
   among low-adaptive salespeople, indicating that CI can actually work to
   a firm's disadvantage if the salesperson is not equipped to respond to
   it. These findings suggest that CI must be examined differently than
   general market knowledge and that firms may leverage CI to their
   tactical advantage at the salesperson-customer interface if managed
   effectively.

AB Fostering and maintaining buyer-supplier relationships is a fundamental
   premise of many channel initiatives. Indeed, these relationships may
   culminate in significant performance enhancements and competitive
   advantage. Yet these relationships may also result in competitively
   harmful events such as partner opportunism. Despite this potential
   competitive erosion, there is a lack of studies examining the interplay
   between the drivers and deterrents of opportunism. By building on
   transaction cost economics and social capital theory, we examine, via a
   sample of 400 manufacturing firms in China, how the interplay between
   drivers (relationship-specific investments and behavioral uncertainty)
   and deterrents (inter-firm social capital) of opportunism affect partner
   opportunism in buyer-supplier exchanges. The significance of this
   interplay between the drivers and deterrents sheds new light on how a
   firm can leverage social capital to curb the harmful effects of
   opportunism.

   demonstrate that offer evaluations are less (more) favorable with
   threshold-based free shipping when order value is below (above) the free
   shipping threshold compared to flat rate shipping. However, when an
   alternative more important referent is present, the effect of shipping
   fee structure is attenuated. Second, we show that although perceptions
   of shipping fees as a profit generator are higher (lower) under
   threshold-based free shipping relative to flat rate shipping for order
   values below (above) the free shipping threshold, providing a
   justification for the shipping fee by explicitly linking it to delivery
   costs encourages consumers to view the shipping fee as a cost of doing

AB Managers increasingly seek to develop brand loyalty through sponsorship
   activities, though this relationship has not been solidly established.
   This article models and demonstrates the impact of sponsorship on brand
   loyalty. The studied concepts and relationships emerge from both the
   sponsorship and consumer-brand relationship literature. The experimental
   design relies on before and after measurements and multiple exposures to
   the sponsorship. Thus this study demonstrates that sponsorship exposure
   has a positive impact on brand affect, brand trust, and brand loyalty.
   The change in brand loyalty from before to after sponsorship exposure
   reflects two persuasion processes. First, self-congruity with an event
   enhances brand loyalty through event and brand affect. Second, perceived
   fit between the event and the brand has a positive effect on brand
   affect, through attitude toward the sponsorship, and on brand trust,
   such that it ultimately influences brand loyalty. Brand affect is
   identified as an important mediator of sponsorship effects.

AB While a few researchers have started to chip away at the notion that
   retail density is always negative, extant studies do not empirically
   address the question of why some shoppers respond negatively to a
   specific level of density while others respond positively. We examine
   this issue by drawing upon field theory (Lewin 1939) to shed light on
   how shoppers vary in terms of deeper motives (McClelland 1953) to seek
   control or intimacy with others in retail mall settings, and whether
   these motives influence shopping orientations. Shopping orientation is
   then hypothesized to affect perceptions of crowding, and, in turn,
   subsequent affective responses to the mall shopping experience.
   Moreover, we examine whether individual differences (gender and age) can
   help retailers segment those with different shopping orientations and
   the motives that influence these orientations. We found that task and
   social shopping orientations were influenced by deeper motives for
   control and intimacy. The causal relationships between shopping motive,
   shopping orientation, and consumers' affective responses of stress and
   excitement were also discovered. Finally, we address theoretical and
   managerial implications of our results.

AB Gaining customer loyalty is an important goal of marketing, and loyalty
   programs are intended to help in reaching it. Research on loyalty
   programs suggests that customers differentiate between loyalty to a
   company and loyalty to a loyalty program, yet little is known about the
   consequences of these two types of loyalty. Therefore, our study intends
   to make two main contributions: (1) improving our understanding of the
   constructs "program loyalty" and "company loyalty", (2) investigating
   the relative impact of the two types of loyalty on preference,
   intention, and purchase behavior for the case of a multi-firm loyalty
   program. Results indicate that company loyalty influences a customer's
   choice to visit a particular provider and to prefer it over competitors,
   but it is not a strong predictor of purchase behavior. Conversely,
   program loyalty is a far more important driver of purchase behavior.
   This implies that company loyalty primarily attracts customers to a
   particular provider and program loyalty ensures that once inside the
   store, more money is spent.

   marketing channel for food and kindred products. The variables studied
   include new product introductions, retail selling area, consumer price
   indices, profitability, cost of goods sold and selling expenditures.
   Efficient market explanations do not fare well in the analyses in
   comparison with market power explanations for practically all the
   variables studied. The paper conlcudes with recommendations for

AB Decision making related to finances is of significant importance. A
   major factor underlying financial decision making involves differences
   in consumers' spending self-control (CSSC). We conceptualize CSSC as an
   individual difference, distinct from general self-control, develop a
   parsimonious measure to assess it, and demonstrate important related
   consequences and behaviors. Further, we examine how underlying
   differences in CSSC impact the effectiveness of a self-control strategy
   that has recently received attention in public policy
   legislation-enhancing consumers' awareness of the future consequences of
   present behavior through the provision of outcome elaboration prompts.
   Results from our studies suggest that outcome elaboration prompts (that
   is, external stimuli used to encourage consumers to consider the future
   outcomes of their present decisions) differentially impact consumers'
   self-control effectiveness depending on their inherent CSSC.
   Specifically, the presence of outcome elaboration prompts enhances
   self-control for low CSSC consumers, but does not affect the choices of
   high CSSC consumers. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that it is
   a differential focus on future outcomes that drives the distinct
   responses of high- versus low-CSSC consumers to the provision of outcome
   elaboration prompts.

   the role that color plays in marketing. This paper examines how color
   affects consumer perceptions through a series of four studies. The
   authors provide a framework and empirical evidence that draws on
   research in aesthetics, color psychology, and associative learning to
   map hues onto brand personality dimensions (Study 1), as well as examine
   the roles of saturation and value for amplifying brand personality
   traits (Study 2). The authors also demonstrate how marketers can
   strategically use color to alter brand personality and purchase intent
   (Study 3), and how color influences the likability and familiarity of a
   brand (Study 4). The results underscore the importance of recognizing
   the impact of color in forming consumer brand perceptions.

AB Drawing from research on retailing, online shopping behavior, and

   investigates purchase intentions in online stores of multi-channel
   retailers. The framework simultaneously examines the influence of
   transference of attitude and trust from the multi-channel retailer's
   physical to online stores, image congruence between the multi-channel
   retailer's physical and online stores, and image congruence between the
   multi-channel retailer's online store and a prototypical online store.
   Further, recognizing that several retailers now operate as multi-channel
   retailers in different countries, we examine the influence of cultural
   differences in thought processes (i.e., holistic versus analytic
   thinking) on shoppers' evaluation of online stores of multi-channel
   retailers. Toward this end, we test the framework using data collected
   from respondents in the U.S. (analytic thinkers) and South Korea
   (holistic thinkers). We conclude with a discussion of the findings,
   suggestions for future research, and potential limitations.

AB Both managers and investors are increasingly concerned with the impact
   of advertising spending on shareholder returns. This study investigates
   the analyst-based processes by which advertising may create firm value.
   Using a large longitudinal dataset with 1,052 firms over 20 years, we
   find that firms decreasing from the top 20% to the bottom 20% of
   advertising spending group when compared to all industry competitors
   would experience a drop of abnormal return by 4.08% in 1 year and a
   cumulative total of 81.6% in 20 years. Also, analyst activities
   partially mediate the impact of advertising on firm return and risk.
   These findings indicate that analysts may act to externally validate the
   business logic underlying the advertising expense. The more analysts
   factor in firm advertising spending and reflect it in their earnings
   forecasts, the more likely the benefits of advertising are channeled
   into firm value. The results bridge research interests across marketing,
   accounting, and finance disciplines and help managers understand how
   product and financial markets are united. Main Street could better align
   with Wall Street via corporate disclosure of advertising spending to
   equity analysts.

AB Existing research implicitly assumes that all factors known to influence
   customer satisfaction are likewise important for investor behavior.
   However, if investors do not equally value activities targeting
   different satisfaction drivers, managers focusing on short-term stock
   returns might over- or under-emphasize certain satisfaction drivers to
   the detriment of the long-term success of the firm. Therefore, we extend
   prior research on the value relevance of customer satisfaction by
   assessing the relationship between the dynamics of key satisfaction
   drivers and contemporaneous risk-adjusted stock returns. Moreover, we
   compare three major markets using a dataset covering nearly the entire
   set of car brands sold between 2004 and 2008. Our results show that
   investors react to information related to perceived product quality,
   whereas, surprisingly, the cost of ownership and dealer service quality
   are unimportant despite the importance attributed to them in consumer
   research. Furthermore, we observe that information concerning the U.S.
   market dominates that of the UK and German markets.

AB There is a substantial literature on the product development process but
   comparatively little on the impact of lean launch execution and launch
   timing on new product performance. Given the costs and risks involved in
   product commercialization, this research gap is surprising. Delays in
   product launch can lead to poor channel cooperation and coordination,
   missed market opportunities, and lost competitive opportunities, yet
   timing of the launch has not been included in many reported studies. In
   addition, managers at many firms have prioritized supply chain
   activities such as integration of logistics with other functional areas
   in order to obtain cost efficiencies and accelerate time to market; the
   role of lean launch execution in improving new product performance has
   also received little research attention. In this study, we build a
   conceptual model in which lean launch, launch timing, and quality of
   marketing effort are modeled as precursors to new product performance;
   we assess the role of market orientation and cross-functional
   integration in lean launch execution as well as indirect and direct
   effects of launch timing on performance. We empirically test our model
   with a sample of 183 U.S.-based corporate managers actively involved in
   new product launch. We find evidence that execution of a lean launch and
   effective marketing significantly improve new product performance, and
   that correct launch timing positively moderates the effect of lean
   launch on performance. These variables therefore should be carefully
   considered by managers of new product processes.

AB Many movies are based on best-selling novels. While book adaptation is
   an often used strategy in the motion picture industry, it has received
   little academic attention. Using a multi-method approach, this research
   investigates the drivers behind the success of book-based movies. In
   Study 1, we analyze over 700 movies and find that book-based movies
   perform better at the box office on the opening weekend than non-book
   movies. However, this superior performance dissipates after the opening
   weekend. Further, the opening weekend performance of book-based movies
   is positively driven by book equity, book-movie similarity, and recency
   between the book's peak equity and movie release. After the opening
   weekend, many of these book-related variables cease to have an impact,
   and the effect of movie-related variables (e.g., reviews) increases.
   Because Study 1 documents that book-movie similarity positively impacts
   the movie's performance, contrary to prior findings that content
   similarity has negative or null impact on performance of a movie sequel,
   we undertake a second study to reconcile the discrepancy. Study 2 finds
   that content similarity results in satiation and therefore hampers the
   movie success for sequels; however, when a movie is adapted from a book,
   due to experiential modality change (i.e., from book format to film
   format rather than film to film), content similarity increases the
   movie's chance of success.

AB Do promotions in a certain category lead to higher revenues in other
   categories? If so, to what degree? The answers to these questions are
   highly relevant for retailers that supply products in different
   categories. Empirical findings in studies that consider a limited number
   of categories indicate small promotional cross-category effects. This
   study develops a framework to determine the impact of price promotions
   on category revenues that include interdependencies among a substantial
   number of categories at the category demand level. The own- and
   cross-category demand effects are moderated by variables such as
   promotion intensity, category characteristics (own-category effects),
   and spatial distances between shelf locations (cross-category effects).
   The empirical results based on daily store-level scanner data show that
   approximately half of all price promotions expand own-category revenues,
   especially for categories with deeper supported discounts. There is a
   high probability (61%) that a price promotion affects sales of at least
   one other category. The number of categories affected is not greater
   than two. Moderate evidence supports the existence of cross-promotional
   effects between categories more closely located in a store.

AB Marketers want to encourage constituents to strongly identify with their
   organizations, because organizational identification contributes to
   positive firm outcomes. However, the extant research on organizational
   identity largely has overlooked the fact that an individual's "self"
   actually is a collection of multiple social identities. This study is
   the first to propose and empirically demonstrate that marketers can
   leverage customers' multiple societal roles (e.g., parent,
   environmentalist, professor) to build and reinforce their relationships
   with the firm. Specifically, the research introduces the concept of
   "identity synergy." Identity synergy occurs when individuals'
   involvement with an organization facilitates their pursuit of other
   important social identities. Our study shows that customer perception of
   identity synergy is positively related to identification with an
   organization. Moreover, the study helps explain the process by which
   antecedents of organizational identity (identity affirmation, identity
   support, and value congruence) positively affect customer-firm
   relationships by proposing and testing identity synergy as a mediator
   between these antecedents and organizational identification. The study
   also contributes to our understanding of organizational identity theory
   by introducing the new concept of peer identification, or identification
   with other members of the organization, such as other customers or
   volunteers. The empirical evidence demonstrates identity synergy's role
   in building peer identification, as well as peer identification's role
   in building organizational identification.

AB Customer profitability measurement is an important element in customer
   relationship management and a lever for enhanced marketing
   accountability. Two distinct measurement approaches have emerged in the
   marketing literature: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer
   Profitability Analysis (CPA). Myriad models have been demonstrated
   within these two approaches across industries. However, limited efforts
   have been made to explain when sophisticated CLV or CPA models will be
   most useful. This paper explores the advantages and limitations of
   sophisticated CLV and CPA models and proposes that the degree of
   sophistication deployed when implementing customer profitability
   measurement models is determined by the type of complexity encountered
   in firms' customer environments. This gives rise to a contingency
   framework for customer profitability measurement model selection and
   five research propositions. Additionally, the framework provides design
   and implementation guidance for managers seeking to implement customer
   profitability measurement models for resource allocation purposes.

AB There is a compelling need to improve the relationship between managers
   in marketing and sales departments. This paper argues that one critical
   way of enhancing individual managers' perceptions of relationship
   effectiveness between these departments is to view the issue as a matter
   of justice and suggests that perceived marketing-sales relationship
   effectiveness is positively influenced by managers' perceptions of
   organizational justice. Furthermore, it proposes that interfunctional
   communication has the potential to enhance the proposed positive effects
   of justice and hence needs to be considered and effectively managed when
   looking at marketing-sales relationship effectiveness. Data drawn from a
   survey of 203 marketing and sales managers in 38 consumer packaged goods
   companies are used to empirically test these predictions. The authors
   find that perceived sales-marketing relationship effectiveness is
   influenced by perceptions of distributive, procedural and interactional
   justice. Greater interfunctional communication is found to further
   enhance the positive effects of distributive and procedural justice on
   perceived relationship effectiveness, but it does not contribute to the
   already strong positive effects of interactional justice. Furthermore,
   results reveal important differences in the effects of justice on
   perceived relationship effectiveness across the marketing and sales
   departments.

AB Customer metrics help firms manage their performance and predict
   financial outcomes. While many firms focus on customer satisfaction
   metrics for this purpose, dual-process theories in psychology and
   neuroscience show that customer decisions are based on two processes.
   This suggests that metrics which measure the impulsiveness of purchase
   decisions might effectively complement customer satisfaction metrics. In
   a series of experiments we demonstrate that satisfaction and
   impulsiveness metrics make distinct but strong predictions of consumer
   choices. Satisfaction and impulsiveness influence choice in different
   ways. While impulsiveness relates to choice directly, the
   satisfaction-choice path is mediated by loyalty intention. Moreover this
   relationship is moderated by product involvement such that impulsiveness
   metrics provide a better prediction for low-involvement than for
   high-involvement situations. Finally, a field study of 750 customers of
   101 firms demonstrates these relationships at a firm level, indicating
   that satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics have equally strong but
   distinct relationships with shareholder value. Therefore firms may be
   able to benefit from complementing customer satisfaction metrics with
   customer impulsiveness metrics.

AB This study examines the effects of customer satisfaction on analysts'
   earnings forecast errors. Based on a sample of analysts following
   companies measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI),
   we find that customer satisfaction reduces earnings forecast errors.
   However, analysts respond to changes in customer satisfaction but not to
   the ACSI metric per se. Furthermore, the effects of customer
   satisfaction are asymmetric; for example, analysts are more willing to
   use good news (i.e. an increase in customer satisfaction information)
   than bad news (i.e. a decrease in satisfaction). Similarly, customer
   satisfaction reduces negative deviation more than positive deviation of
   the analysts' forecasts from actual earnings. Furthermore, the effects
   of customer satisfaction depend upon the base level of satisfaction that
   the firm has achieved. Finally, the effects of customer satisfaction on
   analysts' forecast errors differ across firms with volatile satisfaction
   scores and those with stable satisfaction scores. We discuss the
   implications of our results for marketers and participants in financial

AB Generalized structured component analysis has emerged in marketing and

   modeling. A recent simulation study recommends that, in most cases, this
   analysis is preferable to structural equation modeling because it
   outperforms the latter when the model is misspecified. This article
   examines the characteristics of generalized structured component
   analysis and reveals that the surprising previous findings are
   attributable to an incomplete experimental design and an error incurred
   during the software implementation of generalized structured component
   analysis. Simulated data show that generalized structured component
   analysis provides inconsistent estimates. In some instances, model
   misspecification can nearly neutralize this inconsistency, but in others
   it will reinforce the inconsistency. Moreover, generalized structured
   component analysis is hardly suitable for mediation analysis because it
   substantially overestimates the direct effect. Thus, generalized
   structured component analysis cannot be recommended universally over
   structural equation modeling.

   acceptance in their domain. Interestingly, relatively little attention
   has been paid to assessing the use of partial least squares structural
   equation modeling (PLS-SEM) in marketing research-despite its increasing
   popularity in recent years. To fill this gap, we conducted an extensive
   search in the 30 top ranked marketing journals that allowed us to
   identify 204 PLS-SEM applications published in a 30-year period (1981 to
   2010). A critical analysis of these articles addresses, amongst others,
   the following key methodological issues: reasons for using PLS-SEM, data
   and model characteristics, outer and inner model evaluations, and
   reporting. We also give an overview of the interdependencies between
   researchers' choices, identify potential problem areas, and discuss
   their implications. On the basis of our findings, we provide
   comprehensive guidelines to aid researchers in avoiding common pitfalls
   in PLS-SEM use. This study is important for researchers and
   practitioners, as PLS-SEM requires several critical choices that, if not
   made correctly, can lead to improper findings, interpretations, and
   conclusions.

AB Establishing predictive validity of measures is a major concern in
   marketing research. This paper investigates the conditions favoring the
   use of single items versus multi-item scales in terms of predictive
   validity. A series of complementary studies reveals that the predictive
   validity of single items varies considerably across different (concrete)
   constructs and stimuli objects. In an attempt to explain the observed
   instability, a comprehensive simulation study is conducted aimed at
   identifying the influence of different factors on the predictive
   validity of single versus multi-item measures. These include the average
   inter-item correlations in the predictor and criterion constructs, the
   number of items measuring these constructs, as well as the correlation
   patterns of multiple and single items between the predictor and
   criterion constructs. The simulation results show that, undermost
   conditions typically encountered in practical applications, multi-item
   scales clearly outperform single items in terms of predictive validity.
   Only under very specific conditions do single items perform equally well
   as multi-item scales. Therefore, the use of single-item measures in
   empirical research should be approached with caution, and the use of
   such measures should be limited to special circumstances.

   markets. The introduction to the special issue provides an overview of
   international competitiveness, examples of multinational enterprises and
   their indicators of international competitiveness, and a description of
   the 10 articles in the issue. Appropriately, in the spirit of JAMS'
   breadth of coverage, the articles in the issue broadly address
   international competitiveness issues related to the scope of the field
   of international marketing, multinational enterprises, small-medium
   enterprises, culture, exporting, foreign market subsidiaries, and
   offshoring and outsourcing. Naturally, some of the articles span
   multiple areas as well.

AB Constant in the evolution of the business enterprise has been its
   relentless search for competitive advantage. What has been phenomenally
   different about this quest is that it is, increasingly, a global
   landscape that defines the firm's opportunities and challenges. The
   global marketplace has always been dynamic and complex in terms of the
   changes it brings, but the last two decades have been exceptionally
   transformational. In terms of opportunities, firms pursuing
   international customers have never before faced such open markets, rise
   in discretionary income, and modern tools for accessing global markets.
   In terms of challenges, intense competition, complexity of managing
   multiple markets and coordinating marketing strategy, a host of risk
   elements, and the sheer difficulty of managing geographic, cultural, and
   political barriers are among the factors which impede the firm's success
   in global markets. Often, these changes come in the form of radical,
   transformative disruptions. This essay draws attention to major
   disruptions impacting international marketers and provides insights for
   appropriate firm response.

AB Despite the fact that the dominant theories of the internationalization
   of small-medium enterprises (SMEs) prescribe a dynamic and evolutionary
   process for the firm, most of the empirical research on this topic has
   been based on in-depth studies of a few cases, or cross-sectional
   surveys, which cannot capture the dynamic nature of exporting decisions
   that occur over many years. In this study we propose an empirical
   framework for studying the internationalization of SMEs that: (a)
   identifies latent internationalization stages based on multiple
   indicators of the firms' engagement and strategies in foreign markets
   over multiple years, and (b) analyses the firms' movements among these
   latent states over time, as a function of main characteristics of the
   firms and their markets at each point in time.

AB Transaction cost economics (TCE) is probably the most widely accepted
   theory on how firms can gain competitive advantage through efficient
   organization of their economic transactions. However, by focusing on the
   competitive environment in which companies operate, it abstracts from
   the cultural context in which governance decisions are made. We study
   the cultural boundedness of TCE using two seminal cultural theories: the
   political science/sociology framework of Inglehart and the management
   science framework of Hofstede. We use these theories to develop
   (main-effect) hypotheses about the cultural contexts in which TCE has
   higher predictive power as well as (interaction) hypotheses regarding
   particular cultural contexts that may inherently be more inclined than
   others to adopt certain non-market governance modes if the market
   "fails." Hypotheses are tested using a meta-analysis on data collected
   from 128 studies from 12 countries on 3 continents, representing
   governance decisions of 60,926 companies. We find that TCE is a
   universal theory across all cultural contexts. This being said, we find
   that in societies low on power distance and in societies characterized
   by a strong emphasis on secular-rational and self-expression values,
   companies are more strongly guided in their governance decisions by
   economic, transaction-cost considerations than companies in societies
   high on power distance and in countries that are characterized by
   traditional and survival values. Further, TCE's power to predict the
   specific type of non-market governance employed by the firm is
   systematically moderated by the national culture in which the firm
   operates. The power of TCE for predicting hierarchical governance is
   higher in countries that rate high on secular-rational values and on
   uncertainty avoidance and low on long-term orientation, whereas TCE is
   more diagnostic for predicting relational governance in countries high
   on self-expression values and low on power distance and on uncertainty
   avoidance. In sum, our meta-analysis provides support for our thesis
   that to fully understand governance choices made by firms, we need to
   integrate TCE and cultural theory. While managers around the world are
   guided by economic considerations, the cultural context in which they
   operate exerts a substantial-and predictable-contingent effect on their
   governance choices.

AB Increasingly, multinational companies (MNCs) operate their global
   marketing activities through foreign marketing subsidiaries. However,
   this practice presents MNCs with the challenge of efficiently and
   effectively managing a portfolio of subsidiaries with numerous diverging
   characteristics. To reduce the complexity of managing such a portfolio
   and to increase MNCs' and subsidiaries' performance, we provide MNCs
   with a marketing subsidiary taxonomy that enables them to understand and
   manage different subsidiary types. Analysis of a cross-sectional,
   multi-country, multiple-informant dataset generated five marketing
   subsidiary clusters, which are distinct in the structural
   characteristics of size, age, and value-added scope and the strategic
   characteristics of strategic influence, strategic competence, and
   strategic importance. Subsidiary performance outcomes, subsidiary
   environmental conditions including important marketing aspects (e.g.,
   customer characteristics), and headquarters' coordination and
   communication mechanisms enrich our cluster description and yield a
   holistic picture of our marketing subsidiary taxonomy. The empirical
   results provide significant theoretical and managerial implications.

AB During the past decade, offshoring has become an established business
   practice. Yet it is still more common to offshore less advanced tasks
   compared with offshoring more advanced tasks, i.e., tasks closer to the
   core activities of the firm. The latter is a new phenomenon which raises
   many new issues on the boundaries of the firm. More or less advanced
   tasks can be found within all activities, e.g., in sales and marketing
   where telesales is on the less advanced end of the scale while branding
   and identity building are on the advanced end of the scale. This article
   focuses on the antecedents of advanced offshoring, exploring what causes
   firms to offshore some of their more advanced tasks. Our findings
   indicate that while the lower cost of unskilled, labor-intensive
   processes is the main driver for firms that offshore less advanced
   tasks, the offshoring of advanced tasks is part of firms' strategy to
   achieve international competitiveness through access to cross-border
   knowledge flows and foreign knowledge resources. Furthermore, offshoring
   of advanced manufacturing tasks seems to be more widespread and
   experience-based than the offshoring of advanced service tasks.

AB Over the past few decades, outsourcing has become a widely used and
   researched means for firms to change their performance. In this article,
   we attempt to link outsourcing to the market success of firms,
   specifically their market share. We argue that although firms may be
   able to increase their market share through outsourcing, this is only
   true up to a point, beyond which market share actually decreases as a
   consequence of further outsourcing. There is, in other words, a
   negatively curvilinear (inverted U-shape) relationship between
   outsourcing and market share. We also hypothesize that the
   outsourcing-market share relationship is moderated negatively by both
   the strength of firm resources and the extent of competition in a firm's
   market. We empirically confirm these arguments through a panel data
   analysis containing over 19,000 observations on manufacturing firms and
   offer some case examples to illustrate the mechanisms driving these
   results. Finally, we discuss implications for marketing research and
   practice.

AB Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to a firm's activities for
   establishing and maintaining relationships with its customers.
   Outsourcing refers to a firm's contracting with another firm to perform
   activities that were erstwhile performed within the firm. The emergence
   of a low cost, high speed, global communication network and information
   processing network has enabled an increasing number of firms based in
   more industrialized market economies to outsource specific elements of
   their CRM to offshore vendors located in countries with significantly
   lower labor costs. Building on scholarly insights from multiple
   literature streams, we present a conceptual model delineating the
   antecedents and consequences of CRM offshore outsourcing intensity. We
   also provide a literature overview of the determinants of location
   choice decision for offshore outsourcing, an issue that is closely
   linked to the offshore outsourcing decision. The growing trend toward
   offshore outsourcing of CRM serves to highlight a number of issues that
   merit careful managerial consideration. In this context, we highlight
   supply-side versus demand-side effects of CRM offshore outsourcing, the
   economics of CRM offshore outsourcing versus CRM automation, CRM
   offshore outsourcing versus CRM offshoring, and the evolution of
   hierarchical CRM organizations toward market based CRM business systems,
   and other issues.

AB This study examines the underlying forces that shape the international
   marketing (IM) field using three bibliometric methods: exploratory
   factor analysis (EFA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and metric
   multidimensional scaling (MDS). We apply these techniques to evaluate
   the knowledge structure of IM publications for the 1999-2008 period and
   to concurrently provide a supplemental examination of the findings for
   the 2009-2010 period. Overall, our database contains 228,929 citations
   used in 3,632 IM articles from 34 academic journals in which marketing
   publications appear. We initially trace the underpinning knowledge
   structure in the literature in five-year increments for all influential
   IM publications. We then refine our analysis and examine
   marketing-centered scholarly influences on the IM literature and
   undertake an examination of the developments in later years. The results
   indicate that the IM field is expanding and is considerably more
   inclusive, sophisticated, and increasingly more complex than in earlier
   periods. Our findings also demonstrate that other disciplines
   (principally management) have had a profound influence on the
   development of the IM literature during the 12-year period under
   investigation. Using the bibliometric results derived from our data, we
   provide guidelines for future research and contrast them with those
   forwarded in review studies of the international marketing literature.

AB International competitiveness ultimately depends upon the linkages
   between a firm's unique, idiosyncratic capabilities (firm-specific
   advantages, FSAs) and its home country assets (country-specific
   advantages, CSAs). In this paper, we present a modified FSA/CSA matrix
   building upon the FSA/CSA matrix (Rugman 1981). We relate this to the
   diamond framework for national competitiveness (Porter 1990), and the
   double diamond model (Rugman and D'Cruz 1993). We provide empirical
   evidence to demonstrate the merits and usefulness of the modified
   FSA/CSA matrix using the Fortune Global 500 firms. We examine the FSAs
   based on the geographic scope of sales and CSAs that can lead to
   national, home region, and global competitiveness. Our empirical
   analysis suggests that the world's largest 500 firms have increased
   their firm-level international competitiveness. However, much of this is
   still being achieved within their home region. In other words,
   international competitiveness is a regional not a global phenomenon. Our
   findings have significant implications for research and practice. Future
   research in international marketing should take into account the
   multi-faceted nature of FSAs and CSAs across different levels. For MNE
   managers, our study provides useful insights for strategic marketing
   planning and implementation.

AB Since exporting is the most popular mechanism by which firms engage with

   performance is key to explaining firms' international competitiveness.
   The literature posits that the effective implementation of planned
   export marketing strategy is a key determinant of the performance of
   firms operating in international markets. Yet little is known about the
   specific nature and drivers of export marketing strategy implementation
   effectiveness. In this study we build on the implementation literature
   in marketing and strategic management to develop a new conceptualization
   of export marketing strategy implementation effectiveness. Drawing on
   dynamic capabilities theory, we empirically examine the export marketing
   capability antecedents and performance consequences of export marketing
   strategy implementation effectiveness in the context of manufacturing
   firms that are exporting to international markets. Results indicate that
   effective implementation of planned export marketing strategy
   contributes to export market and financial performance, and that
   marketing capabilities play an important role in enabling effective
   marketing strategy implementation in export venture operations.
