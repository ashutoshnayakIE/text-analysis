TI A NATIONAL CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BAROMETER - THE SWEDISH EXPERIENCE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Many individual companies and some industries monitor customer satisfaction on a continual basis, but Sweden is the first country to do so on a national level. The annual Customer Satisfaction Barometer (CSB) measures customer satisfaction in more than 30 industries and for more than 100 corporations. The new index is intended to be complementary to productivity measures. Whereas productivity basically reflects quantity of output, CSB measures quality of output (as experienced by the buyer). The author reports the results of a large-scale Swedish effort to measure quality of the total consumption process as customer satisfaction. The significance of customer satisfaction and its place within the overall strategy of the firm are discussed. An implication from examining the relationship between market share and customer satisfaction by a location model is that satisfaction should be lower in industries where supply is homogeneous and demand heterogeneous. Satisfaction should be higher when the heterogeneity/homogeneity of demand is matched by the supply. Empirical support is found for that proposition in monopolies as well as in competitive market structures. Likewise, industries in general are found to have a high level of customer satisfaction if they are highly dependent on satisfaction for repeat business. The opposite is found for industries in which companies have more captive markets. For Sweden, the 1991 results show a slight increase in CSB, which should have a positive effect on the general economic climate.

Seventeen percent of the models were perceived, on average, to be significantly younger than 25 years of age, an apparent violation of the tobacco industry's voluntary advertising code. Cigarette ads with young persons were found to appear more often in magazines with younger audiences and for menthol brands. Regardless of viewer age, younger models were judged as more attractive than older models.

TI CONFLICT-RESOLUTION PROCESSES IN CONTRACTUAL CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB On the basis of power theory, theory of relational exchange, and related literature from the fields of organizational behavior, political science, and communications, a set of hypotheses are derived to predict the choice of the four archetypal conflict resolution strategies proposed by March and Simon. Specifically, the contingent impacts of issue characteristics, dependency, and the emergent sentiments of relationalism on this choice behavior are evaluated empirically within the franchised channel of fast food restaurants. The results reveal a high overall incidence of the integrative problem-solving approach, but a preference for third-party intervention when the disputed issues involve high stakes, complexity, and policy connotations and when the franchisee dependency is rated high.

The authors empirically examine a rich theoretical concept with an extensive research-based literature, cognitive moral development or CMD, as it relates to professional marketing. Controlling for similar educational background, they find that (1) professional marketing practitioners compare favorably with other social groups, (2) marketers scoring high on CMD tend to be female and highly educated, and (3) marketers with advanced moral reasoning properties tend to have socially responsible attitudes and behaviors. Implications for marketing theory, education, and practice are discussed.

TI A MARKET EXPANSION ABILITY APPROACH TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL EXPORTERS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors develop and apply a probabilistic model designed to identify currently nonexporting manufacturers with a relatively high potential for future exports. The proposed model includes a new predictive construct (market expansion ability), which incorporates the time dimension of firm behavior, in addition to more familiar attitudinal constructs such as perceived barriers to exporting. The model is demonstrated with a sample of 345 nonexporting manufacturers. Several evaluative tests, including a test of predictive validity with a sample of 43 current exporters, provide evidence of the model's ability to identify nonexporting manufacturers with export potential.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF GLOBAL MARKETING STANDARDIZATION ON PERFORMANCE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors address a key controversy in the marketing literature about the suitability of global standardization.  An empirical investigation of the differences between firms that emphasize global standardization and others that use less standardization was conducted within the global industry context.  The results indicate that market coverage and capacity utilization are important considerations for firms emphasizing global standardization.  Emphasis on speciality products and the development of high priced products for market niches are also of some importance to these firms.  However, in the critical area of performance, no difference is observed between firms stressing global standardization and others.

TI DO NORMS MATTER IN MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Transaction cost analysis is rapidly becoming an important theoretical paradigm in marketing. However, the accumulation of transaction cost studies has been accompanied by a growing body of criticism, primarily directed toward its underlying behavioral norm of opportunism. That norm is a serious theoretical deficiency, not only because it may be descriptively inaccurate, but also because it limits the applicability of the theoretical framework. The authors show that norms play a very significant role in structuring economically efficient relationships between independent firms. In the absence of supportive norms, it is not possible for parties whose specific assets are at risk to acquire vertical control as per the transaction cost prescription. Instead, those parties lose control because of their dependence. An empirical test of conceptual model in a sample of manufacturer-supplier relationships shows good support for the authors' hypotheses.

AB Hunt's 1990 interpretation of scientific realism is compared with the relativistic/constructionist view previously introduced in this journal.  Though some similarities are found, the two views differ most strikingly in terms of the nature of reality, the nature of truth, and the value of the concept of incommensurability.  Several implications are offered for marketing scientists about what difference it makes which view they accept.  However, the author concludes that philosophically oriented marketing theorists need to further demonstrate the value of their work for practicing marketing scientists.

TI TRUTH IN MARKETING THEORY AND RESEARCH - AN ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Numerous authors have discussed the possibility of a marketing science and have presented their visions to describe the characteristics of such a science.  Fundamentally, these visions must come to grips with the idea of "truth" and the role truth plays in theory and research.  In this article, the authors explore "truth in marketing science" by describing the essential problem of science in general and discussing the issues that shape the notion of a marketing science in particular.  They note two limiting factors in viewing marketing as a science:  (1) marketing as an applied field and (2) marketing's attempts to explain human behavior-a phenomenon that is mutable, unpredictable, and reactive.  They propose a scientific realist perspective, which can be useful for describing some of the "scientific" explanations offered in the marketing literature.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Agency and related theories have proven useful as theoretical frameworks for examining relationships between principals and their agents in many disciplines. However, though marketing involves a wide array of agency relationships, agency-based research has only recently begun to be reported in the marketing literature. The authors therefore attempt to clarify the marketing implications of agency theory by describing its major constructs, the two different types of models embedded within the theory, and some closely related theoretical structures. They also critically review past and potential agency-based research in marketing and suggest ways in which marketers might contribute to improving its validity and usefulness.

TI AN EXAMINATION OF RESELLER BUYER ATTITUDES TOWARD ORDER OF BRAND ENTRY
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB A national survey of 145 reseller buyers was used to study how brand entry order into new categories affects reseller buyers' attitudes toward new items. The literature on pioneer brand advantage is extended by finding empirical support for an advantage to pioneer brands with resellers. Also, an important distinction is found between the first me-too follower brand and second or later me-too follower brands. Specifically, reseller buyers have a very favorable attitude toward pioneer brands, a less favorable but still positive attitude toward first me-too follower brands, and an unfavorable attitude toward second or later me-too follower brands. An adaptation of the multiattribute attitude model (that of "importance-likelihood") served as the psychological basis in an effort to explain how and why these attitudinal differences occurred. A causal model framework then was applied to the data to investigate the significant interrelationships between brand order of entry and reseller buyer beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. The theoretical and managerial implications of entry order effects are discussed.

The authors examine gender differences in job-related attitudes and performance outcomes in an integrated salesforce.

TI MEASURING SERVICE QUALITY - A REEXAMINATION AND EXTENSION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors investigate the conceptualization and measurement of service quality and the relationships between service quality, consumer satisfaction, and purchase intentions. A literature review suggests that the current operationalization of service quality confounds satisfaction and attitude. Hence, the authors test (1) an alternative method of operationalizing perceived service quality and (2) the significance of the relationships between service quality, consumer satisfaction and purchase intentions. The results suggest that (1) a performance-based measure of service quality may be an improved means of measuring the service quality construct, (2) service quality is an antecedent of consumer satisfaction, (3) consumer satisfaction has a significant effect on purchase intentions, and (4) service quality has less effect on purchase intentions than does consumer satisfaction. Implications for managers and future research are discussed.

TI CHANNEL SELECTION FOR NEW INDUSTRIAL-PRODUCTS - A FRAMEWORK, METHOD, AND
   APPLICATION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors present a framework and method for addressing the new product channel choice decision and demonstrate its use with an application for a new industrial product. First, on the basis of extant literature, they disaggregate a distribution channel into eight functional components. These functions are representative of the various product-market factors influencing channel choice. Next, they offer a three-step method that involves (1) obtaining evaluations of the new product on each function from several experts, (2) analytically combining those evaluations, and (3) identifying the channel alternative that effectively and efficiently addresses customer requirements of those functions. This method requires extensive management participation to facilitate its implementation. Finally, the authors provide an illustrative application to demonstrate its managerial usefulness.

TI A CATASTROPHE MODEL FOR DEVELOPING SERVICE SATISFACTION STRATEGIES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction has become an important issue for marketing practitioners. The authors examine the issue in terms of customer service. In particular, practitioners and academicians have noted that simply investing in greater service delivery may not return the cost of the additional investment. Part of the problem is that customers' response to service increments can be nonlinear, and satisfaction and dissatisfaction thresholds may not occur at the same point. The authors propose a method for analyzing this complex behavior in a way that can lead to the development of more accurate service strategies through an understanding of the relationships among customer-transaction costs, satisfaction, and purchase loyalty. They use a catastrophe model to describe a service loyalty customer-response surface. Then, by presenting a "real-world" application with a small service-quality customer dataset provided by General Electric Supply, they show how one actually estimates such a model and interprets the results.

TI THE CHANGING-ROLE OF MARKETING IN THE CORPORATION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB New organization forms, including strategic partnerships and networks, are replacing simple market-based transactions and traditional bureaucratic hierarchical organizations. The historical marketing management function, based on the microeconomic maximization paradigm, must be critically examined for its relevance to marketing theory and practice in the 1990s. A new conception of marketing will focus on managing strategic partnerships and positioning the firm between vendors and customers in the value chain with the aim of delivering superior value to customers. Customer relationships will be seen as the key strategic resource of the business.

TI 1ST-MOVER ADVANTAGE - A SYNTHESIS, CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK, AND RESEARCH
   PROPOSITIONS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Numerous conceptual and empirical studies advance the notion that first movers achieve long-term competitive advantages. These studies purport to demonstrate the presence of a systematic direct relationship between order of entry for products, brands, or businesses and market share. However, an objective assessment of the literature suggests that this view must be qualified. A broadened perspective is presented that highlights the complexity of this phenomenon and suggests that first-mover status may or may not produce sustainable advantages because of a multiplicity of controllable and uncontrollable forces. A conceptual framework identifying factors that underlie first-mover advantage and product-market contingencies that moderate the order of entry-competitive advantage relationship is proffered. Several research propositions relevant for marketing theory and practice are presented.

AB The process of knowledge utilization within firms has come to be viewed as an increasingly important area for research in light of its implications for organizational effectiveness. However, our current understanding of this phenomenon is limited because the process of knowledge use in organizations is complex and difficult to conceptualize and measure. Building on prior research in public policy, sociology, marketing, and other administrative disciplines, the authors first explicate the nature of knowledge utilization and propose a framework for circumscribing the concept of knowledge utilization. Next, using an emerging theoretical perspective on knowledge utilization, the "organizational" view, the authors present a conceptual model and research propositions that provide insights into informational and organizational factors that affect marketing knowledge utilization in firms.

Customer behavior in terms of tradeoffs between price and service is an important additional criterion. The authors offer a framework for such buying-behavior-oriented microsegmentation of industrial customers. They apply the framework to segment the national accounts of a large industrial company and show how the results of a segmentation study can be used to redirect the firm's resources and customer segments.

In recent years, however, increasing criticism has been voiced, among other reasons because of its inherent negative definition of sales promotion and its lack of mutual exclusiveness and collective exhaustiveness. The authors evaluate the 4P classification against the criteria proposed by Hunt and present an improved classification.

TI CONCEPTUALIZING, MEASURING, AND MANAGING CUSTOMER-BASED BRAND EQUITY
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The author presents a conceptual model of brand equity from the perspective of the individual consumer. Customer-based brand equity is defined as the differential effect of brand knowledge on consumer response to the marketing of the brand. A brand is said to have positive (negative) customer-based brand equity when consumers react more (less) favorably to an element of the marketing mix for the brand than they do to the same marketing mix element when it is attributed to a fictitiously named or unnamed version of the product or service. Brand knowledge is conceptualized according to an associative network memory model in terms of two components, brand awareness and brand image (i.e., a set of brand associations). Customer-based brand equity occurs when the consumer is familiar with the brand and holds some favorable, strong, and unique brand associations in memory. Issues in building, measuring, and managing customer-based brand equity are discussed, as well as areas for future research.

AB ''Quadrads'' (double dyads) of interviews, each conducted with a pair of marketing executives at a Japanese vendor firm and a pair of purchasing executives at a Japanese customer firm, provided data on corporate culture, customer orientation, innovativeness, and market performance. Business performance (relative profitability, relative size, relative growth rate, and relative share of market) was correlated positively with the customer's evaluation of the supplier's customer orientation, but the supplier's own assessment of customer orientation did not correspond well to that of the customer. Japanese companies with corporate cultures stressing competitiveness (markets) and entrepreneurship (adhocracies) outperformed those dominated by internal cohesiveness (clans) or by rules (hierarchies). Successful market innovation also improved performance.

TI TAXONOMY OF BUYING DECISION APPROACHES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The author reports the development of a classification scheme of buying patterns and situations. Unlike previous conceptual schemes, it consists of six prototypical ''buying decision approaches'' identified through an empirically based taxonomy development procedure. A mix of underlying buying activities distinguishes the categories: search for information, use of analysis techniques, focus on proactive issues, and reliance on control mechanisms. The use of a particular buying decision approach depends on four situational characteristics: purchase importance, task uncertainty, extensiveness of choice, and perceived buyer power. The findings reveal some patterns that are similar to previous classification schemes, but new variations allow for a conceptual extension of the literature. The resulting framework is useful to marketing managers, who can view their customer segments in terms of the categories in the taxonomy. Further, it provides a tool by which sales representatives can develop adaptive selling approaches based on a small set of buying situations and corresponding buying decision approaches.

TI CONTROL COMBINATIONS IN MARKETING - CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK AND
   EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The topic of management control systems has received limited attention in the marketing literature. Though previous research has tended to view each organizational control in isolation, the authors argue that research should examine the simultaneous use of multiple controls. On the basis of previous work, a conceptual framework for combinations of controls is constructed with associated research hypotheses. Four alternative combinations or ''systems'' of controls are identified: (1) a traditional bureaucratic management control system with a primary emphasis on formal controls, (2) a clan system with a primary emphasis on informal controls, (3) a low control system, and (4) a high control system. The findings indicate that SBU characteristics and task complexity variables predict the type of system that is likely to be emphasized. In turn, the results indicate that the high control system is associated with highest job satisfaction followed sequentially by the clan, bureaucratic, and low control systems. The high control system also produced the lowest levels of person-role conflict and ambiguity. No significant relationship is found between the four systems and job performance. Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

TI THE IMPACT OF ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR ON EVALUATIONS OF
   SALESPERSON PERFORMANCE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The research objective was to examine the relative impact of ''organizational citzenship behaviors'' (OCBs) and objective sales productivity on sales managers' evaluations of the performance of their sales personnel. Objective measures of sales productivity were obtained for three diverse sales samples: (1) 261 multiline insurance agents, (2) 204 petrochemical sales representatives, and (3) 108 district sales managers working for a large pharmaceutical company. Managerial evaluations of organizational citizenship behavior and overall performance were also obtained for each of these people. The results indicate that (1) managers do recognize several different dimensions of ''citizenship'' behavior, and these OCBs are distinct from objective sales productivity, (2) the combination of OCBs and objective sales productivity accounts for substantially more variance in managers' overall evaluations than typically is accounted for by sales productivity alone, and (3) the OCBs (taken as a group) consistently account for a larger portion of the variance in managerial evaluations than does sales productivity. The implications of these findings for salesforce motivation and evaluation are discussed.

TI FACTORS AFFECTING TRUST IN MARKET-RESEARCH RELATIONSHIPS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Building on previous work suggesting that trust is critical in facilitating exchange relationships, the authors describe a comprehensive theory of trust in market research relationships. This theory focuses on the factors that determine users' trust in their researchers, including individual, interpersonal, organizational, interorganizational/interdepartmental, and project factors. The theory is tested in a sample of 779 users. Results indicate that the interpersonal factors are the most predictive of trust. Among these factors, perceived researcher integrity, willingness to reduce research uncertainty, confidentiality, expertise, tactfulness, sincerity, congeniality, and timeliness are most strongly associated with trust. Among the remaining factors, the formalization of the user's organization, the culture of the researcher's department or organization, the research organization's or department's power, and the extent to which the research is customized also affect trust. These findings generally do not change across different types of dyadic relationships.

TI BOUNDARY ROLE AMBIGUITY - FACETS, DETERMINANTS, AND IMPACTS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The study of the organizational determinants of role ambiguity among sales and marketing professionals and its dysfunctional impact on job outcomes is an important area of research in marketing. Recently, researchers have identified several gaps in the literature in this area, including (1) substantial variability in results across studies and (2) lack of studies that conceptualize (and operationalize) role ambiguity as a multifaceted construct. As an initial step, the author uses a multifaceted conceptualization of role ambiguity to investigate a model that includes key organizational determinants and job outcomes. Using data from multiple samples of sales and marketing professionals, the author estimates, augments, and validates the hypothesized model. The results show that multifaceted role ambiguity (1) helps uncover functional facets of role ambiguity (e.g., family) that facilitate coping with other ambiguous facets, (2) unravels the sensitivity of role ambiguity facets to different organizational determinants, and (3) offers evidence of differential potency because the different role ambiguity facets exhibit different potency in predicting the various job outcomes. Several directions for enriching theory about the role ambiguity phenomenon are provided and implications for practitioners are discussed.

They propose a model and measurement methodology, which they apply to the premarket forecasting of a new automobile. They describe empirical data collection, parameter estimation, managerial implications, validation issues, and future research needs. The extended model generates new managerial insights into positioning and marketing planning effectiveness, can be used to simulate the effects of changes in positioning strategy on consideration and choice, and provides more detailed information about why consumers consider or reject a new brand. The relevance of the categorization extension for other new product models that condition choice on a consideration set is also explored.

TI IDENTIFYING GLOBAL AND CULTURE-SPECIFIC DIMENSIONS OF HUMOR IN
   ADVERTISING - A MULTINATIONAL ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Humor is a commonly used communication tool in advertising in the United States, but U.S. marketers know little about its use and effectiveness in foreign markets. Such limited knowledge hinders international managers' ability to determine which aspects of humorous communications are likely to be amenable to global standardization and which should be adapted to local expectations. The authors examine the content of humorous television advertising from four national cultures: Korea, Germany, Thailand, and the United States. Findings indicate that humorous communications from such diverse national cultures share certain universal cognitive structures underlying the message. However, the specific content of humorous advertising is likely to be variable across national cultures along major normative dimensions such as collectivism-individualism.

TI OBJECTIVITY IN MARKETING THEORY AND RESEARCH
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Many marketers contend that recent developments in the philosophy of science imply that objectivity in marketing research is an illusion, a chimera, or impossible. Five arguments are customarily put forth that supposedly demonstrate the impossibility of objectivity: (1) linguistic relativism, (2) paradigm incommensurability, (3) theories are underdetermined by facts, (4) perception is theory-laden, and (5) epistemically significant observations are theory-laden. The author evaluates the five arguments, shows that there is nothing in the philosophy of science that dooms objective marketing research, and puts forth the ''positive case'' for objectivity.

TI THEORETICAL MODELING IN MARKETING
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Over the last 10 years or so, theoretical modeling has rapidly become an important style of research in marketing. To many people, however, this style is still a mystery. This article is an attempt at explaining theoretical modeling. The author argues that even though theoretical modeling is quantitative, it is closer to behavioral marketing in purpose and methodology than to quantitative decision support modeling. Whereas behavioral marketing involves empirical experiments, theoretical modeling involves logical experiments. Using this framework, the author addresses such issues as the internal and external validity of theoretical models, the purpose of theoretical modeling, and the testing of model-based theories. The agency theory explanation of salesforce compensation is used as a case study.

TI AN ANALYSIS OF THE MARKET SHARE-PROFITABILITY RELATIONSHIP
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB A number of researchers in the marketing, management, and economics disciplines have expressed reservations regarding the validity and generalizability of the reported relationships between market share and profitability. Against this backdrop, the authors performed a meta-analysis on 276 market share-profitability findings from forty-eight studies to address whether market share and profitablity are positively related and to examine the factors that moderate the magnitude of that relationship. The authors found that, on average, market share has a positive effect on business profitability. However, the magnitude of the market share-profitability relationship is moderated by model specification errors, sample characteristics, and measurement characteristics. The relationship is moderated the most (and, on average, the relationship could be artifactual) when firm-specific intangible factors are specified in the profit model or the estimate of the market share-profitability relationship is based on an analysis of non-PIMS businesses. The authors discuss the implications of these results for the evaluation and utilization of market share information by managers in reference to strategies that focus on building market share as a means for increasing profits.

TI SERVICE FIRMS INTERNATIONAL ENTRY-MODE CHOICE - A MODIFIED
   TRANSACTION-COST ANALYSIS APPROACH
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Some peculiar characteristics of service firms, such as low capital intensity and the inseparability of production and consumption, have necessitated the modification of the traditional transaction-cost framework used to study entry-mode choice. By relaxing some unduly restrictive assumptions of the conventional transaction-cost analysis (TCA) model, the paper argues that firms prefer to start. with full-control modes. It postulates that substantial variation in entry-mode choice occurs when firms that are characterized by low asset specificity relinquish control in response to the rising costs of integration or the diminishing ability to integrate. Several hypotheses on the propensity of service firms to employ shared-control entry modes are developed and tested. The results not only provide insights into entry-mode choice by service firms but also indicate how the transaction-cost framework can be broadened to develop a more comprehensive model for understanding entry-mode choice.

TI ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE ENTRY ON MARKET EXPANSION AND
   INCUMBENT SALES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The assessment of the impact of a new brand entry is an important issue for both practitioners and scholars of competitive strategy. A new entrant into a market may create additional demand for the product and/or share the existing market by drawing buyers away from incumbent brands. This paper suggests a diffusion modeling approach for assessing the impact of a new durable brand entry on market size and the sales of incumbent brands. The model is illustrated by applying it to the case involving Polaroid and Kodak in instant photography during the period 1976 to 1985. Limitations and possible extensions of the model are discussed.

TI MARKET ORIENTATION - ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB This research addresses three questions: (1) Why are some organizations more market-oriented than others? (2) What effect does a market orientation have on employees and business performance? (3) Does the linkage between a market orientation and business performance depend on the environmental context? The findings from two national samples suggest that a market orientation is related to top management emphasis on the orientation, risk aversion of top managers, interdepartmental conflict and connectedness, centralization, and reward system orientation. Furthermore, the findings suggest that a market orientation is related to overall (judgmental) business performance (but not market share), employees' organizational commitment, and esprit de corps. Finally, the linkage between a market orientation and performance appears to be robust across environmental contexts that are characterized by varying degrees of market turbulence, competitive intensity, and technological turbulence.

TI DILUTING BRAND BELIEFS - WHEN DO BRAND EXTENSIONS HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB This paper examines situations in which brand extensions are more or less likely to dilute beliefs associated with the family brand name. The results of an experimental investigation indicate that dilution effects do occur when brand extension attributes are inconsistent with the family brand beliefs. However, they are less likely to emerge when consumers perceive the brand extension as atypical of the family brand, and typicality of the brand extension is salient at the time beliefs are assessed. These findings held regardless of brand extension category, with the extension category being either the same or different from those product categories already occupied by the family brand, but differing by the type of family brand belief involved. Results are discussed in terms of the conditions under which two alternative theoretical perspectives (''bookkeeping'' versus ''typicality-based'' models) are supported.

Several significant features of alpha-numeric brand names are identified, such as the magnitude of the number used in the brand name, its shape or spoken sound, and the symbolism of the words or letters that are used with the number to form the brand name. The inferences that consumers draw from an alpha-numeric brand name influence their understandings and expectations of the product.

The proposed 7-factor model was tested on two independent samples: collegians (188) and householders (195) from Ohio and Mississippi Valley states, explaining 62% and 56% of the variance in their global attitudes, respectively. The model's dimensions were used to profile these publics and to identify attitudinal segments within them. Most respondents exhibited conflict between an appreciation of the personal uses and economic value of advertising and an apprehension of cultural degradation.

TI STANDARDIZATION VERSUS ADAPTATION OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING STRATEGY -
   AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB An issue debated frequently in the international marketing literature centers on whether a business should pursue a strategy that is standardized across national markets or adapted to individual national markets. Of the two aspects relating to standardization of marketing strategy across national markets-(1) standardization of the pattern of resource allocation across marketing mix variables integral to a business's marketing strategy and (2) standardization of the strategy content with respect to individual marketing mix variables-the latter has been the subject of numerous conceptual articles. However, there is a relative dearth of empirical studies on both issues. To partially fill this void, this study addresses empirically the question of the standardization of the pattern of resource allocation among marketing mix variables across national markets. The question is addressed by examining whether competitive strategy and industry structure variables affect market share and business profits similarly or dissimilarly across Western markets, that is, the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Western Europe. The results reveal that with few exceptions, the effects of competitive strategy and market structure variables generalize across these markets. The study findings provide insights into both the merits of standardizing the strategic resource mix across Western markets and the competitive strategy and market structure variables that are major explanators of business performance across Western markets.

The examination indicates that the P-E framework is of questionable validity because of a number of conceptual and definitional problems involving the (1) conceptual definition of expectations, (2) theoretical justification of the expectations component of the P-E framework, and (3) measurement validity of the expectation (E) and revised expectation (E*) measures specified in the published service quality literature. Consequently, alternative perceived quality models that address the problems of the traditional framework are developed and empirically tested.

The results from a study of 144 diverse sales organizations provide support for the relationship between behavior-based salesforce control systems and specific salesforce characteristics, different salesforce performance dimensions, and sales organization effectiveness. The results imply a limited role for incentive compensation in salesforce control systems.

TI A NEW APPROACH TO COUNTRY SEGMENTATION UTILIZING MULTINATIONAL DIFFUSION
   PATTERNS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Country segmentation has been proposed to assist in marketing strategy decisions for international marketing managers. Such schemes typically consist of grouping or clustering a set of specified countries on the basis of a wide array of macroeconomic variables. The authors focus on the merits of such country classification schemes in gaining an understanding about multinational diffusion patterns. More specifically, they analyze the extent to which countries belonging to the same (different) grouping reveal similar (dissimilar) diffusion patterns. To that end, they compare the results of traditional segmentation approaches with diffusion-based country segments derived for three different consumer durable goods. For the latter, they rely on a recently developed latent-structure methodology, here modified to accommodate the Bass diffusion model, which simultaneously determines the segments and segment-level estimates of the diffusion parameters. They find that the market segments derived from these two approaches differ dramatically and that macro-level variables do not fully explain differences in diffusion patterns across countries. In addition, country segments formed on the basis of diffusion patterns often differ by product. Finally, they discuss some managerial implications and directions for future research.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING

Past studies are reviewed and two distinct components of claim objectivity are identified: attribute tangibility and factualness of description. Specific predictions are made concerning the effects of claim objectivity on perceived ad credibility, brand beliefs, ad attitudes, brand attitudes, and purchase intentions. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model different results are predicted for print and broadcast media. A study is conducted in which the degree of claim objectivity (objective, subjective, and mixed) and the type of media (radio or print) are manipulated as independent variables while various message and consumer variables are controlled or measured as covariates. Results show that both tangibility and factualness contribute to claim objectivity effects, that objective claims are more effective than subjective claims, and that no content differences emerge between print and radio media. Implications for marketing research and practice are discussed.

The authors propose and test a contingency that may help resolve this controversy. Experimental results suggest that message reception is influenced by the interplay of two musical properties: attention-gaining value and music-message congruency. Increasing audience attention to music enhances message reception when the music evokes message-congruent (versus incongruent) thoughts.

However, empirical work in the context of export marketing has been fragmented. The authors investigate the marketing strategy-performance relationship in the context of export ventures. The study differs from previous export marketing studies in that (1) a comprehensive set of potential determinants of export market performance is considered; (2) the unit of analysis is the individual product-market export venture, rather than the firm or a business division; and (3) the analysis is based on in-depth personal interviews. The authors propose a conceptual framework of export marketing strategy and performance and test it by path analysis. The results support the contention that export marketing strategy, firm's international competence, and managerial commitment are the key determinants of export performance. Export marketing strategy is influenced by internal (firm and product characteristics) and external factors (industry and export market characteristics) They then discuss implications for management and further research.

TI CONTEXTUAL AND TEMPORAL COMPONENTS OF REFERENCE PRICE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB An emerging consensus in marketing is that consumers respond to price relative to some standard or reference price. Most researchers modeling brand choice have reasoned that this standard is based on past prices of the brand. The authors argue that consumers do use reference prices, but one that is also based on context-other prices in the store-rather than on past prices alone.  An analysis of households' brand choices in two subcategories and over three cities supports this premise. Within context, the lowest price seems to be an important cue for reference price, whereas within time, a brand's own past prices seem to be the most important cue. Households' use of a contextual reference price also varies predictably across some consumer characteristics. Though their model can be applied to other categories, the findings have important managerial implications: Managerial focus on temporal reference prices could lead to an everyday high price, whereas focus on contextual reference prices could lead to an everyday low price. Only the inclusion of both contextual and temporal reference prices justifies

TI DOES COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT MODERATE THE MARKET ORIENTATION-PERFORMANCE
   RELATIONSHIP
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Recent studies have shown evidence ot a positive relationship between market orientation and performance. However, some scholars have suggested that competitive environment could moderate this relationship. The authors investigate how competitive environment affects the strength of the market orientation-performance relationship and whether it affects the focus of the external emphasis within a market orientation-that is, a greater emphasis on customer analysis relative to competitor analysis, or vice versa, within a given magnitude of market orientation. Their results provide very limited support for a moderator role for competitive environment on the market orientation-performance relationship. The benefits of a market orientation are long term though environmental conditions are often transient, and thus being market oriented is cost-effective in spite of any possible short-term moderating effects of the environment.

Building on Lazarus's general theory of emotion and adaptation, they hypothesize that public service ads designed to reduce the incidence of child abuse stimulate negative emotions. these, in turn, lead to empathic reactions and end with the decision to help. Two field experiments are conducted to test the theory.

TI INTERORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE IN MARKETING CHANNELS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Relationship management rapidly is becoming a central research paradigm in the marketing channels literature. A growing body of conceptual and empirical literature addresses different aspects of interfirm relationships, building in part on recent theoretical developments in organization theory, law, and economics. Interestingly, however, some of these theoretical frameworks make radically different assumptions about the nature of interfirm relationships, though these differences to date have not been examined systematically in the marketing literature. The author reviews these theoretical perspectives and develops a formal typology of approaches to relationship management. Specifically, he develops a typology of three different forms of governance, which vary systematically in terms of how specific interfirm processes are carried out. He also discusses the antecendents of different relationship forms and shows the results ot a preliminary empirical test.

TI SHARE AND GROWTH ARE NOT GOOD PREDICTORS OF THE ADVERTISING AND
   PROMOTION SALES RATIO
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Researchers have tried for several years to explain variations in advertising and promotion/sales (A&P/S) ratios across brands, product-market categories firms, and industries. Market share (MS) and market growth (MG) have been included as explanatory variables in almost all of these studies A recent article by Balasubramanian and Kumar (1 990) presents a parsimonious yet powerful model explaining A&P/S ratios using these two variables and their interaction. Though the MG-MS matrix provides a possible rationale for the use of these variables in an interaction model, the authors argue that it is more consistent with strategic business unit (SBU)-level data than firm data. They attempt to replicate the model with two other data sets (SBU and brand data) as well as a version of the firm data used in the original study. Being unable to find empirical support for the model with any of the three data sets, they argue that further research should rely on other variables.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB A variety of new information technologies have emerged that clearly can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing programs. However. the use of technologies such as computer matching or automatic order-entry systems to support marketing programs also can lead to legal and societal difficulties. The authors review the types of problems that marketers could encounter when using new information technologies. Particular attention is paid to the possibilities of being charged with (1) participating in collusive information exchanges, (2) maintaining an illegal '' essential facility,'' (3) storing or transmitting inaccurate and harmful information, and (4) violating the privacy rights of individuals. They offer ideas about how marketing managers and researchers can reduce the chances of facing these types of problems.

   ASSESSMENT OF A REASSESSMENT
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The author responds to issues raised by Parasuraman Zeithaml, and Berry (1994) concerning his 1993 article that outlines theoretical and operational problems associated with the SERVQUAL model of perceived service quality. Because theoretical problems and ambiguities must be resolved before operational issues can be addressed effectively, his response focuses on the Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1 994) comments concerning (1) the theoretical problems associated with the SERVQUAL P - E model and (2) the Teas (1993) evaluated performance (EP) and normed quality (NQ) models. In addition, he assesses the theoretical merit of the Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1994) SERVQUAL ''mixed-model.'' His primary conclusions are that the conclusions reached by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1994) with respect to the Teas (1 993) EP and NQ models are incorrect and that the proposed SERVQUAL mixed-model is merely a restricted version of (i.e. a re-expression that is less general than) the Teas (1993) NQ model.

TI DETERMINANTS OF LONG-TERM ORIENTATION IN BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Marketing managers must know the time orientation of a customer to select and use marketing tools that correspond to the time horizons of the customer. Insufficient understanding of a customer's time orientation can lead to problems, such as attempting a relationship marketing when transaction marketing is more appropriate. The author suggests that long-term orientation in a buyer/seller relationship is a function of two main factors: mutual dependence and the extent to which they trust one another. Dependence and trust are related to environmental uncertainty, transaction-specific investments, reputation, and satisfaction in a buyer/seller relationship. The framework presented here is tested with 124 retail buyers and 52 vendors supplying to those retailers. The results indicate that trust and dependence play key roles in determining the long-term orientation of both retail buyers and their vendors. The results also indicate that both similarities and differences exist across retailers and vendors with respect to the effects of several variables on long-term orientation, dependence, and trust.

AB The author empirically examines the efficiency of scanner checkout systems by calculating the rates of underrings and overrings occurring in stores employing scanner systems. Actual purchases were used to calculate error rates across three shopping trips to each of 15 stores. The results reveal that both underring and overring rates are significantly higher than retailers' expectations. Though these rates are equivalent across regular-priced purchases, they systematically favor the retailer for purchases of advertised specials and items on end-of-aisle displays. The author discusses the implications of these findings for retailers, consumers, researchers, and public policymakers.

TI MANAGERIAL REPRESENTATIONS OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Managers use mental models of markets to simplify and impose order on complex and ambiguous competitive environments and isolate points of competitive advantage or deficiency. In this study of senior managers of 190 businesses, the authors found four different types of mental models or representations of competitive advantage, varying in the emphasis placed on customer or management judgments about where and how competitors differ. These representations were influenced equally by pressure points in the environment and choice of strategy. The type of representation was also strongly associated with constrained patterns of information search and usage, raising the possibility that the necessary simplifications and narrowing of perspective may come at the cost of myopia and insensitivity to challenges from unexpected directions. There was also a strong association between the completeness of the managerial representation and relative financial performance, which supports related studies on the profitability of a market orientation.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors outline a conceptual framework for analyzing differences in competitive marketing behavior of businesses in established industrial markets. They explicitly distinguish between retaliatory and cooperative marketing behavior. The structural characteristics of the served markets and the competitive positions of businesses are postulated to affect the nature and likelihood of retaliatory and cooperative behavior with respect to price and sales force expenditures. The authors specify different models explaining these dimensions of competitive marketing behavior at the strategic business unit level and test their hypotheses by estimating the various competitive behavior models using relevant data obtained from the PIMS (Profit Impact of Market Strategies) Program. The empirical results support several theoretical arguments and provide insights into the determinants of competitive marketing behavior in industrial markets.

AB Delays in service are becoming increasingly common; yet their effects on service evaluations are relatively unknown. The author presents a model of the wait experience, which assesses the effects of delay duration, attribution for the delay, and degree to which time is filled, on affective and evaluative reactions to the delay. An empirical test of the model with delayed airline passengers reveals that delays do affect service evaluations; however, this impact is mediated by negative affective reactions to the delay. The degree to which the service provider is perceived to have control and the degree to which the delayed customer's time is filled also indirectly affect service evaluations, mediated by the customers' affective reactions of uncertainty and anger.

TI THE EFFECT OF EFFORT ON SALES PERFORMANCE AND JOB-SATISFACTION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors address a fundamental gap in understanding how sales performance and job satisfaction are determined in an investigation of the sales force of a direct-selling organization. Results indicate a direct positive effect of work-related effort on job satisfaction that is not mediated by sales performance. This is inconsistent with commonly accepted theoretical models and suggests that the perspective of work as a ''terminal value'' (i.e., an end in itself, rather than strictly a means to an end) has been underemphasized in models of work behavior. As such, either (1) measures of sales performance should be broadened to encompass the terminal value perspective on the psychological value of work or (2) conceptual models should be revised to reflect that narrowly defined measures of sales performance do not completely mediate the effect of effort on job satisfaction. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial implications of these findings.

AB Marketing universals are defined as consumer behaviors within a segment and toward a particular product category that are invariant across cultures. Using several definitions of culture and three different criteria for universality, the authors evaluate whether the use of brand, price, retailer reputation, and physical product appearance as signals of quality are marketing universals for consumer electronics products. Using a sample representing 38 nationalities, they find that there are few differences in the use of quality signals across cultures for a high priority segment of consumers. They draw conclusions for the adaptation versus standardization debate and argue that certain behaviors are likely to be universal, whereas others are not. Understanding such differences is essential to designing international marketing strategies.

TI SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATIONAL BUYING - ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN AS A
   NONECONOMIC BUYING CRITERION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The greening of corporate America has added a new and different type of criterion to some organizational buying decisions-social responsibility. Scholars have given little attention to such noneconomic buying criteria. On the basis of a study of 35 buying processes in ten organizations and an in-depth examination of 21 of those processes, the author addresses how and why socially responsible buying comes about in organizations. The findings suggest that two factors have been key to the success of socially responsible buying initiatives. One factor is the presence of a skillful policy entrepreneur. Policy entrepreneurs are found to have many of the same characteristics as business entrepreneurs, but invest their resources in instituting new organizational policies. Their zeal for socially responsible buying is rooted in a commitment based on a complex and often difficult process of moral reasoning. The second factor influencing the success of socially responsible buying is the organizational context within which policy entrepreneurs operate. The author differentiates organizational contexts on the basis of whether the socially responsible buying is part of a deliberate corporate strategy and further classifies them through a framework and identifies themes observed across the contexts. Guidance is offered for vendors marketing socially responsible products and services.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Relationship marketing-establishing, developing, and maintaining successful relational exchanges-constitutes a major shift in marketing theory and practice. After conceptualizing relationship marketing and discussing its ten forms, the authors (1) theorize that successful relationship marketing requires relationship commitment and trust, (2) model relationship commitment and trust as key mediating variables, (3) test this key mediating variable model using data from automobile tire retailers, and (4) compare their model with a rival that does not allow relationship commitment and trust to function as mediating variables. Given the favorable test results for the key mediating variable model, suggestions for further explicating and testing it are offered.

TI LEARNING ORIENTATION, WORKING SMART, AND EFFECTIVE SELLING
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Learning and performance goal orientations, two motivational orientations that guide salespeople's behavior, are related to working smart and hard. Working smart is defined as the engagement in activities that serve to develop knowledge of sales situations and utilize this knowledge in selling behavior. It is found that a learning goal orientation motivates working both smart and hard, whereas a performance goal orientation motivates only working hard. The goal orientations also are found to be alterable through supervisory feedback. Furthermore, self-efficacy, sales-people's confidence in their overall selling abilities, is found to moderate some of the relationships with the goal orientations.

TI CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, MARKET SHARE, AND PROFITABILITY - FINDINGS FROM
   SWEDEN
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Are there economic benefits to improving customer satisfaction? Many firms that are frustrated in their efforts to improve quality and customer satisfaction are beginning to question the link between customer satisfaction and economic returns. The authors investigate the nature and strength of this link. They discuss how expectations, quality, and price should affect customer satisfaction and why customer satisfaction, in turn, should affect profitability; this results in a set of hypotheses that are tested using a national customer satisfaction index and traditional accounting measures of economic returns, such as return on investment. The findings support a positive impact of quality on customer satisfaction, and, in tum, profitability. The authors demonstrate the economic benefits of increasing customer satisfaction using both an empirical forecast and a new analytical model. In addition, they discuss why increasing market share actually might lead to lower customer satisfaction and provide preliminary empirical support for this hypothesis. Finally, two new findings emerge: First, the market's expectations of the quality of a firm's output positively affects customers' overall satisfaction with the firm; and second, these expectations are largely rational, albeit with a small adaptive component.

TI NATIONAL BOUNDARIES, BORDER ZONES, AND MARKETING STRATEGY - A
   CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK AND THEORETICAL-MODEL OF SECONDARY BOUNDARY EFFECTS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Although national boundaries figure centrally in the definition of international marketing, the topic has not been explored fully. The author attempts to remedy this by surveying national boundary concepts and introducing a theoretical model and propositions describing the influence land boundaries have on actors in their immediate vicinity, the border zone. Dynamic national systems meet at national boundaries, and the resulting discontinuities produce spatial complexities critically important to marketing behavior in the border zone. Implications for market strategies and government policy are provided.

TI THE INTERFACE BETWEEN COMPETITIVE MARKET SIGNALING AND ANTITRUST-LAW
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors examine the antitrust implications of certain market behavior, using recent findings from research on competitive market signaling. They show that certain behavior of a firm that is sometimes thought to raise antitrust concerns should be viewed as a natural and permissible facet of competitive interplay in the market. Conversely, they identify other market behavior that should be viewed with much more caution due to the antitrust risks of such behavior. The authors offer new perspectives on the motives and intentions that drive market behavior but may or may not raise antitrust concerns. They also show how competitive signaling research holds considerable promise for a better understanding of when serious antitrust issues are or are not triggered by particular market actions.

TI COMPETITIVE INTERFERENCE EFFECTS IN CONSUMER MEMORY FOR ADVERTISING -
   THE ROLE OF BRAND FAMILIARITY
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Although consumers often encounter ads for familiar brands, previous advertising interference studies have used ads for low-familiarity brands. The authors focus on brand familiarity's role in increasing ad memorability and moderating competitive interference. They conducted a factorial experiment varying the familiarity of brands featured in test and competing ads. With differences in ad executions, prior exposure, processing objectives, and exposure time experimentally controlled, subjects displayed substantially better recall of new product information for familiar brands. Their findings suggest that established brands have important advantages in advertising: Consumers should be more likely to recall ad information, and their memory should be less affected by exposure to competitors' ads. The authors conclude with implications for the marketing of new and mature brands.

TI DYADIC BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN A BUSINESS NETWORK CONTEXT
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB In business-to-business settings, dyadic relationships between firms are of paramount interest.  Recent developments in business practice strongly suggest that to understand these business relationships, greater attention must be directed to the embedded context within which dyadic business relationships take place.  The authors provide a means for understanding the connectedness of these relationships.  They then conduct a substantive validity assessment to furnish some empirical support that the constructs they propose are sufficiently well delineated and to generate some suggested measures for them.  They conclude with a prospectus for research on business relationships within business networks.

TI EDLP, HI-LO, AND MARGIN ARITHMETIC
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors examine the viability of an ''everyday low price'' (EDLP) strategy in the supermarket grocery industry.  In two series of field experiments in 26 product categories conducted in an 86-store grocery chain, they find that a 10% EDLP category price decrease led to a 3% sales volume increase, whereas a 10% Hi-Lo price increase led to a 3% sales decrease.  Because consumer demand did not respond much to changes in everyday price, they found large differences in profitability.  An EDLP policy reduced profits by 18%, and Hi-Lo pricing increased profits by 15%.  In a third study, the authors increase the frequency of shallow price deals in the context of higher everyday prices and find a 3% increase in unit volume and a 4% increase in profit.  Finally, they draw a conceptual distinction between ''value pricing'' at the back door and EDLP pricing at the front door.

   QUALITY
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors examine the relative importance of extrinsic versus intrinsic cues in determining perceptions of store brand quality in an experiment using a sample of 1564 shoppers for five products.  Results of the experiment suggest that consumers' evaluations of store brand grocery items are driven primarily by the extrinsic cues that these products display rather than intrinsic characteristics.  In addition, the authors found that a value for money orientation taken by retailers in the marketing of their private label lines may represent a suboptimal strategy; they recommend a quality orientation.

TI THE CAPABILITIES OF MARKET-DRIVEN ORGANIZATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Considerable progress has been made in identifying market-driven businesses, understanding what they do, and measuring the bottom-line consequences of their orientation to their markets.  The next challenge is to understand how this organizational orientation can be achieved and sustained.  The emerging capabilities approach to strategic management, when coupled with total quality management, offers a rich array of ways to design change programs that will enhance a market orientation.  The most distinctive features of market-driven organizations are their mastery of the market sensing and customer linking capabilities.  A comprehensive change program aimed at enhancing these capabilities includes:  (1) the diagnosis of current capabilities, (2) anticipation of future needs for capabilities, (3) bottom-up redesign of underlying processes, (4) top-down direction and commitment, (5) creative use of information technology, and (6) continuous monitoring of progress.

They conducted one field survey, two laboratory experiments, and one field experiment to test hypothesized effects.  The results generally support the hypotheses, indicating that causal attributions can either raise or lower expectancy, depending on certain underlying conditions.  The results also suggest that salespeople's prior experience may moderate the effect of attribution on expectancy change.  These findings have important implications for sales managers as coaches and trainers.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF COWORKER FEEDBACK ON SALESPEOPLE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors investigate the effects of four types of coworker feedback-positive output, negative output, positive behavioral, negative behavioral-on salespeople's role clarity, satisfaction, and performance.  These effects are further hypothesized to be contingent on salespeople's characteristics (e.g., need for conformity), their ability to provide self-feedback, and coworker characteristics (e.g., competence).  The results suggest that behavioral feedback provided by coworkers is more functional than output feedback and that positive coworker feedback is more functional than negative feedback.  Moreover, negative behavioral feedback provided by coworkers appears to have a dysfunctional impact on salespeople's performance.  The contingency hypotheses are not supported.  The study findings provide insights into the appropriateness of alternative types of organizational climates and suggest managerially actionable implications.  The authors conclude by suggesting several directions for research.

TI CRITICAL SERVICE ENCOUNTERS - THE EMPLOYEES VIEWPOINT
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB In service settings, customer satisfaction is often influenced by the quality of the interpersonal interaction between the customer and the contact employee.  Previous research has identified the sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction in service encounters from the customer's point of view; this study explores these sources in service encounters from the contact employee's point of view.  Drawing on insights from role, script, and attribution theories, 774 critical service encounters reported by employees of the hotel, restaurant, and airline industries are analyzed and compared with previous research.  Results generally support the theoretical predictions and also identify an additional source of customer dissatisfaction-the customer's own misbehavior.  The findings have implications for business practice in managing service encounters, employee empowerment and training, and managing customers.

TI LONG-TERM MANUFACTURER SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS - DO THEY PAY OFF FOR
   SUPPLIER FIRMS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Recently, there has been a growing trend toward long-term relationships between manufacturers and their suppliers. Although much as been written about the benefits of this shift to manufacturers, little is known about the benefits to supplier firms. In this study, we empirically assess the impact of long-term relationships with specific customers on the performance of supplier firms using cross-sectional and longitudinal information available in the Compustat collection of data bases and the Compact Disclosure data base. Our results indicate that maintaining long-term relationships with select customers does not come at the expense of the tate of sales growth. Suppliers in long-term relationships are able to achieve the same level of growth as firms that employ a transactional approach to servicing their customers. These suppliers are able to reduce costs over time through better inventory utilization; however, this reduction in cost seems to be bargained away by their customers through lower prices over time. Finally, the supplier firms in long-term relationships achieve higher profitability by differentially reducing their discretionary expenses such as selling, general, and administrative overhead costs to a greater extent than their counterparts who use a transactional approach to servicing their customers.

TI CONSUMER TRADE-OFFS AND THE EVALUATION OF SERVICES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The evaluation of services by consumers in terms of service attributes that should have an impact on judgments as well as the nature of the judgments themselves are investigated. A conjoint analysis is used to examine subjects' utilities for service alternatives that differ in terms of price, level of quality, friendliness of the service personnel, and the degree of customization of the service. The impact on subjects' utilities was studied in relation to several factors, including the type of service industry being evaluated (i.e., experience or credence services); the criticality of the service situation (i.e., high or low importance that the service be executed well); and the type of evaluative judgment asked of the respondent (i.e., ratings of subjects' anticipated satisfaction, value, or likelihood of purchase). The results indicate that all service attributes are important to consumers and that their importance varies with the mediating factors. For example, consumers ate price sensitive for less critical purchase situations, whereas quality is more important for credence services. The findings allow for a parsimonious theoretical explanation based on risk and the clarification of some constructs in the area of consumer evaluations.

TI SOFTWARE PIRACY - ESTIMATION OF LOST SALES AND THE IMPACT ON SOFTWARE
   DIFFUSION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Software piracy by users has been identified as the worst problem facing the software industry today. Software piracy permits the shadow diffusion of a software parallel to its legal diffusion in the marketplace, increasing its user base over time. Because of this software shadow diffusion, a software firm loses potential profits, access to a significant proportion of the software user base, opportunities for cross-selling, and marketing its other products and new generations of the software. However, shadow diffusion may influence the legal diffusion of the software. Software pirates may influence potential software users to adopt the software, and some of these adopters may become buyers. A diffusion modeling approach is suggested to track shadow diffusion and the legal diffusion of a software over time. The approach enables management to estimate (1) the pirated adoptions over time and (2) the percentage of legal adoptions due to the influence of pirates. The modeling approach is applied to study the diffusion of two types of software (spreadsheets and word processors) in the United Kingdom. The results suggest that although six of every seven software users utilized pirated copies, these pirates were responsible for generating more than 80% of new software buyers, thereby significantly influencing the legal diffusion of the software. The implications of these results are discussed.

Public Service Commission (1980) to expand significantly the power of the government at ail levels to regulate advertising and other promotional activities. As a result, first amendment protection for commercial speech has steadily diminished. In this article, Supreme Court decisions subsequent to Central Hudson are reviewed to provide an update of Cohen's (1978) work. In addition, the current standard for identifying commercial speech is analyzed, and managerial recommendations are made to guide managers who are responsible for making promotional decisions in this increasingly restricted area.

TI ORGANIZING FOR EFFECTIVE NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT - THE MODERATING ROLE
   OF PRODUCT INNOVATIVENESS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Marketing and sales personnel are frequently called on to work with-and sometimes to lead-specialists from other functional areas in the development of new products and services. Such cross-functional interactions can be structured and coordinated in a variety of ways, from bureaucratic approaches to more decentralized participatory mechanisms. Recently, cross-functional team structures have received a great deal of positive press. However, this paper questions whether teams are a universal panacea for shortening development times and improving success rates across all types of projects. It presents a contingency model based on resource dependency theory, which suggests that more participative structures are likely to improve the effectiveness and timeliness of the development process when the product being developed is truly new and innovative. However, the model also predicts that more bureaucratic structures may produce better outcomes on less innovative projects, such as those involving line extensions or product improvements. An empirical test involving 45 projects from 12 firms in widely varying industries substantially supports the model's predictions. The findings indicate that the better the fit between the newness of the product concept and the participativeness of the coordination mechanism used the better the outcomes of the development process in terms of (1) objective measures of product and team performance, (2) the attitudes of team members toward the process, and (3) the efficiency and timeliness of the new product development process.

Making use of event study methods, the authors assess whether and how the stock market return-a measure of the change in expected future cash flows-associated with a brand extension announcement depends on these brand equity components. The empirical analysis indicates that stock market participants' responses to brand extension announcements, consistent with the trade-offs inherent in brand leveraging, depend interactively and nonmonotonically on brand attitude and familiarity.

TI THE STRUCTURE OF COMMITMENT IN EXCHANGE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Commitment is an essential part of successful long-term relationships. Whereas commitments by both parties in an exchange can provide the foundation for development of relational social norms, disproportionate commitments can lead to opportunism by the less committed partner. The authors study the effect of the credibility and propertionality of commitment inputs in an exchange upon the development of relational social norms, opportunism, and long-term commitment intentions. They also investigate longitudinal effects of the credibility of long-term commitment intentions, relational social norms, and opportunism in one time period on commitment inputs and long-term commitment intentions in later periods. Data gathered from a behavioral simulation suggest that (1) the credibility of commitment inputs in exchange is positively related to the development of relational social norms, (2) and is positively related to long-term commitment intentions in the same time period, (3) relational social norms may be undermined by opportunistic conduct, and (4) the presence of relational social norms in one time period is positively related to commitment inputs and long-term commitment intentions in later periods.

The main vehicle upon which the Journal of Marketing relies for achieving these goals is the publication of full-length articles that are grounded in scholarly research. However, two other sections of the Journal, the Literature Review and the Book Reviews, also play a vital role in fulfilling its editorial goals. The former section informs JM readers about developments that have appeared in related journals, whereas the tatter focuses on providing critical reviews of influential books.

TI THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE THEORY OF COMPETITION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB A new theory of competition is evolving in the strategy literature.  The authors explicate the foundations of this new theory, the ''comparative advantage theory of competition,'' and contrast them with the neoclassical theory of perfect competition.  They argue that the new theory of competition explains key macro and micro phenomena better than neoclassical perfect competition theory.  Finally, they further explicate the theory of comparative advantage by evaluating a market orientation as a potential resource for comparative advantage.

TI INDUCING MULTILINE SALESPEOPLE TO ADOPT HOUSE BRANDS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB How can multiline providers induce their salespeople to sell house brands?  Using both unobtrusive measures (archival data) and direct questions, the authors model the extent to which salespeople adopt house brands, as well as the salesperson's perception that selling house brands can pose contractual hazards and his or her dependence upon the employer.  Results indicate that adoption of house brands is most pronounced for salespeople who are habitually successful, are more dependent on the firm, or receive high levels of company training.  In contrast, salespeople who resist house brands perceive that selling these products threatens their customer bond, have greater experience as a salesperson, and are more oriented to external than to internal sources of information.  The authors discuss implications of the findings in terms of developing ways for multiline providers to manage independent-minded salespeople.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Would regular users of established brands be susceptible to the influence of advertisements that are repeated more than the competition, even if they have heard the advertisements before?  The authors conducted an experiment to find out.  They paid careful attention to ecological validity and accurate preference measurement, designing an experiment to measure the incremental effect of advertising repetition on awareness, preference shifts, and brand choice.  They discuss the results of the experiment in terms of implications for managers, further research on advertising repetition, and theory development.

   FRAMEWORK
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Although unethical marketing behaviors of corporations have been studied and some normative frameworks suggested for judging their ethicality, no research has focused on assessing individual responsibilities of marketing executives for the consequences of their unethical actions.  The author identifies major factors that exonerate executive responsibility and those that enhance.  He derives ten testable research propositions that constitute the framework for the diagnostic model.  The model challenges marketing executives to go beyond legal and attributional responsibilities to appropriational responsibilities of commitment to consumers they serve.

TI RETURN ON QUALITY (ROQ) - MAKING SERVICE QUALITY FINANCIALLY ACCOUNTABLE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Many companies have been disappointed by a lack of results from their quality efforts.  The financial benefits of quality, which had been assumed as a matter of faith in the ''religion of quality,'' are now being seriously questioned by cost-cutting executives, who cite the highly publicized financial failures of some companies prominent in the quality movement.  In this increasingly results-oriented environment, managers must now justify their quality improvement efforts financially.  The authors present the ''return on quality'' approach, which is based on the assumptions that (1) quality is an investment, (2) quality efforts must be financially accountable, (3) it is possible to spend too much on quality, and (4) not all quality expenditures are equally valid.  The authors then provide a managerial framework that can be used to guide quality improvement efforts.  This framework has several attractive features, including ensured managerial relevance and financial accountability.

The author reports results of a critical incident study conducted among more than 500 service customers.  The research identifies more than 800 critical behaviors of service firms that caused customers to switch services.  Customers' reasons for switching services were classified into eight general categories.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The physical form or design of a product is an unquestioned determinant of its marketplace success. A good design attracts consumers to a product, communicates to them, and adds value to the product by increasing the quality of the usage experiences associated with it. Nevertheless, the topic of product design is rarely it ever, encountered in marketing journals. To bring needed attention to the subject of product design and enable researchers to better investigate design issues, the author introduces a conceptual model and several propositions that describe how the form of a product relates to consumers' psychological and behavioral responses. After presenting this model, the author describes numerous strategic implications and research directions.

TI VENDOR CONSIDERATION AND SWITCHING BEHAVIOR FOR BUYERS IN
   HIGH-TECHNOLOGY MARKETS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB High-technology markets represent unique problems for organizational buyers and, in turn, for their existing and potential vendors. These problems are due to high levels of uncertainty and the presence of switching costs tied to existing technologies or vendors. The authors focus on two aspects of buyer decision making in such markets: (1) whether buyers include new vendors at the consideration stage of the process and (2) whether they switch to new vendors at the choice stage. Using survey data from organizational buyers' purchases of computer workstation equipment, the authors present a joint test of the antecedent conditions that influence the two processes. Based on a sequential legit model, they show that individual antecedents have different effects on consideration and switching behavior. The authors then discuss the implications of their study for the literatures on high-technology markets and organizational buyer behavior.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB On the basis of an extensive review of the literature, the authors have developed a framework of entry deterrence strategy. The major aspects of this framework are the interconnected elements of the competitive environment; the choice of entry deterrence strategy, ranging from strategies involving a single element of the marketing mix to corporate-level strategies; and the consequences that both the strategy choice and subsequent entry decision have for the incumbent. The authors' framework explicitly acknowledges the role of perceptions in signal detection, interpretation, and decision making in the development of entry deterrence strategy. With their framework as a focal point, they review the extant literature to make it accessible to a wider audience and provide guidance for further research.

TI THE ECONOMIC WORTH OF CELEBRITY ENDORSERS - AN EVENT STUDY ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Celebrity endorsement has become a prevalent form of advertising in the United States. Despite extensive literature on the effects of celebrity endorsements on consumers' brand attitudes and purchase intentions, little is known about the economic Value of these endorsements. Research on this topic has typically focused on theories explaining how celebrity endorsements influence consumers' attitudes and intentions. The authors assess the impact of celebrity endorsement contracts on the expected profitability of a firm by using event study methodology. Their approach assumes that the announcement of a celebrity endorsement contract, usually widely publicized in the business press, is used as information by market analysts to evaluate the potential profitability of endorsement expenditures, thereby affecting the firm's expected return. Announcements of 110 celebrity endorsement contracts were analyzed. Results indicate that, on average, the impact of these announcements on stock returns is positive and suggest that celebrity endorsement contracts are generally viewed as a worthwhile investment in advertising.

A market orientation, complemented by an entrepreneurial drive, provides the cultural foundation for organizational learning. However, as important as market orientation and entrepreneurship are, they must be complemented by an appropriate climate to produce a ''learning organization''. The authors describe the processes through which organizations develop and use new knowledge to improve performance. They propose a set of organizational elements that comprise the learning organization and conclude with recommendations for research to contribute to the understanding of learning organizations.

Their analysis indicates that the show provided positive economic returns to the firm. They also provide evidence that the show had positive effects on generating product awareness and interest. Although their research studies a single firm and the effect of a single show, the authors' results indicate that, under carefully controlled conditions, the returns from trade show investments can indeed be measured and quantified and that extensions of their approach may have broad applicability.

The authors develop the Entry Strategy Performance Model (ESPM) and propose an encompassing framework for product entry strategy research. They empirically test a research model derived from the ESPM through an examination and replication in the microcomputer software market. The authors' significant findings are that initial competitive positioning and media coverage (an atypical market characteristic) drive long-term performance.

TI ORDER OF ENTRY AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE - AN EMPIRICAL SYNTHESIS AND
   REEXAMINATION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB One stream of research for order of entry effects focuses on the possibility that the order of entry exerts a direct impact on business performance. A second stream of research, the contingency perspective, debates the merits of whether the order of entry, in combination with other market strategy and marketplace variables, is what actually drives business performance. The findings from studies focusing on possible direct effects offer only mixed evidence in favor of a pioneering advantage. The contingency perspective; however, has not been subjected to systematic, empirical scrutiny. Against this backdrop, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of the pioneering-market share findings and an examination of the contingency perspective of order of entry effects. The findings from the meta-analysis reveal that, on average, earlier entry is associated with greater market share. The findings from the contingency analysis, however, offer evidence suggesting that the contingency perspective is the more valid perspective for capturing the association between order of entry and market share. The authors discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings and several directions for further research.

TI AN EMPIRICAL-INVESTIGATION OF CONSUMER MEMORY, ATTITUDE, AND PERCEPTIONS
   TOWARD PIONEER AND FOLLOWER BRANDS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors' study provides the first survey-based approach for examining consumer cognitions, affect, and reported behavior toward pioneer brands. Prior consumer research on pioneers has largely focused on automatic learning effects that are based on order of exposure. An entirely different issue is whether it matters to consumers to know, years after the product's introduction when follower brands are also available, that a particular brand was the product pioneer. The authors test six hypotheses, focusing on this issue as well as on new consumer behavior explanations for pioneer brand advantage. They find consumers to have a positive attitude toward pioneer brands in general, which is partially explained by their favorable perceptions of pioneer brands. In addition, a similarity is found between pioneer brand image and individual ideal self-image, which suggests that an association or desire for consistency between the two may be another explanation for favorable attitude and positive purchase intentions toward pioneer brands. The authors' findings support the idea that a potentially enduring, relatively inimitable competitive advantage may be created by the act of ''pioneership.''

TI UNDERSTANDING THE BOND OF IDENTIFICATION - AN INVESTIGATION OF ITS
   CORRELATES AMONG ART-MUSEUM MEMBERS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Identification is defined as the ''perceived oneness with or belongingness to an organization'' of which the person is a member. The authors propose that customers, in their role as members, identify with organizations. They use social identity theory to propose and test a model that relates members' identification with the focal organization to (1) organizational and product characteristics, (2) members' affiliation characteristics, and (3) members' activity characteristics. Their empirical setting consists of the members of an art museum. Their survey findings show that members' identification is positively related to perceived organizational prestige, donating activity, tenure of membership, visiting frequency, and confirmation of member expectations with the organization's services. However, members' participation in similar organizations is negatively related to identification with the focal organization. The authors discuss how this study can be extended to other marketing contexts and how managers can use the notion of identification in implementing marketing strategies.

The recognition of select trade characters tended to increase with the age of the child. The level of recognition and favorable attitude toward the product were positively associated with age except for cigarettes. The attitude for cigarettes and matches were negatively associated with age. Because the possibility of demand artifacts cannot be ruled out, these findings must be interpreted with caution.

TI INFLUENCE STRATEGIES IN BUYING CENTERS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Research on influence strategies has typically been conducted in interorganizational settings. In a departure from this tradition, the authors focus on influence strategies used by managers in buying centers. They develop a three-dimensional framework for classifying six prominent influence strategies-threats, promises, recommendations, requests, legalistic pleas, and information exchange. Drawing on this framework, the authors argue that the use of a particular influence strategy by a manager is likely to be related to two classes of antecedents: source and target characteristics. Additionally, they draw on the framework to argue that the effectiveness of alternative influence strategies is likely to vary in predictable ways. The authors investigate the pervasiveness of each of the six influence strategies in a study of 187 purchasing decisions and compare the findings to those previously obtained in interorganizational settings. Findings pertaining to the study's hypotheses provide insights into the relative effectiveness of the six influence strategies and the conditions under which certain influence strategies are more likely to be used.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Retailers offer temporary price promotions to attract shoppers to stores and encourage them to purchase regular price merchandise. Existing research has found little evidence that price promotions affect regular price sales, possibly because published studies have not directly examined individual purchase baskets to determine if shoppers buying promoted items also purchase regular price items. The authors match actual purchases of individual shoppers with an in-store survey to determine the relationship between regular price and promotion purchasing. The results show a significant, positive relationship between regular price and promotion purchases. Among shoppers who identify the promotion as one of their reasons for visiting the store, three-fourths make regular price purchases. On average, these shoppers spend more money on regular price merchandise than on promotion merchandise. Also, the results show that shoppers visiting the store for the promotion are no less profitable to the store than other shoppers.

TI In pursuit of an ideal: The editorial and literary history of the
   Journal of Marketing
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The occasion of the diamond jubilee for the Journal of Marketing affords an opportunity to chronicle its editorial and literary history in pursuit of an ideal, namely, the advancement of science and practice in marketing. This ideal has been expressed in different ways, variously manifested in over 3000 published articles during the past 60 years, and most recently embodied in the Journal of Marketing's transformation into a scholarly-professional journal. The narration and explanation of this transformation is the subject of the author's commemorative essay.

TI Price discrimination using in-store merchandising
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors compare the effectiveness of in-store coupons and straight off-the-shelf price discounts (bonus buys), in generating incremental sales and profits for the retailer. In five field tests, they find that, on average, in-store coupons lead to a 35% greater increase in the promoted brand's sales than bonus buys offering the same level of discount. Because redemption rates average 55%, in-store coupons produce a 108% greater increase in dollar profits than bonus buys. Both promotion vehicles have the same effect on the rest of the category, so coupons lead to higher overall category sales and profits. The authors develop a unified decision framework for a retailer maximizing category profits, that considers the trade-offs involved in using coupons and bonus buys in response to bill-back trade deals. Their empirical application in the ready-to-eat cereal category shows that the retailer passes through larger amounts of a trade deal when using in-store coupons. As a consequence, at the optimal discount level, unit category sales and dollar category profits are substantially higher with coupons. Robustness checks show that the findings hold over a wide range of parameter values and are, thus, generalizable.

TI Advertising strategies to increase usage frequency
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Interest has been shifting from how consumers choose brands to how they use brands. The authors focus on how advertising can best encourage consumers to use a mature brand in a new situation. They develop a schema congruity framework that integrates comparison advertising with substitution-in-use research. The framework suggests that situation comparison ads favorably affect usage attitudes, but have no advantage over product comparison ads in enhancing a person's ability to recall the target brand in the target situation. The authors' empirical study shows increases in brand usage. The authors conclude with implications for brand managers and researchers.

TI Premarket forecasting really new products
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors illustrate how a firm can face the challenge of forecasting consumer reaction for a really-new product. For the case of an electric vehicle, the authors describe how one firm combines managerial judgment and state-of-the-art market measurement to determine whether (1) the really-new product would be a viable business venture at its target launch date, (2) the firm should plan for improvements in technology that would reduce price and/or increase benefits enough so that the business venture would be profitable, or (3) the firm should stop development. The new market measurement system combines existing methods with a multimedia virtual-buying environment that conditions respondents for future situations, simulates user experience, and encourages consumers to actively search for information on the product. The authors comment on the advantages and disadvantages of the methodology and summarize the lessons they have learned from this application.

AB The increasing globalization of markets and businesses and the criticality of new products to business performance make the relationship between national culture and new product development an important area for academic research and managerial practice. By means of a literature review, the authors attempt to provide an understanding of this relationship in terms of the links between new product development on the one hand and the five dimensions of national culture-individualism, power distance, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, and Confucian dynamic-on the other. They advance several propositions for additional research, develop a conceptual model, and identity directions for further exploration of the relationship.

TI Emerging role of technology licensing in the development of global
   product strategy: Conceptual framework and research propositions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB In the context of mode of entry into new markets, existing theory tends to identify technology licensing as a step toward or an alternative to wholly owned subsidiaries. However, recent trends in technology licensing indicate that technology licensing is used increasingly as a conscious, proactive component of a technology-based firm's global product strategy. The authors present a conceptual framework from the licensor's perspective on technology licensing by combining the existing literature and licensing practices in industry to identify the antecedent product market, industry level, and resource-based factors that lead to technology licensing. They also present propositions on how these factors affect technology licensing and conclude by linking technology licensing to different dimensions of a firm's product strategy.

TI Dimensions and types of supervisory control: Effects on salesperson
   performance and satisfaction
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors extend the conceptual work of Anderson and Oliver (1987) and Jaworski (1988) on control in three ways. First, they account for the independent effects of the reinforcement dimension of control, in addition to the information dimension traditionally studied. Second, to reflect the varied behaviors that supervisors attempt to control, they disaggregate behavior control into activity control and capability control. Third, they delineate the direct and mediated effects of control on salespeople. Their proposed framework was tested with data collected from 270 salespeople in five industrial product divisions of two Fortune 500 companies. The findings suggest that managers must carefully match controls-in-use with desired results. Overall, the results show that information and reinforcement effects vary, which suggests the need to distinguish between the information provided and the actual reinforcements administered to salespeople. They also show that activity and capability control have different effects and draw a sharp distinction between two types of behavior control. Finally, the results suggest that supervisory controls primarily have indirect effects on salesperson performance, but both direct and indirect effects on satisfaction

TI The last straw? Cigarette advertising and realized market shares among
   youths and adults, 1979-1993
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors test the hypotheses that parameters of advertising sensitivity for adolescents are significant and perhaps larger than those for adults. Cigarette brand shares of advertising voice are found to be significantly related to realized market shares, with advertising sensitivity being about three times larger among teenagers than among adults. This result is robust to various analytic assumptions and converges with strategic analysis, consumer behavior theory and research, econometric metanalyses, historical research, and corporate documents. The authors argue that cigarette competition between firms is predominated by the battle of brands for market share among the young, and assertions to the contrary, without supporting evidence, should be treated with scholarly skepticism.

TI Promotional elasticities and category characteristics
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors study the relationships between product category characteristics and average brand promotional elasticity within the category. They present a framework for understanding these relationships and use it to generate hypotheses. The authors also consider three types of promotions and seven category characteristics. They study 108 product categories and use data compiled from weekly scanner data, scanner panel data, and survey data. Their results indicate that promotional elasticities are higher for categories with relatively fewer number of brands, higher category penetration, shorter interpurchase times, and higher consumer propensity to stockpile. The authors find no statistically significant relationship between promotional elasticity and either impulse buying or private label market share. They discuss the reasons for these results and their managerial implications.

TI The behavioral consequences of service quality
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB If service quality relates to retention of customers at the aggregate level, as other research has indicated, then evidence of its impact on customers' behavioral responses should be detectable. The authors offer a conceptual model of the impact of service quality on particular behaviors that signal whether customers remain with or defect from a company. Results from a multicompany empirical study examining relationships from the model concerning customers' behavioral intentions show strong evidence of their being influenced by service quality. The findings also reveal differences in the nature of the quality-intentions link across different dimensions of behavioral intentions. The authors' discussion centers on ways the results and research approach of their study can be helpful to researchers and managers.

TI Impact of salesperson attraction on sales managers' attributions and
   feedback
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors develop a model of how a salesperson's task and social attraction affect a sales manager's causal attributions explaining the salesperson's poor performance and the manager's corrective feedback based on these attributions. The authors' experimental results, based on a sample of 218 sales managers, suggest that (1) causal attributions, cognitive effort, and decision confidence are directly affected by task and social attraction; (2) the effects of task and social attraction on coercive feedback are mediated by internal attributions; and (3) external attributions play a partial, but negative, mediating role for nonpunitve feedback. The authors also find evidence that interpersonal affect directly influences manager feedback. Implications for research and practice are developed that recognize that appraisal processes are influenced by affect and attributional considerations, not simply bias and inaccuracy in rating performance itself.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The popular press has recently reported that managers of retail and service outlets are diffusing scents into their stores to create more positive environments and develop a competitive advantage. These efforts are occurring despite there being no scholarly research supporting the use of scent in store environments. The authors present a review of theoretically relevant work from environmental psychology and olfaction research and a study examining the effects of ambient scent in a simulated retail environment. In the reported study, the authors find a difference between evaluations of and behaviors in a scented store environment and those in an unscented store environment. Their findings provide guidelines for managers of retail and service outlets concerning the benefits of scenting store environments.

TI What to tell consumers in waits of different lengths: An integrative
   model of service evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors conduct an experimental study to examine the impact of two types of waiting information-waiting-duration information and queuing information-on consumers' reactions to waits of different lengths. The authors test a model that includes three different constructs-perceived waiting duration, acceptability of the wait, and affective response to the wait-as mediators between waiting information and service evaluation. Results show that though acceptability of the wait and affective response to the wait have a significant mediating effect on the relationship between waiting information and service evaluation, perceived waiting duration does not. Moreover, neither type of information has significant impact in the short-wait condition, whereas waiting-duration information has greater impact than queuing information in the intermediate-wait condition and a smaller impact in the long-wait condition. The authors conclude with a discussion of research and managerial implications.

TI Price search in the retail grocery market
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The literature has produced an incomplete understanding of factors explaining the variance in price search in markets in which search is a regularly occurring activity. The authors develop a model of price search in the retail grocery industry by expanding the classic cost-benefit model and integrating psychosocial returns and concepts from human capital theory. The results indicate that prior investment search and market mavenism explain significant amounts of variance in price- and specials-related search, respectively, beyond that accounted for by economic costs and returns. The authors further explore the habitual nature of price search in this industry, consider the implications of the social value of price-specials information, and discuss the indirect impact of demographic characteristics. They consider implications for pricing strategy and competition, including reasons why previous research has found that executives overestimate consumer price search.

TI Marketing controls and dysfunctional employee behaviors: A test of
   traditional and contingency theory postulates
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The author examines two different theories-traditional and contingency-of negative employee responses to marketing control systems. Traditional control theory draws on the humanistic perspective to suggest that controls have negative consequences because they limit employee autonomy and signal a lack of trust in employees. Contingency theory, on the other hand, posits that employee response depends on the degree to which the control used fits the job context. The author examines two types of job contexts, namely, task and supervision. Tasks are characterized along two dimensions, namely, performance documentation and procedural knowledge. Supervision is captured by three factors-the degree to which employees perceive that they are allowed to participate, that supervisors are knowledgeable about their performance, and that supervisors are considerate. Using dysfunctional behaviors as the focal negative response, the author finds stronger support for the traditional perspective compared with the contingency perspective.

TI Can package size accelerate usage volume?
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Packaging influences usage behavior long after it has influenced purchase. Managers of consumer packaged goods and public policy officials have, therefore, questioned whether a package's size influences usage volume. Although often assumed, it has never been supported. Four laboratory studies and a final study in a Laundromat identity circumstances in which larger package sizes encourage greater use than do smaller package sizes. Unit cost is a key factor mediating this relationship. After noting useful implications for decisions regarding package size portfolios, sales promotions, and public policy, the author concludes by identifying other important but overlooked factors that increase usage volume and provide research opportunities.

An empirical test of the model provides support for the hypothesized relationships and a better understanding of the mechanisms that produce satisfaction.

Yet, for many of them, soliciting adequate resources to carry out their mandates is a continuing struggle. Confronted with a growing need for their services, fierce competition from other charities, and shrinking support from government agencies, charities may turn to marketers for help in developing effective promotional strategies. Unfortunately, marketing literature is unable to provide meaningful guidance because scant research attention has hampered a fuller understanding of why people help. The authors integrate relevant research in marketing, economics, sociology, and social psychology to advance theoretical understanding of helping behavior. They develop research propositions regarding specific promotional strategies that charitable organizations can employ to elicit help.

TI Do organizational practices matter in role stress processes? A study of
   direct and moderating effects for marketing-oriented boundary spanners
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Previous research and meta-analyses suggest that the influence of organizational variables on boundary role stress processes is weak and marginal. Using the emerging work in organizational practices and configurations, the authors reexamine this relationship by addressing three critical gaps: (1) conceptualizing organizational environment as a multidimensional practices construct, (2) operationalizing the organizational environment as configurations or combinations of practices dimensions, and (3) testing for direct and moderating hypotheses. The results reveal that organizational practices matter significantly in boundary role stress processes. The findings show that procedural environments are dysfunctional because they engender higher levels of role stressors, reduce performance, and negatively affect the psychological well-being of boundary spanners. In contrast, the achievement and affective-oriented environments involve distinct trade-offs, because none is clearly superior. The authors discuss the theoretical implications for further research and provide recommendations for managerial practice.

TI Aggressive and predatory pricing: A framework for analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors examine competitive interaction in the context of aggressive pricing strategies. Although aggressive pricing by one firm may initially provide lower prices to consumers, the behavior also can be predatory and ultimately result in undesirable welfare consequences. To date, public policy analysis of such behavior has relied on traditional economic theory, with State and Federal policies creating conflicting guidelines for managers. The authors offer a framework for understanding aggressive and predatory pricing that incorporates research from marketing and related disciplines as well as traditional and newer streams of economic analysis. Distinguishing features of the framework include a broader delineation of indicators that potentially predatory behavior might have occurred, an expanded view of the possible motivations for aggressive and predatory pricing behavior that are not admitted into current analyses, and a more comprehensive analysis of competitors' strategic responses to such pricing and the varying consequences of these responses. They further argue that the field of marketing is uniquely positioned to provide the kind of comprehensive measurement and modeling contributions needed to create policy guidelines that can be implemented in this area.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Governance strategies, such as integration or control, structure and regulate the conduct of parties in exchange relationships; as such, they serve to constrain the latitude of the decision making of channel partners. Similarly, collaborative communication can be used to create an atmosphere of mutual support, thereby creating volitional compliance between partners. The authors develop a model that addresses the interrelationships of governance and communication and examine the effects of collaborative communication on channel outcomes (the dealer's perceptions of commitment to, satisfaction with, and coordination of activities with a focal manufacturer) across various levels of integration and control. Based on survey data collected from a national sample of computer dealers, the findings indicate that when levels of integration or manufacturer control are high, the effect of collaborative communication on outcomes is weaker than when integration or control is low.

TI The American customer satisfaction index: Nature, purpose, and findings
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) is a new type of market-based performance measure for firms, industries, economic sectors, and national economies. The authors discuss the nature and purpose of ACSI and explain the theory underlying the ACSI model, the nation-wide survey methodology used to collect the data, and the econometric approach employed to estimate the indices. They also illustrate the use of ACSI in conducting benchmarking studies, both cross-sectionally and over time. The authors find customer satisfaction to be greater for goods than for services and, in turn, greater for services than for government agencies, as well as find cause for concern in the observation that customer satisfaction in the United States is declining, primarily because of decreasing satisfaction with services. The authors estimate the model for the seven major economic sectors for which data are collected. Highlights of the findings include that (1) customization is more important than reliability in determining customer satisfaction, (2) customer expectations play a greater role in sectors in which variance in production and consumption is relatively low, and (3) customer satisfaction is more quality-driven than value- or price-driven. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications of ACSI for public policymakers, managers, consumers, and marketing in general.

TI Interdependency, contracting, and relational behavior in marketing
   channels
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The dependency structure between wholesale-distributors and their major suppliers is posited to influence the type of contract-explicit and normative-used. In turn, dependency structure and type of contract is hypothesized to influence wholesale-distributor performance. This process occurs both directly and indirectly through some intermediate constructs, such as long-term orientation, relationship length, and relational behavior. The authors investigate three dependency structures: wholesaler dependent on supplier, supplier dependent on wholesaler, and high bilateral dependency. They obtain empirical support for many of the hypothesized linkages.

TI Determinants of distribution intensity
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Within many categories of consumer products, manufacturers differ markedly in how intensively they distribute their brands among retailers. The authors enhance understanding of why such differences in distribution intensity occur. Literature in the marketing and economics disciplines on brand and channel management, agency theory, and credible commitments, combined with extensive field interviews, provides the foundation for a conceptual framework that centers on proposed moderator effects. Data collected from manufacturers in the consumer electronics industry are used to test the conceptual framework. Credible commitments by retailers in the form of contractual agreements and investments are shown to moderate the relationships of manufacturer brand strategy and channel practices with distribution intensity.

TI The management of customer-contact service employees: An empirical
   investigation
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors develop and test a model of service employee management that examines constructs simultaneously across three interfaces of the service delivery process: manager-employee, employee-role, and employee-customer. The authors examine the attitudinal and behavioral responses of customer-contact employees that can influence customers' perceptions of service quality, the relationships among these responses, and three formal managerial control mechanisms (empowerment, behavior-based employee evaluation, and management commitment to service quality). The findings indicate that managers who are committed to service quality are more likely to empower their employees and use behavior-based evaluation. However, the use of empowerment has both positive and negative consequences in the management of contact employees. Some of the negative consequences are mitigated by the positive effects of behavior-based employee evaluation. To increase customers' perceptions of service quality, managers must increase employees' self-efficacy and job satisfaction, and reduce employees' role conflict and ambiguity. Implications for the management of customer-contact service employees and directions for further research are discussed.

TI Company advertising with a social dimension: The role of noneconomic
   criteria
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The author examines company advertising campaigns with social dimensions and compares them to matched standard, or nonsocial, campaigns. The author investigates the managers' objectives for the campaigns with social dimensions, examines the processes creating them, and develops a model for explaining success factors. Most campaigns have mixed objectives, both economic and social, which have many implications. Although these campaigns are not particularly effective in achieving traditional economic objectives, such as increasing sales, they are highly effective in achieving company-oriented objectives, such as motivating the work force or communicating the essence of the company's mission. Drawing on research and theory related to organizational identification, the author discusses causal mechanisms underlying social campaigns' effectiveness with company-oriented objectives and presents directions for further research. Ethical considerations and managerial implications are discussed, as well.

TI Automatic and strategic processes in advertising effects
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The author distinguishes two kinds of cognitive processes: automatic processes, which are mostly subconscious, are learned and changed slowly and are not subject to the capacity limitations of working memory, and strategic processes, which are conscious, are subject to capacity limitations, and can easily be adapted to situational circumstances. The perception of advertising and the way it influences brand evaluation involves both processes. Automatic processes govern the recognition of advertising stimuli, the relevance decision that determines further higher-level processing, the retrieval of information, and the provision of a heuristic for brand evaluation. Strategic processes govern learning and inference formation. The relative importance of both types of processes depends on product involvement. The distinction of these two types of processes leads to some conclusions that are at variance with current notions about advertising effects. For example, the attention span problem is relevant only for strategic processes. A certain amount of learning can occur with little conscious effort, and advertising's effect on brand evaluation may be more stable for low- than for high-involvement products.

He discusses what creates market diversity and comparative advantage, why competitive markets are more efficient, how competitive markets fail, and how management of failed markets can fail. The author's goal is to demonstrate the explanatory power of the dynamic paradigm and encourage the use of it to focus on how firms can learn to improve their competitive processes.

TI The resource-advantage theory of competition: Dynamics, path
   dependencies, and evolutionary dimensions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors respond to the thoughtful concerns raised by Dickson (1996) about the issue of path dependencies and the dynamics of resource-advantage (R-A) theory (Hunt and Morgan 1995), Rather than R-A theory and Dickson's work being inconsistent, the authors point out that Hunt and Morgan (1995) cite Dickson's (1992) work on two different occasions as support for the dynamics of R-A theory. Furthermore, because R-A theory proposes that firms seek superior financial performance, when combined with the fact that all firms cannot be superior at the same time, R-A competition necessarily is dynamic. Moreover, though the issue of path-dependencies is more contentious than Dickson suggests, R-A theory fully accommodates path dependencies, because it is an evolutionary, nonconsummatory theory.

TI The effects of organizational differences and trust on the effectiveness
   of selling partner relationships
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Selling alliances that are formed to cooperatively develop and maintain customer relationships are among the new organizational forms that marketing managers utilize for competitive advantage. To be successful, these alliances require sales representatives from allied organizations to work effectively as selling partners. The authors develop a trust-based model of effective selling partner relationships and test it in the context of the computer industry. Partial Least Squares analysis of 103 dyadic relationships found that organizational differences were modest predictors of three dimensions of mutual perceived trustworthiness, which in turn differentially affected three trusting behaviors. Trusting behaviors were found to have a somewhat greater effect on perceived task performance than on mutual satisfaction, whereas dimensions of trustworthiness had both direct and indirect effects on satisfaction. The authors discuss the managerial and theoretical implications of these results.

TI The effect of output controls, process controls, and flexibility on
   export channel performance
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors examine international distribution channels in terms of the coordination processes that govern the relationship between export manufacturers and their foreign-based distributors. Although this relationship is mediated by market prices, manufacturers can enhance performance by relying on certain nonmarket forms of governance-control and flexibility-to manage their overseas channel better. The authors develop a model that examines both the contextual antecedents and the performance consequences of these nonmarket governance forms. One form of controls-output control-along with flexibility, is shown to enhance export channel performance, but another control form-process control-has no performance effect.

TI Effects of goal-directed emotions on salesperson volitions, behavior,
   and performance: A longitudinal study
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors investigate the motivational effects of emotions in a sales force context. The personal stakes that salespeople have in a goal situation triggered anticipation of emotions that result from attaining or failing to attain their performance goal. Positive anticipatory emotions were positively related to volitions and mediated the relationship between personal stakes and volitions. Goal attainment was positively related to positive outcome emotions and negatively related to negative outcome emotions, Goal-directed behavior was positively associated with positive outcome emotions, independently of goal attainment. The findings suggest that emotions are an important driving force behind sales force motivation, The authors discuss the implications for sales management, theory development, and further research.

AB Environmental concerns have begun to reshape the landscape in which global organizations compete. The demands and influences of the environmental movement are evident in the dollar value size of the environmentally conscious marketplace. In addition, the growing regulatory concerns over the environmental impact of corporate practices have begun to influence corporate strategies. The authors discuss the concept of an enviropreneurial marketing strategy, which reflects the confluence of social performance goals, corporate entrepreneurship orientations, and marketing strategy by integrating environmental concerns when developing marketing policies and practices. They provide a brief overview of the emergence of the enviropreneurial strategy paradigm, identify three types of enviropreneurial marketing strategies, and develop a model of the antecedents and consequences of an enviropreneurial marketing strategy. Finally, they conclude with a brief discussion of future research needs.

TI The company and the product: Corporate associations and consumer product
   responses
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Although brand theorists suggest that what a person knows about a company (i.e., corporate associations) can influence perceptions of the company's products, little systematic research on these effects exists. The authors examine the effects of two general types of corporate associations on product responses: One focuses on the company's capabilities for producing products, that is, corporate ability (CA) associations, and the other focuses on the company's perceived social responsibility, that is, corporate social responsibility (CSR) associations. The results of three studies, including one that measures respondents' CA and CSR associations for well-known companies and one that uses consumers recruited in a shopping mall, demonstrate that (1) what consumers know about a company can influence their beliefs about and attitudes toward new products manufactured by that company, (2) CA and CSR associations may have different effects on consumer responses to products, and (3) products of companies with negative associations are not always destined to receive negative responses. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for marketing managers and further research.

   ratio: A reanalysis
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors focus on their 1990 model (B&K; see Balasubramanian and Kumar 1990), which indicates that market share, market growth, and their interaction are important predictors of the ratio of advertising and promotional costs to sales (A&P/S). In sharp contrast, Ailawadi, Farris, and Parry's (1994; AFP) subsequent replication attempt asserts that market share and market growth are not good predictors of A&P/S. The authors' research documents serious problems in AFP's study, including erroneous model estimates caused by incorrect execution of the SAS TSCSREG procedure, pooling data for analysis in ways that cannot be justified statistically data preparation errors, and inappropriate operationalizations of market share and market growth. With regard to analyses of Profit Impact of Market Strategy and brand-level data reported by AFP, the authors again find that AFP have analyzed data in inappropriate ways, given the conceptual framework of the B&K model. Because these problems provide compelling evidence to disregard AFP's results, the authors conclude that the criticisms advanced by AFP against the B&K model are not valid.

Balasubramanian and Kumar (1997) have now listed several concerns with the authors' 1994 analysis-of which two data preparation errors are valid. However, these errors have no impact on the main thesis of the authors 1994 article-market share and market growth are not good predictors of A&P/S. The authors also have analyzed currently available COMPUSTAT data, and their findings once again invalidate Balasubramanian and Kumar's (1990) results. The authors can only reiterate their earlier conclusion-neither currently available COMPUSTAT data, Profit Impact of Market Strategy data, nor brand-level data show any significant effect of market share and market growth on A&P/S. The authors conclude that Balasubramanian and Kumar's (1990) findings are simply not valid, and there is no way to identify what exactly led to their unique results because they have not made available their original data set.

AB The authors propose a new theoretical rationale that explains the paired existence of both a manufacturer's decision to limit the number of intermediaries operating in a specific geographic market and a distributor's decision to limit brand assortment in a product category. Using transaction cost reasoning, they suggest that channel selectivity agreements can be understood as interrelated exchanges of pledges, or credible commitments, that counterbalance exposure to opportunism and neutralize sources of relationship instability, thereby strengthening an interorganizational relationship. The empirical results, which are based on dyadic data from 362 manufacturer-distributor relationships, are broadly supportive of their framework.

TI An examination of the nature of trust in buyer-seller relationships
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors integrate theory developed in several disciplines to determine five cognitive processes through which industrial buyers can develop trust of a supplier firm and its salesperson. These processes provide a theoretical framework used to identify antecedents of trust. The authors also examine the impact of supplier firm and salesperson trust on a buying firm's current supplier choice and future purchase intentions. The theoretical model is tested on data collected from more than 200 purchasing managers. The authors find that several variables influence the development of supplier firm and salesperson trust. Trust of the supplier firm and trust of the salesperson (operating indirectly through supplier firm trust) influence a buyer's anticipated future interaction with the supplier. However, after controlling for previous experience and supplier performance, neither trust of the selling firm nor its salesperson influence the current supplier selection decision.

Few marketing scholars, however, have considered the relationship between the market performance of entertainment services and the role of critics. The authors do so here. They show empirically that critical reviews correlate with late and cumulative box office receipts but do not have a significant correlation with early box office receipts. Although still far from any definitive conclusion, this finding suggests that critics, at least from an aggregate-level perspective, appear to act more as leading indicators than as opinion leaders.

TI Ethics and target marketing: The role of product harm and consumer
   vulnerability
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Target marketing might be the epitome of the marketing concept. However, in certain instances it has been criticized as unethical. The authors identify explanations for the ethical concern and controversy that can arise over targeting. An empirical study confirms public disquiet over consumer vulnerability and product harmfulness, identifies which targeting strategies are evaluated as less ethical, and highlights the likelihood of consumer boycotts and other disapproving behaviors. Evidence of ethical concern arises when both ''sin'' and ''non-sin'' products are involved, and it increases for consumers perceived to be more vulnerable. The authors discuss implications for marketing managers, researchers, and public policy.

TI The integration of marketing problem-solving modes and marketing
   management support systems
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB To be effective, decision aids for marketing managers should match with the thinking and reasoning processes of the marketing decision makers who use them. The authors take a cognitive approach to problem solving in marketing. They develop a classification of ''marketing problem-solving modes'' and distinguish four modes: optimizing, reasoning, analogizing, and creating. They also present a typology of what they call ''marketing management support systems.'' In an integrating framework, they then link the four marketing problem-solving modes with the most appropriate marketing management support systems. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications of this ''demand-side'' approach to marketing management support systems.

   incentives to participate in electronic marketplaces
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors examine the implications of electronic shopping for consumers, retailers, and manufacturers. They assume that near-term technological developments will offer consumers unparalleled opportunities to locate and compare product offerings. They examine these advantages as a function of typical consumer goals and the types of products and services being sought and offer conclusions regarding consumer incentives and disincentives to purchase through interactive home shopping vis-a-vis traditional retail formats. The authors discuss implications for industry structure as they pertain to competition among retailers, competition among manufacturers, and retailer-manufacturer relationships.

TI Enhancing communication between marketing and engineering: The
   moderating role of relative functional identification
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Using research in social psychology, the authors illustrate how two key routes to improve communication between marketing and engineering are dependent on the strength of managers' psychological connection to their functional area compared to the firm as a whole (i.e., relative functional identification). In particular, they argue that relative functional identification moderates the relationship between strategies traditionally used to affect interfunctional relationships (information-sharing norms and integrated goals) and the frequency, bidirectionality, and coerciveness of interfunctional communication behaviors. In turn, these communication behaviors are linked to information use and perceived relationship effectiveness. The authors empirically test predictions of the framework in two studies. Study 1 results suggest that (1) the efficacy of the traditional strategies depends on marketing managers' relative functional identification and (2) the traditional strategies can have negative and unintended effects on communication behaviors. In Study 2, the authors replicate and extend Study 1 by illustrating that bidirectional communication is as important as frequency in increasing both information use by engineering personnel and the perceived effectiveness of interfunctional relationships. The authors conclude with implications for theory building and managerial practice.

TI Quality tier competition: How price change influences brand choice and
   category choice
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors demonstrate that competition among brands in different quality tiers can be asymmetric both in brand choice (''what'') and in category choice (''whether''). They also investigate how competition among quality tiers is affected by the direction of price changes (increase or decrease). Empirical findings from four scanner panel data sets consistently show that with price reduction, high-quality brands gain more than do low-quality brands both in ''what'' and ''whether'' decisions. Furthermore, high-quality brands are less vulnerable to losses when prices are increased. The authors conclude with implications for understanding quality tier competition and developing price promotional strategies.

TI An investigation into the antecedents of organizational citizenship
   behaviors in a personal selling context
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors report the results of two studies that attempt to model antecedents of organizational citizenship behaviors in a personal selling context. They draw the antecedents from extant research and propose that the willingness to perform organizational citizenship behaviors is related to the job-related perceptions of the degree of organizational fit between the salesperson and his or her firm, level of leadership support, perceived fairness in reward allocation (i.e., distributive justice), and job satisfaction. They hypothesize and test direct and indirect relations with these constructs and organizational citizenship behaviors. Most of these relations were significant across the two studies.

TI Comparative versus noncomparative advertising: A meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Previous research and reviews on comparative advertising report mixed results. The authors report the results from a meta-analysis that examines the efficacy of comparative advertising, The analysis shows that comparative ads are more effective than noncomparative ads in generating attention, message and brand awareness, levels of message processing, favorable sponsored brand attitudes, and increased purchase intentions and purchase behaviors, However, comparative ads evoke lower source believability and a less favorable attitude toward the ad. Additional analyses of moderator variables find that market position (sponsor, comparison, and relative), enhanced credibility, message content, and type of dependent measure (relative versus nonrelative) affect some of the relationships between advertising format and cognition, brand attitudes, and purchase intentions, New brands comparing themselves to established brands appear to benefit most from comparative advertising.

TI Pro-social consumer influence strategies: When and how do they work?
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Whereas some arms embrace and successfully exploit pro-social consumer influence strategies (e.g., environmental positionings, cause-related promotions), other firms tend to downplay their effectiveness and are reluctant to pursue such strategies. The author's research findings reveal that important moderators, namely consumer trust in the marketing source and attributions of consumer responsibility, must be activated for pro-social positioning strategies to work. Moreover, the levels of the moderating variables appear to be critical in determining whether a pro-social positioning strategy achieves the intended effect or backfires, thereby jeopardizing product equity and market share.

TI Generalizing about trade show effectiveness: A cross-national comparison
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Trade shows are a multibillion-dollar business in the United States and the United Kingdom, but little is known about the determinants of trade show effectiveness. The authors build a model that captures differences in trade show effectiveness across industries, companies, and two countries. They focus on the differences in trade show effectiveness measured in a similar way across similar samples of 221 U.S. and 135 UK firm-show experiences between 1982 and 1993. Although the variables explain different amounts of variance in these two countries and some variables tend to have different relative effects, the similarities outweigh the differences, The authors are able to generalize about the effect of various show selection (go/not go) variables as well as tactical variables (e.g., booth size, personnel) on observed performance. They conclude by discussing the implications of their research for developing benchmarks for trade show performance.

TI Does the comparative advantage theory of competition really replace the
   neoclassical theory of perfect competition?
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The Comparative Advantage Theory of Competition (CATC) is proposed by Hunt and Morgan (1995) to replace the Neoclassical Theory of Perfect Competition (NTPC). The new theory claims to offer a better explanation for key macro and micro phenomena. The authors' purpose in this article is to evaluate the CATC's potential as a replacement for the neoclassical theory. They argue that (1) both the NTPC and CATC are offshoots of the exchange paradigm; furthermore, (2) the efficient theories in the exchange paradigm family cannot claim superiority over one another since a supracriterion for their contest is lacking; and (3) the CATC - even when considered efficient - cannot challenge the NTPC, let alone replace it. In addition to meeting a host of conditions, a successful contender must come from a new paradigm, which the CATC does not. Therefore, the replacement assertion remains unjustified.

TI Market-based assets and shareholder value: A framework for analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors develop a conceptual framework of the marketing-finance interface and discuss its implications for the theory and practice of marketing. The framework proposes that marketing is concerned with the task of developing and managing market-based assets, or assets that arise from the commingling of the firm with entities in its external environment. Examples of market-based assets include customer relationships, channel relationships, and partner relationships. Market-based assets, in turn, increase shareholder value by accelerating and enhancing cash flows, lowering the volatility and vulnerability of cash flows, and increasing the residual value of cash flows.

The results of three experimental investigations indicate that beliefs about flagship products are less vulnerable to dilution than beliefs about the parent brand name in general. The findings suggest that assessments of the impact of brand leveraging strategies should include analysis of the effects on individual products as well as on the family brand name.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The relationship between-attribute-level performance, overall satisfaction, and repurchase intentions is of critical importance to managers and generally has been conceptualized as linear and symmetric, The authors investigate the asymmetric and nonlinear nature of the relationship among these constructs, Predictions are developed and tested empirically using survey data from two different contexts: a service (health care, n = 4517) and a product (automobile, n = 9359 and n = 13,759). Results show that (1) negative performance on an attribute has a greater impact on overall satisfaction and repurchase intentions than positive performance has on that same attribute, and (2) overall satisfaction displays diminishing sensitivity to attribute-level performance, Surprisingly, results show that attribute performance has a direct impact on repurchase intentions in addition to its effect through satisfaction.

TI The effects of brand name suggestiveness on advertising recall
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The authors report the results of a laboratory experiment examining the effects of the meaningfulness of brand names on recall of advertising. The findings indicate that a brand name explicitly conveying a product benefit (e.g., PicturePerfect televisions) leads to higher recall of an advertised benefit claim consistent in meaning with the brand name compared with a nonsuggestive brand name (e.g., Emporium televisions). Conversely, a suggestive brand name leads to lower recall of a subsequently advertised benefit claim unrelated in product meaning (e.g., superior sound) compared with a nonsuggestive brand name. The authors discuss implications of these findings for marketers with respect to advertising strategies and the optimal use of meaningful brand names in building and managing brand equity.
