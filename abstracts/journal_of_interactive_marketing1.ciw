TI Disclosure of Vlog Advertising Targeted to Children
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Influencers can disclose vlog advertising by implementing a platform-generated disclosure or by generating their own disclosure. This study aims to investigate whether and how these two types of disclosures differentially affect children's responses toward the sponsored content and the influencer. To do so, a two (platform-generated [PG] disclosure: no PG disclosure versus PG disclosure) by three (influencer-generated [IG] disclosure: no IG disclosure versus no commercial interference disclosure versus commercial interference disclosure) between-subjects experimental study was conducted among 190 children (aged ten to twelve). The results show that both types of disclosures increased children's recognition of vlog advertising; however, children's advertising literacy (i.e. their understanding of influencer marketing and skepticism toward the ad) was less activated when the influencer specifically indicated that there was no commercial interference of the brand. In addition, besides being more beneficial for influencers (by not negatively affecting children's evaluations of the influencer), an 10 disclosure also showed to be more favorable for brands, as it increased brand effects among children, whereas a PG disclosure decreased these brand effects.

TI Enduring Attitudes and Contextual Interest: When and Why Attitude
   Surveys Still Matter in the Online Consumer Decision Journey
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers leave traces of key interest to managers on their journey to purchase. Next to traditional survey-based attitudes, readily available online metrics now show aggregate consumer actions. But how do survey response metrics and online action metrics relate to each other? To what extent do they explain and predict brand sales across consumer categories? This article shows that surveys and online behavior provide complementary information for brand managers. Times series data for 32 brands in 14 categories reveal low correlations but substantial dual causality between survey metrics and online actions. Combining both types of metrics greatly increases the model's power to explain and predict brand sales in low-involvement categories. By contrast, high-involvement categories do not gain much from adding survey-based attitudes to a model including online behavior metrics. The authors synthesize these generalizations in a new framework relating enduring attitudes to the contextual interest expressed by online actions. This new framework helps managers assess both types of metrics to drive brand performance depending on whether their goal is short-term sales or long-term brand health.

TI Excellent Product ... But Too Early to Say: Consumer Reactions to
   Tentative Product Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This research explores the effects of tentativeness in online product reviews on consumers' product attitude certainty and behavioral intentions. Drawing on salience theory, attribution theory, and work in attitude certainty, I predict that, when consumers who have seen positive reviews of a product are exposed to a tentative review, their attitude certainty and willingness to purchase is reduced. I also predict that consumer reactions differ depending on the expertise of the review source as well as the product experience of the consumer.
   I also address confidence in information completeness as the metacognitive mechanism that explains the tentative review effect. Specifically, I argue that consumers who see a tentative review are sensitized to potentially missing information, which reduces their attitude certainty and willingness to purchase.
   Our hypotheses are tested in a series of experiments which demonstrate that tentativeness reduces attitude certainty and willingness to purchase but that the effect is attenuated when the reviewer is a novice and when the consumer has a high level of product experience. Based on the findings, I discuss our contributions to theory and suggest practical steps that firms can take to mitigate the effects of tentative reviews.

TI Seize the Day: How Online Retailers Should Respond to Positive Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Research on online retailer-customer interactions has extensively focused on how to turn negative reviews into marketing wins. By contrast, few prior studies have investigated how retailers should best respond to positive reviews. The current study aims to fill this gap. Drawing on interpersonal relationship research into capitalizing on positive experience, together with reinforcement effect theory and automatic behavioral priming theory, this study explores how retailers should respond to positive reviews to drive consumer repurchase intention. Two laboratory experiments reveal that an active-constructive response in a friendly communication style increases consumer repurchase intention, and consumer positive affect mediates this process. Our findings provide new theoretical insights and useful guidance for retailers on designing effective online communication strategies for consumers.

TI Negative Consequences of Storytelling in Native Advertising
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Native advertising and storytelling are both increasingly popular advertising strategies. This research explores the effectiveness of storytelling in a native advertising context on social media. While most research recommends the use of stories as a way to build trust and relationships with consumers, the current research suggests that in the form of native ads on social media, narratives may be less effective when compared to informational native ads. Two studies find that even when advertising cues such as disclosure labels and brand presence are prominently located, consumers are less likely to recognize the advertising nature of narrative native ads when compared to informational native ads. Lower levels of advertising recognition are associated with increased perceptions of manipulative intentions by the advertiser, which has a negative influence on consumers' attitudes toward the ad. The findings suggest that native ads that clearly communicate their advertising nature through cues such as an informational execution, high brand presence. and prominent disclosure labeling are more effective than a narrative execution style.

TI Motivations to Use Different Social Media Types and Their Impact on
   Consumers' Online Brand-Related Activities (COBRAs)
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Using a six-dimension uses and gratifications (U&G) framework, we explore how social media use motivations drive consumers' online brandrelated activities (COBRAs: consumption, contribution, and creation of brand-related content). We examine these relationships for different social media types by drawing on two previously suggested dimensions. namely their nature of connections and level of customization of messages. Using a US-based sample (n = 939), findings of a PLS-SEM procedure show that "traditional" U&G hardly explain social media COBRAs. In contrast, Empowerment and Remuneration motives-two U&G specifically relevant for social media use-are the most critical COBRAs drivers. Multigroup analyses suggest that the relation between U&G and COBRAs differs between social media platforms classified either as: (a) profile- or content-based; or as employing (b) customized or broadcast messages. We argue for a specific design of brand-related activities on different social media in order to incentivize users' engagement with brand-related content.

TI A Combination of Self-Reported Data and Social-Related Neural Measures
   Forecasts Viral Marketing Success on Social Media
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers often share product-related content (e.g., advertising), and highly shared advertising has a huge impact on consumer behavior. Despite its apparent effectiveness, prediction of whether such advertising will be highly shared is a poorly understood area of marketing. Advances in brain imaging techniques may allow researchers to forecast aggregate consumer behavior beyond subjective reports. Using neuroimaging techniques, previous research has established models showing that expectations of self-related outcomes (potential for self-enhancement) and the social impact of sharing (potential for social approval) contribute to the likelihood of users sharing non-commercial static content (i.e., text-based health news). However, whether this finding can be applied to forecasting the virality of dynamic commercial stimuli, which is more relevant to interactive marketing (i.e., video ads), remains unknown. Combining brain imaging techniques, cross-validation methods, and real-world data regarding sharing on social media, the present study investigated whether brain data can be used to forecast the viral marketing success of video ads. We used neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging: fMRI) to measure neural activity during three sets of theory-driven neural measures implicated in value, self, and social (mentalizing) processes while 40 participants viewed video ads that brands had posted on Facebook. Contrary to previous findings regarding value-related virality in non-commercial static content, our results indicate that social-related neural activity contributes significantly to forecasting the virality of dynamic marketing-related content. The model that included both social-related neural measures and subjective intentions to share forecasted viral marketing success better than the model that included only social-related neural measures. The model that included only subjective intention to share did not forecast viral marketing success. Overall, these findings provide a novel connection between neurophysiological measures and real-world dynamic commercial content. Contrary to previous neumforecasting findings, social-related but not value-related neural measures can significantly improve our ability to predict market-level sharing of video ads.

TI Consumer Responses to Conflict-Management Strategies on Non-Profit
   Social Media Fan Pages
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Past research has demonstrated that consumer-to-consumer (C2C) conflicts, here defined as uncivil social interactions between consumers, can have a negative impact on consumers' engagement in social media fan pages (SMFPs). Little is known, however, about how best to manage such conflicts, and this is particularly true in the non-profit context. This paper follows a mixed-method approach in order to address this research gap. Study 1 uses a netnography of a non-profit organization (NPO) to examine how it manages C2C conflicts on its SMFP. Five different conflict-management strategies are identified: non-engaging, censoring, bolstering, educating, and mobilizing. These findings inform Study 2, an online experiment to test how different strategies affect consumers' attitudes towards the conflict-management approach itself and towards the NPO's social responsibility. Study 2 also accounts for the moderating effect of the conflict content, differentiating between whether a conflict relates to a consumer's self-benefit or the benefit to others. Our results offer insights for practitioners into preferable content management strategies when consumers engage in different types of conflict on social media platforms.

TI Challenges and Opportunities for Marketing Scholars in Times of the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G connectivity have been identified as drivers of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR). AI and 5G, through emerging technologies such as blockchain, gene editing, Internet of Things sensors, nanotechnology, or 3D printing accelerate a blurring of boundaries between digital, biological, and physical spheres. In this editorial, we introduce the term boundary object, or boundary technology, that can help process more information (syntactic boundary) for enhanced learning (semantic boundary) and that can create a higher-level intelligence (pragmatic boundary). Boundary objects are also a means of representing, learning about, and transforming knowledge at a given boundary. We propose that crossing syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic boundaries is facilitated by three FIR phenomena (big data, machine learning, and AI). Each of these phenomena possesses a unique capability (processing, learning, and adaptation) to help communities learn about their differences and dependences. We also show how the six articles in this special issue are related to boundary and sphere challenges, and we provide an overview of directions for future research. All in all, marketing scholars should focus on enhancing their abilities in knowledge integration across boundaries to sustain their role as cutting-edge scientists.

TI Frontline Cyborgs at Your Service: How Human Enhancement Technologies
   Affect Customer Experiences in Retail, Sales, and Service Settings
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Human enhancement technology (HET) is advancing a host of industries, yet it remains limited in its retail, sales, and service applications. Soon, however, these technologies appear likely to have notable impacts on customer experiences. To address their potential influences on customer-employee interactions and the customer experience, this article leverages insights about the human-robot continuum to predict that a mid-range approach may be realistic for retail, sales, and service encounters (cf. pure robot range), at least in the near term. Furthermore, the authors detail the likelihood of both beneficial (elevated warmth and competence) and detrimental (dehumanization) mediating effects of HET on customer experiences. They also propose four moderators: information about the HET, gain/loss frames, persuasion ability, and strategic fit between HET and firm orientations. These insights suggest various implications and research directions pertaining to MET. as well as ways that these technologies might be used effectively in different industries. (C) 2020

TI Digital Analytics: Modeling for Insights and New Methods
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Firms are increasingly turning towards new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and drones, among others, to assist in interacting with their customers. Further, with the prominence of personalization and customer engagement as the go-to customer management strategies, it is essential for firms to understand how to integrate new-age technologies into their existing practices to aid seamlessly in the generation of actionable insights. Towards this end, this study proposes an organizing framework to understand how firms can use digital analytics, within the changing technology landscape, to generate consumer insights. The proposed framework begins by recognizing the forces that are external to the firm then lead to the generation of specific capabilities by the firm. Further, the firms capabilities can lead to the generation of insights for decision-making that can be data-driven and/or analytics-driven. Finally, the proposed framework identifies the creation of value-based outcomes for firms and customers resulting from the insights generated. Additionally, we identify moderators that influence: (a) the impact of external forces on the development of firm capabilities, and (b) the creation of insights and subsequent firm outcomes. This study also identifies questions for future research that combines the inclusion of new-age technologies, generation of strategic insights, and the achievement of established firm outcomes.

TI The Role of Marketing in Digital Business Platforms
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Digital business platforms (DBPs) such as eBay, Google, and Uber Technologies have seen enormous growth; this paper explores their salient characteristics, the role of marketing in helping DBPs succeed, and important research topics for theory and practice. A new conceptual framework based on insights from transaction cost analysis outlines the role and impact of marketing in DBPs. A key role for marketing is to increase the number and quality of interactions on a DBP while reducing transaction costs for users and production costs for the DPB. The DBPs' interactions and the data thus generated are key enablers of value creation and value appropriation on these platforms. However, there are several challenges to resolve in value creation and value appropriation because DBPs cater to the needs of many different types of users. Therefore, DBPs should carefully coordinate and manage interactions among users on different sides of a platform. For researchers, there are many opportunities to reconceptualize some of the traditional roles of marketing in the context of DBPs.

TI Artificial Intelligence and Marketing: Pitfalls and Opportunities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This article discusses the pitfalls and opportunities of AI in marketing through the lenses of knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. First, we discuss the notion of "higher-order learning" that distinguishes AI applications from traditional modeling approaches, and while focusing on recent advances in deep neural networks, we cover its underlying methodologies (multilayer perceptron, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks) and learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning). Second, we discuss the technological pitfalls and dangers marketing managers need to be aware of when implementing AI in their organizations, including the concepts of badly defined objective functions, unsafe or unrealistic learning environments, biased AI, explainable AI, and controllable AI. Third, AI will have a deep impact on predictive tasks that can be automated and require little explainability, we predict that AI will fall short of its promises in many marketing domains if we do not solve the challenges of tacit knowledge transfer between AI models and marketing organizations.

TI "Speaking of Purchases": How Conversational Potential Determines
   Consumers' Willingness to Exert Effort for Experiential Versus Material
   Purchases
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers spend much of their incomes on two types of purchases: experiences and material objects. Recent research has successfully used this purchase type categorization to predict various types of social and psychological consumer outcomes. The present investigation extends this research to a novel domain of primary relevance to firms-that of consumer effort. Specifically, this work advances and tests the prediction that consumers are more willing to exert effort to acquire experiential versus material purchases. Further, drawing on literature on online and offline consumer interactions, it proposes that the greater conversational potential of experiences (vs. objects) explains this effect. Five studies employing mediation, moderation, and actual-choice approaches, applying different methodologies to purchases (past, future, and framed purchases) and testing different types of acquisition effort (e.g., to save money, to wait in a line to make the purchase) offer converging evidence in support of the predicted model. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2020 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Cross-Media Consumption: Insights from Super Bowl Advertising
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB When viewers engage in cross-media consumption-view television advertising and social media posts on another medium-how do stimuli from multiple screens influence their response? To address this question, we construct a comprehensive dataset to estimate the effects of Super Bowl advertising and the advertised brands' Facebook content on ad likability. The novel insights emerging from the analyses include that: both media directly and significantly impact the response, contributing 60% and 40%, respectively; thinking hurts liking; and an ad's serial position does not matter, which differs from the primacy and recency effects previously reported in advertising studies. This study contributes to the theory and practice by: (i) testing open research questions empirically regarding the complementary effects of two screens; (ii) extracting the formal, analytic, and narrative thinking styles from the actual words in social media comments; and (iii) demonstrating that divided attention across screens has negative consequences on viewer appraisals.

TI Thinking Beyond Privacy Calculus: Investigating Reactions to Customer
   Surveillance
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB As interactive technologies become more pervasive, firms are increasingly conducting customer surveillance-the acquisition, usage, and storage of consumers' personal data-more covertly and with fewer resources. Privacy calculus-the rational decision to disclose personal data-has dominated the literature to explain rational or calculated reactions to customer surveillance, however, not all reactions can be explained by rational processes. This article advances our understanding of these reactions beyond the privacy calculus concept by proposing attitudes toward customer surveillance. Based on levels of consumer privacy and consumer value concerns, these attitudes are associated with four archetypes-pragmatists, protectionists, capitalists, and apathists. By understanding these attitudes, researchers and managers can gain insight into the diversity of consumers' concerns regarding both consumer privacy and consumer value in order to better explain observed marketplace behaviors.

TI To Defend or Not to Defend? How Responses to Negative Customer Review
   Affect Prospective customers' Distrust and Purchase Intention
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Negative online reviews are a ubiquitous problem that affects every online seller at some point. It can lead to prospective consumers' distrust and decrease future purchase intention. Therefore, formulating a proper response is essential for minimizing these negative effects. Based on the ability-motivation paradigm and stability attribution, we find that apology works better when the alleged cause is relatively unstable (e.g., competence-based negative review) and when the seller has a high ability to change. However, when the alleged cause is relatively stable (e.g., integrity-based negative review) or when the seller has a low ability to change, we show that it is better for the seller to defend its reputation. In addition, we demonstrate that a remedial action plan in the seller's response can reinforce the motivation to change communicated through apology. Thus, coupled with a remedial action plan, apology works better than defending one's reputation, regardless of the negative online review type.

TI Are Digital Menus Really Better than Traditional Menus? The Mediating
   Role of Consumption Visions and Menu Enjoyment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study examined consumers' responses to interactive media in a restaurant setting (i.e., digital menus). Study 1 tested a conceptual model, which examined the underlying process shaping customers' evaluations of a Web-based digital menu. The results demonstrated that consumption visions and menu enjoyment mediated the effects of perceived interactivity on attitudes toward the digital menus. Study 1 also identified direct product experience as an important moderator of the relationship. Study 2 extended and replicated Study 1 in an offline setting by conducting a lab experiment that compared the use of digital and traditional menus in ordering foods that participants have experienced versus those they have not. In general, tablet-based digital menus generated greater enjoyment, increased intentions to adopt, and encouraged participants to order more within a shorter time. But they were preferred only for less-experienced foods. Furthermore, consumption visions were important mediators of interactivity effects in the digital menu condition, but not in the traditional paper menu condition, while menu enjoyment played a mediating role in both conditions.

TI An Experimental Analysis of the Effectiveness of Multi-Screen
   Advertising
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Multiscreening refers to consumers' simultaneous usage of multiple screen-based devices. Prior research has shown that simultaneous multiscreening distracts consumers and hinders cognitive processing. In this paper, we evaluate whether and how simultaneous multiscreening can harm advertising effectiveness. Moreover, we test under which conditions an additional mobile advertising impression can moderate the effect of multiscreening on advertising effectiveness. We test the impact of multiscreening via different screen-based devices in two experiments. We find that multiscreening decreases advertising effectiveness and show that an additional mobile advertising impression of the same brand can attenuate the effect, but only when the additional mobile advertisement does not lead to high levels of distraction from the desktop advertisement.

TI "Don't Forget that Others Are Watching, Too!" The Effect of
   Conversational Human Voice and Reply Length on Observers' Perceptions of
   Complaint Handling in Social Media
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB When dissatisfied customers voice their complaints on companies' social media pages, many other consumers can observe such interactions. Yet, only limited research has investigated how complaint handling is perceived by this online audience. Since the final outcome of the complaint is rarely visible publicly, the message characteristics (e.g., length and style) of company replies can represent signaling cues for observers of how the complaint is handled. The results of two experimental studies show that the use of conversational human voice (CHV) leads to more positive observer perceptions of complaint handling as opposed to when a corporate voice is employed. We found that interactional justice fully mediates this process and that satisfaction with complaint handling positively impacts corporate image and indirectly observers' WOM intentions. Surprisingly, high CHV can negatively affect procedural justice, but these effects are mainly offset through interactional justice, as the observers focus on the fairness in the communication exchange. Interestingly, our findings show that, in the case of low CHV, other cues such as the length of the company's reply significantly change perceived justice dimensions; however, the length of reply does not lead to such changes when high CHV is employed. Our studies bring novel findings that contribute to justice and signaling theories in the context of complaints management in social media. Managerial implications are discussed.

TI Cutting the Internet's Environmental Footprint: An Analysis of
   Consumers' Self-Attribution of Responsibility
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This research project investigates consumers' willingness to adopt online pro-environmental behaviors. First, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study that revealed respondents' low awareness of the environmental impact of Internet usage and reluctance to change their online behaviors. Consumers tend to decline all responsibility and expect companies and public authorities to take the necessary measures. Moreover, they are led by contradictory motives: not harming the environment on the one hand and continuing to use the Internet the way they currently do on the other. Based on these findings, two quantitative studies were conducted to investigate the determinants of consumers' self-attribution of responsibility to reduce the digital footprint of their online activity (e.g., using an eco-friendly search engine). Our conceptual model emphasizes the mechanisms of cognitive dissonance and highlights the crucial role of skepticism toward pro-environmental solutions. Implications for IT companies and public policy makers are discussed. (C) 2020 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Social Media's Impact on the Consumer Mindset: When to Use Which
   Sentiment Extraction Tool?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB User-generated content provides many opportunities for managers and researchers, but insights are hindered by a lack of consensus on how to extract brand-relevant valence and volume. Marketing studies use different sentiment extraction tools (SETs) based on social media volume, top-down language dictionaries and bottom-up machine learning approaches. This paper compares the explanatory and forecasting power of these methods over several years for daily customer mindset metrics obtained from survey data. For 48 brands in diverse industries, vector autoregressive models show that volume metrics explain the most for brand awareness and purchase intent, while bottom-up SETs excel at explaining brand impression, satisfaction and recommendation. Systematic differences yield contingent advice: the most nuanced version of bottom-up SETs (SVM with Neutral) performs best for the search goods for all consumer mind-set metrics but Purchase Intent for which Volume metrics work best. For experienced goods, Volume outperforms SVM with neutral. As processing time and costs increase when moving from volume to top-down to bottom-up sentiment extraction tools, these conditional findings can help managers decide when more detailed analytics are worth the investment.

TI The Use of Computer Vision to Analyze Brand-Related User Generated Image
   Content
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB With the increasing popularity of visual-oriented social media platforms, the prevalence of visual brand-related User Generated Content (UGC) have increased. Monitoring such content is important as this visual brand-related UGC can have a large influence on a brand's image and hence provides useful opportunities to observe brand performance (e.g., monitoring trends and consumer segments). The current research discusses the application of computer vision for marketing practitioners and researchers and examines the usability of three different pre-trained ready-to-use computer vision models (i.e., YOLOV2, Google Cloud Vision, and Clarifai) to analyze visual brand-related UGC automatically. A 3-step approach was adopted in which 1) a database of 21,738 Instagram pictures related to 24 different brands was constructed, 2) the images were processed by the three different computer vision models, and 3) a label evaluation procedure was conducted with a sample of the labels (object names) outputted by the models. The results of the label evaluation procedure are quantitatively assessed and complemented with four concrete examples of how the output of computer vision can be used to analyze visual brand-related UGC. Results show that computer vision can yield various marketing insights. Moreover, we found that the three tested computer vision models differ in applicability. Google Cloud Vision is more accurate in object detection, whereas Clarifai provides more useful labels to interpret the portrayal of a brand. YOLOV2 did not prove to be useful to analyze visual brand-related UGC. Results and implications of the findings for marketers and marketing scholars will be discussed.

TI A Framework for Digital Marketing Research: Investigating the Four
   Cultural Eras of Digital Marketing
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The digital marketing discipline is facing growing fragmentation; the proliferation of different subareas of research impedes the accumulation of knowledge. This fragmentation seems logically tied to the inherent complexity of the Internet, itself resulting from 50 years of evolution. Thus, our aim is to provide an integrative framework for research in digital marketing derived from the historical analysis of the Internet. Using practice theory and institutional theory, we outline a new type of institutional work: imprinting work. We apply this framework to the analysis of historical secondary sources. We find four cultural repertoires on the Internet (collaborative systems, traditional market systems, co-creation systems, and prosumption market systems) and describe the dynamics of imprinting work leading to their creation, showing how new systems are created by appropriating and assimilating existing cultural repertoires. We contribute to the digital marketing literature by providing a cultural framework and a theory explaining the dynamics of the creation of four cultural repertoires. Moreover, we outline three paths of potential evolution of the digital landscape. Our framework may help managers make sense of their digital strategy and navigate the various Internet systems.

TI What You Feel, Is What You Like Influence of Message Appeals on Customer
   Engagement on Instagram
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Visual-based social media are growing exponentially and have become an integrated part of the customer engagement strategy of many brands. Prior work points to the textual message content as a driver of customer engagement behavior. So far, little is known about the impact of visual message content, specifically visual emotional and informative appeals. We extract emotional and informative appeals from Instagram posts using machine learning models and use a Negative Binomial model to explain customer engagement. We test our model on 46.9 K Instagram posts from 59 brands in six sectors. Our results show that visual emotional and informative appeals encoded in brand-generated content influence customer engagement in terms of likes and comments. Specifically, we demonstrate that positive high and negative low arousal images drive customer engagement. Informative appeals do not drive customer engagement with the exception of informative brand-related appeals. These findings help brand managers in developing an effective customer engagement strategy on visual social media. (C) 2019 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

TI Newspapers' Content Policy and the Effect of Paywalls on Pageviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper examines the impact of newspaper paywalls on daily pageviews, and how their impact varies across newspapers as a function of their content provisioning strategies. Our data consist of daily pageviews of 42 newspapers that introduced a paywall during the eight-year analysis period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017. We find that a paywall has a negative impact on daily pageviews for most newspapers, but that the impact varies significantly across them. Newspapers that publish proportionately more articles on politics, business/economics, sports, and general social news tend to perform better with a paywall than newspapers that publish proportionately fewer articles on those topics. Interestingly, the effectiveness varies substantially across news topics. For example, increasing the proportion of business/economics news by 1% is nearly 1.4 times more effective than increasing the proportion of general social news by the same percentage in mitigating the negative impact of a paywall. We also find that newspapers with proportionately more unique content and papers with a more liberal slant experience a smaller drop in pageviews. These results have important managerial implications for newspapers-especially pure-play online news publishers (for whom online advertising is the primary revenue source)-regarding how to develop and manage their content policy with paywall adoptions.

TI How 3D Virtual Reality Stores Can Shape Consumer Purchase Decisions: The
   Roles of Informativeness and Playfulness
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The recent rise of consumer virtual reality (VR) hardware raises important questions in the field of online marketing: what makes 3D VR more informative and playful than conventional 2D media such as a still image and a video, and how it affects the online purchase decision-making process. In this study, we mainly focus on three interface features-interactivity, visual-spatial cues, and graphics quality. We explore how each of these three interface features enhances playfulness and informativeness of shopping interface and further influences subsequent product evaluation and purchase intention. The results of the study provide two meaningful insights. First, interactivity and visual-spatial cues significantly enhance perceived informativeness and playfulness; however, the role of graphics quality was found to be more critical for 2D displays than for 3D VR environment. Second, informativeness and playfulness influence the purchase decision-making process in distinct ways. More specifically, a playful interface may enhance consumers' preference for hedonic product benefits (e.g., a stylish and attractive design), whereas informativeness is a more important explanatory variable for subsequent purchase intentions. We discuss the theoretical contribution and managerial insights the research provides for online retailers and designers. (C) 2019

TI A Transaction Utility Approach for Bidding in Second-Price Auctions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In both the Vickrey and eBay auctions, bidding the reservation price is the optimal strategy within the conventional utility framework. However, in practice, buyers tend to bid less than their reservation prices, and bid multiple times, thus increase their bids, in the course of an auction. In this paper, we show that both underbidding and multiple bidding behaviors can be consistent with utility maximization, if buyer's utility incorporates a transaction utility (reference price dependent) component. Transaction utility is based on the difference between the buyer's reference price and actual price paid; it captures the perceived value of the deal. More specifically, we show that the optimal bid is lower than the reservation price, but higher than the reference price. Furthermore, buyer may re-bid (above the prior optimal level) if the reference price is revised upon observing a higher current price.

TI Effects of Disclosing Influencer Marketing in Videos: An Eye Tracking
   Study Among Children in Early Adolescence
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study focused on the effects of sponsorship disclosure timing on children's ability to understand that social influencer videos are sponsored. The study also investigated how sponsorship disclosure timing affects children's attitudes toward the sponsoring brand, the video, and the influencer. An experiment among 272 children in early adolescence (10-13 years of age) was conducted using eye tracking. Results show that a disclosure shown prior to the start of the videos leads to more visual attention than a disclosure shown concurrently with the start of videos. Consequently, disclosure prior to the start of videos is better processed, as indicated by disclosure memory, which then leads to a better understanding that the content is sponsored. This understanding evokes a more critical attitude toward the sponsored content in the video, and results in less positive attitudes toward the brands, the videos, and the influencers. Theoretically, this study provides insights into the mechanisms that explain disclosure timing effects among children in early adolescence. Practically, this study offers recommendations to policy makers to develop sponsorship disclosures that can increase transparency of online embedded advertising to minors.

TI Whose Algorithm Says So: The Relationships Between Type of Firm,
   Perceptions of Trust and Expertise, and the Acceptance of Financial
   Robo-Advice
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Financial advisors seek to accurately measure individuals' risk preferences and provide sound personalized investment advice. Both advice tasks are increasingly offered through automated online technologies. Little is known, however, about what drives individuals' acceptance of such automated financial advice and, from a consumer point of view, which firms may be best positioned to provide such advice.
   We generate novel insights on these questions by conducting a real-world empirical study using an interactive automated online tool that employs an innovative computer algorithm to build pension investment profiles, the "Pension Builder," and a large, representative sample.
   We focus on the role that two key firm characteristics have on consumer acceptance of pension investment advice generated by computer algorithms running on automated interactive online tools: profit orientation and role in the sales channel.
   We find that consumers' perceptions of trust and expertise of the firm providing the automated advice are important drivers of advice acceptance (besides a strong impact of the satisfaction with the consumer-online tool interaction), and that these constructs themselves are clearly influenced by the for-profit vs. not-for-profit orientation and the product provider vs. advisor only role in the sales channel of the firm providing the advice.
   We discuss the implications of our findings for marketers and policy makers and provide suggestions for future research. (C) 2019 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Viral advertising videos are a prominent form of viral marketing, yet little is known about which factors influence an online video's virality or likelihood to be shared and viewed. A content analysis of 155 viral ad videos found that average shares and views were higher for videos with full story development versus videos with less than full story development as measured via a five-point drama scale based on Freytag's Pyramid. An incremental story development effect on shares and views was also found. Time duration and company size did not significantly influence the results for shares but did have some effect on the results for views. The role of story in viral videos, the relationship between drama theory, narrative theory, story grammar theory and transportation theory, and managerial implications of story development in viral marketing are also discussed.

TI Tweeting with the Stars: Automated Text Analysis of the Effect of
   Celebrity Social Media Communications on Consumer Word of Mouth
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Prior research has focused on analyzing the content and intent of celebrity social media communications. By observing that the linguistic style of such celebrity communications drives consumer word of mouth, the main goal of the current research is to broaden this limited perspective. An automated text analysis of narrative/analytical, internally/externally focused, and negative/positive emotional styles in tweets by celebrity chefs, personal trainers, and fashion bloggers was conducted to this effect. The findings are threefold. First, across celebrity categories externally focused, narrative styles are more effective in terms of word of mouth. Second, emotional styles are not effective. Third, angry outbursts are an exception; they are effective drivers of word of mouth for personal trainers. As such, this research furthers scholarly and practitioner understanding of the state-the-art of celebrity social media communication: the effect of tweets' linguistic styles on consumer word of mouth.

TI Enhancing the Helpfulness of Online Consumer Reviews: The Role of Latent
   (Content) Factors
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Past empirical studies have analysed the influence of manifest online review content factors and the reviewer-related factors on online review helpfulness. However, the influence of latent content factors, which are implied from the text and that result in the differential helpfulness perceptions of review receivers, have been ignored. Hence, using the lens of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), we develop a comprehensive model to study the influence of content- and reviewer-related factors on review helpfulness. This study not only includes the manifest content-related and reviewer-related factors, but also the latent content factors consisting of argument quality (comprehensiveness, clarity, readability and relevance) and message valence. The study initially employs a manual content analysis to analyse the argument quality of 500 TripAdvisor reviews (Study 1). Subsequently, model testing techniques are used to study the holistic and relative influence of these different factors on review helpfulness. In the validation study (Study 2), Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques are used to extract latent content information and test the above model with 50,000 reviews from Yelp.com. The results show that latent review content variables like argument quality and valence influence the helpfulness of the reviews better and beyond the previously studied, manifest review content- and reviewer-related factors.

TI Product Rating Statistics as Consumer Search Aids
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online product review forums commonly provide consumers with averages of product ratings given by reviewers. Some also provide frequency distribution of ratings in the form of a histogram. The authors argue that consumers use these statistics as search aids when reading reviews. Provision of the average rating statistic affects consumers' reading of reviews through confirmation or disconfirmation of their expectancies about the product in question. However, provision of the distribution statistics attenuates this effect because it alerts consumers to divergent opinions. An eye-tracking experiment that simulated a forum visit demonstrates these effects. The experiment also shows that as a result of these effects, average rating provision causes consumer attitude toward the product to be more extreme, whereas rating distribution provision reduces this polarization. Further, supporting the expectancy confirmation account, results show that consumers with a high need for cognition exhibit a greater response to average rating provision than those with a low need. The findings suggest the benefits to marketers of tracking the number of negative reviews read by consumers and displaying positive reviews and negative reviews separately. The findings also identify circumstances that call for greater effort by marketers when responding to reviews. (C) 2019 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

TI What's Mine Is a Hologram? How Shared Augmented Reality Augments
   Psychological Ownership
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Augmented Reality (AR) holograms are 3D digital objects projected into a customer's physical environment through mobile technology. Applied as potential substitutes to physical products, AR holograms pose a unique challenge for conventional configurations of product ownership. Taking a socially situated cognition perspective, we demonstrate how customers' shared experience of AR holograms leads to distinct perspectives on psychological ownership. In Study 1, we demonstrate how customization of AR holograms lets customers feel psychological ownership of digital products. In Study 2, we highlight the mechanisms of social adaptation related to assimilation and differentiation that drive the relationship between customization and psychological ownership of AR holograms in social settings. In Study 3, we illustrate how these mechanisms are influenced by the affordances of AR technology when customers switch between personal or shared devices. We discuss implications for theory and marketing practice of this potentially novel class of digital consumer products. (C) 2019

TI Adding Voice to the Omnichannel and How that Affects Brand Trust
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers can use alternative methods to interact with or access a brand through their mobile devices. They can type a response using a touchscreen keyboard (touch interaction) or use voice response while holding a mobile device (combined voice and touch interaction). In this study, we look at the impact of these different types of interaction on personal engagement and the effect on brand trust as relevant concerns to managers in the digital, mediated context. Using a framework based on sensory marketing and Dual Coding Theory, we conducted 2 one-way between-subjects experiments with a two-level interface interaction considering a hedonic product (Experiment 1) and utilitarian product (Experiment 2). Findings confirm a three-way interaction such that the impact of privacy concern on the relationship between personal engagement and trust depends on the nature of the platform interaction; touch vs. combined touch and voice. We also find that adding voice to the platform interface has the counterintuitive effect of reducing engagement with that platform. All in all, our results provide novel insights into the role of touch and voice in the online context when it comes to consumers' decision-making. (C) 2019

TI Is Sociability or Interactivity more Effective for Enhancing
   Performance? Findings from a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing
   Game
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The essential issue currently challenging marketing managers in the virtual world is: How can a virtual world feature be designed to elevate consumers' purchase of virtual items and usage in the virtual world? Previous scholars have investigated the issue and have published their predictions on the individual level. Yet, they have done so without specifically addressing endogeneity or carryover effect among users and their activities. To alleviate this omission and potential methodological bias, we probe the impact of virtual world technological features on two performance criteria at the platform level. In addition, we differentiate two types of users (new vs returning users) and probe their distinct impact on purchase of virtual items and usage patterns in the virtual world. When using data from one virtual world and applying the vector auto regression model, results show that virtual world managers can elevate performance through promotion of both types of users' activities. The effects of these activities, however, are varied. Specifically, for returning users, interactivity leads to a more significant impact on consumers' purchase of virtual goods than sociability, while the opposite effect is applicable to usage in the virtual world. For new users, interactivity is more efficient for promotion of users' purchase of virtual goods than sociability, while the results are the opposite for usage in the virtual world. (C) 2019

TI Modeling Advertisers' Willingness to Pay in TV Commercial Slot Auctions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Auctions are receiving increasing attention from both practitioners and researchers in the TV advertising market. This paper studies advertisers' willingness to pay (WTP) in Hong Kong television commercial slot auctions, defined as overlapped, multiple-winner auctions with discrete, ascending, semi-sealed bids. We specify advertisers' WTP as a parametric function of their valuations of slot-specific attributes and the valuations that depend on the context of the focal auction and on the competition from other auctions of similar commercial slots. We extend the two "noregret" bidding principles (first proposed by Haile and Tamer 2003) to obtain informative boundary conditions for asymptotical identification. The estimation results suggest that advertisers' WTP increases with the TV rating of the program in which the advertisement is embedded and decreases with the bidder's bidding experience and the number of similar slot options available. The WTP also depends on the number of bidders classified into the same product category, as two directly competing advertisers are not allowed to advertise in the same commercial break. In the current practice, advertisers submit discrete bids using price levels set by the TV station. Based on the recovered bidder's WTP, we investigate how the TV station can set adjacent price levels and examine the resulting revenue implications.

TI Feeling Confident and Smart with Webrooming: Understanding the
   Consumer's Path to Satisfaction
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The multichannel marketing literature consistently shows that consumers who use multiple channels in their purchase journeys are more satisfied, loyal, and can be more profitable, than single-channel consumers. However, there is little research investigating how specific channel combinations affect the customer experience. Recognizing that webrooming (research products online, purchase offline) is the prevalent form of cross-channel shopping, this paper examines its influence on the consumer's search process satisfaction. The results of three studies combining qualitative, survey, and experimental methods show that webrooming leads to more satisfaction than showrooming behaviors. Furthermore, we find that webrooming makes consumers feel more confident and like "smart shoppers." Both factors subsequently determine satisfaction. Perceptions of money savings also affect search process satisfaction. Importantly, saving time and/or effort during the purchase process (convenience) has no influence on satisfaction with cross-channel shopping. The results are robust across shopping motivations and product categories. Theoretical implications and proposals for effective channel integration are offered.

TI App Adoption: The Effect on Purchasing of Customers Who Have Used a
   Mobile Website Previously
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB A key question for retailers who already offer a mobile website is, whether they should add an app as an additional purchase channel. We address this issue by exploring whether consumers' app adoption stimulates additional purchases and how this change in purchase behavior differs across customers with different levels of spending share for different product categories and customer loyalty. By using transactional data from a Chinese online retailer, we show that app adopters have higher purchase incidence, buy more frequently, and spend more in each order than non adopters. We also find that app adoption has a stronger positive effect on the order size of customers who have a lower spending share of high-price products and customers who are less loyal to the focal retailer. Hereby, we contribute to multichannel and mobile marketing literature by empirically examining the effects of adding a similar (mobile) purchase channel to an already established (mobile) purchase channel. Managerially, our results suggest that apps are worth investing in despite their similarity to mobile websites and can induce non-loyal customers to purchase more and thus potentially foster these customers' loyalty.

TI The Dark Side of Good Reputation and Loyalty in Online Retailing: When
   Trust Leads to Retaliation through Price Unfairness
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This research examines price variations that are perceived to be unfair which then induce consumers to retaliate online. These phenomena are growing in online retailing given the data-based means for companies to set differential pricing, and the social media venues for consumer complaints. In this research, data from 997 respondents are used to test moderated mediation relationships integrating: (1) the influence of trust (i.e., competence and benevolence) on perceived price unfairness, and its mediating role on subsequent online revenge intentions; (2) the moderating role of (a) retailer reputation and (b) customer loyalty. We find that pricing practices seen as unfair can lead to a "dark side" or a "love becomes hate" effect for loyal customers of retailers with good reputations. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2019 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI A Comparison of Formative Versus Reflective Approaches for the
   Measurement of Electronic Service Quality
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Drawing upon the extant literature, we examine the definition, conceptualization, and measurement of electronic service quality (e-SQ) and propose an alternative measurement approach. We posit that customers' perceptions of overall e-SQ are influenced by six proximal antecedents: security/privacy, fulfillment/reliability, website design, customer service, informativeness, and customization. Using three independent samples of real customers of three hotel reservation sites, we assess the proposed measurement approach via appropriate scale development procedures. Findings indicate that a causal structure that considers e-SQ as a distinct construct that is influenced by six proximal antecedents should be preferred over a second-order reflective measurement model. We discuss theoretical implications of our proposed measurement method, make recommendations for service firms, and offer directions for future research. (C) 2019

TI The Effect of Cross-Channel Integration on Cost Efficiency
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In multichannel retailing, cross-channel integration, which is the integration of different channels, such as brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce, and mobile retailers, has been a key strategy. However, the effectiveness of cross-channel integration for firm performance remains uncertain. This study examines the impact of cross-channel integration on firm performance cost efficiency. It uses stochastic frontier analysis to estimate cost efficiency and employs a dynamic panel model to assess the relationship between cross-channel integration, firm-level characteristics, and cost efficiency. The results reveal that cross-channel integration is positively associated with cost efficiency and that the extent of a retailer's experience with e-commerce and level of face-to-face services reduce its effectiveness.

TI Mobile Advertising and Traffic Conversion: The Effects of Front Traffic
   and Spatial Competition
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB As mobile devices gain increasing popularity in consumers' shopping journeys, geofencing mobile advertising is widely used by retailers to convert front traffic, i.e., consumers walking in front of a store, into sales. In the process, retailers face two critical questions, i.e., how to set the fence locations and how to improve the conversion effectiveness with consideration of the advertising costs. We aim to shed light on the issues by developing an analytical model that considers two competitive retailers' mobile advertising strategies in a linear Hotelling city. We first present the equilibrium prices (or fence locations), advertising levels, and profits. In addition, by conducting a comparative static analysis, we ascertain the separate effects and joint effects of front traffic, showing how the traffic changes caused by consumer entry and consumer switching affect the equilibrium outcomes in different competitive environments. Counter-intuitively, we find that higher front traffic, which is usually regarded as being favorable to a retailer, can lead to lower prices, advertising levels, and profits under certain conditions. The results suggest that retailers should craft and adjust mobile advertising strategies in accordance with both consumers' movement tendency and competition intensity. Besides, by comparing the competitive retailers, we provide guidance to retailers on how to make mobile advertising strategies according to traffic advantages or disadvantages. (C) 2019

TI Propagators, Creativity, and Informativeness: What Helps Ads Go Viral
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This research explores characteristics that make consumers more likely to circulate ads. We focus on (a) the main transmitters of the viral content which we refer to as propagators, consumers who are more socially connected and active, and (b) two key ad characteristics: creativity and informativeness. Results from field data and two online studies show that propagators may wish to elevate their social status and therefore circulate ads that are both creative and informative. Since propagators spread ads to many people, ads that are both creative and informative are more likely to go viral compared with ads that are only creative or informative. These results extend previous research on the role and preferences of propagators and emphasize that, contrary to common beliefs, ad creativity alone may not be enough to drive a successful viral campaign.

TI The Impact of Adding Online-to-Offline Service Platform Channels on
   Firms' Offline and Total Sales and Profits
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online-to-offline service platform (O2OSP) channels offer innovative means for customers to order local, daily services online (via apps) and have them delivered almost instantly offline. By comparing the business models underlying O2OSP, traditional online and offline, and platform based e-commerce channels, this article aims to identify the short- and long-term impacts of adding an O2OSP channel on firms' offline and total sales and profits. The analysis focuses primarily on a recent set of daily data gathered from a Chinese fast-food restaurant chain with 35 physical stores that also participates in four food delivery O2OSP channels. The panel data regressions with fixed effects reveal that adding O2OSP channels hurts offline and total profits in the short run but improves offline and total sales and profits in the long run. Specifically, offline and total sales increase by 23.28% and 33.94%, respectively. Thus, the O2OSP channel can serve as a complement to, rather than a substitute for, the offline channel. These results challenge previous research on the sales effects of adding (pure) online or offline channels and highlight the attractiveness of O2OSP channels for improving sales and profits. However, negative interaction effects among different O2OSP channels also signal that adding more O2OSP channels does not necessarily lead to profitable growth.

TI The Role of Network Embeddedness and Psychological Ownership in Consumer
   Responses to Brand Transgressions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Research has recognized that in addition to consumer brand relationships, consumers are engaged in social networks of consumer-to-consumer interactions, which increasingly take place online through virtual brand communities. However, little attention has been paid to how consumer-to consumer influence within virtual brand communities plays a role when brands behave badly. This research examines the role of network embeddedness, specifically network centrality and network density, and psychological ownership in consumer responses to a brand transgression. Across three studies of virtual brand communities and one of offline brand communities, we document an inherent conflict for those who occupy a central position within a brand community. Central consumers are more likely to punish the brand for the transgression, but centrality also leads to greater psychological ownership of the brand community and the brand, which makes consumers less likely to punish the brand. Psychological ownership also leads to a higher likelihood of helping the brand recover from the transgression, creating an additional conflict for central consumers, Network density resolves these conflicts by strengthening the negative relationship between psychological ownership and likelihood to punish the brand, but only in online brand communities where punishing and helping behaviors are more visible and more likely to act as reputational signals for the central consumer. This suggests that firms should encourage the formation of dense virtual brand communities and cultivate psychological ownership among central community members in order to protect themselves from negative consequences in the wake of a transgression.

TI Temporal Certainty and Skippable In-Stream Commercials: Effects of Ad
   Length, Timer, and Skip-ad Button on Irritation and Skipping Behavior
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Does a timer-displayed during an in-stream commercial to show viewers how long they need to wait-help relieve the ad irritation that viewers experience when they have to wait for a video to play? Likewise, does the skip-ad button that allows viewers to skip an ad after several seconds help lessen their irritation with the commercial? This research theoretically and empirically examined whether reducing temporal uncertainty (i.e., using a timer to let viewers know the ad length) in skippable advertising actually helped relieve viewers' ad irritation and reduce their likelihood of ad-skipping. Across two experimental studies, temporal certainty (e.g., the presence of the timer) during short commercials generally decreased ad irritation. In contrast, when a skip-ad button is displayed, temporal certainty during both short and long commercials increased ad irritation, which subsequently decreased advertising effectiveness. Also, the higher the ad irritation, the higher the ad-skipping rate. Theoretical and managerial implications of these results are discussed, and alternative solutions for reducing ad irritation are provided.

TI Consumer Processing of Online Trust Signals: A Neuroimaging Study
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The growth of online transactions coupled with the worldwide expansion of Internet-based information exchange has triggered fear, distrust and risk among online consumers. Despite the well-proven benefits to retailers when they include assurance services (online trust signals) such as seals of approval, rating systems or assurance statements in their websites, there is no consensus as the most trustworthy type. To fill this research gap, the current study reverts to neuroscience (fMRI) to compare the underlying brain mechanisms linked to each type. Twenty-nine subjects participated in an experiment simulating a low-involvement online purchase. The functional neuroimaging analysis reveals that seals of approval are the most trustworthy as they elicit activation of brain areas linked to reward and expected values. Although assurance statements reveal lower scores of trust than seals of approval, they do not arouse negative brain areas. By contrast, products accompanied by rating systems elicit brain areas linked to ambiguity, negativity and risk. Interestingly, more positive trust and purchase intentions toward seals of approval were predicted by the activation of value-computation areas, whereas higher scores of risk associated with rating systems were predicted by negative-related activations. These results offer invaluable insight into the psychological origin of trust conveyed to different types of online trust signals.

TI Analyzing the Browsing Basket: A Latent Interests-Based Segmentation
   Tool
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The increasing importance of online distribution channels is paralleled by a rising interest in gaining insights into the customer journey to online purchases. In this paper we propose an easy-to-implement two-step procedure that enables online marketing managers to disentangle the complex interrelationships hidden behind observed Internet browsing behavior across websites. Utilizing the procedure allows managers to gain a better understanding why Internet users are visiting their website(s) and how these visits are related to purchases. In the first step, the procedure uncovers latent interests underlying online users' browsing behavior. In the second step, we segment the online users based on their uncovered latent interests. This way, online marketers may understand how segment-specific combinations of latent interests are linked to purchase behavior. We apply the procedure to ComScore clickstream data across 472 websites. We show that there is considerable heterogeneity among online users both regarding online browsing habits, combinations of latent interests, and their conversion into online purchases. For example, some users are interested in apparel and travel service opposed to users who are interested in entertainment tickets. Our empirical analysis confirms that a relatively small fraction of online users realize 70% of online spending. In addition, we detect substantial segment-specific differences of shopping behavior across categories, the most important product categories being apparel as well as food & beverages. Our descriptive perspective comes up with surprising associations among the websites which can be interesting for online marketers.

TI Crowdfunding As a Vehicle for Raising Capital and for Price
   Discrimination
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Crowdfunding campaigns are traditionally used as a means for entrepreneurs to raise capital to fund the development of new products. We show that reward-based crowdfunding may serve an additional purpose of allowing entrepreneurs to successfully implement price discrimination. The entrepreneurs' ability to implement such price discrimination depends on the extent to which they are eager to raise capital through the crowdfunding campaign in comparison to the eagerness of contributors in the campaign to ensure that the product becomes a reality. Specifically, we show that enhanced consumer surplus extraction through price discrimination is feasible when the total surplus that the project generates is relatively small, when the pool of potential contributors in the campaign is relatively small, and when the extent of heterogeneity in the consumer population is relatively high. In contrast, when both the development and the financing costs from traditional funding sources are relatively high the capacity of crowdfunding to serve as a price discrimination device is hampered. We also provide insights regarding the entrepreneur's choice of the funder reward and campaign goal, two decision variables that entrepreneurs traditionally set in reward based crowdfunding campaigns.

TI Emotions Within Online Reviews and their Influence on Product Attitudes
   in Austria, USA and Thailand
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online reviews are of considerable interest to both practitioners and academics. Prior research has focused mostly on the valence and volume of online reviews. Questions on how the emotional content of online reviews influence consumers remain open. Given that non-verbal cues of communication are limited in the online environment, content can be a strong driver of attitudes and, in turn, online purchases. Importantly also, a wide stream of research indicates that different self-construal levels (i.e. independent or interdependent self-construal) perceive emotions in different ways. Therefore it is necessary to examine whether the effect of emotional content within online reviews on product attitudes varies across consumers with different self-construals. Hence, we conduct three studies to analyze the relationship between the emotional content within online reviews (positive, negative, mixed) and product attitudes. Results from Study 1, conducted in Austria (n = 280), show that emotional content within online reviews has an effect on product attitudes, which goes above and beyond that of a review's overall valence. Further building on this finding, Study 2, also conducted in Austria (n = 420), offers specific insights on how reviews containing different emotional cues (i.e. positive, negative and mixed emotions) influence consumers' hedonic and utilitarian attitudes. Finally, Study 3 investigates the moderating role of self-construal by comparing consumers from two countries which differ considerably in terms of self-construal, namely USA (n = 480) and Thailand (n = 480). The findings of these three studies are discussed. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are considered as well as implications for future research. (C) 2019

TI Being Active in Online Communications: Firm Responsiveness and Customer
   Engagement Behaviour
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This research investigates the behavioral effects of firms' online activeness in influencing customer engagement in word-of-mouth communications. Using a large-scale field dataset of hotel reviews and managerial responses, this study empirically examines firm responsiveness in relationship to community members' participation in the online review posting. Novel findings are reported that response volume and speed are important for effecting firm-customer interactions. This highlights a firm-leading influence on customers' word-of-mouth behaviour by identifying firm engagement as a motivational driver of customer engagement. It offers implications for researchers and practitioners with regard to social media marketing, in particular firm engaging in the online communication network by acting in an active and prompt manner.

TI Online Category Pricing at a Multichannel Grocery Retailer
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB As the importance of online grocery shopping increases, both pure-play online grocers and multichannel grocers are likely to be interested in setting optimal prices for their online stores. We use a unique household scanner panel dataset to investigate how a grocery retailer with both online and offline stores can set prices for its online store. We observe the same households shopping interchangeably at the online and offline stores of the same grocery chain and investigate their purchase behavior in specific product categories. We find that across three product categories, these households exhibit lower price sensitivities when shopping online than offline. In addition, a household's price sensitivity is inversely related to distance to the closest physical store. We compute the retailer's category profit-maximizing prices for the online store and explore several alternative pricing schemes that are consistent with the retailer's current price image. We find that the retailer can substantially increase its profits from online operations by fine tuning its current pricing policy. Given the estimated inverse relationship between price sensitivity and store distance, we investigate online zone pricing as a price discrimination tool based on residential location and find that the retailer can further improve store profits. We examine the potential mechanism to assign zones and determine the optimal number of pricing zones. (C) 2019 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI It's Not Just What You Say, But How You Say It: The Effect of Language
   Style Matching on Perceived Quality of Consumer Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study explores the role of language style in the perceived quality of online reviews. Drawing from research in psychology and sociology, we posit that language style matching (LSM) of a review-the degree to which the language style of a review matches the language style of intended customers-directly influences the perceived quality of the review. We also propose that LSM should matter more when processing fluency is greatly needed such as when customers learn about new products and process complicated product information. Using restaurant reviews from Yelp, we calculate the LSM score for every review to measure the distance between the language style of the focal review and the typical language style of the restaurant's intended customers. We find that LSM has a significant and positive effect on the number of useful votes received by a review. In addition, the effect of LSM is more pronounced for less familiar restaurants and for more complicated reviews. We discuss the implications of these findings for online review platforms, restaurant managers, and online review writers and close by identifying several opportunities for further research. (C) 2018

TI How Social Media Communications Combine with Customer Loyalty Management
   to Boost Green Retail Sales
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper explores the combined impact of social media and customer relationship management (CRM) on retail sales in the context of green (aka organic, natural and healthy) retailing, specifically in terms of duration. In particular, the study explores the impact on green retail sales of altruistic or egoistic marketing posts on a Facebook brand page relative to CRM membership over time compared with other types of sales. The results show that the purchase expenditures for longer-term members of a retailer's loyalty rewards program are higher and that over time, consumers are more likely to respond to messages related to healthy benefits than to those related to price and environmental benefits. This study demonstrates the value of managing social media in conjunction with CRM, which can positively influence the purchase behavior of a retailer's most valuable customers.

TI Post, Eat, Change: The Effects of Posting Food Photos on Consumers'
   Dining Experiences and Brand Evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Although posting food photos has become a pervasive phenomenon on social media platforms and has significant marketing implications for restaurants, there is not much evidence concerning why this practice has such implications. Building on research into self-expression and social influence, we hypothesize that posting food photos serves as a form of self-expression, which in turn leads to an enhanced dining experience. A field study, a laboratory experiment, and archival data from a popular Chinese social media platform provide support for our hypotheses. Specifically, Study 1 indicates that posting photos of food enhances consumers' dining experiences and leads to positive evaluations of restaurants. Study 2 identifies self-expression as the underlying mechanism and tests the moderating role of supportive interactions. Study 3 is a follow-up investigation into the real-time interactions examined in Study 2, using archival data from a popular social media platform. (C) 2018

With branded apps, companies try to create value for their brands among prospective and current customers by providing entertainment and information content. The aim of this study was to examine a) whether branded apps influence consumers' cognitive and affective brand responses, b) whether this effect is moderated by the type of branded app (i.e., information vs. entertainment), and c) to what extent enjoyment and elaboration are explanatory mechanisms for these effects. An experiment demonstrated that 1) branded apps enhanced brand responses, 2) an entertainment app evoked higher levels of enjoyment, which in turn enhanced affective brand responses, and 3) an informational app evoked higher levels of elaboration, which enhanced cognitive brand responses. Theoretical and practical implications for branded app designers and mobile advertisers are discussed. (C) 2019 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Digital Content Marketing's Role in Fostering Consumer Engagement,
   Trust, and Value: Framework, Fundamental Propositions, and Implications
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In a landscape of growing online consumer/firm interactions, digital content marketing (DCM) which aims to foster consumers' brand engagement and trust, is on the rise. However, despite significant practitioner interest, academic DCM research is lagging, resulting in an important knowledge gap. Based on an extensive review, we conceptualize DCM as the creation and dissemination of relevant, valuable brand-related content to current or prospective customers on digital platforms to develop their favorable brand engagement, trust, and relationships (vs. directly persuading consumers to purchase). We also develop a conceptual framework that identifies important consumer-based DCM antecedents, including uses-and-gratifications (U&G)-informed functional, hedonic, and authenticity-based motives for DCM interactions. DCM's first-tier, intra-interaction consequences include consumers' cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement that foster brand-related sense-making, identification, and citizenship behaviors, respectively. These in turn trigger DCM's second-tier, extra-interaction consequences of brand trust and attitude, which successively contribute to the development of DCM's third-tier, value-based consequences of consumer and firm-based brand equity. We summarize our findings in a set of Fundamental Propositions (FPs) of DCM and conclude by deriving key implications from our analyses.

TI Digital Sensory Marketing: Integrating New Technologies Into
   Multisensory Online Experience
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB People are increasingly purchasing (e.g., food, clothes) and consuming (e.g., movies, courses) online where, traditionally, the sensory interaction has mostly been limited to visual, and to a lesser extent, auditory inputs. However, other sensory interfaces (e.g., including touch screens, together with a range of virtual, and augmented solutions) are increasingly being made available to people to interact online. Moreover, recent progress in the field of human-computer interaction means that online environments will likely engage more of the senses and become more connected with offline environments in the coming years. This expansion will likely coincide with an increasing engagement with the consumer's more emotional senses, namely touch/haptics, and possibly even olfaction. Forward-thinking marketers and researchers will therefore need to appropriate the latest tools/technologies in order to deliver richer online experiences for tomorrow's consumers. This review is designed to help the interested reader better understand what sensory marketing in a digital context can offer, thus hopefully opening the way for further research and development in the area.

TI Calling Customers to Take Action: The Impact of Incentive and Customer
   Characteristics on Direct Mailing Effectiveness
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study investigates the effect of call-to-action (CTA) direct mailings (DMs) on customers' purchase behavior and how this effect is moderated by incentive type as well as customer characteristics. The authors analyze individual purchase behavior of a panel of 179,525 customers across 40 Dutch optical retailers over 9 years. The empirical results show that CTA DMs that include an incentive have a higher positive impact on customer's purchase probability compared with those without an incentive. Furthermore, non-monetary incentives, especially utilitarian ones, have a higher positive impact than monetary incentives. Our results also show that customer heterogeneity plays an important role in the influence of CTA DMs on purchase incidence. More specifically, CTA DMs have a higher impact on purchase incidence for customers with higher past purchase frequency, lower purchase recency, longer relationship duration and for customers who received DM more recently and frequently. The results of the study provide valuable insights for managers allocating their direct marketing budget: it is better to use non-monetary (preferably utilitarian) incentives and to target customers based on relationship history as well as DM history.

TI Responding to Causal Uncertainty in the Twitterverse: When Abstract
   Language and Social Prominence Increase Message Engagement
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Events that capture the public's attention are saturated with causal uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about why things happen). Yet, little is known about the type of language that is favored when communicating such events. We study this issue in the context of social media, as social media platforms are powerful tools for communication in politics and business, especially during times of heightened causal uncertainty. When causal uncertainty is high, people should evaluate more favorably messages that help relieve such uncertainty. Germane to our research, previous work has shown that abstract thinking helps reduce causal uncertainty, and that the goal to reduce causal uncertainty increases the desire for abstract thinking. We extend these findings to better understand the role of causal uncertainty in social interactions and message engagement. Using data from natural social media communications and experiments based on high-profile events, we demonstrate that individuals react more positively to abstract (vs. concrete) messages in situations of heightened causal uncertainty. Importantly, this effect is stronger when the message source is socially prominent, and hence, the message carries greater diagnosticity. Our results indicate that increasing the abstractness of a tweet by a standard deviation increases the average number of likes it receives by 10.25% and retweets by 4.07%. When originating from a source with a standard deviation of more followers than the average user, these messages receive 15.80% and 5.98% more likes and retweets, respectively. Beyond the clear managerial implications of our findings, we provide unique insights into why simplified causal explanations for complex problems may win over an audience during times of causal uncertainty.

TI Fake News, Real Problems for Brands: The Impact of Content Truthfulness
   and Source Credibility on consumers' Behavioral Intentions toward the
   Advertised Brands
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The presence of fake news via Internet media compels researchers and practitioners to understand the consequences of this phenomenon on marketing activities. Surprisingly, no marketing study to date has analyzed the effect of fake news on consumers' evaluations of a brand advertised on the same webpage. To fill this gap, this study empirically investigated whether individuals' perceptions of fake news transfer to an adjacent brand advertisement. Specifically, we manipulated news truthfulness and source credibility, observing the change in individuals' responses while distinguishing between objective truthfulness and the perceived credibility of the news.
   The results confirmed that the news' objective truthfulness exerts no direct effect on behavioral intentions toward the brand (i.e., intention to purchase, spread word-of-mouth, or visit the brand's store). However, we did uncover a chain of effects whereby the impact of fake news on behavioral intentions was fully mediated by people's perceptions of the news' credibility, which affected the perceived credibility of the sources, which then influenced brand trust, which finally translated into brand attitudes. From a managerial perspective, this study's results can partially reassure brand managers that their brand advertisements will not suffer from appearing next to fake news when the source itself is credible.

TI Determinants of Retailers' Cross-channel Integration: An Innovation
   Diffusion Perspective on Omni-channel Retailing
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The decision on whether and to what extent they should implement cross-channel integration is a crucial and complex task for multi-channel retailers. Although prior studies have sought to identify key determinants of this decision, most are descriptive or draw on divergent theoretical perspectives. The authors provide a cohesive theoretical model from the perspective of innovation diffusion, including not only technology-related but also organizational and environmental factors. The empirical findings based on the observations in the U.S. retail sector indicate that retailers' information-technology capabilities and private-label provision drive their cross-channel integration. Moderate diversity facilitates cross-channel integration more than does high or low diversity. Firms' financial resources seem to be less important or unimportant at a low level of industry concentration, but may influence retailers' cross-channel integration at a high level of industry concentration.

TI How Online Reviews Become Helpful: A Dynamic Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online product reviews aid consumer decision making. Although many studies show that review characteristics have salient effects on review helpfulness, little research has investigated whether such effects change temporally. To bridge this research gap, we study the dynamic formation of review helpfulness by considering the behaviors of three major players in a typical review system: consumers, the review hosting firm, and reviewers. This study uses both dynamic and static drivers of review helpfulness to examine temporal changes in their effects on review helpfulness, along two time characteristics of a post: its lifespan and its timing. Daily data collected from Amazon show that for long post lifespans or late post timing, the effects of static drivers and the spillover effect of dynamic drivers weaken, but the carryover effect of dynamic drivers strengthens. For vendors to leverage user reviews of a product, high-quality reviews posted early are extremely important and should be cultivated diligently. Sorting by review quality attributes, such as review length, also can effectively prolong the time window for reviewers to write high-quality detailed reviews.

TI Seriously Engaged Consumers: Navigating Between Work and Play in Online
   Brand Communities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Seriously engaged consumers create and manage online communities dedicated to brands or consumption activities, but this type of engagement remains under-examined. This study explores the contextual triggers and individual drivers of serious engagement in online communities and explains how seriously engaged consumers navigate the intersection between work and play that characterizes serious engagement. We draw from qualitative data spanning over a decade on the trajectory of four seriously engaged consumers who created and/or managed an online brand community for players of Microsoft's Xbox. Three contextual triggers (market-specific practices, marketplace shifts, sociotechnical advancements), when aligned with individual drivers (relevant skills and expertise, entrepreneurial vision, personal commitment), motivate consumers who have been engaged with a brand or consumption activity to deepen their engagement, becoming managers of or launching an online brand community. Consumers can navigate the in-between space of serious leisure through knowledge development or searching for personal fulfillment and/or external recognition. These findings support several contributions to the literature on consumer engagement: demonstrating the vital role seriously engaged consumers play in online community development; drawing attention to contextual triggers and individual drivers of consumer engagement that have not been addressed in prior research; and exploring how consumers navigate the in-between space arising from serious engagement in online communities, finding routes that can lead to deeper engagement in the community itself or redirect it to alternative targets.

TI Touchable Apps: Exploring the Usage of Touch Features and Their Impact
   on Engagement
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Touch has become an inseparable element of mobile platforms. This study examines the use of different touch features and the impact of these touch gestures on consumer engagement with a mobile shopping app. We focus on three informational touch features that are common among shopping apps: touch to zoom in on a page (zoom-page), to view product details (product-view), and to be directed to outside links (open-webpage). We develop a two-level model that captures (1) consumers' decisions to stay with or leave an app and (2) their use of touch features. Our main results empirically demonstrate the strong explanatory power of informational touch gestures, especially their dwell time, in consumer app browsing decisions, whereas navigational touch gestures do not significantly affect app. stay likelihood. A longer dwell time and early use of zoom-page within a session encourage the stay. Moreover, we observe strong synergy and antergy (negative synergy) among these touch gestures. The cumulative dwell time and temporal progression of touch gestures affect subsequent touch feature usage. Managerially, our results suggest that an early intervention that encourages the use of zoom-page increases app stay likelihood, and marketers may apply our model to quantify the impact of such interventions on consumer browsing decisions at the individual level. The results also shed light on how marketers can infer the stage of the shopping process based on touch gestures (segmentation) and guide consumers through the purchase funnel by promoting the use of zoom-page and product-view. Lastly, the findings provide insights into how marketers can promote the use of open-webpage, which has the lowest baseline usage rate yet is crucial for transactions, based on the synergy among touch gestures and through improving the non-native browsing experience.

TI The Effects of Online Incivility and Consumer-to-Consumer Interactional
   Justice on Complainants, Observers, and Service Providers During Social
   Media Service Recovery
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Using a mixed-methods approach, the current research examines online incivility in relation to service recovery on social media. First, findings from a netnographic investigation suggest consumer-to-consumer (C2C) incivility results in some consumers holding the firm accountable to address uncivil exchanges on a firm-managed communication channel. Based on the netnographic findings, fairness theory, and justice theory, a follow-up experimental study assesses how online incivility negatively affects service recovery outcomes (firm consumer justice) when a firm chooses (not) to respond to the incivility. Through these two studies, the current paper proposes a new form of justice (C2C interactional justice) and posits that online service recovery extends beyond direct victims of the incivility (first-party justice) to also include observers (third-party justice). This more nuanced view of justice associated with a service recovery is especially significant when considering the traditional relationships of justice with satisfaction, loyalty, positive word-of-mouth, and other desirable firm outcomes. For practitioners, this research suggests that firms must manage C2C interactional justice on corporate social media channels for both complainants and observers to avoid reputational damage and a loss of customers.

TI The Boundaries of Gamification for Engaging Customers: Effects of Losing
   a Contest in Online Co-creation Communities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Despite the increasing use of gamification mechanics to engage customers in firms' activities, the risks related to such use remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, this research examines the impacts of losing a challenge, which is a phenomenon experienced by the majority of customers involved in gamified settings but underexplored in literature. We investigate the context of co-creation communities by combining two widely used gamification mechanics, competition and cooperation. Results from three laboratory experiments and one field experiment show that win/lose decisions weaken the benefits of gamification and, in the case of losing a competition, have negative impacts on customer experience and engagement. They also demonstrate that customers' levels of prior engagement with the community moderate the negative impacts of losing a competition. Supported by equity theory, this research questions the effectiveness of gamification mechanics, identifies their limits, and provides guidelines on how to properly implement them.

TI A Consumer-based Taxonomy of Digital Customer Engagement Practices
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers can engage with brands online in a variety of ways, ranging from playing a branded game to writing a review or viewing branded content. This work presents a consumer-based taxonomy of these digital engagement practices. By means of a literature review and expert surveys, we created an overview of the ways in which consumers digitally engage with brands across different media formats and platforms. A consumer sample then classified all practices into five distinct types of digital engagement practices (for fun practices, learning practices, customer feedback, work for a brand, talk about a brand). A subsequent survey on another consumer sample showed that the five types of practices are differently related to the three motivational states of customer brand engagement (cognitive, emotional and behavioral). The taxonomy of digital engagement practices integrates prior research. We provide implications for managing digital customer engagement.

TI I See Myself in Service and Product Consumptions: Measuring
   Self-transformative Consumption Vision (SCV) Evoked by Static and Rich
   Media
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB When consumers encounter uncertainty regarding their purchase decisions, they tend to perform a mental visualization process of creating a self-involved imaginative future incident about a product/service in which the consumption outcome is envisioned. The current study proposes a new measurement instrument to capture the process, namely self-transformative consumption vision (SCV) scale. Although similar theoretical constructs have been introduced, validity tests in more diverse media platforms and more elaborated measurement approaches are required. As today's marketing communications are increasingly oriented toward stimulating SCV through diverse rich and interactive media, it is considered scholarly and practically meaningful to propose a new scale. To this end, several pretests are conducted for initial item generations and stimuli developments. Studies 1 and 2 identify valid items that capture SCV and Study 3 establishes the SCV construct's nomological validity. Studies 4 and 5 apply this scale in an empirical study, thereby comparing it to existing scales to identify scale superiority.

TI "How to Project Customer Retention" Revisited: The Role of Duration
   Dependence
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Cohort-level retention rates typically increase over time, and the beta-geometric (BG) distribution has proven to be a robust model for capturing and projecting these patterns into the future. According to this model, the phenomenon of increasing cohort-level retention rates is purely due to cross-sectional heterogeneity; an individual customer's propensity to churn does not change over time. In this paper we present the beta-discrete-Weibull (BdW) distribution as an extension to the BG model, one that allows individual-level churn probabilities to increase or decrease over time. In addition to capturing the phenomenon of increasing cohort-level retention rates, this new model can also accommodate situations in which there is an initial dip in retention rates before they increase (i.e., a U-shaped cohort-level retention curve). A key finding is that even when aggregate retention rates are monotonically increasing, the individual-level churn probabilities are unlikely to be declining over time, as conventional wisdom would suggest. We carefully explore these connections between heterogeneity, duration dependence, and the shape of the retention curve, and draw some managerially relevant conclusions, e.g., that accounting for cross-sectional heterogeneity is more important than accounting for any individual-level dynamics in churn propensities.

TI The Role of a Companion Banner and Sponsorship Transparency in
   Recognizing and Evaluating Article-style Native Advertising
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Native advertising is a relatively new form of online advertising that matches the format of surrounding non-advertising content. The fact that native advertising blends into its context risks deceiving consumers who may be unaware the content they are viewing is actually advertising. Article-style native advertising, a native ad form that mimics the style of online news articles, is particularly concerning since consumers may not expect advertising to appear in such a format. Such concern is supported by research finding low efficacy of traditional disclosures on article-style native advertisements. We investigate a novel means of increasing ad recognition through the use of companion banner advertising. Across two experiments we demonstrate that inclusion of a companion banner boosts consumer recognition of the paid nature of article-style native advertising to the same degree as a traditional disclosure. In both cases we also find that the negative reactions caused by ad recognition are muted when a native ad is perceived as having higher sponsorship transparency. These effects occur for both familiar and unfamiliar brands. Taken together, results not only detail the efficacy of a new means of achieving adequate disclosure, but also develop greater understanding of how consumers respond to article-style native advertising.

TI Battle of the Brand Fans: Impact of Brand Attack and Defense on Social
   Media
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Fans of a brand attack fans of rival brands on social media. Given the nature of such rival brand fan attacks, managers are unsure about how much control they should exercise on brand-negative comments on their owned social media touchpoints, and what brand actions drive these Attack, Defense and Across (ADA) posts. Multimethod analysis identifies ADA's impact across industries of technology, fast food, toothpaste, beverages, and sports apparel. Sentiment analysis identifies that fans posting in both communities stimulate both brand-negative and brand-positive comments. Despite their relatively low prevalence (1-6% of all posts), ADA posts induce broader social-media brand engagement as they substantially increase and prolong the effects of managerial control variables such as communication campaigns and new-product introductions. Brand managers, thus, have specific levers to stimulate the positive consequences of rival brand fan posting on their owned media.

TI Good to Be Novel? Understanding How Idea Feasibility Affects Idea
   Adoption Decision Making in Crowdsourcing
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Soliciting novel ideas from the crowd is a paradigm shift for innovation that gains increasing attention from researchers and practitioners. However, studies examining the relationship between the novelty of crowdsourced ideas and firms' idea adoption decisions are surprisingly rare. This research adopts the path-of-least-resistance (POLR) theory as a new theoretical angle to examine the role of idea feasibility as a key heuristic cue mediating the effect of idea novelty on adoption decisions. We further explore factors that may amplify or mitigate this mediation. Using data collected from a laboratory experiment and a firm-sponsored crowdsourcing community, we reveal that firms tend to follow the POLR by using idea feasibility as meta-information to evaluate novel ideas in their idea adoption decisions. However, this tendency depends on external stimuli and constraints, such that the mediation of idea feasibility exists only when idea favorability from the crowd is low or when an ideator's prior ideation participation is high. Our supplementary study further offers preliminary insights on the extension of our proposed effects to the ultimate success of adopted ideas. These findings illuminate a better understanding of firms' idea adoption decisions and suggest ways to manage idea crowdsourcing effectively for new product/service development and improvements.

TI Transforming Consumers Into Brands: Tracing Transformation Processes of
   the Practice of Blogging
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The goal of this research is to explore the transformational power of a new consumption and production practice, the practice of blogging, to understand its impact on consumers' identity transformations beyond their self-concept as consumers and on the blogosphere as an organizational field. Through an exploratory study of over 12,000 blog posts from five fashion bloggers, complemented by in-depth interviews, we trace the transformation of consumer bloggers. We identify and describe three identity phases, the individual consumer, collective blogger and blogger identity phase, and two important turning points. Our findings show that through a continuous process of identity negotiation, adaptation, and reinterpretation with multiple stakeholders, these bloggers transform into human brands. In turn, these individual transformation processes reciprocally influence the emergence of blogging as a professional practice and of the blogosphere as a new organizational field. These findings contribute to a theoretical understanding of consumer transformation processes in a new field, where consumers can leave their role as consumers through continuously engaging in identity negotiation, adaptation and re-interpretation, creating alternative points of reference and validation in a new field that in turn continues to influence their brand identity. Furthermore, our findings contribute to an understanding of human brands from a brand-as-process perspective, and have implications for brands wishing to collaborate with these influential actors.

TI Don't Just "Like" Me, Promote Me: How Attachment and Attitude Influence
   Brand Related Behaviors on Social Media
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB As social media marketing becomes more pervasive, questions continue to emerge regarding utilizing the medium strategically to maximize positive brand-related outcomes. Marketers are increasingly seeking guidance for targeting consumers who will interact and behave in ways that are meaningful to the brand on social media. Understanding how individual differences among consumers can influence social media behaviors linked to valuable organizational outcomes is crucial for managers seeking to justify social media marketing expenditures. This research addresses that issue by applying Attachment Theory to social media. In Study 1, we examine the roles of two individual difference factors, attitude toward social media and attachment to social media (ASM), in predicting token and meaningful behaviors on social media. We find that while attitude toward social media and ASM are both related to token behaviors, only ASM predicts meaningful behaviors. In Study 2, we investigate attachment and attitude toward the brand and social media as predictors of offline and social media brand advocacy and demonstrate that individuals who are attached to or have a positive attitude toward the brand are more likely to engage in offline advocacy. Further, ASM adds incremental explanatory power, beyond attitude and attachment to the brand, in predicting advocacy via social media. In Study 3, we examine likelihood of advocating for a brand via social media as a moderator and find that even consumers who are not likely to be offline advocates are more likely to advocate for the brand on social media if they are strongly attached to social media. In sum, the results indicate that ASM is an important predictor of meaningful social media behaviors and is a new means by which marketers can identify consumers who are more likely to perform meaningful behaviors for brands via social media.

TI Understanding the Omnichannel Customer Journey: Determinants of
   Interaction Choice
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Through the proliferation of channels and ways to engage in these channels, customers today have an unprecedented range of options to individualize their customer journey. This study investigated the underlying and overt reasons for customers' interaction choices using focus groups, expert interviews, and laddering interviews with motor insurance customers to make three central contributions. First, omnichannel customer journeys are inherently individualistic but driven by effects that apply to any single interaction, sequencing effects, and customer journey patterns. The latter pertain to sections of the journey that cover multiple interactions and include both research shopping and the novel impersonalization/interactivity reduction effects. Second, the analysis of customers' underlying reasons for interaction choices provides novel explanations for these effects and indicates why customers' search efforts regarding motor insurance are limited. Third, four types of value-in-use that customers seek in their interactions were found to be the ultimate underlying motives and are suggested to segment customers more effectively than the predominant efforts that rely on observable interaction behavior.

TI The Effects of Culture on Consumers' Consumption and Generation of
   Online Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In the globalized industry of online travel agencies, it is well known that providing culturally customized reviews can attract more customers by sharing similarity-oriented experiences. Given the importance of culturally customized reviews, if national cultures lead to systematic differences in the review generating process, it is necessary to examine whether culturally customized information would be useful in customers' decision making processes and whether customers prefer online travel agencies providing such information. The objective of this research is to investigate whether (1) culturally customized review information based on nationality might have an influence on consumers' intention to recommend an agency, and whether (2) cultural differences have differential impacts on review posting in terms of the valence and dispersion of review ratings and textual contents of reviews. We find that customers from Western societies, such as the U.K. and the U.S., tend to be positively predisposed and that the dispersion of their ratings is significantly less for hotels in Beijing where they stayed compared to that of Chinese customers. Furthermore, using two experimental surveys, we reveal that customers regard the average review rating from review posters with same cultural background as more useful than those from all reviewers in their decision-making process.

TI A Neuropsychological Study on How Consumers Process Risky and Secure
   E-payments
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Dependable online payment systems (e-payments) are fundamental in promoting future online purchases. Yet little research has focused on either the differences between secure and risky e-payments or consumer reactions to the different systems. This study reverts to neuroscience (fMRI) to 1) identify the neural effects pertaining to risky and secure e-payments and 2) reveal the underlying brain mechanisms when confronted with two widespread systems: debit cards and Paypal. Thirty subjects participated in an experiment simulating a low-involvement online purchase. The analysis reveals that perceived risky e-payments activate brain areas linked to negative emotional processing, while areas involved with reward prediction are strongly triggered by secure e-payments. Furthermore, the study not only reveals a greater intention of use toward Paypal, but sees it as more secure, rewarding and affective. Debit card e-payments, by contrast, elicit brain activations associated with negative and risky events. Interestingly, the right cerebellum response (responsible for value encoding) covaried with more positive use intention toward Paypal. These results offer invaluable insight into the unconscious origin of the choice of payment systems among consumers. (C) 2018 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

An inherent characteristic of gamification is the gameful experience of consumers when using a gamified application. However, no existing measure captures the gameful experience consumers feel when they engage with gamified applications. Based on an extensive literature review and six consecutive studies, the authors develop and validate a new gameful experience scale [GAMEX] for measuring gameful experience in gamification. The results confirm that the GAMEX is a reliable and valid measure, which is useful for both, researchers and practitioners, and easy to apply in different gamification settings.

TI Finding Meaning in Contradiction on Employee Review Sites - Effects of
   Discrepant Online Reviews on Job Application Intentions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Sharing experiences with peers through online reviews has amplified the impacts of individual articulations on the reputations of firms across many industries. With employee review sites, current and former employees share their positive and negative experiences with their company, which has become an increasingly important aspect for reputation management and for job seekers' decision-making on where to apply. In the present study, the effects of discrepant reviews (i.e., reviews with a high variance in company evaluations) are examined in the context of employer review sites. In particular, we investigate how review discrepancy, persuasion knowledge activation, and constructive company responses affect job seekers' trust in the company and the resulting application intentions. In our preliminary study, we analyzed a sample of 25,827 published company reviews on the German employee rating site Kununu.de. The results revealed that high levels of discrepant reviews for the same company exist, thus underlining the need for additional studies. In our main study, a 2 (review discrepancy) x 2 (persuasion knowledge activation) x 2 (company response) between-subject-design experiment was conducted with 311 respondents. We find that high levels of discrepancies lead to increased intentions to avoid submitting applications to the focal company and reduced intentions to pursue employment. This study complements the research concerning online reputation by highlighting the relevance of discrepant reviews for job seekers' application intentions.

TI Uncovering Patterns of Product Co-consideration: A Case Study of Online
   Vehicle Price Quote Request Data
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers often consider multiple alternatives from the same product category prior to making a purchase. Uncovering the predominant patterns of such co-considerations can help businesses learn more about the competitive structure of the market in the mind of the consumer. Extant research has shown that various types of online and offline consumer activity data (e.g., shopping baskets, search and browsing histories, social media mentions) can be used to infer product co-considerations. In this paper, we study a case of uncovering co-consideration patterns using a massive dataset of online price quote requests from U.S. auto shoppers. The main challenge we face is that, for privacy protection, no unique individual identifier (anonymous or otherwise) is contained in the data. Such a data deficiency prevents us from using existing methods such as affinity analysis for inferring co-considerations. However, by leveraging spatiotemporal patterns in the data, we manage to probabilistically uncover the predominant patterns of co-considerations in the U.S. auto market. As a validation and illustration of its usefulness, we embed the inferred market structure in a sales response model and show a substantial improvement in predictive performance.

TI How Brand Disclosure Timing and Brand Prominence Influence Consumer's
   Intention to Share Branded Entertainment Content
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The spread of branded entertainment video online relies on the consumer's referral decision, an initial decision to share the video. This study investigates how brand prominence and brand disclosure timing in a branded entertainment video interact with each other and affect viewers' persuasion knowledge, sharing intention, and visual attention. The study finds that when the branded nature of the video was disclosed prior to viewing the video content, prominent placement generated greater conceptual/attitudinal persuasion knowledge compared to subtle placement. Accordingly, greater persuasion knowledge resulted in less sharing intention and active avoidance in visual attention to the brand in the video content. On the other hand, when the brand was disclosed after the video content, there were no significant effects of brand prominence on conceptual or attitudinal persuasion knowledge, or on sharing intention. Further, the study shed light on the underlying mechanism of interaction effect by demonstrating the mediating role of attitudinal persuasion knowledge and enjoyment. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. (C) 2018 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI The Effect of House Ads on Multichannel Sales
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Similar to in-store displays in brick-and-mortar stores, house ads promote a set of specific products for customers who have reached the website. In contrast to general display advertising whose primary goal is to bring traffic to the website, these self-promotional ads are aimed to highlight specific products and enhance conversion. We analyzed more than 300 house ad campaigns to study the effect of this type of promotional display on customer behavior across channels. We included not only direct effects on SKU sales in all channels, but also the promotional effect at the category level. Our model uses aggregated data that are easy to collect for most multichannel retailers, facilitating its implementation in similar settings. We found that (1) despite observing positive cross-channel effects, the primary effect occurs on online sales, (2) the effects are usually short-lived, and (3) there are no spillover effects on the corresponding category. We characterize the effects that house ads have on the whole system in terms of design variables such as type of display, and scope and duration of the campaign. Our evidence suggests that the effectiveness depends on the product category and that regular banners are the most effective in generating traffic. Interestingly, the depth of the promotion plays no role on the effect of the house ads' effectiveness. Based on the results, we provide suggestions for improving routine promotional planning.

TI Dyad Calling Behavior: Asymmetric Power and Tie Strength Dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We develop a model of dyad calling behavior as the outcome of asymmetric power between the initiating and receiving callers and the strength of their tie. Using a unique mobile phone service dataset, we estimate the model which encapsulates the evolving relationship between pairs of callers. We find that, first, the initiating callers enjoy more power than the receiving callers in determining the call volume. Second, the call volume between a pair of callers increases with the number of their common contacts. Finally, the reciprocity effect is prevalent in mobile phone service consumption. We discuss and demonstrate the implications of our results on firms' telecommunication service pricing decisions. (C) 2018 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

TI Using Websites to Recruit Franchisee Candidates
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Unlike other interorganizational relationships, such as joint ventures, franchisors commonly display information on their websites with the objective of attracting franchisee entrepreneurs and having them sign standardized contracts. This paper analyses, for the first time, how franchise brands disclose both functional and symbolic benefits and their effect on franchise chain growth. Our empirical study, based on an in-depth analysis of 106 websites, suggests that both types of benefits are intertwined in advertising franchise opportunities. Information on financial requirements, contact facilities and recruiting processes are positively related to franchise chain growth, whereas information on business potential (financial expectations) is negatively related to growth. Moreover, information on continuous assistance is relevant for service-type franchisee candidates. Finally, our observations show that information available in all the categories is far from exhaustive and that influential information is frequently absent from franchisor websites.

TI Positive Effects of Disruptive Advertising on Consumer Preferences
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Advertisers want to get consumers to love the advertised products, but they often try to do this by annoying them with unwelcome and disruptive advertising. This creates a possible contradiction between the negative feelings elicited by the advertising and the positive feelings the consumers are supposed to develop towards the advertised products. One may assume that the negative feelings towards annoying advertising are transferred to the advertised brands. This assumption was tested in a series of five experiments. Participants were disrupted by annoying pop-up ads while playing a popular computer game. In a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test, participants were required to choose between advertised and new brands. The advertised brands were preferred over the new brands, even though the ads were perceived as annoying. The positive effects of disruptive advertising can be attributed to the enhanced fluency of advertised brands. These findings demonstrate that disruptive advertising can be effective in increasing brand preferences, which may help to explain the widespread use of this type of advertising in practice. However, before recommending the use of disruptive advertising, it should be taken into consideration that it may also have undesirable side effects such as increasing advertising avoidance.

TI Anxiety and Ephemeral Social Media Use in Negative eWOM Creation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers regularly share negative eWOM regarding brand experiences, yet the effects of emotions in this process are unknown. Using the framework of Stimulus Organism Response theory we operationalized our study in the context of ephemeral (self-deleting) social media. Across two studies, consumers experienced anxiety during the creation of eWOM, particularly after considering a negative brand experience. Anxiety was manifest in consumers' decisions to reduce the time availability of online messages and appeased by the use of ephemeral social media. This behavior, in theory, reduces the threat to consumers' impression management goals caused by sharing negative eWOM within their social networks. Further evidence is found as consumers limit (lengthen) message availability a) when including less (more) positive words in their messages, or b) when sharing about non-economic (economic) experiences. We discuss the implications of consumer emotion and anxiety on the availability of eWOM in social media. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

TI Watch Your Tone: How a Brand's Tone of Voice on Social Media Influences
   Consumer Responses
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Social media platforms enable firms to communicate directly and often publicly with individual consumers. In this research, comprising four online studies, the authors investigate how the tone of voice used by firms (human vs. corporate) influences purchase intentions on social media. Findings suggest that a human tone of voice is not always the firm's best option. Study la (N = 174) shows that using a human voice, instead of the more traditional corporate voice, can increase a consumer's hedonic value on social media and also purchase intentions. However, that influence of a human voice on purchase intentions is stronger when the consumer is looking at a brand page with a hedonic goal in mind (versus a utilitarian one). Study 1b (N = 342) shows that the presence of several negative comments about a brand on social media acts as a boundary condition, nullifying the influence of a human voice on purchase intentions. Studies 2a (N = 154) and 2b (N = 202) show in different settings that using a human voice can even reduce purchase intentions in contexts of high situational involvement, due to perceptions of risk associated with humanness. The results contribute to the literature surrounding the effects of conversational human voice, while also providing managers with a set of guidelines to help inform and identify which tone of voice is best adapted to each communications scenario.

TI Viral Promotional Advergames: How Intrinsic Playfulness and the
   Extrinsic Value of Prizes Elicit Behavioral Responses
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB When designing a viral promotional advergame (VPA) (which combines a promotional game and an advergame in a viral marketing campaign), marketers focus on game schemes and prizes to trigger players' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and elicit certain behavioral responses, such as sharing personal data and forwarding the game. A field study examines factors that lead to behavioral responses in VPAs. The results show that players who perceive more playfulness tend to increase their game forwarding and personal data sharing behaviors. The perceived value of prizes also relates positively to game forwarding but not to personal data sharing. Finally, the results show that prior brand attitudes moderate the effect of the perceived value of prizes on game forwarding behavior.

TI Do Colors Change Realities in Online Shopping?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study investigates the links among color, price, and patronage intention on the Internet. With regard to the effects of a store website's background colors and product prices, the interactions of background colors and price levels may influence online patronage intention via perceptions of quality, sacrifice, and value. The results reveal that online consumers' reactions to online merchandise prices vary according to website background colors. Participants who view blue or low-brightness backgrounds have high patronage intentions regardless of whether prices are high or low. Participants who view red or high-brightness backgrounds are sensitive to merchandise prices and react significantly negatively to high prices. Further mediation analyses indicate that website background colors can influence how consumers interpret price levels: Blue backgrounds make consumers use high price as a sign of high quality rather than monetary sacrifice, but red or high-brightness backgrounds make consumers use high price as a sign of high monetary sacrifice rather than product quality.

TI Pricing Best Sellers and Traffic Generators: The Role of Asymmetric
   Cross-selling
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Among the many items online retailers sell, some stand out as best sellers and are often sold at considerable discounts. Best seller discounting can encourage customer traffic and the purchase of a basket of other products in the same transaction. Although most studies treat retailers as symmetric, the cross-selling potential is generally asymmetric across retailers, since some online retailers have more products to sell. In addition, the cross-selling effect works both ways customers intending to buy a best seller may buy other items in their shopping basket, while other customers intending to buy a basket may buy a best seller while visiting the retailer. The authors model the pricing implications of this rich variety of asymmetric cross-selling, with both best sellers and typical baskets acting as traffic generators and cross-sold products. The common wisdom that loss leader pricing leads to neither a significant increase in store traffic nor an increase in profits does not apply in an asymmetric case where one retailer has more products to cross-sell. The cross-selling potential of products even far down the best seller list is demonstrated. Empirical analyses provide support for key findings of the theoretical model using book pricing and sales rank data from multiple online retailers.

TI Making-the-Product-Happen: A Driver of Crowdfunding Participation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Crowdfunding campaigns, where entrepreneurs seek consumer funding to develop new products, foster dynamics that go beyond traditional seller buyer transactions. This research studies how consumers increase their participation when they believe their contribution is pivotal to product creation. Utilizing controlled experiments we find that making-the-product-happen motivates participation above and beyond the desire to help the entrepreneurs. Moreover, we show how this motivation, which increases when an all-or-nothing campaign is drawing to a close and its financing target is within reach, is driven by future product availability. Furthermore, we identify conditions where making-it-happen dominates herding and an increase in the backing actions of others decreases one's willingness to back. Lastly, consistent with the notion that individual backers can determine campaign success, an analysis of over 200,000 Kickstarter projects shows that 33% of all successful campaigns hinge on the marginal support of no more than three average backers.

TI Weight Loss Through Virtual Support Communities: A Role for
   Identity-based Motivation in Public Commitment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Individuals increasingly participate in virtual support communities (VSCs) where they conduct numerous aspects of their lives with others whom they may never encounter in person, and they interact within these communities to attain various goals. Research finds that individuals are more likely to achieve success with such goals when they make a public commitment to achieving them. Through our netnographic inquiry, we extend prior theorizing of VSC with an explanation of how public commitment manifests in VSC in support of goal attainment. More specifically, we find these online communities make salient a context relevant social identity which motivates behaviors that facilitate compliance to the public commitment, and hence, more effective goal pursuit. In addition, we create a typology of member roles within these VSC that further influence public commitment. Our findings contribute to theories of VSC and public commitment.

TI Consumer Search of Multiple Information Sources and its Impact on
   Consumer Price Satisfaction
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB When making important purchase decisions, consumers often consult multiple information sources. This paper exanines how consumers allocate their search time across offline and Internet sources using survey data from new automobile purchases. Our analysis shows how time spent on Internet sources interrelates with time spent on offline sources, such as car dealerships, and vice versa. Furthermore, we examine whether longer search times imply higher price satisfaction as an outcome of search. A simultaneous equations Tobit model with latent classes is used. Analysis of a decade of survey data reveals two automobile purchaser segments of which the larger one accounts for 91% of observations. Based on this, we find that (1) specific website types can complement or substitute for offline information sources and for each other and (2) longer search times result in increased price satisfaction but only on specific information sources. Our findings provide automobile manufacturers and dealers an insightful way to utilize and manage different sources for product and price information provision.

AB Based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study examined how rewards could weaken intrinsic motivation to use a retail loyalty program. Two experiments were conducted. Study 1 revealed that individuals who received a salient reward (an explicit requirement and deadline for reward achievement and no reward options) presented lower intrinsic motivation to engage in the loyalty program than those who received its non-salient counterpart (a less explicit requirement, no deadline, and reward options). Study 2 found that the salient reward presented in the gamified form using graphical feedback enhanced the lowered intrinsic motivation. Implications for designing effective loyalty programs are discussed. (c) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

AB During the past two decades, the focus of marketing has moved from the tactics of persuasion to the strategies of value cocreation. After moving toward cognitive science and corporate strategies in the early 2000s, marketing research returned to its traditional domains of consumer psychologies and customer management. While conscientious consumers are gradually restraining themselves from selfish indulgence, marketers have refocused on a new set of values that encompass mental, experiential, and societal well-being. In this regard, we adopt an unprecedented approach by incorporating topic modeling with social network analysis. The results show that, in terms of topic heterogeneity, the most impactful journals are the most diverse, whereas each runner-up has a unique focus. Among the joumals, we detect two major co-authorship communities, and among the topics, we detect three. Further, we find that the communities of the most cited papers are composed of heterogeneous clusters of similar topics. The pivots within, and the bridges between, these communities are also reported. In the spirit of collaborative research, our topic model and network analysis are shared via online collaboration and visualization platforms that readers can use to explore our models interactively and to download the dataset for further studies.

TI Consumer Connectivity in a Complex, Technology-enabled, and
   Mobile-oriented World with Smart Products
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Today's consumers are immersed in a vast and complex array of networks. Each network features an interconnected mesh of people and firms, and now, with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), also objects. Technology (particularly mobile devices) enables such connections, and facilitates many kinds of interactions in these networks?from transactions, to social information sharing, to people interfacing with connected devices (e.g., wearable technology).
   We introduce the POP-framework, discuss how People, Objects and the Physical world inter-connect with each other and how it results in an increasing amount of connected data, and briefly summarize existing knowledge on these inter-connections. We also provide an agenda for future research focused on examining potential impact of IoT and smart products on consumer behavior and firm strategies.

TI The Presentation Format of Review Score Information Influences Consumer
   Preferences Through the Attribution of Outlier Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Review score information can be presented in different formats. In three online experiments, we examined consumers' behavior in the context of review scores presented in a disaggregated format (individual review scores observed sequentially and individually), an aggregated format (review scores summarized into a frequency distribution chart), or both together. Participants tended to attribute outlier review scores to reviewer rather than product reasons. This tendency was more prevalent when reviews were presented in disaggregated format. Moreover, reviews attributed to reviewer reasons tended to be perceived with low credibility. When presented with a choice between two products with equal average review scores but different variances, participants chose as if outlier review scores were discounted when scores were presented in the disaggregated format. This tendency emerged even when disaggregated and aggregated formats were presented together. The number of review scores moderated the effect of format on choice. We argue that disaggregated information allows consumers to better track the number of outliers and, when the number of outliers is small, prompts them to attribute these outliers to reviewer reasons, and subsequently discount them.

TI To Share and Protect: Using Regulatory Focus Theory to Examine the
   Privacy Paradox of Consumers' Social Media Engagement and Online Privacy
   Protection Behaviors
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers' personal information often informs retailers' marketing efforts in terms of creating value in the online marketplace. This study examines four factors related to consumers' social media engagement and online privacy protection behaviors. Regulatory focus, social exchange, and marketing relationship theories explain the online consumer personal information share-and-protect model developed. Consumers aged 18-64 years across the United States participated in this survey research. The results suggest that while personal privacy violation experience and perceived secondary control of one's personal information are influential antecedents, privacy concerns and trust in social media websites mediate each of these respectively. The findings suggest that promotion- and prevention-related behaviors regarding personal information align with the orientation of the antecedents, indicating that regulatory focus theory shows promise for examining the privacy paradox. We conclude by developing a matrix that integrates regulatory focus and social exchange theories to guide future research. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

TI Permission Marketing and Privacy Concerns - Why Do Customers (Not) Grant
   Permissions?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Little is known about the influence of motivators that drive consumers to grant permission to be contacted via personalized communication. In this study, a framework is developed to investigate the effect of select drivers of consumers granting permission to receive personalized messages. The authors distinguish between drivers related to benefit and cost to the consumers. They identify the influence of perceived personal relevance, entertainment, and consumer information control as well as monetary incentives and lottery participation as benefit-related factors. Cost-related factors entail the registration process, privacy concerns, and perceived intrusiveness. The authors find that, except for monetary incentives and lottery participation, the identified drivers significantly influence consumers' decision to grant permission. The strong negative influence of privacy concerns on the probability of granting permission can be lessened by two benefit-related factors, namely message content with entertainment value or personal relevance for the consumer. The study helps to improve firm measures aimed at getting more permissions granted by customers for interactive campaigns. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

TI Mobile Shopping Through Applications: Understanding Application
   Possession and Mobile Purchase
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Smartphones have penetrated rapidly and mobile shopping provides promising market opportunities for retailers. However, little is known about mobile shopping patterns and inferring these patterns from online shopping may provide misleading insights. We combine mobile log data and a mobile panel survey, and examine two stages in mobile shopping: the possession of shopping applications (hereafter, apps) and the purchase via shopping apps. Our exploratory investigation of mobile data and its empirical analyses provide three substantive findings. First, online experience and mobile experience both positively relate to the possession of shopping apps. Second, browsing behavior for non-shopping apps helps understand the possession of shopping apps as it reflects user preferences for acquiring more apps. Third, purchasing decisions are explained by digital experience (i.e., online experience and mobile experience) and browsing information from shopping apps, with other factors being of little predictive value. The implications for mobile retailing research and practice are discussed. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Basket Composition and Choice Among Direct Channels: A Latent State
   Model of Shopping Costs
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Shoppers of multi-channel retailers often place orders using different channels on different shopping occasions. The differential use of channels is related to both basket composition and channel characteristics, such as the ability of the channel to provide additional information that resolves uncertainty about the purchase. In this paper, we examine the impact of basket composition on the choice among direct channels. We develop a two-stage, shopping cost model with two, latent states. Given a shopping basket, the shopper first decides if she needs additional information about items in the basket. If she is uncertain about the items in the basket meeting her needs, she uses an information rich channel, such as the retailer's website or call center, and risk reduction costs become salient in addition to the other shopping costs. If she does not require additional information, she places her order by choosing among all available channels, and she may incur a welfare loss from making a purchase that does not optimally meet her needs. We operationalize welfare loss with Shannon information and various metrics based on purchase history.
   Our empirical setting is a data set from a catalog retailer that offers multiple direct channels. Our estimates show that basket composition impacts channel choice. Large baskets shift to the Internet channel, suggesting that the Internet channel has lower ordering costs. High-risk baskets shift to call centers and this suggests that the call center has lower risk reduction costs. Collectively these estimates provide evidence for the notion of channel specialization-some channels are better at addressing certain shopping costs compared to others. Our estimates also show that electronic self-service channels have high initial access costs and a significant learning curve compared to the call center suggesting that these channels might be better suited to heavy users. We use the estimated model to quantify the value of channels, to identify categories that need risk reduction, and to segment and target shoppers for Internet ordering based on basket size and the potential to accumulate experience.

TI Is Augmented Reality Technology an Effective Tool for E-commerce? An
   Interactivity and Vividness Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study evaluates the effectiveness of augmented reality (AR) as an e-commerce tool using two products - sunglasses and watches. Study 1 explores the effectiveness of AR by comparing it to a conventional website. The results show that AR provides effective communication benefits by generating greater novelty, immersion, enjoyment, and usefulness, resulting in positive attitudes toward medium and purchase intention, compared to the web-based product presentations. Study 2 compares the paths by which consumers evaluate products through AR versus web with a focus on interactivity and vividness. It is revealed that immersion mediates the relationship between interactivity/vividness and two outcome variables - usefulness and enjoyment in the AR condition compared to the web condition where no significant paths between interactivity and immersion and between previous media experience and media novelty are found. Participants' subjective opinions about AR are examined through opinion mining to better understand consumer responses to AR.

TI Second Person Pronouns Enhance Consumer Involvement and Brand Attitude
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online brand messaging, e.g., blogging or posting on social media platforms, has an important role in digital marketing strategy. Such messaging is largely text based and provides an opportunity for brands to interact with many consumers simultaneously. The marketing literature, however, has yet to provide sufficient guidance on effective online brand messaging strategies. In particular, research has yet to address how the inclusion of second person pronouns in online brand messaging affects relevant consumer outcomes. The present research proposes that second person pronouns should work to enhance consumer involvement and brand attitude as a result of increasing the extent that consumers engage in self-referencing. A field study involving actual brand posts on Facebook and two subsequent experiments provide support for this hypothesis. In addition, drawing on cultural dimensions theory, individual levels of collectivism are identified as a boundary condition. The presence (vs. absence) of second person pronouns in online brand messaging enhances involvement and brand attitude for consumers that are lower, but not higher, in collectivism. The results provide marketers with needed guidance for creating effective online brand messaging. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Can Social Media Marketing Improve Customer Relationship Capabilities
   and Firm Performance? Dynamic Capability Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Social media usage has become ubiquitous, and organizations need to manage this tool to meet their strategic goals. Companies are finding it necessary to modify their approach to customer relationship management (CRM) and develop new marketing capabilities that facilitate customer satisfaction. The purpose of this study is to examine how social media usage can help firms build new CRM capabilities and thus improve marketing adoption strategies and business performance. We suggest that social CRM capability is critical when companies merge social media into their marketing strategies to improve customer engagement and firm performance. We empirically analyze data from 232 companies using Facebook, COMPUSTAT North America, and Global Fundamentals annual databases for the period 2004-2014. This study contributes to extant literature by confirming a new form of CRM capabilities social CRM using the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities theory frameworks, and by demonstrating that social media usage plays a moderating role by amplifying the positive impact of social CRM capabilities on firm performance.

TI Consumers' Role Performance and Brand Identification: Evidence from a
   Survey and a Longitudinal Field Experiment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Why do some consumers evangelize brands and create value for them even without receiving any direct reward in return? How do their motivations influence their role behaviors and their identification with the company or brand? We draw on motivation theory and the in- and extra-role literature of leadership to propose a theoretical framework. We use this framework to analyze data from one cross-sectional survey conducted with members of two online brand communities and one longitudinal field experiment with consumers of one new online brand community. We first separate community members' motivations into three types of psychological needs (self-competency, self-belongingness, self-autonomy) that are fulfilled by membership in a brand community. We investigate how each of these needs influences consumers' in-role and extra-role behaviors, which in turn positively affect their brand identification and create value for the company. Our results show that self-competency motivates both in and extra-role behaviors, self-belongingness only increases less involved in-role behaviors, and self-autonomy only affects more involved extra-role behaviors. Both role behaviors foster beneficial consumer brand identification. We discuss how these findings can inform marketers' brand community-building strategies.

TI Pre-launch Prediction of Market Performance for Short Lifecycle Products
   Using Online Community Data
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Prediction of sales for short life-cycle products can be problematic. Generic predictive models based on past launches may provide only crude historic data which are unsuited for distinctive, innovative products. This paper investigates the role of online communities in providing pre-launch data to predict post-launch sales. We argue that levels of awareness, word-of-mouth, expectations, and adoption intention prevailing within an online community for an upcoming product have an independent direct effect on the product's future sales. Additionally, we test the complementarity effect of these community variables by introducing a higher order construct called Pre-release Community Buzz, to demonstrate the incremental explanatory power of using pre-launch community variables to predict post-launch sales. Data for community variables were collected from a movie-based online community, and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). We found strong support for both direct and complementarity effects of community variables in predicting a movie's opening week sales. We also found that community variables mediate the effects of generic predictor variables such as MPAA ratings, star cast, production budget and competition on opening week sales. Tests for robustness demonstrated the value of community variables. Models which included community variables had higher predictive power than those without. Implications for theory and practice are presented. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

This study uses a 2 (high repetition vs low repetition) x 2 (high brand familiarity vs low brand familiarity) factorial design to test the effects of repetition and brand familiarity on consumers' memory for brands placed in video games. Results suggest that consumers recall familiar brands placed in the video game better than unfamiliar ones. Familiar brands also performed better in a brand recognition measure than unfamiliar brands. As no interaction effect of repetition was found, both familiar and unfamiliar brands will benefit equally of the effect of repetition.

TI The Showrooming Phenomenon: It's More than Just About Price
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper examines the factors that influence competitive showrooming, whereby consumers visit an offline retail store to gather information but make their purchase online at a competing retailer. We survey 556 respondents to study how the benefits and costs of showrooming influence the consumer's decision to showroom. Not surprisingly, we find that expected average price savings from showrooming are positively associated with showrooming. In addition, however, the perceived dispersion in online prices is also positively related to showrooming. Moreover, we find that non-price factors play a key role in consumers' showrooming decisions: perceived gains in the quality of the product purchased when showrooming (measured as the fit with a consumer's need) and waiting time for service in the brick-and-mortar store are positively associated with showrooming. Online search costs are negatively related to showrooming. Time pressure that consumers face when shopping is negatively associated with their propensity to showroom. We discuss implications for researchers and retail managers. For example, managers of offline retail stores can curtail showrooming by increasing the number of sales personnel available in-store instead of providing currently employed personnel with more training. To encourage showrooming, managers of online retailers should make it easier for the customer to search online. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB A meta-analysis examined the role of online trust in business-to-consumer e-commerce. The analysis of 16 pairwise relationships derived from 150 empirical studies involving online trust revealed that online trust exhibits significant relationships with selected antecedents (e.g., perceived privacy, perceived service quality) and consequences (e.g., loyalty, repeat purchase intention). Even so, additional analyses demonstrated that methodological characteristics such as study design, website type, and type of items used to measure the trust construct moderated certain online trust relationships. These additional analyses indicated that the relationships between online trust and its respective antecedents and consequences are simultaneously more idiosyncratic, complex, and subtle than previously envisioned. Implications of the analyses for theory, practice, and future research are discussed. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Atypical Shifts Post-failure: Influence of Co-creation on Attribution
   and Future Motivation to Co-create
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study investigates how the effect of the failure of co-created products or services influences: (a) internal attribution (i.e. the self) and external attribution (i.e. the firm), (b) customers' expectancies of success, and (c) customers' future motivation to co-create and contribute to recovery from failure. We use attribution theory and the attribution-expectancy framework to explain the theoretical relationships we advance and test our hypotheses in two independent experiments that stimulate co-creation through role-play and vignettes. The results show that customer co-creation shifts the attribution for failure to the self, resulting in atypical shifts in expectancy (increasing customers' expectancy of future success and motivation to continue co-creating in the future). Our results suggest that utilizing customers' efforts and skills in the co-creation of products and services can help firms to manage failure effectively. The implications of our findings on co-creation research and product and service failures are discussed, specific applications within the digital context are considered, and suggestions are offered for future research.

This study addresses the effects of sponsorship disclosures by means of a 2 (no disclosure vs. the sponsorship disclosure 'Sponsored') x 2 (source: celebrity endorser vs. brand) experiment. Results suggest that a sponsorship disclosure only influences the use of persuasion knowledge when the post is disseminated by a celebrity. Moreover, a disclosure starts a process in which the recognition of advertising (i.e., the activation of conceptual persuasion knowledge) causes consumers to develop distrusting beliefs about the post (i.e., higher attitudinal persuasion knowledge), and in turn, decreases their intention to engage in electronic word of mouth.

TI Rethinking Catalogue and Online B2B Buyer Channel Preferences in the
   Education Supplies Market
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The purpose of this study is to better understand B2B paper-based catalogue and online buying channel determinants in the education supplies sector by identifying factors that are critical in determining buyer channel preferences. A conceptual model was developed and empirically tested using self-report survey data from 316 B2B New Zealand educational institutions and analyzed with Hayes PROCESS macro (SPSS). The findings indicate that catalogue is the preferred channel for B2B educational buyers. The most important determinant of channel preference is channel experience. The catalogue and online channels appear to be less substitutable in B2B markets then proposed by B2C market studies. Structural assurance (trust, security, safeguards, and robustness) is a significant predictor of general channel satisfaction, and online channel preference, but not catalogue channel preference. The study results benefit practitioners in the development and implementation of channel strategies by providing a better understanding of the factors that determine online and catalogue channel preference in B2B markets. This study is the first to empirically demonstrate the influence and importance of structural assurance in catalogue channels, while channel experience supported by structural assurance significantly influences online channel choice. These findings indicate that determinants of channel preference found in B2C studies cannot be uncritically transferred to the B2B domain. The research also suggests that existing B2B channel adoption and preference drivers are different from B2C, and B2C research is not necessarily applicable in the B2B context.

TI Evaluation Set Size and Purchase: Evidence from a Product Search Engine
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the popularity of product search engines, yet the analysis of consumer behavior at such sites remains a challenging research problem despite its timeliness and importance. In this article, we develop and estimate a copula model of evaluation set size and purchase behavior employing data from 3,182 hotel searches by customers at a large travel search engine. The model allows us to jointly study purchase behavior, evaluation sets, and their antecedents. Our results reveal that evaluation set size and purchase are negatively correlated and that factors typically presumed to be associated with purchase i.e., when users sort search results by price or quality, request many rooms, disclose that there are many guests in their party, or arrive from other search engines and/or partner sites actually relate to larger evaluation sets but lower purchase probability. In contrast, when users filter the search results, we observe smaller evaluation sets and higher purchase probability. The theoretical background and practical implications of our findings suggest that efforts to increase purchases need not necessarily be predicated on cultivating larger evaluation sets.

TI Consumer Communities Do Well, But Will They Do Good? A Study of
   Participation in Distributed Computing Projects
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Brand communities and corporate social responsibility have been touted for their ability to both generate significant equity for their brands and strong bonds among community members. However, the reciprocal capacity of these brands to mobilize their followers to engage in prosocial behavior, while very promising, has been largely ignored by researchers and practitioners alike. Given the untapped potential of product aficionados, who are said to possess considerable knowledge, expertise, and engagement, this lack of research and managerial guidance is somewhat perplexing. To address this shortcoming, we conducted a longitudinal investigation of two brand communities and one non-brand based product category community drawn from five years of data from a scientific crowdsourcing project aimed at curing medical diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and AIDS. Employing a hazard modeling approach, we find that contrary to conventional wisdom, brand community participation reduces the likelihood of joining, while participation in a non-brand based product category community increases the likelihood of joining, a prosocial distributed computing project. Furthermore, willingness to help fellow community members plays an important role in the likelihood to join. These findings provide important insights for firms seeking to engage product category and brand communities in prosocial causes.

TI Private Sales Clubs: A 21st Century Distribution Channel
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Private sales clubs are a novel service institution arising out of the Internet's ability to allow an exclusively online channel to distribute out of season or out of fashion inventories to a large set of customers. They have become a thriving industry in the 21st century. In this paper we enhance understanding of this technology mediated institution as a distribution channel. Furthermore, we show how to measure the impact of the distribution services it provides through the Internet on customer satisfaction and of the latter on economic performance. We rely on the technique of quantile regressions in this endeavor. The latter allows for asymmetries in the response function that have been noted as a major issue to be addressed in the analysis of both customer satisfaction and economic performance variables. Our most important empirical finding is that the distortions introduced by ignoring asymmetries in the response function with respect to customer satisfaction are extremely misleading for managers of private sales clubs.

TI Advertising and Word-of-Mouth Effects on Pre-launch Consumer Interest
   and Initial Sales of Experience Products
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study examines how consumers' interest in a new experience product develops as a result of advertising and word-of-mouth activities during the pre-launch period. The empirical settings are the U.S. motion picture and video game industries. The focal variables include weekly ad spend, blog volume, online search volume during pre-launch periods, opening-week sales, and product characteristics. We treat pre-launch search volume of keywords as a measure of pre-launch consumer interest in the related product. To identify probable persistent effects among the pre-launch time-series variables, we apply a vector autoregressive modeling approach. We find that blog postings have permanent, trend-setting effects on pre-launch consumer interest in a new product, while advertising has only temporary effects. In the U.S. motion picture industry, the four-week cumulative elasticity of pre-launch consumer interest is 0.187 to advertising and 0.635 to blog postings. In the U.S. video game industry, the elasticities are 0.093 and 1.306, respectively. We also find long-run co-evolution between blog and search volume, which suggests that consumers' interest in the upcoming product cannot grow without bounds for a given level of blog volume.

TI Understanding Interactive Online Advertising: Congruence and Product
   Involvement in Highly and Lowly Arousing, Skippable Video Ads
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Interactive online media are an increasingly preferred format for users and advertisers, and skippable online video advertisements are common on social media networks such as YouTube. The specific features and influences of this interactive marketing tool demand further consideration. Focusing on effective tactics, this article investigates the influence of introducing high-arousal and low-arousal stimuli on skippable ad effectiveness (i.e., ad acceptance, ad attitude, brand attitude, and ad intrusiveness), with the potential moderation of context congruency and product involvement. A pretest and three studies confirm that high-arousal ads are watched for longer time and are more effective in congruent contexts. Users' product involvement determines the intrusiveness of high- and low-arousal skippable ads. These findings, along with their practical implications for this novel setting, provide further directions for research too.

TI Cutting Through the Online Review Jungle - Investigating Selective eWOM
   Processing
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers frequently rely on online reviews, a prominent form of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), before making a purchase decision. However, consumers are usually confronted with hundreds of reviews for a single product or service, as well as rich information cues on online review websites (review texts, helpfulness ratings, author information, etc.). In turn, consumers face more information cues on online review websites than they can or want to process, and are likely to proceed selectively. This paper investigates selective processing of such eWOM information cues. Results of Study 1, an exploratory study using verbal protocols, confirm that consumers display selective eWOM processing patterns and are able to articulate them. Study 2 develops and applies a measurement instrument to capture these patterns. A subsequent cluster analysis on members of a large-scale online panel (N = 2,295) indicates five prominent eWOM processing types, termed "The Efficients", "The Meticulous", "The Quality-Evaluators", "The Cautious Critics", and "The Swift Pessimists". Insights of this research can help firms to better understand consumers' eWOM processing and improve the user-friendliness of online review websites.

TI Brand Attitudes and Search Engine Queries
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Search engines record the queries that users submit, including a large number of queries that include brand names. This data holds promise for assessing brand health. However, before adopting brand search volume as a brand metric, marketers should understand how brand search relates to traditional survey-based measures of brand attitudes, which have been shown to be predictive of sales. We investigate the relationship between brand attitudes and search engine queries using a unique micro-level data set collected from a panel of Google users who agreed to allow us to track their individual brand search behavior over eight weeks and link this search history to their responses to a brand attitude survey. Focusing on the smartphone and automotive markets, we find that users who are actively shopping in a category are more likely to search for any brand. Further, as users move from being aware of a brand to intending to purchase a brand, they are increasingly more likely to search for that brand, with the greatest gains as customers go from recognition to familiarity and from familiarity to consideration. Additionally, users that own and use a particular automotive or smartphone brand are much more likely to search for that brand, even when they are not in market suggesting that a substantial volume of brand search in these categories is not related to shopping or product search. We discuss the implications of these findings for assessing brand health from search data. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Will They Come and Will They Stay? Online Social Networks and News
   Consumption on External Websites
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study explores the role of online engagement, homophily and social influence in explaining traffic and news consumption by social network users at an external news website. The authors jointly model visits and page views for a panel of users who registered with the news site using their Facebook accounts. In their model, the authors account for homophily using a latent space approach, and account for endogeneity, heterogeneity, and unobservable correlates. The results show that measures of an individual's activity on Facebook are positively associated with that individual's actions at the news site. In addition, knowing what a user's Facebook friends do at the content website provides insights into a focal user's behavior at that website, as visitors with friends who visit external news sites are more likely to visit the news website studied. In addition, news consumption (not just visits) also depends on friend's actions but such an impact varies with the individual's underlying browsing mode. We highlight the importance of social influence in news consumption and further show that homophily bias in news consumption is similar to prior research in other categories. Our study also highlights that visitors' past browsing patterns are important predictors of future content consumption, although social network information significantly improves prediction beyond the effect of such more traditional behavioral metrics. Finally we find that Managers can use readily available data for both prediction and targeting. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Experiential Engagement and Active vs. Passive Behavior in Mobile
   Location-based Social Networks: The Moderating Role of Privacy
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The study aims to understand how social media and mobile change customer experiences and influence the online active behavior. We explore how leveraging differently on experiences that the users live online helps to increase experiential engagement and mitigate the negative influence of privacy concern on the active use of location-based social networking applications. We conceptualize experiential engagement as a second-order construct that is manifested in two first-order "experience" constructs (Personal Engagement and Social Interactive Engagement). We theorize that our engagement constructs are causally related to consumer active and passive use of a mobile location-based social network and we test (n = 379) the moderating role of privacy concern on this relation in EU and the US. Findings show that Personal Engagement plays an important role influencing active usage when users are more concerned with privacy issues. Social Interactive Engagement shows a significant effect on passive usage meaning that the more people experience a deep sense of community the more they are interested in reading other comments or collecting information. Managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI When Online Visibility Deters Social Interaction: The Case of Digital
   Gifts
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB One of the defining features of online social networks is that users' actions are visible to other users. In this paper, we argue that such visibility can have a detrimental effect on users' willingness to exchange digital gifts. Gift giving is an intimate activity that comes with social risk, and the public nature of online environments can deter interactions that usually occur in smaller, more intimate settings. To study the effects of online visibility on the decision to give, we analyze a unique dataset from a large online social network that offers users the option of buying a digital gifting service. We find that purchase rates of the service increased with the number of ties that users kept on the network, but decreased with the extent to which those ties were connected to each other. We argue that the latter effect is due to the fact that, when a user's ties are connected, any gift sent between the user and one tie is visible to their mutual contacts. We explore how characteristics of users' networks moderate the effect of online visibility, and argue that firms should take consumer network structure into account when designing digital products and promoting engagement online.

TI The Power of Codesign to Bond Customers to Products and Companies: The
   Role of Toolkit Support and Creativity
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Configuration tools allow customers to codesign their products in the most extraordinary fashion to illustrate their unique identity. While research widely acknowledges the functional benefits of codesigned products, far less is known about the emotional benefits of codesign activities for the customer and the company. This research highlights the effect of codesign activities on the emotional bond between the customer and the product (i.e., customer product attachment) as well as the customer and the company (i.e., customer company identification). Data from an experimental study and a survey study with customers of a bicycle manufacturer show that codesign drives customer product attachment and customer company identification. Importantly, the studies show that the emotional bond with the company rather than that with the product boosts codesign expenditures. Investing in codesign toolkits thus pays off for companies because they drive customer company identification and, consequently, codesign expenditures.

TI Brands, Friends, & Viral Advertising: A Social Exchange Perspective on
   the Ad Referral Processes
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Advertisers worldwide are designing advertising with an eye toward viral activity particularly within social networking sites such as Facebook. Yet, little is known about the social processes at play when ads are shared. Taking a consumer-centric approach, this study investigates the social processes central to ads going viral within the Social Web. Conducting a national online experiment, the intertwining roles of brand relationships, interpersonal relationships, and sharing motivations in the social exchange of advertising are explored by testing two proposed referral decision making processes: referral and referral acceptance. Results suggest that brand relationships and interpersonal relationships impact referral of ads within SNSs, and brand relationships interact with sharing motivations to impact decisions; specifically, brand relationships are conduits for ensuring reciprocal altruism in exchange, but their influence is tempered within stronger interpersonal relationships. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Employees' Company Reputation-related Social Media Competence: Scale
   Development and Validation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Cases in which employees' uses of social media harm their company's reputation highlight the need for a measure to evaluate employees' company reputation-related social media competence (RSMC). Drawing on reputation and human capital theory and data from four occupationally diverse samples of employees, this study develops and validates a new, multidimensional measure of RSMC, or an employee's ability to use social media without causing harm to the employer's reputation. Exploratory factor analyses, first- and second-order confirmatory factor analyses, and structural equation modeling all provide strong evidence of the convergent, discriminant, known-group, and nomological validities of the proposed RSMC scale. The higher-order RSMC construct also relates to job demands and resources and to two behavioral outcomes: bad mouthing and positive word of mouth. The RSMC scale also exhibits test retest reliability and ecological validity. Thus, the new scale offers both research directions and managerial implications.

TI The Role of Emotions for the Perceived Usefulness in Online Customer
   Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online customer reviews often express emotions. This can enable marketers to analyze the textual content of online reviews with the aim to understand the role of emotions and how they can affect other customers. In this paper, we present an approach to extracting emotion content from online reviews in order to measure the importance of various emotion dimensions within different product categories. The approach uses an emotion lexicon to extract emotion terms, while it also builds a classification model to measure the importance of emotion dimensions based on the quality of reviews. Review quality is measured based on the usefulness of online customer reviews, which are perceived and evaluated by other customers through their helpfulness ratings. This approach allows the identification of emotion dimensions that characterize qualitative reviews. The empirical evaluation in our study suggests that trust, joy, and anticipation are the most decisive emotion dimensions, although substantial variance across product categories can also be detected. Additionally, we compared two contrasting emotion dictionaries. One lexicon was crowd funded and contained a large vocabulary, whereas the other was more focused and smaller, since it was created word-wise by an expert. Our empirical findings indicate that the crowd-funded solution outperforms its smaller counterpart in terms of classification precision. The main implication of this study is that it adds an emotional perspective to the broad set of existing tools that marketers employ to analyzing online reviews. Our contributions are: i) we are the first to analyze emotions' role in online customer reviews; ii) we demonstrate how to develop a big data model such as this, without external assistance; iii) we show how to interpret the results of the created model; and iv) we show which dictionary to prefer when creating the model.

TI The Effects of Channel Experiences and Direct Marketing on Customer
   Retention in Multichannel Settings
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In customer relationship management (CRM), it is critical for managers to understand how and when customers terminate their relationships with the company in order to make more accurate predictions for CLV. However, in many non-contractual settings, customer churn is not easily observed, which presents difficulty for estimating customer retention. In this research, we present a framework for estimating multichannel customer relationship dynamics in a non-contractual setting that flexibly allows for relationship revival and investigates the effects of different channel experiences and marketing communication on retention and profitability. We use a multi-segment, multivariate hidden Markov modeling framework to model three managerially relevant customer behaviors: purchase amount, purchase incidence, and channel choice. Using data from a multichannel clothing retailer, we uncover two latent relationship states that customers migrate to and from an active state and an inactive state characterized by different levels of purchase frequency, responsiveness to marketing, and profitability. We find that an offline (retail-store) channel can be used to migrate customers from an inactive state to an active state, effectively serving the purpose of "education" or "revival," whereas an online channel is most effective in keeping the existing active customers active, thus serving the purpose of "retention". Using counterfactual analysis, we highlight an opportunity for the multichannel firm to optimize marketing strategies to dynamically manage and increase the retention and hence also the value of its customer base.

TI Examining Biased Assimilation of Brand-related Online Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper examines the impact of pre-existing brand attitudes on consumer processing of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). This topic is particularly important for brands that simultaneously possess strongly pronounced proponents as well as opponents. Two experimental studies using univalent (study 1, N = 538) and mixed (study 2, N = 262) sets of online reviews find indications for biased assimilation effects of eWOM processing. Consumers perceive positive (negative) arguments in online reviews as more (less) persuasive when having a positive (negative) attitude towards the brand. Perceived persuasiveness in turn influences behavioral intentions and acts as a mediator on the relationship between attitude and behavioral intentions. We examine two moderators of this effect. When priming individuals to focus on other consumers (vs. a self focus prime), the biased assimilation effect is weaker (study 3a, N = 131). In contrast, we show that biased assimilation becomes stronger under conditions of high (vs. low) cognitive impairment (study 3b, N = 124). Our findings contribute to the literature on the relationship between eWOM and brands and advance our understanding of potential outcomes of brand polarization.

TI Community Members' Perception of Brand Community Character: Construction
   and Validation of a New Scale
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Brand communities offer effective means to achieve favorable brand outcomes, such as enhanced consumer brand loyalty. But what drives brand community success, and how can managers evaluate their communities' performance? Based on Mufiiz and O'Guinn (2001) the existing literature suggests high levels of consciousness of kind, shared rituals and traditions, and a sense of moral responsibility among community members, which imply a notion of "brand community character". This study accordingly argues that community members' perceptions of the brand community character (PBCC) should lead to positive outcomes for both the community and the brand. Neither PBCC nor its three characteristics have been measured empirically previously, so this study develops an initial scale. Six consecutive studies to develop the PBCC scale demonstrate its reliability and validity, while a further study affirms that PBCC has a positive relationship with relevant brand outcomes.

TI Social Media and Value Creation: The Role of Interaction Satisfaction
   and Interaction Immersion
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This research examines the effects of social media brand consumer interactions on three types of customer value: customer lifetime value (CLV), customer influencer value (CIV) and customer knowledge value (CKV). By examining the differential effects of consumers' satisfaction and immersion with social-media brand interactions on CLV, CIV and CKV, the authors identify conditions under which interaction satisfaction and interaction immersion create value for brands. Results suggest that whereas interaction satisfaction positively influences both CLV and CIV, interaction immersion impacts both CIV and CKV. The authors identify social media strategies for brands related to interaction satisfaction and immersion that are based on the three types of customer value studied. The findings reported offer important managerial and theoretical implications with respect to the effects of discrete' social media interactions on customer value creation.

TI Winning Versus not Losing: Exploring the Effects of In-Game Advertising
   Outcome on its Effectiveness
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Prior literary works on product placement in games predominantly focus on a host of game and brand characteristics to eventually explore their effects on consumers' psychological responses and behavior. One primary facet of in-game advertising (IGA) that has largely been ignored is game outcome in terms of winning and losing and its effect on consumers' nature of information processing. This article explores the effect of IGA outcome and performance feedback shown to players on their motivation expressed in terms of induced regulatory focus. Further, the effects of regulatory focus are examined on players' implicit and explicit memory, game and brand attitude, and emotions. A conceptual framework highlighting afore-mentioned relationships is developed and empirically tested which reveals that IGA outcome and performance feedback in the form of game messages plays a major role in explaining players' motivation which in turn also affects their memory and attitude. Managerial implications, limitations, and scope for future research are also discussed. (C) 2016 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI No Comment?! The Drivers of Reactions to Online Posts in Professional
   Groups
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Social media has moved beyond personal friendships to professional interactions in high-knowledge industries. In particular, online discussion forums are sponsored by firms aiming to position themselves as thought-leaders, to gain more insight in their customer base and to generate sales leads. However, while firms can seed discussion by posts, they depend on the forum members to continue the discussion in the form of reactions to these posts. The goal of the current study is to investigate what features and characteristics drive the number of comments that a post receives on an online discussion forum. The empirical setting involves a global manufacturer connecting with health care professionals through a LinkedIn discussion forum. We project that (i) content characteristics, (ii) post characteristics, (iii) author characteristics, and (iv) timing characteristics jointly determine the number of comments a post receives. We show that the readability of the post, the controversiality of the content and the status of the post author have the highest elasticity on the number of comments. These results provide valuable insights for firms on how to build and maintain an attractive online forum through ongoing discussions.

TI Effects of Likeability Dynamics on Consumers' Intention to Share Online
   Video Advertisements
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Understanding how consumer evaluations of online advertisements affect their intention to share advertising content online is essential for successful viral advertising. This article examines consumer decisions whether or not to share video advertisements, in particular the role of their moment-to-moment likeability of the online ad. The study uses a theoretical memory-based framework of temporal sequence effects and unique data for 120 advertisements and more than 43,000 consumer evaluations. The authors find that high likeability at the beginning and the end of a video advertisement is important, though consistent with the memory-based framework, the ending effect is greater. A linear trend in likeability does not influence viral potential, but variance in likeability evaluations (the rollercoaster effect) has positive effects on an advertisement's virality. The moment-to-moment effects are mediated by the overall liking for an online video advertisement. Interestingly, the beginning, end and peak effects influence the viral potential even after controlling for the overall liking. The difference of the peak moment becomes important only when controlling for the overall liking, whereas the direct peak and the rollercoaster effects are suppressed by the overall liking.

TI Affective Images, Emotion Regulation and Bidding Behavior: An Experiment
   on the Influence of Competition and Community Emotions in Internet
   Auctions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Internet auction sites frequently employ images as design elements on their websites in order to either induce a sense of community or competition among the bidders. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such affective images on bidding behavior in a controlled laboratory experiment during which participants' emotional processes are assessed through psychophysiological measurements. Immediately before placing a bid in a first-price sealed-bid auction, bidders are presented a) pictures of competitive sports scenes, b) pictures of families or children, or c) a blank screen. Participants place significantly lower bids when they were exposed to pictures that induce competition emotions as opposed to pictures that induce community emotions. This relationship is moderated by the bidders' emotion regulation strategy. In particular, we find that the more participants try to suppress their emotional responses to the presented images, the more they are affected in their bidding behavior. Our results entail valuable insights about the coherence of emotional stimuli on Internet auction marketplaces and customers' decisions. They also question recent marketing strategies by the market leader. (C) 2016 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI How to Measure Alignment in Perceptions of Brand Personality Within
   Online Communities: Interdisciplinary Insights
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Considerable research has been done on brand personality as a key factor in brand management, focusing mainly on how it is perceived by consumers, but without much attention to the managerial perspective. However, the latter is crucially important to ensure that the brand personality that consumers perceive actually corresponds to what a company intends to communicate. This study offers an innovative methodology to achieve this dual-perspective objective, integrating notions of marketing and linguistics to investigate brand personality alignment as it emerges from authentic and spontaneous digital environments. Textual data were collected from both company and consumer web communications across a sample of 100+ fashion brands, and then processed with software to extract sets of adjectives as the expression of brand personality. The adjectives were interrelated to calculate ratios that measure (a) the degree of alignment between company-defined vs. consumer-perceived brand personality, (b) similarity in personality between brands and (c) consumer perception of similarity in personality between brands. Varying degrees of alignment were identified, suggesting differences in how effectively the companies communicate their brand personality. The combination of the ratios derived from this research process can be utilized to evaluate the strength of brand differentiation and to redefine brand communication strategies.

TI Who Am I? How Compelling Self-storytelling Builds Digital Personal
   Reputation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The work explores whether self-storytelling is a powerful predictor of personal reputation in a collaborative community of the sharing economy realm. By proposing that powerful self-storytelling allows an attractive positioning in respect to potential others, the paper extends the literature of brand storytelling and brand archetypes shifting the perspective to a personal level. This study adopts a qualitative quantitative approach to investigate the meanings and stories contained in personal profile descriptions and their relation with reputation. Personal descriptions are interpreted as storytelling activities, labels/glosses that allow members to access the services of the community by facilitating personal reputation building. The findings show that powerful storytelling structures have defined phases and are crucial in reputation building when the story evolves in a metaphoric, symbolic lesson. The presence of archetypes, in particular the Sage and the Ruler, also confers reputational power to the stories. The results reveal opportunities for peer-to-peer communities, traditional companies, and social businesses. Marketers should design tools and platforms able to trigger consumers' desire to express their individuality through personal descriptions and suggest the drivers that affect reputation.

One such opportunity is gamification, which, one hopes, will enhance appeal to mobile consumers. Our sense from both personal experience and the literature is that the gamified mobile apps currently offered by firms mostly miss the mark. We provide a systematic overview of game design and note how principles derived from that field are highly applicable to gamification in mobile marketing settings. We are aided by the work of Schell (2008), whose Elemental Game Tetrad Model allows us to offer a coherent look at how gamification should affect mobile marketing outcomes.

We formally define mobile shopper marketing as the planning and execution of all mobile-based marketing activities that influence a shopper along and beyond the path-to-purchase: from the initial shopping trigger, to the purchase, consumption, repurchase, and recommendation stages. However, not much is known about mobile shopper marketing. We plug this gap by first discussing mobile shopper marketing and its scope in depth and then presenting a process model that connects the mobile shopping journey with four key entities, i.e., shopper, employee, organization, and mobile technology.

TI Channel Choice in the 21st Century: The Hidden Role of Distribution
   Services
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB A fundamental distinction between goods and services is that in the retailing of goods and some services the costs of production and distribution are clearly separable in a non-arbitrary fashion, usually identified as costs of goods sold. They have type I separability. Distribution services, which are also known as attributes, marketing mix or output variables, are produced, distributed and consumed just as goods or physical products or core services sold directly to consumers at an explicit price. When online settings generate separability of production distribution and consumption of all these distribution services in space and time we have strong type II separability, which has not been identified in the literature. The latter plays an essential role in the emergence, sustainability and sometimes dominance of online channels. It has profound implications for both the demand side and the supply side of firms in online channels.
   We develop implications of this result with respect to potential maximum levels of these services in electronic channels and for a broad range of other important topics relevant for marketing and economics.

TI Why Nonprofits Are Easier to Endorse on Social Media: The Roles of
   Warmth and Brand Symbolism
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Brands often seek endorsements by consumers on social media (e.g., likes on Facebook). But is this marketing strategy feasible for all brands? To answer this question, this research investigates in seven studies the processes that underlie consumers' intention to endorse brands on social media. We suggest that consumers aim to signal their identity by endorsing brands online. Based on the Brands as Intentional Agents Framework and related research in (social) cognition and consumer behavior, we argue that consumers on social media primarily want to emphasize their warmth rather than their competence. Experimental studies 1, 2, and 3 distinguish between nonprofit and for-profit brands and show that brand warmth (and not competence) mediates the effect of brand type (nonprofit vs. for-profit) on consumers' intentions to endorse brands and branded content on social media. Experiment 4 demonstrates that this process is moderated by brand symbolism (moderated mediation). A high level of brand symbolism increases the positive effect of warmth on consumers' intention to endorse brands online, but only for for-profit brands. The fifth experiment shows that these effects are conditional upon the public vs. private distinction in consumer behavior: consumers prefer to publicly affiliate with nonprofit (vs. for-profit) brands but with regard to private affiliations, there is no difference between both types of brands. In experiment 6, the causal role of warmth (vs. competence) is further examined. Finally, we demonstrate that perceptions of brands' warmth and not competence reduce the efforts that brands need to make to achieve consumers' endorsements on their real brand pages on Facebook.

TI The Psychological Mechanism of Brand Co-creation Engagement
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Co-creation for brand innovation is an intriguing and rapidly growing trend in the current competitive market. Past research emphasizes the economic gains of consumer co-creation, with limited research focusing on the psychological effects engendered in the process of consumer brand co-creation. Drawing from self-determination theory and implicit self-esteem theory, the present research proposes an integrative framework for synthesizing the perceived psychological benefits and distinctive motivations in the brand co-creation process. The results indicated that brand self connection and three perceived benefits of brand co-creation tasks (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) facilitate consumer motivations to participate in brand co-creation campaigns. These motivations facilitate the establishment of brand co-creation engagement, which in turn leads to strengthened brand relationship behavior. This research exemplifies that a well designed brand co-creation contest is a potent means which can not only enhance consumer engagement with the co-creation contest, but also turn engaged consumers into intangible assets for brand innovation.

TI The Impact of User Review Volume on Consumers' Willingness-to-Pay: A
   Consumer Uncertainty Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Numerous studies have investigated the impact of review volume and review variance on product price, but their findings are mixed. The perspective of mismatch cost framework (e.g., Sun 2012) argues that, at the market level, the impact of review variance on product price varies with review valence due to diverse product tastes across individuals. The perspective of classic expected utility framework (e.g., Wu and Ayala Gaytan 2013; Wu et al. 2013) further argues that heterogeneous risk attitudes across individuals directly drives the varying impact of both review volume and variance on willingness-to-pay, regardless of review valence. Although both frameworks have gained good empirical support, neither of them probed whether the impact of review volume or review variance varies within an individual.
   We extend the current research by focusing on the varying impact of review volume on consumers' willingness-to-pay. Combining economic and behavioral theories of decisions under uncertainty, we argue that consumers' preferences of uncertainty can vary both across and within individuals. The extended framework thus concludes that the impact of review volume on consumers' willingness-to-pay not only varies across individuals with different types of uncertainty preferences, but may also change with review valence within an individual of some types of uncertainty preferences. The framework is tested using an experimental study and an empirical study. Results from both studies provide good support for this broader framework.

TI Is the Daily Deal Social Shopping?: An Empirical Analysis of Customer
   Panel Data
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Shortly after Groupon started its business in 2008, selling one deal a day with substantial price discounts, daily-deal sites became new online shopping places for many people. Starting with Groupon, most daily-deal sites required that voucher sales be higher than a predetermined number before deals become active. This feature, known as the "tipping point," was a unique characteristic of the daily-deal business and is identified as one of the most prominent features of social shopping. Most daily-deal sites also required that a redemption period start after a deal was over and be fixed, usually 90 days, presumably to maximize the promotional effect of deals by encouraging rapid voucher redemption. The question remains, however, whether such features actually contributed to the success of the daily-deal industry. Using individual-level panel data from a major daily deal site in Korea, we analyze whether consumers' purchase and redemption behaviors were affected by these features and how consumers changed their behaviors as they continued to purchase and redeem vouchers over time. We find that the presence of the tipping point did not boost voucher sales and likely deterred new customers from buying deals right away. We also find that new customers tended to redeem their vouchers quickly, and this likely caused the small businesses that offered deals to become overwhelmed. It is not surprising, given our findings, that both Groupon and the Korean daily deal site abandoned the use of the tipping point and modified redemption rules.

TI Level Up! The Role of Progress Feedback Type for Encouraging Intrinsic
   Motivation and Positive Brand Attitudes in Public Versus Private Gaming
   Contexts
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB With the popularity of video games and the resulting gamification of everyday activities comes an increase in in-game advertising (IGA). As a result, video game players' engagement and motivation to level-up or master a video game are becoming increasingly important for marketers hoping to increase exposure to their brands. Across two experimental studies, we provide evidence that games played publically (versus privately) are more motivating to players, and also demonstrate the important influence of feedback via building a character or completing a status bar. In study 1, we find that, for public gaming contexts, players experience more enjoyment, effort, and flow when progress is shown via building a character. Furthermore, in study 2 we extend study 1 's findings and discover a moderated mediation model for brand attitudes. Specifically, the relationship between public gaming context and brand attitude is mediated by enjoyment and flow. Further, the mediation of enjoyment and flow is moderated by feedback type, where progress affects brand attitude when a character is used for game feedback, but not for status bar feedback. We examine our research questions within the context of intrinsic motivation, specifically self-determination them. (C) 2015 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE.

TI Connecting with and Converting Shoppers into Customers: Investigating
   the Role of Regulatory Fit in the Online Customer's Decision-making
   Process
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Drawing on regulatory focus and regulatory fit theories, this study illustrates that, through the mechanism of engagement, promotion-focused (prevention-focused) shoppers who are faced with a website offering a more hedonic (utilitarian) shopping experience are more likely to both have a favorable attitude towards it and a higher intention to make a purchase. Moreover, by extending the goal compatibility principle to the online shopping context, this study shows that shoppers experiencing fit are able to sustain their regulatory orientation in subsequent decisions, resulting in a preference for products that emphasize the same regulatory goal. This study will help e-retailers increase sales by clarifying why, when, and to what extent they should offer hedonic versus utilitarian shopping experiences. In doing so, this study documents a new source of regulatory fit: a match between the hedonic or utilitarian online shopping experience and a shopper's promotion versus prevention regulatory orientation.

TI Promotional Tactics for Online Viral Marketing Campaigns: How Scarcity
   and Personalization Affect Seed Stage Referrals
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Against the backdrop of consumers being deluged with traditional online advertising, which is increasingly manifesting in inefficient conversion outcomes, viral marketing has become a pivotal component of marketing strategy. However, despite a robust understanding about the impact of viral marketing as well as of factors that drive consumer referral engagement, we know very little about the effect of traditional promotional tactics on consumer referral decisions. Drawing on a randomized field experiment in the context of an online fashion service named StyleCrowd, we investigate the effects of scarcity and personalization, two classical promotional cues that have become ubiquitous on the web and have received only minimal attention hitherto, on actual referral behavior. Our analysis reveals that using these cues in promotional campaigns is a balancing act: While scarcity cues affect referral propensity regardless of whether a campaign is personalized or not, personalization cues are particularly effective when scarcity is absent, yet are cancelled out when scarcity is prevalent. We demonstrate that consumers' perceptions of offer value drive the impact of scarcity on referral likelihood, while consumer gratitude vis-a-vis the marketer is the underlying mechanism for personalization's influence on referral decisions.

TI A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words: Segmenting Consumers by Facebook
   Profile Images
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Conventional segmentation efforts usually focus on verbal or behavioral data while ignoring visual cues, which play a significant role in impression management. Drawing on theoretical work regarding motivations for impression management (need to belong and need for self-promotion), we propose that Facebook users differ from each other in the composition of visual elements they portray in their Facebook profile photos (PPs), and thus can be segmented based on this composition. In this exploratory study we present a methodological proof of concept for the visual segmentation of Facebook users. Using a randomly selected international sample of 500 Facebook accounts, we analyze data implicit in PPs and identify visual cues relevant to virtual impression management. Using these cues we segment users into types, and relate the types to demographics, Facebook usage, and brand engagement as reflected in the Facebook profile. At the theoretical level, the findings suggest that the current accepted motivations for Facebook impression management (need to belong and need for self-promotion) should be expanded to include a third motivation, need for self-expression. At the practical level, the findings demonstrate the utility of visual segmentation, which can later be implemented using computerized systems.

TI Of "Likes" and "Pins": The Effects of Consumers' Attachment to Social
   Media
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Marketing researchers and practitioners are showing substantial interest in social media communication, hying to understand the challenges and opportunities associated with this new cultural and social phenomenon. In this research, the authors examine social media as a new attachment phenomenon, positing likely predictive links to marketing-related social media behaviors. Researchers have demonstrated useful applicability of psychological attachment theory to a variety of other marketing contexts, including special possessions, places, brands, and services. Attachment to such varied focal targets has been shown to influence behaviors of interest to marketers. However, research to date has yet to develop a conceptualization or operationalization of attachment in the social media context. The authors seek to contribute to the literature in two primary ways: first, we provide a foundational definition of attachment to social media, and conduct four initial studies to develop a measure that meets desired reliability and validity standards. Secondly, in a fifth study, we use this validated measure to test its empirical usefulness in predicting social media behaviors in an applied retail setting. Taken together, the results are particularly valuable in demonstrating that attachment to social media is a distinct, measurable phenomenon that helps to explain various activities on social media platforms, including C2C advocacy and C2B supportive communication behaviors. Results reveal practical guidance for marketing managers wrestling with developing effective social media marketing strategies.

TI Does a Virtual Like Cause Actual Liking? How Following a Brand's
   Facebook Updates Enhances Brand Evaluations and Purchase Intention
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Studies have shown positive associations between liking a Facebook brand page and brand evaluations, but causal evidence is lacking. This online pre-post-measure experiment compared brand evaluations of 'current followers' of a target brand's Facebook page, with 'new followers' instructed to 'like' the page, and 'non-followers' over one month. Results showed a significant positive increase for new followers on brand evaluations, whereas non-followers showed no change. Current followers were most positive in evaluations overall, but showed no change over time. This provides evidence that following a brand's Facebook updates can cause positive changes in brand evaluations. The effects were explained by perceived conversational human voice, indicating the importance of brand interactivity. Implications for brands' social media presence are discussed.

TI How Managers' Shared Mental Models of Business Customer Interactions
   Create Different Sensemaking of Social Media
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Building on empirical research, we identify four mental models of business customer interactions and show how each uniquely affects how managers conceptualize and use social media. The four models are "business-to-customers," "business-from-customers," "business-with-customers," and "business-for-customers." The mental model approach helps explain why managers' use of social media does not necessarily lead to radical changes in their interaction with customers, despite the opportunities facilitated by these media. We provide a conceptual framework that enables managers to introspectively investigate their own mental models and thereby revise their sensemaking and use of social media.

TI A Meta-analytic Investigation of the Role of Valence in Online Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Based on a meta-analysis, this study aims to clarify the influence of online review valence (i.e., whether reviews in a review set are predominantly positive or negative) on various dependent variables, in particular on perceived usefulness of the reviews and on attitudes toward the product. The findings suggest that review valence affects perceived usefulness in a different way than it affects attitudes. We find an optimum impact level for perceived usefulness and a ceiling effect for attitudes. Primarily negative review sets that include few positive reviews show the strongest effect on perceived usefulness, while positive review sets that include few or no negative reviews are most successful in influencing attitudes. Additionally, review valence has a stronger influence on perceived usefulness when the reviews refer to experience (rather than search) products, and it has a stronger influence on attitudes for unfamiliar (rather than familiar) brands. Finally, the strongest influence of review valence refers to recommendation intentions. These findings provide several implications for researchers and practitioners.

TI Fostering Customer Ideation in Crowdsourcing Community: The Role of
   Peer-to-peer and Peer-to-firm Interactions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Firms increasingly engage customers in idea generation (or ideation) to sustain their competitive advantages. Drawing from social interaction literature, this study adopts a social network perspective to investigate empirically how the characteristics (i.e., direction, size, and strength) of customers' online peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-firm (P2F) interactions, moderated by customers' past efforts to post ideas (i.e., past ideation participation), influence their likelihood of generating ideas in an idea crowdsourcing community. With four years of data from a popular online crowdsourcing site, this study demonstrates the significant impacts of P2P and P2F online interactions on customers' likelihood of subsequent idea generation. In particular, a potential double-edged sword of past ideation participation emerges: A high level of past ideation participation strengthens (weakens) the impact of P2F (P2P) interactions on customers' subsequent idea generation. These findings suggest implications for how firms can cultivate customers' online social interactions with peers and firms and enhance their capabilities for capturing the wisdom of the crowd.

TI Buying Groceries in Brick and Click Stores: Category Allocation
   Decisions and the Moderating Effect of Online Buying Experience
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The large majority of online grocery shoppers are multichannel shoppers who keep visiting offline grocery stores to combine convenience advantages of online shopping with self-service advantages of offline stores. An important retail management question, therefore, is how these consumers divide grocery purchases across the retailer's online and offline channel. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of category characteristics on the allocation pattern of multichannel grocery shoppers and find that category allocation decisions are affected not only by marketing mix differences between the online and offline channel, but also by intrinsic category characteristics like perceived purchase risk and shopping convenience. In addition, we examine the effect of online buying experience. In line with expectations, we find that it can affect allocation patterns in different ways: (i) it attenuates the perceived risk of buying sensory categories online, thereby reducing differences in online category share, (ii) it reinforces marketing mix (assortment) effects, thereby making online category share differences more pronounced, and (iii) it has no effect for factors such as promotions that are easy to evaluate without experience, thereby leaving the online category share stable. In addition to different experience effects across allocation factors, we also observe variations in experience effects across consumer segments.

TI The Effects of Adopting and Using a Brand's Mobile Application on
   Customers' Subsequent Purchase Behavior
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Mobile applications (apps) have become an important platform for brands to interact with customers, but few studies have tested their effects on app adopters' subsequent brand purchase behavior. This paper investigates whether adopters' spending levels will change after they use a brand's app. Using a unique dataset from a coalition loyalty program with implementations of propensity score matching and difference-in-difference-in-difference methods, we compare the spending levels of app adopters with those of non-adopters. Specifically, we examine whether the use of the app's two main interactive features information lookups and check-ins influences adopters' spending levels. We find that app adoption and continued use of the branded app increase future spending. Furthermore, customers who adopt both features show the highest increase. However, we also observe "the recency effect" - when customers discontinue using the app, their spending levels decrease. Our findings suggest that sticky apps which attract continuing uses can be a persuasive marketing tool because they provide portable, convenient, and interactive engagement opportunities, allowing customers to interact with the brand on a habitual basis. We recommend that firms should prioritize launching a mobile app to communicate with their customers, but they should also keep in mind that a poorly designed app, which customers abandon after only a few uses, may in fact hurt their brand experience and company revenues.

TI Leaving the Home Turf: How Brands Can Use Webcare on Consumer-generated
   Platforms to Increase Positive Consumer Engagement
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The level of brand-related consumer engagement is considered to be a key determinant of successful social media activities. However, due to the commonly high levels of consumers who merely consume instead of being actively engaged, companies seek strategies to increase consumer engagement. Additionally, a large part of consumers' engagement does not occur on platforms controlled by the brand, but on consumer-generated platforms. Based on social learning theory we propose webcare as a reaction to positive engagement to be an effective marketing tool for reinforcing observing consumers' engagement intentions, especially on consumer-generated platfonns. In an experimental online study we reveal that webcare can be used to increase engagement intentions on consumer-generated platforms, and that consumers' surprise explains this reinforcing effect. Moreover, we show that in these consumer-dominated spaces, personal webcare is more effective in driving consumer engagement intentions than impersonal webcare, and that this effect is explained by consumers' perceptions of a brand's conversational communication style. The results indicate that brand managers should leave their home turf and use webcare on consumer-generated social media platforms outside of their direct control.

TI Mobile Advertising: An Empirical Study of Temporal and Spatial
   Differences in Search Behavior and Advertising Response
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Using clickstream panel data from an automobile ad campaign conducted on a mobile platform, we investigate the relevance of mobile advertising, the interrelationships between ad content, information search behavior, and advertising response. Temporally, we compare mobile users' search behavior and advertising response before and during a focal campaign event of an automobile show. Spatially, we examine their search behavior and advertising response in relation to their proximity to the show's location. Estimation results from individual-user random effects binary Logit and Poisson count models show that users' responses to mobile advertising are related to the depth and breadth of search and the ad content. While informative and persuasive ad content exhibits differential non-linear effects on the depth and breadth of search, they have similar effects on advertising response. Interestingly, spatial and temporal proximity of mobile ad campaigns may not lead to increased relevance of mobile campaigns; it depends on the type of ad content and the type of measure used to assess relevance.

TI The Impact of Market Competition on Search Advertising
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Although search advertising has gained popularity in recent years, research on the content of search advertising is scarce. This study develops a conceptual framework to understand how market competition affects what a firm advertises in its search ads. Search advertisements from two industries (i.e., hotel and car industries) are used to test hypotheses developed from the conceptual framework. The findings indicate that in a highly competitive market (1) firms engage in more price advertising in their search ads and (2) intermediaries are more likely to increase price advertising in their search ads than brand suppliers. More interestingly, competition from intermediaries and brand suppliers has different effects on the content of search advertising by intermediaries and brand suppliers. These findings enhance the understanding of firms' behaviors in determining their search advertising content based on the intensity of market competition.

TI Consumer Fear of Online Identity Theft: Scale Development and Validation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB One unwelcome side effect accompanying the rise of e-commerce concerns the increase in cyber-crime, which in turn contributes to consumer fear of online identity theft (FOIT). This research details the development and validation of a FOIT scale that measures individual differences in consumers' proneness to feel negative emotions in relation to shopping online, specifically, the fear that others may illicitly use their identifying details. Based on literature insights, findings from qualitative interviews (n = 43), and three quantitative studies in Germany (n = 345, n = 539, n = 1,150) conducted in various online contexts, the authors propose a two-dimensional FOIT scale. Comprehensive validation procedures which involve relating FOIT to antecedents and consequences suggest the usefulness of the FOIT scale. Suggestions for future research and managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.

TI Emotional Support, Perceived Corporate Ownership and Skepticism toward
   Out-groups in Virtual Communities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers often look to virtual communities for knowledge and support in overcoming the challenges they face. This article examines the role of emotional support in virtual communities that help participants to cope with personal challenges such as healthcare, financial or legal matters. It examines the potential for peer to peer emotional support experienced in virtual communities to generate skepticism toward related out-groups such as doctors and drug companies. It also examines the degree to which corporate ownership of the virtual community reduces the level of skepticism emotional support generates toward out-groups. Guided by predictions of social identity theory, we use data from 270 regular participants in healthcare virtual communities to show that emotional support does generate skepticism toward out-groups. However, we find that this effect is reversed when the virtual community is reported by participants to be corporate owned. We offer guidance to public policy makers on the potential negative consequences of skepticism and we provide advice to managers on how to counter skepticism and improve community stickiness.

TI Targeting High Value Customers While Under Resource Constraint: Partial
   Order Constrained Optimization with Genetic Algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB To maximize sales or profit given a fixed budget, direct marketing targets a preset top percentage of consumers who are the most likely to respond and purchase a greater amount. Existing forecasting models, however, largely ignore the resource constraint and render sup-optimal performance in maximizing profit given the budget constraint. This study proposes a model of partial order constrained optimization (POCO) using a penalty weight that represents the marginal penalty for selecting one more customer. Genetic algorithms as a tool of stochastic optimization help to select models that maximize the total sales at the top deciles of a customer list. The results of cross-validation with a direct marketing dataset indicate that the POCO model outperforms the competing methods in maximizing sales under the resource constraint and has distinctive advantages in augmenting the profitability of direct marketing.

TI Managing Customer Acquisition Risk Using Co-operative Databases
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Acquisition of new customers involves both opportunity and risk, and it is important for firms to predict and manage the risks involved in customer acquisition. Despite its importance, the management of customer acquisition risk has not been the subject of much academic research. This paper develops a framework for firms to manage customer acquisition risk using co-operative databases. We illustrate this framework in the context of the optimal selection of customers for direct mail with a 'buy now, pay later' payment option when the acquisition risk manifests as bad debt risk. Using data from a large scale direct marketing campaign, we show that our empirical model that incorporates bad debt risk substantially outperfonns suboptimal targeting schemes that overlook bad debt risk. We also demonstrate how alleviating bad debt risk is one beneficial outcome of a fairly recent trend in database marketing, namely the emergence of co-operative databases.

TI Information Accessed or Information Available? The Impact on Consumer
   Preferences Inferred at a Durable Product E-commerce Web site
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Most previous choice modeling research infers preferences by assuming that consumers consider all the information available at the point-of-purchase. Because e-commerce sites increasingly incorporate tracking technologies that can monitor consumer behavior on their site, our research studies how incorporating the information accessed by consumers into a choice model impacts model performance and inferred preferences. We use data from an electronic goods manufacturer that monitored the attribute information accessed by 582 shoppers while they made Customize and Buy decisions at the firm's website. We find that incorporating the information accessed by consumers into the choice model provides more valid estimates of attribute preferences and better fitting choice models than models based on information available. Because firms can easily obtain this type of information as a by-product of their online operations, we propose that managers who monitor information acquisition and apply the information accessed model will have a useful methodology to gain a better understanding of consumer preferences.

TI The Sales Velocity Effect on Retailing
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In an increasingly crowded marketplace, retailers need innovative ways of promoting products to their consumers. E-commerce retailers have utilized to great effect lists of top ranked products to promote product sales; the higher the sales rank, the more likely consumers buy that product. This influence to buy, based on observing what others bought is known as observational learning (OL). Prior OL research assumed that OL arises from observing a static outcome, such as the current sales rank of a product. However, prior research on intertemporal choice showed that people prefer outcomes with increasing trends over stable or decreasing trends. This suggests that observing an increasing sales rank, denoted as sales velocity, would have a positive effect on purchase likelihood. We conducted three studies to test the sales velocity effect. Results show that sales velocity has a significant effect on likelihood of purchases, reversing even participant preferences for a product with a higher sales rank. This effect is consistent across four broad products tested. For researchers, by joining the two previously disparate branches of research in OL and intertemporal choice, we addressed a gap in OL research which previously ignored the velocity dimension of OL. For retailers, the study demonstrated the impact of the sales velocity metric on making choices, and thus they could use sales velocity data as a cost-effective marketing tool for specific products.

TI Customer Responses to Channel Migration Strategies Toward the E-channel
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Many firms stimulate customers to use the E-channel for services, which provokes various consumer responses to such limits on their freedom of choice. In a study on bank customers, we examine the extent of customer reactance in response to various E-channel migration strategies, the potential of incentive programs in mitigating customer reactance, as well as the, moderating role of attitudinal loyalty. Finally, we address the mediating role of customer forgiveness. Our study documents that rewarding the use of the film-preferred E-channel is more effective than punishing the retention of the incumbent channel, and that a punishment-based E-channel migration strategy causes similar reactance levels as forced migration does. Importantly, the mere act of forcing also creates reactance among those customers who have already been using the firm-preferred E-channel. In addition, our results reveal that highly loyal customers exhibit lower reactance than less loyal customers. By including customer forgiveness as a process measure we show that this partially occurs because highly loyal customers tend to be more forgiving toward the firm than less loyal customers.

TI How Online Consumer Segments Differ in Long-term Marketing Effectiveness
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online commerce gives companies not only a growing global sales platform, but also powerful consumers enjoying 24/7 availability, choice proliferation and the power to opt in and out permission-based communication. Unfortunately, our knowledge is limited on long-term marketing effectiveness in this space and on how it differs across customer segments. Managers appear overwhelmed by the combination of rich online data on hundreds of thousands of customers and the typical aggregate-level data on offline marketing spending.
   This paper is the first to investigate the long-term impact of coupon promotions, TV, radio, print, and Internet advertising across customer segments for a major digital music provider with over 500,000 customers. We first segment customers and subsequently analyze how these segments respond in the long run to different marketing activities when purchasing music downloads. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of marketing differs across segments, while standard segmentation approaches fail to identify the most valuable catches in a sea of consumers. In contrast to empirical generalizations on consumer packaged goods, heavy users of digital music products are least sensitive to price and most sensitive to TV advertising and to multiple touch points. Light users, the majority of consumers, are price sensitive and tend to opt out of targeted communication. Our research enables managers in the digital media space to target high-value customer segments with the most effective actions.

TI Finding the Right Words: The Influence of Keyword Characteristics on
   Performance of Paid Search Campaigns
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Despite its importance for both e-commerce and traditional offline vendors, managing paid search campaigns is often based on trial and error. In particular, neither research nor practice has extensively addressed identifying relevant keywords and setting appropriate matching options. The authors develop a model based on a keyword's intrinsic and extrinsic information content to shed light on how keyword characteristics affect campaign performance. Intrinsic information includes linguistic aspects and user- and content-related features, which can be indirectly changed through extrinsic information such as matching options. Using an advertiser-level data set from multiple industries, this study evaluates the impact of these criteria on click-through and conversion rates. The authors find that the query variation index, which measures whether a keyword contains sufficient information to identify a user's information need correctly, is an effective predictor of keyword performance. Moreover, they show that the relationship between two of the main predictors, namely, query variation and advertiser names, and a keyword's performance is moderated by the advertiser's choice of matching options.

TI No Strings Attached: When Giving It Away Versus Making Them Pay Reduces
   Consumer Information Disclosure
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We examine egocentric biases in mental accounting that occur when consumers face the prospect of disclosing personal information in exchange for online marketing incentives. We find that consumers keep balanced "mental accounts" of the costs and benefits of such exchanges when they are contingent or temporally integrated. However, when non-contingent exchanges are temporally separated so that benefits precede costs, or when bias correction is impeded in the same non-contingent transaction, consumers keep separate mental accounts in which they egocentrically devalue the marketers' incentives, making them less likely to reciprocate by disclosing. We explore consequences of these findings for online relationships between consumers and marketers. (C) 2014 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE.

TI The Mixed Effects of Participant Diversity and Expressive Freedom in
   Online Peer-to-Peer Problem Solving Communities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online peer-to-peer problem solving (P3) communities provide a cost-effective and reliable means of delivering education and service support to customers of complex, frequently evolving products. Through a multi-disciplinary conceptual framework, we examine the roles of diversity perceptions and expressive freedom in affecting learning and social identification of online P3 community participants, and in turn, their effects on the participants' relationship with, and future intentions towards the brand. We test our hypotheses via a structural equation model with survey data obtained from 555 active members of the two largest XBOX online P3 communities in Brazil. Our results reveal that greater perceived diversity facilitates learning but hinders social identification, whereas expressive freedom has positive effects on learning, but no effect on social identification. Social identification fully mediates the effects of the antecedents on outcomes. We also discuss the theoretical contributions and the managerial implications of our findings, and suggest opportunities for future research.

TI For New Customers Only: A Study on the Effect of Acquisition Campaigns
   on a Service Company's Existing Customers' CLV
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study examines the effect of attractively priced acquisition campaigns on retention intention, and subsequently CLV, of existing customers. The main finding is that customers who are aware of the acquisition campaigns both have a significantly higher intention to stay and do actually stay longer than do customers who are unaware of these campaigns. However, since CLV is not only influenced by retention intention but also by revenues and costs, it is found that aware customers do not have a significantly different CLV than do unaware customers. The inclusion of attractiveness of the offer as an additional explanatory variable results in a positive effect of campaign attractiveness on retention intention, i.e. if the customer thinks the acquisition campaign is attractive, the retention intention will be higher. However, the effect that is found for intention cannot be directly translated in actual behavior. (C) 2014 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE.

TI Customer Response to Web Site Atmospherics: Task-relevant Cues,
   Situational Involvement and PAD
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Using the pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD) model, this study seeks to extend existing knowledge about consumers' activities in online retail environments by focusing on the largely ignored role of perceived dominance. In online environments, perceived dominance might influence purchasing intentions both directly and indirectly through pleasure. Furthermore, consumers' perceptions of Web site atmospherics (informativeness, navigational cues, perceived organization, and entertainment) likely affect two dimensions of emotion (perceived dominance and arousal). This study also investigates the moderating effects of situational involvement on the relationships among the PAD dimensions for online consumers. The results affirm that perceived dominance has direct effects on purchasing intentions, as well as indirect impacts through pleasure. The impact of perceived dominance on pleasure also is moderated by situational involvement. Whereas high task-relevant cues exert significant effects on perceived dominance, low task-relevant cues influence arousal. Therefore, this research shows that perceived dominance relates to online customers' purchasing intentions, which represents an extension of existing knowledge about the PAD model applied online; it also provides notable managerial implications for e-marketers.

TI The Shifting Range of Optimal Web Site Complexity
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Web designers and providers are keenly interested in determining the ideal range of Web site complexity to facilitate user Web site interactions. Previous empirical findings have sparked a lively debate about whether Web site complexity inhibits or enhances user responses toward the Web site. This paper develops a theoretical framework that posits that complexity effects shift along a sequence of evaluation criteria depending on the overall intensity and type of Web site complexity. The first experimental study confirms the suggested interaction effect of the overall degree of complexity and the sequence of evaluation criteria: the optimum is lower for upstream criteria (e.g., ease of navigation) and higher for downstream criteria (e.g., attitude toward the Web site). The second experiment distinguishes two dimensions of complexity (structural vs. visual) that evoke the antipodal effects underlying the shift in the optimal range of complexity. The paper also outlines avenues for further research and implications for marketing practitioners. (C) 2013 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE. Published by Elsevier.

TI From Firm-Controlled to Consumer-Contributed: Consumer Co-Production of
   Personal Media Marketing Communication
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Fueled by the sociocultural shift from firm-controlled to consumer-contributed media, the researchers explore the idea of adapting a co-production strategy from service marketing to marketing communication sent to personal media. Eleven field experiments with firms, along with a structural model tested on survey data, provide empirical evidence supporting a co-production approach applied as a communication strategy in the context of a text message mobile coupon marketing campaign. The results demonstrate a co-produced direct marketing communication strategy that increases attitude toward the communication, purchase intent, and purchase activity, while also acting as a risk-reducing mechanism. Furthermore, perceived customization of the communication interacts strongly with risk perception and marginally with coupon proneness as related to attitude toward the communication when marketers enter the world of consumers' personal media. A push versus pull framework and a co-produced communication framework are put forth to suggest various areas marketers can make available for consumers to co-produce in a marketing communication exchange.

TI GOSIP in Cyberspace: Conceptualization and Scale Development for General
   Online Social Interaction Propensity
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The interactive nature of the Internet has boosted online communication for both social and business purposes. However, individual consumers differ in their predisposition to interact online with others. Whereas an impressive stream of research has investigated media interactivity, the existence of individual differences in the use of different online media, that is, differences in general online social interaction propensity, has so far received less research attention. An individual's predisposition to interact online affects many important consumer behaviors, such as online engagement and participation. Thus, in this paper, we propose and conceptualize general online social interaction propensity as a trait-based individual difference that captures the differences between consumers in their predisposition to interact with others in an online environment. Based on eight studies, we develop and validate a scale for measuring general online social interaction propensity and demonstrate its usefulness in understanding diversity in levels of engagement and in predicting online interaction behaviors.

TI Fostering Consumer-Brand Relationships in Social Media Environments: The
   Role of Parasocial Interaction
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB As brands solidify their place in social media environments, consumers' expectations have amplified, thus spurring the development of technologies to assist with the engagement process. Understanding the ways in which brands can preserve the one-to-one characteristics and intimate relationship qualities offered by social media while still meeting consumer expectations amidst the escalating volume of interactions has become essential. Drawing on the communications literature, this research proposes that parasocial interaction (PSI) theory may be used as a theoretical lens for designing successful social media strategies. Three studies, using a multi-method approach, provide evidence of PSI's role in the development of positive relationship outcomes. Mediation analysis reveals that this sense of feeling connected with the brand goes beyond the interaction itself and drives increased feelings of loyalty intentions and willingness to provide information to the brand. Evidence from this research suggests that these effects may not hold when consumers are aware of the possibility that the brand's social media response may be automated. These findings offer marketers theoretical guidance for fostering relationships in social media environments. (C) 2013 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE.

TI Consumer Brand Engagement in Social Media: Conceptualization, Scale
   Development and Validation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In the last three decades, an influential research stream has emerged which highlights the dynamics of focal consumer/brand relationships. Specifically, more recently the 'consumer brand engagement' (CBE) concept has been postulated to more comprehensively reflect the nature of consumers' particular interactive brand relationships, relative to traditional concepts, including 'involvement.' However, despite the growing scholarly interest regarding the undertaking of marketing research addressing 'engagement,' studies have been predominantly exploratory in nature, thus generating a lack of empirical research in this area to date. By developing and validating a CBE scale in specific social media settings, we address this identified literature gap. Specifically, we conceptualize CBE as a consumer's positively valenced brand-related cognitive, emotional and behavioral activity during or related to focal consumer/brand interactions. We derive three CBE dimensions, including cognitive processing, affection, and activation. Within three different social media contexts, we employ exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to develop a reliable, 10-item CBE scale, which we proceed to validate within a nomological net of conceptual relationships and a rival model. The findings suggest that while consumer brand 'involvement' acts as a CBE antecedent, consumer 'self-brand connection' and 'brand usage intent' represent key CBE consequences, thus providing a platform for further research in this emerging area. We conclude with an overview of key managerial and scholarly implications arising from this research. (C) 2013 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE.

TI Patterns of Herding and their Occurrence in an Online Setting
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB When groups of consumers share information or express their opinions about products and services, their attitudes or behavior sometime align without centralized coordination, a phenomenon known as herding. Building on pattern-based explanations of herding from the cognitive science literature, we propose a framework to elucidate herding behavior based on three dimensions: the speed of contagion, i.e., the extent to which the behavior spreads in a given time, the number of individuals, i.e., the proportion of the whole population expressing the behavior, and the uniformity of direction, i.e., the extent to which the mass behavior is increasingly uniform with one variant becoming dominant. Based on these dimensions, we differentiate eight patterns of herding behavior from slowly diffusing, small and disparate groups through to rapidly spreading, massive herds expressing a convergent behavior. We explore these herding patterns in an online setting, measuring their prevalence using over four thousand streams of data from the online micro-blogging application, Twitter. We find that all eight patterns occur in the empirical data set although some patterns are rare, particularly those where a convergent behavior rapidly spreads through the population. Importantly, those occurrences that develop into the pattern we call "stampeding," i.e., the rapid spread of a dominant opinion expressed by many people, generally follow a consistent development path. The proposed framework can help managers to identify such noteworthy herds in real time, and represents a first step in anticipating this form of group behavior.

TI Asymmetries in the Effects of Drivers of Brand Loyalty Between Early and
   Late Adopters and Across Technology Generations
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Mobile marketing activities are growing at a rapid pace. The success of mobile marketing hinges on consumers' adoption of mobile devices. However, consumers' mobile device adoption is not well understood at the brand (e.g., Apple, Nokia, Samsung) level. We propose a conceptual framework linking mobile device brand loyalty (repurchase intention) to its drivers including perceived value, brand satisfaction, brand attachment and trust, and develop hypotheses about the moderating roles of adopter type and mobile technology generation in some of these linkages. We test these hypotheses using structural equation modeling on a unique cross-sectional dataset of attitudes toward mobile phone brands spanning two technology generations, 2.5G and 3G. The results reveal important asymmetries between adopter types and between technology generations: early adopters of mobile devices emphasize perceived value, whereas late adopters rely on brand satisfaction in developing brand loyalty; and consumers depend more on trust and less on perceived value in developing loyalty for the new generation than for the existing generation. We outline how brand managers of mobile devices should adapt their marketing strategies to different adopter types and technology generations. (C) 2013 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Consumer Decision-making Processes in Mobile Viral Marketing Campaigns
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The high penetration of cell phones in today's global environment offers a wide range of promising mobile marketing activities, including mobile viral marketing campaigns. However, the success of these campaigns, which remains unexplored, depends on the consumers' willingness to actively forward the advertisements that they receive to acquaintances, e.g., to make mobile referrals. Therefore, it is important to identify and understand the factors that influence consumer referral behavior via mobile devices. The authors analyze a three-stage model of consumer referral behavior via mobile devices in a field study of a firm-created mobile viral marketing campaign. The findings suggest that consumers who place high importance on the purposive value and entertainment value of a message are likely to enter the interest and referral stages. Accounting for consumers' egocentric social networks, we find that tie strength has a negative influence on the reading and decision to refer stages and that degree centrality has no influence on the decision-making process.

TI Thematic Discrepancy Analysis: A Method to Gain Insights into Lurkers
   and Test for Non-Response Bias
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Word of mouth (WOM), long recognized as a highly influential source of information, has taken on new importance with the proliferation of online WOM. Research in online environments has focused on individuals who actively participate in generating WOM. However, over 90% of those that read WOM are non-participants, commonly. called "lurkers." This paper develops and tests a thematic discrepancy analysis (TDA) approach that combines commonly available information on Views and Replies with content analysis to provide new insights into differences between WOM participants and lurkers. TDA provides managers with market-sensing information to identify hidden opportunities and threats, as well as to test for non-response bias. Given the lack of approaches to address non-response bias due to lurkers, TDA represents a significant contribution to research methodology. We demonstrate the efficacy of TDA by applying it to a large scale WOM dataset containing over 80,000 messages from a brand-specific online forum.

TI Increasing Price Transparency: Implications of Consumer Price Posting
   for Consumers' Haggling Behavior and a Seller's Pricing Strategies
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In an attempt to gain a better position in haggling, consumers often seek a seller's pricing information (e.g., whether the posted price is negotiable, the discount and transaction prices) before going to that seller. Although traditionally difficult to obtain, such information is becoming increasingly available due to consumer price posting (CPP), whereby consumers post and share their purchase price information on the Internet. In this analytical study, we consider a market in which a seller, who chooses between a fixed price policy and a haggling policy, serves two types of consumers who differ in their willingness to pay and haggling costs. We explore how CPP can affect consumers' behavior and the seller's pricing strategies (i.e., pricing policy and the associated prices). In the absence of CPP, our model features a two-sided uncertainty: the seller does not know individual consumer's type and thus may find it optimal to use a haggling policy to price discriminate consumers, whereas consumers do not readily observe the seller's cost type and pricing policy, and thus are uncertain whether their haggling will be fruitful. In the presence of CPP, consumers' uncertainty about the seller's pricing policy is resolved. Because CPP can improve price transparency, inhibit consumers' acceptance of a posted price and spur price haggling, it seems apparent that it should benefit consumers and hurt the seller. However, our analysis shows that CPP can lead to fewer purchases, higher prices and even a greater seller profit. It further shows that although CPP surely increases information accessibility, it can also reduce the amount of information available to consumers. These results are in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom in the literature. (C) 2013 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Let Users Generate Your Video Ads? The Impact of Video Source and
   Quality on Consumers' Perceptions and Intended Behaviors
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The advent of social media has challenged companies as sole creators of marketing messages. Whether intentionally branded or subconsciously promoted, users become ambassadors for products and brands by producing and disseminating user-generated content (UGC). Whereas previous studies on UGC have mainly considered verbal peer recommendations or written reviews, our research focuses on user-generated videos (UGVs). In our 2 (source: user vs. agency) x 2 (technical quality: low vs. high) experimental study, we explore the impact of user-generated videos (UGVs) vs. agency-generated videos (AGVs) on spectators' perceived source credibility and their intention to visit the tourist destination Tyrol in Austria, as promoted in the video. In addition, we explore the moderating role of video quality. In contrast to conventional wisdom, our results indicate that there is no general superiority of UGVs over AGVs. Rather, the influence of different video generators (user vs. agency) on spectators' perception and intended behavior depends on the technical quality of the video. In the case of low technical quality, users as generators have a significantly stronger positive effect on source trustworthiness - and expertise and thereby on consumers' intended behaviors - than AGVs. However, no impact from the generating source on trustworthiness has been found under the condition of highly technical quality. Concerning source expertise, videos generated by users are rated more highly than agency-generated videos under both low and high technical qualities, but the advantage is significantly lower under high technical quality. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of user-generated content overall and relativize the widely assumed general superiority of user-generated content over commercial, firm-generated content, at least in the case of videos.

TI Social Commerce: A Contingency Framework for Assessing Marketing
   Potential
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB A key issue for marketers resulting from the dramatic rise of social media is how it can be leveraged to generate value for firms. Whereas the importance of social media for brand management and customer relationship management is widely recognized, it is unclear whether social media can also help companies market and sell products. Extant discussions of social commerce present a variety of perspectives, but the core issue remains unresolved. This paper aims to make two contributions. First, to address the lack of clarity in the literature regarding the meaning and domain of social commerce, the paper offers a definition stemming from important research streams in marketing. This definition allows for both a broad (covering all steps of the consumer decision process) and a narrow (focusing on the purchase act itself) construal of social commerce. Second, we build on this definition and develop a contingency framework for assessing the marketing potential that social commerce has to offer to firms. Implications for researchers and managers, based on the proposed definition and framework, are also discussed. (C) 2013 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Managing Brands in the Social Media Environment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The dynamic, ubiquitous, and often real-time interaction enabled by social media significantly changes the landscape for brand management. A deep understanding of this change is critical since it may affect a brand's performance substantially. Literature about social media's impact on brands is evolving, but lacks a systematic identification of key challenges related to managing brands in this new environment. This paper reviews existing research and introduces a framework of social media's impact on brand management. It argues that consumers are becoming pivotal authors of brand stories due to new dynamic networks of consumers and brands formed through social media and the easy sharing of brand experiences in such networks. Firms need to pay attention to such consumer-generated brand stories to ensure a brand's success in the marketplace. The authors identify key research questions related to the phenomenon and the challenges in coordinating consumer- and firm-generated brand stories.

This article explores the intersection of consumer behavior and digital media by clearly defining consumer power and empowerment in Internet and social media contexts and by presenting a theoretical framework of four distinct consumer power sources: demand-, information-, network-, and crowd-based power. Furthermore, we highlight technology's evolutionary role in the development of these power sources and discuss the nature of shifts in power from marketers to consumers in terms of each source. The framework organizes prior marketing literature on Internet-enabled consumer empowerment and highlights gaps in current research.

TI Managing Customer Relationships in the Social Media Era: Introducing the
   Social CRM House
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB CRM has traditionally referred to a company managing relationships with customers. The rise of social media, which has connected and empowered customers, challenges this fundamental raison d'etre. This paper examines how CRM needs to adapt to the rise of social media. The convergence of social media and CRM creates pitfalls and opportunities, which are explored. We organize this discussion around the new "social CRM house," and discuss how social media engagement affects the house's core areas (i.e., acquisition, retention, and termination) and supporting business areas (i.e., people, IT, performance evaluation, metrics and overall marketing strategy). Pitfalls discussed include the organization's lack of control over message diffusion, big and unstructured data sets, privacy, data security, the shortage of qualified manpower, measuring the ROI of social media marketing initiatives, strategies for managing employees, integrating customer touch points, and content marketing.

However, social media are fundamentally different from any traditional or other online media because of their social network structure and egalitarian nature. These differences require a distinct measurement approach as a prerequisite for proper analysis and subsequent management. To develop the right social media metrics and subsequently construct appropriate dashboards, we provide a tool kit consisting of three novel components. First, we theoretically derive and propose a holistic framework that covers the major elements of social media, drawing on theories from marketing, psychology, and sociology. We continue to support and detail these elements - namely 'motives,' 'content,' 'network structure,' and 'social roles & interactions' - with recent research studies. Second, based on our theoretical framework, the literature review, and practical experience, we suggest nine guidelines that may prove valuable for designing appropriate social media metrics and constructing a sensible social media dashboard. Third, based on the framework and the guidelines we derive managerial implications and suggest an agenda for future research. (C) 2013 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Destination Social Business: Exploring an Organization's Journey with
   Social Media, Collaborative Community and Expressive Individuality
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper delineates the main characteristics of the evolution of the organization as a social business in response to the socially networked marketplace. We advance the notion that the modern day firm is increasingly organized as a community according to the principle of collaboration. The main message is that the prominence of organizational structure is not redundant but needs to be complemented by collaborative community in response to market demands. In order to fulfill this complementary role, the concept of organization is profoundly changing. Based on recent theorizing, we review the role of collaborative community as a key characteristic of social business, provide an overview of its principles, show how social media can effectively facilitate and support collaborative community, and introduce the concept of expressive individuality. We provide illustrative examples that feature Dell. We conclude by identifying an agenda for further academic inquiry, and by specifying a large number of issues that researchers may address.

TI Nested Network Effects in Online Free Games with Accessory Selling
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We analyze the innovative business model of free online games in which game players do not pay subscription fees and the firms generate their revenue by selling accessories-namely, virtual items within the games. The online game market is modeled as a nested network, with the segment of accessorized buyers embedded within that of game players. Both segments exhibit local network effects within the segments, and they impose crossed network effects on each other. We demonstrate that offering free games emerges as the revenue-maximizing strategy when the positive network effect of the game is high and the negative network effect of the accessory is low. We distinguish between two major types of accessories-namely, weaponries and decoratives-via their network effects. The weaponries impose a threat on the game players and subsequently confine the growth of the game; this negative effect is absent for the decoratives, which can thus be priced higher. We also generalize our findings related to online games to cope with other types of network-based free services, ranging from social networks to various kinds of information intermediaries.

TI Donor Segmentation: When Summary Statistics Don't Tell the Whole Story
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Funding pressures amidst the slow economic recovery from the late-2000's recession have forced universities, as well as other not-for-profit organizations, to increase the volume and sophistication of their direct marketing activities. The efficiency of direct marketing strategies is linked to an organization's ability to effectively target individuals. In this paper, we present a finite-mixture model framework to segment the alumni population of a university in the midwestern United States.
   Much of the research on customer segmentation summarizes response data (e.g., purchase and contribution histories) via recency, frequency and monetary value (RFM) statistics. Individuals sharing similar RFM characteristics are grouped together; the rationale being that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Summary statistics such as RFM, however, introduce aggregation bias that mask the dynamics of purchase/contribution behavior. Accordingly, we implement latent-class segmentation models where alumni are classified based on how an individual's contribution sequence compares to those of other individuals. The framework's capability to process contribution sequences, i.e., longitudinal data, provides fundamental new insights into donor contribution behavior, and provides a rigorous mechanism to infer and segment the population based on unobserved heterogeneities (as well as based on other observable characteristics). Specifically, we analyze Markov mixture models to segment alumni based on contribution-behavior patterns, under the assumption of serially-dependent contribution sequences. We use the expectation-maximization algorithm to obtain parameter estimates for each segment. Through an extensive empirical study, we highlight the substantive insights gained through the processing of the full contribution sequences, and establish the presence of three distinct classes of alumni in the population (each with a discernible contribution pattern). The proposed framework, collectively, provides a basis to tailor direct marketing policies to optimize specific performance criteria (e.g., profits).

TI A Partially Hidden Markov Model of Customer Dynamics for CLV Measurement
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Customer lifetime value (CLV) measurement is challenging as it requires forecasting customers' future purchases. Existing stochastic CLV models for this purpose generally make the following assumptions: I) purchase behavior of customers can be described by purchase frequency and the average monetary value of transactions, 2) customers keep the same purchase behavior pattern over time, 3) purchase frequency and monetary value are independent, and 4) customers are active during a limited period of time after which they permanently defect. We develop a new stochastic model that relaxes these four assumptions. First, in addition to the number of transactions and its monetary values, we also model purchase incidence decisions (i.e. whether or not to purchase). Second, our partially hidden Markov truncated-NBD-GG (PHM/TNBD-GG) model allows dynamic purchase patterns, dependence between purchase frequency and monetary value, and customers to become active after a few periods of temporary inactivity. Validation of our model on two datasets demonstrates that if assumptions 1 to 4 of existing stochastic models are violated our model produces more accurate forecasts of future customer behavior.

TI Customer Attitude and Dispositions Towards Customized Products: The
   Interaction Between Customization Model and Brand
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Despite increasing interest in customization-related topics, little is known about the relation between customization and brand. The authors identify two main archetypes of product customization based on the degrees of freedom given to the customer in the design process: Combination-based Customization (CbC), which is the selection of product modules provided by the company, and Integration-based Customization (IbC), which is product customization by means of signs and symbols provided by the customer. The authors propose that customer attitude and dispositions towards CbC and IbC depend on the presence/absence of a mass brand logo upon the product. Results of three studies, based on web toolkits for t-shirt and trolley bag customization, demonstrate that in the presence of a mass brand logo CbC shows higher customer attitude and dispositions than IbC. In the absence of a mass brand logo, the opposite pattern holds. Additional findings show, however, that the advantage of CbC over IbC for branded products disappears when there is high congruence between the customer self and the brand, and when creative brands are considered.

TI Value Creation in the Video Game Industry: Industry Economics, Consumer
   Benefits, and Research Opportunities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In the past twenty years, the video game industry has established itself as a significant contributor to the global entertainment economy. Compared to more established entertainment industries such as movies and music, limited scholarly research in marketing has addressed the processes that create value for companies and consumers in the context of video games which are now available on multiple devices (e.g., consoles, portables, mobile devices) and through multiple channels (e.g., retail and online). The authors therefore develop a conceptual framework of value creation through video games, highlight important findings from extant research in marketing and other disciplines, and apply the framework to derive future research opportunities.

TI Too Popular to Ignore: The Influence of Online Reviews on Purchase
   Intentions of Search and Experience Products
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers assess the credibility of online product reviews to guide their purchase decisions. However, little is known about how consumers determine the credibility of online product reviews. This article examines the effect of the level of detail in a product review and the level of reviewer agreement with it on the credibility of a review and consumers' purchase intentions for search and experience products. Overall, the results indicate that more credible reviews lead to higher purchase intentions. Interestingly, the findings also demonstrate that consumers determine the credibility of a review differently for search and experience products. For search products, consumers deem online reviews to be more credible when the reviews contain detailed information about the product. However, for experience products, consumers determine the credibility of a review by assessing the level of reviewer agreement with a review. The lack of diagnosticity of detailed information in online reviews of experience products is attributed to the idiosyncratic nature of experiences. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (C) 2013 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluating the Effect of Affinity Card Programs on Customer
   Profitability Using Propensity Score Matching
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Affinity card programs have become popular in recent times and account for one fifth of all credit card accounts. There is no research that links affinity card programs to customer profitability. Moreover, little is known about what type of affinity card programs would lead to higher profit. Using a large proprietary dataset we answer the above questions. We also apply propensity score matching, a relatively new technique, to control for selection bias in addressing the above issues. Contrary to previous research and common belief, we show that affinity card customers are no more profitable than non-affinity card holders. We also show that sports-based affinity programs are the least profitable and surprisingly, alumni-based affinity programs also do poorly relative to other types of affinity. On the positive side, affinity card customers are lower risk and help to lower the average risk of the portfolio of customers. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Perceived Ubiquity in Mobile Services
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Ubiquity has been referred to as one of the most important characteristics of mobile services. In this study, an instrument for the measurement of perceived ubiquity reflecting the benefits derived from continuity, immediacy, portability, and searchability is developed using a multiple-stage approach. In the initial stage, perceived ubiquity is conceptualized through interdisciplinary perspectives as a multidimensional, 32-item eight-factor construct. In the second stage, the original measurement is pretested on a student sample and recalibrated into a 16-item four-factor instrument. In the third stage, general consumers are invited to complete a task in which they are asked to perform a search with a mobile device before rating the measurement items. A confirmatory factor analysis produces a 12-item four-factor instrument. Furthermore, a second-order structure results from a statistical comparison of alternative models through a competing model strategy. In the final stage, we use a scenario method to validate the measurement tool while establishing discriminant, nomological, and known-group validities. The thorough validation results demonstrate the value of our instrument as a measurement tool of perceived ubiquity that is useful in describing the unique nature of mobile devices and predicting differences in user perceptions of mobile services and desktop PC services. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed, important limitations are recognized and future research directions are suggested. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Using Internet Behavior to Deliver Relevant Television Commercials
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumer footprints left on the Internet help advertisers show consumers relevant Web ads, which increase awareness and click-throughs. This "proof of concept" experiment illustrates how Internet behavior can identify relevant television commercials that increase ad-effectiveness by raising attention and ad exposure. Product involvement and prior brand exposure, however, complicate effective Internet-targeting. Ad relevance matters more for low-involvement products, which have a short pre-purchase search process. For the same reason, using Web browsing behavior to make inferences about current ad relevance is more accurate for low-involvement products. Prior brand exposure reduces information-value, even for relevant commercials, and therefore dampens ad relevance's effect on attention and ad exposure.

TI Finding Donors by Relationship Fundraising
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Our research utilizes revenue business-based relationships and data to expand the donor bases of non-profit organizations. Fundraisers desire to predict who will donate and how much to allocate their marketing resources effectively. To answer both questions, we develop the Spatial Tobit Type 2 (ST2) model that integrates the auto-Logistic (AL) and auto-Gaussian (AG) models into the Tobit type 2 framework. The AL component is used to predict who is likely to donate by inferring inter-client similarities based on the clients' transaction information from the revenue businesses. Similarly, the AG component is used to predict how much based on a similar measure of inter-client similarities. The Tobit type 2 framework combines both components into the single framework of ST2. Our empirical application linking a veterinary school's medical treatment records to its donation records demonstrates that clients' relationships built through their medical treatments at the school hospital positively contribute to their donation decisions.

TI Organizational Learning and CRM Success: A Model for Linking A
   Organizational Practices, Customer Data Quality, and Performance
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB A high quality customer database is a cornerstone of successful interactive marketing strategies and tactics. Based on the notion that customer data quality is not only a technical but also an organizational problem, this study develops and tests an organizational learning framework of the relationship between organizational processes, customer data quality and firm perfomance. The findings show that high quality customer data impact both customer and business performance and that the most important driver of customer data quality comes from the executive suite. A large portion of the impact of organizational culture on performance is mediated by customer data quality and data sharing. The results support the presence of a hierarchy of effects for enhancing data quality that runs from organizational learning (committed to a shared vision for CRM data), to cross-functional learning (marketing/IT cooperation, marketing/IT integration) to functional learning (data sharing).

TI A Walk in Customers' Shoes: How Attentional Bias Modification Affects
   Ownership of Integrity-violating Social Media Posts
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The number of social media posts that expose company integrity violations has increased dramatically. In response, some companies empower employees to respond to customer blogs, which requires employees to recognize the customer's perspective. We show that attentional bias modification can be used to prime employees of two global Fortune 100 companies with a self-sufficiency or empathy bias. The results indicate that narrative transportation, or the extent to which employees mentally enter the world evoked by a customer's story, mediates the effect of attentional bias on two relevant psychological ownership dimensions: acknowledgment of responsibility and willingness to respond. Participants with a self-sufficiency bias neither acknowledge responsibility nor want to respond. However, participants primed with an empathy bias take responsibility for the customer's case and respond to the integrity violation. We find evidence for two boundary conditions of this effect: (1) it strengthens when the employee perceives the customer's financial vulnerability as high and (2) it weakens when the customer is impolite in the blog post.

TI Attitude Toward the Viral Ad: Expanding Traditional Advertising Models
   to Interactive Advertising
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB As a form of advertising, viral video (VV) advertising is distinct in that its communication medium is the social connections between individuals instead of formal media. After viewing VV advertising, people are engaged in two independent but interrelated processes, i.e., video sharing and embedded brand information processing. Previous research has not examined the interaction between the two processes. This study expands on the mediation of attitude toward the advertisement model proposed by MacKenzie, Lutz, and Belch (1986). Experimental results from three viral video advertisements show that attitude toward the VV advertisement is the major factor affecting video sharing, but attitude toward the brand also has a significant impact on sharing activity. Affect transfer. hypothesis (ATH) and its extended models are optimal in explaining viral video advertising, which is different from prior research on non-viral advertising that suggests dual mediation hypothesis as the optimal explanatory theory.

TI Thinking or Feeling the Risk in Online Auctions: The Effects of Priming
   Auction Outcomes and the Dual System on Risk Perception and Amount Bid
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The present research sheds new light on the antecedents and outcomes of bidders' perceived risk. It examines the role of the two-system model in the context of activating the potential to either win or lose an online auction. This study demonstrates that when a bidder's affective system is primed, concern about losing the item is greater and ultimately the bid amount is higher when the bidder expects to lose rather than win. Conversely, when the cognitive system is primed, the anticipated goals of winning the auction - rather than the fear of losing - drive the bidder's actions. In the latter case, the bidder pays a higher amount if the expectancy of winning is primed, as opposed to the expectancy of losing. A field study on eBay and two lab studies confirm this phenomenon.

AB Despite increasing adoption of social media for market research, the effect of the design of Web 2.0 platforms on the quantity and quality of market insights obtained is unclear. With a field experiment, this article addresses the effect of participant interaction and the role of questioning on the performance of blog platforms that aim to solicit online consumer feedback. We show that the role of questioning is a key determinant of the protocol design decision process. In contrast with the industry standard of directive questioning and the intuitive appeal of a collective protocol in a social media setting, this study shows that no questioning, combined with an individual protocol, results in the best feedback quality. The analyses also highlight the value of an individual, no questioning protocol for performance over time and insights in consumers' experiential consumption and personal backgrounds. In terms of feedback quantity, protocols that combine directive questioning with a collective setting are best. These actionable recommendations indicate how market researchers can design online blog platforms to improve consumer feedback quantity and quality.

TI A Cross-national Investigation of the Satisfaction and Loyalty Linkage
   for Mobile Telecommunications Services across Eight Countries
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Improving customer satisfaction has become a strategic imperative for managers and researchers given the benefits of developing customer loyalty for long-term financial success. Creating these linkages becomes even more important in the context of mobile telecommunications due to the ubiquitous nature of mobile phones and the potential this creates to engage in interactive marketing for firms. Further, with increased global penetration of mobile telecommunications, examining cross-national differences in consumer attitudes and behaviors has become critical. Most studies that examine customer satisfaction and loyalty linkages however have traditionally focused on single countries and/or single industries. This study extends the literature by testing the moderating impact of cultural variables on the impact of satisfaction on loyalty intentions using data from 3,393 mobile telecommunications customers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Spain, UK, and USA. Our findings reveal that the impact of satisfaction on loyalty in the mobile telecommunications context depends on cultural differences. The results demonstrate non-linear threshold effects where managers operating in countries characterized by self-expressionist values will have an easier time creating satisfaction and loyalty with mobile customers compared to those operating in cultures dominated by high survivalist values.

TI Social Media Peer Communication and Impacts on Purchase Intentions: A
   Consumer Socialization Framework
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumer socialization through peer communication using social media websites has become an important marketing issue through the development and increasing popularity of social media. Guided by a socialization framework, this article investigates peer communication through social media websites; individual-level tie strength and group-level identification with the peer group as antecedents; and product attitudes and purchase decisions as outcomes. Survey data from 292 participants who engaged in peer communications about products through social media confirm that the two antecedents have positive influences on peer communication outcomes. Online consumer socialization through peer communication also affects purchasing decisions in two ways: directly (conformity with peers) and indirectly by reinforcing product involvement. In addition, consumer's need for uniqueness has a moderating effect on the influence of peer communication on product attitudes. These findings have significant theoretical and managerial implications. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Interactivity in Brand Web Sites: Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral
   Responses Explained by Consumers' Online Flow Experience
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Web site interactivity creates numerous opportunities for marketers to persuade online consumers and receives extensive attention in the marketing literature. However, research on cognitive and behavioral responses to web site interactivity is scarce, and more importantly, it does not provide empirical evidence for how interactivity effects can be explained. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the underlying principle that explains the influence of web site. interactivity on consumers' cognitive, affective and behavioral responses: online flow, the web site users' complete immersion in an online activity (Hoffman and Novak 2009). In two studies, the hypothesis was tested that a visitor's flow experience in a specific brand web site mediates the effects of interactivity on the number and type (web site vs. product related) of thoughts, on attitudes toward the brand and web site, and on several behavioral intentions. The results provide evidence for the importance of flow in a marketing context, and the notion that the flow experienced on a specific web site is the underlying mechanism by which cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral responses to an interactive brand web site can be explained.

TI I Like Your Product When I Like My Photo: Misattribution Using
   Interactive Virtual Mirrors
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Recent technological advances in interactive marketing allow consumers to use a 'virtual mirror' (created with their own digital photo uploaded to a retailer's Web site) to see how products would look on them. The virtual mirror can be used for simulated product experiences in virtual shopping environments (e.g., trying a garment or a pair of sunglasses in an Internet shopping mall). To enhance our understanding of the managerial implications of this new marketing tool, we test whether the images consumers select to construct their 'virtual mirror' influence their product evaluations. Psychological theorizing suggests that it is difficult to distinguish one's reaction to the product from one's reaction to the personal image to which the product is applied, giving rise to misattribution effects. Consistent with this assumption, three studies show that consumers evaluate a product more favorably the more they like the image used to construct a virtual mirror (for themselves or for someone they personally know); the variables used to enhance consumers' liking of their virtual mirror include the consumer's own facial expression (Study 1), a visual enhancement of the image (Study 2), and a regular vs. mirror image format (Study 3).

TI Brand Performances in Social Media
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The branding literature has long recognized the power of storytelling to provide meaning to the brand and practitioners have used storytelling to enhance consumers' connections with brands. The premise of brand storytelling has been that the story and its content, production, and distribution are the brand owner's realm and the consumer primarily a listener. The emergence of social media has changed the consumers' role in storytelling from that of a passive listener to a more active participant. Our paper uses the metaphor of improvisation (improv) theater to show that in social media brand owners do not tell brand stories alone but co-create brand performances in collaboration with the consumers. The first and foremost contribution of such a conceptualization is that it offers a semantic framework that resolves issues in storytelling, demonstrates the necessity of co-creation in storytelling, and identifies the core of an inspiring story. The improv theater metaphor also helps identify the following three propositions relevant for branding in social media: (i) the process of improvisation is more important than the output, (ii) managing brands is about keeping the brand performance alive, and (iii) understanding the audience and its roles is the prerequisite for a successful brand performance.

TI We Create, We Connect, We Respect, Therefore We Are: Intellectual,
   Social, and Cultural Value in Online Communities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The web has become an irreplaceable source for knowledge creation and consumption and online communities have turned out to be the new form of socialization platforms for fulfilling certain needs such as providing or acquiring information, sharing experiences, playing games, etc. The aim of this paper is to explore the main characteristics of an online community that can deliver value to its consumers and instigate engagement. For this purpose, Airliners.net, an online community on aviation with high traffic and committed participants who are willing to pay membership fees to become active participants, is explored through netnography (Kozinets 2010). Netnography along with online and offline in-depth interviews revealed three specific online community characteristics that create value for the members of Airliners.net: goal driven and quality content (intellectual value), interactive environment for building relationships (social value), and self-governed community culture consistent with its principles (cultural value). Along with the results of netnography, the study discusses co-creation (Kozinets, Hemetsberger, and Schau 2008; Toffler 1980), interactivity and ritual chains (Collins 2004, Gordon 2010), and community culture (Cova 1997; Muniz and O'Guinn 2001; Muniz and Schau 2005) literature to show how these concepts converge to create value and therefore engagement, loyalty, and sustainability for online community members. These findings have theoretical implications for social media and online interaction related literature as well as critical business implications for sponsors or creators of online communities to differentiate themselves within the inflating number of online platforms.

TI Balance and Sequence in Online Reviews: How Perceived Usefulness Affects
   Attitudes and Intentions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper is the first study that investigates the impact of balance (the ratio of positive and negative reviews) and sequence (the order in which the reviews are presented) of a set of online reviews on the perceived usefulness of these reviews (objective 1). As a second objective, our study attempts to provide more understanding in the gatekeeping role of the perceived usefulness. The results do not only evidence that review balance matters, but also reveal that review sequence has an important effect on the perceived usefulness of a set of reviews. The crucial role of perceived usefulness is demonstrated in that only when reviews are perceived as relatively useful, recall of positive and negative review information affects attitude and intention formation through the impression it creates about the object.

TI So Whaddya Think? Consumers Create Ads and Other Consumers Critique Them
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB With the availability of online creative tools, consumers create ad-like communications on their own or in response to company contests. These consumer-generated ads (CGA) are like word-of-mouth (WOM) in that they are consumer-to-consumer communications, yet they have the look and feel of traditional advertising. We examine consumer responses to both contest and unsolicited CGA and company ads using data gathered from consumers via netnography and depth interviews. Content analysis is used to compare the three ad types and reveals that the contest rules frame CGA so that they resemble company ads while unsolicited CGA differ from both ad types. Findings show that consumers respond to both types of CGA by engaging with the ad rather than the brand, much like an ad critic, while company ads elicit brand associations. Unsolicited CGA are seen as authentic, but not credible, while contest ads are seen as credible, but not authentic, revealing a boundary condition to the conventional view that authenticity leads to credibility.

TI Online Damage Control: The Effects of Proactive Versus Reactive Webcare
   Interventions in Consumer-generated and Brand-generated Platforms
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Web 2.0 has empowered consumers to voice complaints with reduced costs (physical and psychological), and to share these with a multitude of other consumers on the Internet. As a public phenomenon, online complaints have a negative impact on consumers' evaluations of brands that are under attack in online complaints. By means of an experiment, we study the most effective means for companies to counter complaints as expressed in negative electronic word of mouth (NWOM). The results show that negative brand evaluations engendered by NWOM can be attenuated by webcare interventions dependent on type of strategy (proactive vs. reactive) and platform used (consumer-generated vs. brand-generated blog). This effect appeared to be mediated by conversational human voice. The findings are discussed in the light of practical implications for online complaint management.

Little is known, however, about which online advertising channel works best to address particular customer groups when short- and long-term effects, are taken into account. We look at the sales effect of search engine marketing (SEM), banner advertising, price comparison advertising (PCA) and coupon/loyalty advertising (CLA) on new and existing customers. Our analysis, which uses a sample of 2.8 million purchases, shows that SEM has the longest effect, followed by banners, CLA, and PCA. We find that CLA works better for existing customers than for new customers, whereas PCA works better to attract new customers. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Return on Quality Improvements in Search Engine Marketing
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In search engine marketing, such as on Google, advertisements' ranking and prices paid per click result from generalized, second-price, sealed bid auctions that weight the submitted bids for each keyword by the quality of an advertisement. Conventional wisdom suggests that advertisers can only benefit from improving their advertisement's quality. With an empirical study, this article shows that quality improvements have complex effects whose returns are actually unclear: 5% of all quality improvements to an advertisement lead to higher prices (measured by price per click) per keyword, 100% to a higher number of clicks, 53% to higher costs for search engine marketing, and 37% to lower profits. Quality improvements lead to higher weighted bids, which only lower prices if they do not improve the ranking of the advertisement. Otherwise, better ranks likely lead to higher prices. A decomposition method can disentangle these effects and explain their effects on search engine marketing costs and profits. Finally, the results indicate that advertisers benefit if they lower their bids after improvements to advertising quality. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI The Impact of Online and Offline Information Sources on Automobile
   Choice Behavior
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The Internet has significantly impacted the information search behavior of consumers. Many consumers regularly consult Internet sources for information on product categories, brands, manufacturers, and retailers, particularly when making a purchase decision about major durable goods. Automobiles are one example of such goods. The Internet has become a major source for information on automobile brands, attributes, and dealers. While much research has been done on the impact of the Internet on automobile information search behavior and search costs, there is limited work on the relationship between Internet use and the ultimate automobile choice. This type of relationship may have interesting managerial implications for both manufacturers of automobiles and firms that provide information on automobiles. This paper attempts to address this gap. It examines whether Internet use is associated with different choice patterns for automobiles. Using discrete choice analysis on automobile choice data, we explore whether there will be differences in the salience of specific information types for online versus offline consumers. We find that Internet users rely more on ratings while non-Internet users rely more on recommendations when making automobile choices. Our findings have several useful managerial implications for information provision, both online and offline. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Heterogeneity in the Effects of Online Persuasion
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Average effects of influence strategies on consumers' attitudes and behaviors have been studied extensively. Less is known about the relative size of individual differences in these effects, despite recognition of their importance in social psychology. Two experiments use repeated exposures to influence strategies to identify the effects of each social influence strategy for individual participants. Study 1 provides evidence of large variation in the effects of influence strategies, such that for many participants the estimated effect of using an influence strategy is negative, even though the effect of that strategy is significantly positive on average. Study 2 replicates these findings over three sessions, each a week apart. The observed variation in responses to influence strategies cannot be attributed to transient intra-individual variation (e.g., strategy x mood interactions). Meta-judgmental measures of personality constructs (e.g., need for cognition) explain only a small portion of the observed variance, suggesting the importance of directly modeling heterogeneity in responses to influence attempts. These results are important for interactive marketeers since they indicate that different influence strategies substantially differ in their effects on individual consumers and should thus be adapted to individuals.

TI Rising to Stardom: An Empirical Investigation of the Diffusion of
   User-generated Content
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB With the explosive growth of online user-generated content and the desire by marketers to better utilize this space, it is beneficial to understand the viral diffusion of such content and to identify messages that are most likely to achieve popularity. In this paper, we combine network analysis and the diffusion literature to study the spreading of user-generated videos online. We identify three groups of factors that affect diffusion outcomes: network structure, content characteristics, and author characteristics. Using a proportional rates model, we analyze the diffusion of a sample of videos on YouTube. Our results show that it is preferable to have many subscribers who each has a few friends than to have a few subscribers with many connections. Furthermore, a curvilinear relationship exists between subscriber network connectivity and diffusion rate such that diffusion is at its highest under moderate connectivity. Examining content characteristics, we show that entertainment and educational values affect diffusion but production quality does not matter. Moreover, we find that quality as manifested by user ratings influences diffusion more than innate content quality. Not surprisingly, an author's past success carries over to the current content, and content from younger authors is more popular. (C) 2012 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Is Online Word of Mouth Higher for New Models or Redesigns? An
   Investigation of the Automobile Industry
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Changing consumer preferences, entry of new competitors with better products, and product improvements by existing competitors make new products a necessary investment for most companies. In addition to the investments in R&D and production of new products, firms also need to invest in advertising to promote them. The growing use of social media by consumers therefore makes online consumer conversations an attractive additional format for firms to promote products at a lower cost. This is particularly so in the automobile industry where advertising costs are very high. Whether consumers discuss a newly introduced product, and help to promote it, however, may depend on how new the product is. This is the question that we investigate in the context of the automobile category. Specifically, we examine whether online consumer conversations are more likely for new models (e.g., Chevy Volt introduced in 2010) or redesigns of existing models (e.g., the redesign of Chevy Impala in 2010). We use data from two online sites where consumers discuss automobiles - consumerreports.org and edmunds.com - for our analysis. Our empirical investigation also accounts for the effects of sales on word of mouth and the simultaneity between sales and word of mouth. Additionally, we also consider the effect of satisfaction on word of mouth and the endogeneity of satisfaction. Our results across two datasets suggest that redesigns stimulate significantly more conversations than new models. Managerial and research implications of the findings are discussed.

TI Popularity of Brand Posts on Brand Fan Pages: An Investigation of the
   Effects of Social Media Marketing
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Social media outlets constitute excellent vehicles for fostering relationships with customers. One specific way to do this is to create brand fan pages on social networking sites. Companies can place brand posts (containing videos, messages, quizzes, information, and other material) on these brand fan pages. Customers can become fans of these brand fan pages, and subsequently indicate that they like the brand post or comment on it. This liking and commenting on brand posts reflects brand post popularity. In this article, we determine possible drivers for brand post popularity. We analyze 355 brand posts from 11 international brands spread across six product categories.
   Results show that positioning the brand post on top of the brand fan page enhances brand post popularity. But the findings also indicate that different drivers influence the number of likes and the number of comments. Namely, vivid and interactive brand post characteristics enhance the number of likes. Moreover, the share of positive comments on a brand post is positively related to the number of likes. The number of comments can be enhanced by the interactive brand post characteristic, a question. The shares of both positive and negative comments are positively related to the number of comments. Managers of brands that operate brand fan pages can be guided by our research with regards to deciding which characteristics or content to place at brand posts.

TI How Does Brand-related User-generated Content Differ across YouTube,
   Facebook, and Twitter?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study tests hypotheses regarding differences in brand-related user-generated content (UGC) between Twitter (a microblogging site), Facebook (a social network) and YouTube (a content community). It tests them using data from a content analysis of 600 UGC posts for two retail-apparel brands (Lululemon and American Apparel), which differ in the extent to which they manage social media proactively. Comparisons are drawn across six dimensions of UGC; the dimensions were drawn from a priori reading and an inductive analysis of brand-related UGC. This research provides a general framework for comparing brand-related UGC, and helps us to better understand how particular social media channels and marketing strategies may influence consumer-produced brand communications.

TI "The (Real) World Is Not Enough": Motivational Drivers and User Behavior
   in Virtual Worlds
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Virtual worlds (VWs) have become increasingly prominent during the past decade, populated by individual users and more recently, even "real world" firms. To effectively use a VW for business purposes, a relevant question for those firms pertains to why people use VWs and which motivational drivers might influence their participation behavior. This study offers an early analysis of the topic by extending a social influence model to explain participation behavior in a new, marketing-relevant context and identify specific motivational drivers of VW participation. Socializing, creativity, and escape emerge as individual drivers. Accounting for user heterogeneity also reveals four latent segments, each characterized by a distinct motivational driver, and one segment that reflects mixed motives. The segments differ substantially in their descriptive characteristics (e.g., usage intensity, overall spending behavior). These results have significant implications for research, VW operators, and companies doing business in VWs. (C) 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Effects of Prominence, Involvement, and Persuasion Knowledge on
   Children's Cognitive and Affective Responses to Advergames
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The integrated and highly involving nature of advergatnes has led to criticism and concern among academics and caretakers. It is assumed that children are highly susceptible to persuasion via advergames, but empirical evidence is scarce. Therefore, this study examined the effects of three factors typically associated with advergames: brand prominence, game involvement, and (limited) persuasion knowledge on cognitive and affective responses. An experiment among 7 to 12 year old children (N=105) showed that brand prominence and game involvement influenced children's responses, while persuasion knowledge did not. Brand prominence led to increased brand recall and recognition, whereas game involvement led to more positive brand attitudes. The effect of game involvement was mediated by game attitude, indicating that children are susceptible to affective mechanisms induced by the game. Crucially, our results demonstrate that brand prominence evokes cognitive responses, while game involvement leads to affective responses. Finally, our study revealed that persuasion knowledge (i.e. knowledge of the commercial source of the game and its persuasive intent) did not influence cognitive or affective responses to the brand or game. This implies that even if children understand the game's commercial and persuasive nature, they do not use this knowledge as a defense against the advergame's effects. This study has important theoretical and practical implications regarding the influence of new marketing techniques on children. (C) 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Optimal Resource Allocation with Time-varying Marketing Effectiveness,
   Margins and Costs
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The importance of optimal marketing communications mix decisions is well-recognized by both marketing scholars and practitioners. A significant volume of work has addressed the problem of dynamic marketing mix optimization assuming constant effectiveness of marketing instruments. However, the effectiveness of marketing communications varies over time for a variety of reasons. Moreover, due to factors such as inflation or deflation in media prices and/or raw material inputs, there can be differential changes in the costs of communications and/or margins on the good (or service) sold over time. The academic literature offers little normative direction on how time-varying marketing effectiveness and costs drive optimal marketing-mix levels and their relative allocation. The authors shed light on these issues by solving a monopoly firm's finite horizon dynamic marketing communications mix optimization problem involving two marketing instruments with time-varying parameters, i.e., the marketing effectiveness parameters, media costs, and product margin are all allowed to vary over time. First, they find that the structure of the solutions is similar to that of the classic Nerlove Arrow model, for a completely general nature of time-varying effectiveness. Second, their model can be used by managers to exactly determine whether and when to switch their marketing-mix emphasis (defined by the marketing element receiving the dominant portion of the budget) over a finite planning horizon. In sum, the authors expand knowledge on optimal allocation of marketing resources with time-varying effectiveness. They also extend their solution to incorporate multiple (more than two) marketing instruments. (C) 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Work and Fun on the Internet: The Effects of Utilitarianism and Hedonism
   Online
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers may act on the spur of the moment, driven by fun and curiosity, or be goal-oriented, task-focused utilitarians. This study investigates the effects of consumers' hedonic and utilitarian orientation online on price consciousness, frequency of purchase, purchased amount, intention to re-patronize a Web site and expertise with the Internet. It specifically considers purchasing, not mere browsing, basing on data collected on customers of one of the largest Italian online retailers for electronics. The data show significant differences between hedonic and utilitarian orientation online with regard to past purchase frequency, the amount purchased and the intention to re-patronize the Web site in the future. The findings suggest that utilitarianism is strongly present online, and is valuable, thus utilitarian consumers should not be neglected, but hedonism is even more profitable, impacting on the number of items purchased and the intention to come back to the Web site. No differences are found in the level of price consciousness or in the degree of expertise with the Internet. (C) 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Determinants of Consumer Perceptions toward Mobile Advertising - A
   Comparison between Japan and Austria
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Mobile marketing provides an innovative channel for transmitting advertising messages to customers via mobile devices. The growth of mobile advertising in recent years requires that researchers and practitioners understand consumer perceptions of this form of advertising. The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors influencing the perception of mobile advertising in different cultures. Based on samples from Austria and Japan, we empirically examine relevant m-advertising effects. The results suggest that infotainment and credibility are key factors predicting advertising value among Austrians and the Japanese. However, our findings show that Japanese customers are more irritated by mobile advertising than are Austrian respondents. (C) 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI An Empirical Investigation of Dual Network Effects in Innovation Project
   Development
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB As innovation project developers advance their knowledge through more project experience, cross-project learning is likely to enhance project performance. Past research has demonstrated positive contributions of developer networking at the macro (project) level. However, the network effects at the micro (project property) level have not been studied as much. To address this gap, we apply a network model to examine which project properties (e.g., the project's operating system and topic) generate positive or negative network effects in addition to the macro network effect when developers engage in multiple projects. In this dual (developer and property) network model, we theorize that positive network effects take place because of cross-project learning and knowledge exchange, whereas negative network effects can also occur due to time constraints and cognitive overloading. In addition to such dual network effects, we also consider such project success predictors as spatial and temporal reach opportunities for project users (scope of translations and project age) and human resources availability (developer team size). Our empirical application using open source software (OSS) data demonstrates that the presented model can effectively integrate both the dual network effects and non-network variables as factors influencing the commercial success of OSS projects.

TI The Effectiveness of Branded Mobile Phone Apps
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Mobile phone applications ("apps") have generated substantial interest among marketers, primarily because of their high level of user engagement and the positive impact this presumably has on a user's attitude toward the sponsoring brand. This study utilized a pre-test/post-test experimental design to determine whether using popular mobile phone apps affects brand attitude and brand purchase intention. The results show that using these apps has a positive persuasive impact, increasing interest in the brand and also the brand's product category. The relevance of the product category makes no difference, but apps with an informational/user-centered style were more effective at shifting purchase intention, most likely because this style focuses attention on the user, and therefore encourages making personal connections with the brand. Experiential game-like apps were less successful, because they focus attention on the phone. These results suggest that understanding how to maximize the impact of mobile phone apps will be a key topic for future research. (C) 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI The Effect of Pricing and Advertising on Customer Retention in a
   Liberalizing Market
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study investigates the drivers of customer retention in a liberalizing market. The authors address key, retention issues that allow them to contribute to existing retention research in several critical ways. They (1) examine the effects of pricing and mass advertising, (2) account for (new entrants) competitors' actions, (3) investigate the dynamic impact of marketing tactics, and (4) study the proposed relationships in a market recently opened to competition. Using longitudinal data for a sample of 650 mobile phone consumers and a split-population hazard model that accounts for the notion that some customers are never at risk of defection, the authors show that both the focal firm's (incumbent) and the competitors' price and mass advertising exert a significant influence on the probability of terminating an existing incumbent relationship. They find that the relationships between marketing variables and retention are not static but vary over time. Price is generally less effective in the early stages of market liberalization, which suggests that customers become more price sensitive in later stages. Finally, the study findings can have important strategic implications on designing customer management and marketing resource allocation strategies, as well as on providing a competitive regulatory framework in liberalizing markets.

TI Do Interruptions Pay off? Effects of Interruptive Ads on Consumers'
   Willingness to Pay
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We present the results of a study designed to measure the impact of interruptive advertising on consumers' willingness to pay for products bearing the advertiser's brand. Subjects participating in a controlled experiment were exposed to ads that diverted their attention from a computer game they were testing. We measured subjects' willingness to pay for a good associated with the advertised brand. We found that the ads significantly lowered the willingness to pay for goods associated with the advertising brand. We do not find conclusive evidence that providing some level of user control over the appearance of ads mitigates the negative impact of ad interruption. Our results contribute to the research on the economic impact of advertising, and introduce a method of measuring actual (as opposed to self-reported) willingness to pay in experimental marketing research.

TI The Effect of Social Cues on Sniping Behavior in Internet Auctions:
   Field Evidence and a Lab Experiment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This research explores how social cues presented in an online auction affect sniping behavior. Sniping is a strategy of placing a bid on an item in the very ending stages of an auction with a pre-determined ending time in an attempt to win the auction. Such a strategy conceals the intentions of the bidder until the last moments of the auction and minimizes the possibility of other opposing bidders submitting higher bids due to the short period of time left to respond. The research includes two field studies and a lab experiment indicating that sniping appears to be influenced by social factors, that is, when there are a greater number of bidders in the auction or the auction site provides social information about the bidders, the relative use of sniping increases. This research supports the perspective that bidders rely on others' bidding behavior and characteristics as an indication of the true value of the item on sale, and is one of the first studies in the literature which takes this perspective.

   Book Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Using book review data on Amazon.com, the authors extend current research into online consumer reviews by empirically investigating the context dependence effect in the review writing process. They find that when product quality remains constant, later reviews tend to differ from previously posted ones, and the difference is moderated by the popularity of the product, the variance of previous reviews, whether later reviews explicitly refer to previous reviews, and the age of the product and the reviews. This phenomenon can be explained by both consumer expectation and self-selection effects in review writing. The implications of this research can help practitioners understand the reviewing process and provide some guidelines for improving the objectivity of online product reviews.

TI Effect of Consumer Beliefs on Online Purchase Behavior: The Influence of
   Demographic Characteristics and Consumption Values
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The three most common beliefs that consumers have about shopping online are that it saves time, saves money and helps find products that best match needs. But how do these beliefs, either individually or in combination, influence online purchase behavior? The premise of the article is that the effect of beliefs on online purchase behavior is moderated by demographic characteristics such as income, education, and generational age, and by consumption values such as the inclination to consider many alternatives before making a choice, the enjoyment of shopping, and the tendency to research products prior to making a purchase. The findings on how beliefs and consumption values influence purchase behavior can assist online retailers formulate product positioning strategies that create more value for consumer segments through better customization, thereby enhancing retailer profits. The findings can also help public policy makers design communication strategies to help lower-income consumers realize the same benefits of e-commerce as their higher-income counterparts.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The purpose of this study is to assess the possibility of implementing an online advertising strategy using a well-known third-party privacy seal located on the order page of an unfamiliar online retailer. An online experiment was conducted with 223 participants using a 2 (third-party seal: present vs. absent) x 2 (purchase-decision involvement: low vs. high) x 2 (disposition to trust: low vs. high) x 2 (privacy-protection self-efficacy: low vs. high) between-subjects design. The results provide evidence of trust transference from a well-known third-party seal to an unfamiliar retailer website, indicating that seal presence raised initial trust in the website and that the effects of seal presence were mediated by perceived privacy empowerment. Results also indicate that the seal effects were moderated by the level of purchase-decision involvement, disposition to trust, and self-efficacy. Theoretical explanations and managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2010 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The Effect of the Number of Product Subcategories on Perceived Variety
   and Shopping Experience in an Online Store
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study tested whether organizing the same number of products in different ways on an online store's website influences attitudes toward the store. The pilot study revealed that when the products were sorted into more subcategories (9 as opposed to 3), such that more subcategory options appeared in the selection menu, participants perceived that the website offered a greater variety of products and experienced greater ease of navigation and shopping pleasure, which improved their attitudes toward the online store. The next experiment tested the same effect but with three subcategory quantities (18, 9, and 3) while also considering the moderating effect of choice uncertainty (high versus low) in two processing contexts (buying versus browsing). The more subcategory options, the greater consumers' perceived variety. However, the influence of the number of subcategory options on ease of navigation, shopping pleasure, attitudes toward the store, and future purchase intentions indicated an inverted U-shaped pattern; moreover, the influence was significant only among participants with low rather than high choice uncertainty. This article concludes with implications for online marketing. (C) 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Relationships among Brand Identity, Brand Image and Brand Preference:
   Differences between Cyber and Extension Retail Brands over Time
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study examines the relationships among brand identity, brand image, and brand preference in the context of cyber (pure online) and offline-based extension (traditional brick-and-mortar to online) retail brands over time. We test a conceptual model with survey data gathered over three time periods. Our results show that offline-based extension brands have an advantage over cyber brands when it comes to translating a brand identity into a successful brand image, especially in the early Internet stages (i.e., introduction and elaboration stages). Offline-based extension brands gain positive spillover effects from their offline-based counterparts, but such effects take time, and are not evident in the early Internet stage. Both types of brands have to work hard in the introductory stage to create a successful brand image that manifests into consumer preference for the brand. With regards to Internet use, we found that cyber brands have a slight disadvantage when moving from the elaboration stage to the fortification stage.

TI A Note on Willingness to Spend and Customer Lifetime Value for Firms
   with Limited Capacity
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The paper draws a distinction between customer lifetime value (CLV) and willingness to spend (WTS). By WTS we mean the maximum amount the firm should be willing to spend to acquire (retain) the customer relationship. In order to avoid the double counting of cash flows when summing the CLVs of customers, we suggest including only direct cash flows in the formulation of CLV. This convention means that CLV will equal WTS if (and, for the most part, only if) the firm's relationships with customers are independent. By independent we mean that the acquisition (retention) of Jane Doe has no effect on the cash flows of any other current or future customers. In contrast to well-understood demand-side dependencies among customer relationships (such as referrals), this paper highlights a particular kind of supply-side dependency-that created when the firm is limited in the number of customers it can serve. Using an extended version of the model of Blattberg and Deighton ("Manage Marketing by the Customer Equity Test," Harvard Business Review, July-August 1996, 136-144) of customer equity, we demonstrate that, for a firm at capacity (in this model), CLV is no longer relevant to marketing spending decisions and the firm can prefer a lower-CLV customer.

TI How Much Can You Trust Online Information? Cues for Perceived
   Trustworthiness of Consumer-generated Online Information
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers increasingly rely on the Internet to obtain product information and advice from other consumers. However, since the information available on the Internet is easily manipulated, they have to seek cues for the trustworthiness of the online information. The present study proposes and tests the effects on perceived trust of online information and subsequent attitude of (1) perceived strong vs. weak social relationships among net pals and (2) positive vs. negative messages. The moderating effects of credence vs. experience goods are also examined in the research. Results show that, for experience goods, either positive or negative online messages will be perceived as credible as long as the messages are posted by those perceived to have close social relationships. On the other hand, for credence goods, negative online messages are perceived to be more credible than positive online messages when the messages are posted by those perceived to have close social relationships. Results also show the main effect of positive/negative messages on credibility of information, as well as that the effect of credibility of information on product attitude is weaker in the credence goods group than in the experience goods group.

TI Advertising: Stimulant or Suppressant of Online Word of Mouth?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Word of mouth by consumers is attracting increased attention from marketing scholars because of findings that it can affect brand perceptions and sales. There is limited empirical research, however, on the stimulants of consumer word of mouth. An assumption in the literature has been that increased advertising can also stimulate consumer word of mouth and, hence, complement the effects of advertising. We present arguments for why increased advertising may be associated with reductions in online word of mouth. We empirically test this possibility on online word of mouth in the auto industry. Our results suggest that increased advertising can, indeed, be associated with reductions in online consumer word of mouth. (C) 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Do Price Charts Provided by Online Shopbots Influence Price Expectations
   and Purchase Timing Decisions?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online price comparison sites (shopbots) like PriceGrabber.com are the most powerful tools for consumers to easily compare prices and find offers for desired products. Besides providing distributions of actual prices in price comparison tables, shopbots like NexTag.com have recently introduced price charts (line charts) displaying a product's full price history. Price charts should support consumers in forming expectations about future prices. Nevertheless, it is currently unclear how price charts influence consumer price expectations and purchase decisions. The results of this study show that the provision of past prices leads to strong adjustments of price expectations depending on price chart characteristics. In particular, the trend, variance and range of past prices in the chart strongly affect price expectations and purchase timing decisions. Furthermore, in the case of a strong downward trend and high variance in past prices, results show that nearly 50% of the total effect is caused by the visualization of the price history.

TI Decision Quality Measures in Recommendation Agents Research
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Electronic recommendation agents provide a way for online marketers to gather information about consumer preferences and assess the quality of consumer decisions. Much of the literature on recommendation agents, however, employs divergent measures to assess consumer decision quality. Moreover, decision quality measures are dictated by the type of agent employed. This article provides a review of the decision quality measures used in the recommendation agent research to date and proposes novel measures. We classify and examine the assumptions of and relationships among preference-dependent, preference-independent, and subjective measures of decision quality. The analysis of data from an experiment that simulates a broad spectrum of recommendation agents shows that the relative utility and the sum of attribute values of the chosen alternative capture the majority of variance in objective decision quality. Although subjective decision quality measures turn out to be poor proxies for objective measures, they provide important incremental information. Managerial implications for deploying electronic recommendation agents to gather information and measure consumer decision quality under different conditions are discussed.

TI The Role of Marketing in Social Media: How Online Consumer Reviews
   Evolve
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Social media provide an unparalleled platform for consumers to publicize their personal evaluations of purchased products and thus facilitate word-of-mouth communication. This paper examines relationships between consumer posting behavior and marketing variables-such as product price and quality-and explores how these relationships evolve as the Internet and consumer review websites attract more universal acceptance. Based on automobile-model data from several leading online consumer review sources that were collected in 2001 and 2008, this study demonstrates that the relationships between marketing variables and consumer online-posting behavior are different at the early and mature stages of Internet usage. For instance, in the early stage of consumer Internet usage, price is negatively correlated with the propensity to post a review. As consumer Internet usage becomes prevalent, however, the relationship between price and the number of online consumer reviews shifts to a U-shape. In contrast, in the early years, price has a U-shaped relationship with overall consumer rating, but this correlation between price and overall rating becomes less significant in the later period. Such differences at the two different stages of Internet usage can be driven by different groups of consumers with different motivations for online review posting.

TI On Estimating Current-Customer Equity Using Company Summary Data
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper considers how to use company reported summary data to estimate current-customer equity, taken here to mean the sum of the customer lifetime values of the firm's current customer relationships. It offers general guidance about how to estimate retention rate and revenue per renewal when the reporting period spans multiple renewal periods (as, for example, when summary data are reported quarterly but customers pay and renew on a monthly basis). The paper goes on to show that traditional retention rate and revenue estimates based on the average number of customers are biased low when acquisition rates are low and vice versa. In addition, the paper demonstrates that monthly, quarterly, and annual models for customer lifetime value are not equivalent even though there exist annual, quarterly, and monthly retention and discount rates that are equivalent. The suggested improvements for estimating the equity of current customers are demonstrated first using a previously published illustrative example and then using company summary data from Netflix, Inc. For the illustrative example, the improvements make a substantial difference in the estimate of current-customer equity (15% and 25% for the two periods) despite being straightforward and somewhat obvious in retrospect.

TI Improving Campaign Success Rate by Tailoring Donation Requests along the
   Donor Lifecycle
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Since charitable fundraising relies heavily on direct mail, this paper studies how tailoring donation requests along the donor lifecycle could improve campaign success rate. Our field study provides a unique combination of three parameters whose combined interaction has not been studied to this date: donor segment, suggested personalized donation amount and social comparison, resulting in a 3 x 3 x 2 between-subjects design. Taking into account the donor's zone of acceptable prices, we show that for acquiring and reactivating donors the use of a recently suggested donation amount is most effective, whereas for retaining donors, it is preferred to use an average amount. Our results also demonstrate that social comparison is an excellent acquisition strategy, but that it could be harmful when reactivating lapsed donors. Social comparison was not found to have an effect on the donation behavior of current donors. (C) 2010 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Strategic Herding Behavior in Peer-to-Peer Loan Auctions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loan auctions enable individual consumers to borrow and lend money directly to one another. We study herding behavior, defined as a greater likelihood of bidding in auctions with more existing bids, in P2P loan auctions on Prosper.com. The results of an empirical study provide evidence of strategic herding behavior by lenders such that they have a greater likelihood of bidding on an auction with more bids (a 1% increase in the number of bids increases the likelihood of an additional bid by 15%), but only to the point at which it has received full funding. Alter this point, herding diminishes (a 1% increase in bids increases the likelihood of an additional bid by only 5%). We also find a positive association between herding in the loan auction and its subsequent performance, that is, whether borrowers pay the money back on time. Unlike eBay auctions where herding impacts bidders adversely, our findings reveal that strategic herding behavior in P2P loan auctions benefits bidders, individually and collectively.

Using a novel mixed-method approach and consenting participants, the authors generated digital brand audits of 12 people and asked undergraduate students and a human resources professional to judge their profiles (made anonymous), both qualitatively and quantitatively. After comparing these evaluations with participants' own judgments of their online profiles, the authors conducted long interviews to understand how people manage online profiles and feel about others' judgment of the content they post. According to these results, people engage in personal branding, though their efforts are often misdirected or insufficient. They consider personal online branding challenging, especially, during life changes or when managing multiple audiences. (C) 2010 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI The Differential Effects of Online Word-of-Mouth and Critics' Reviews on
   Pre-release Movie Evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In this paper, we examine the persuasive influences of online user comments (or word-of-mouth) and of the reviews by movie critics on moviegoers' evaluation of to-be-released movies. Two distinctive features of this study are: (I) moviegoers are considered to be heterogeneous in their movie going frequency and (2) word-of-mouth and critical reviews are concurrently available, and the views expressed in the two messages are in conflict. Using three experiments with natural stimuli, we find that the persuasive effect of online word-of-mouth is stronger on infrequent than on frequent moviegoers, especially when it is negative (Study 1). The effect of negative word-of-mouth on infrequent moviegoers is enduring even in the presence of positive reviews by movie critics (Study 2). The relative influence of word-of-mouth and critical reviews are asymmetric with infrequent moviegoers more influenced by word-of-mouth, while frequent moviegoers more influenced by the reviews (Study 3). We validate this source segment alignment through secondary data analysis. (C) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We examine two methods, logit models and classification trees, both with and without applying a bagging procedure. Bagging consists of averaging the results of multiple models that have each been estimated on a bootstrap sample from the original sample. We test the models using customer data of two firms from different industries, namely the internet service provider and insurance markets. The results show that the classification tree in combination with a bagging procedure outperforms the other three methods. It is shown that the ability to identify high risk customers of this model is similar for the in-period and one-period-ahead forecasts. However, for all methods the staying power is rather low, as the predictive performance deteriorates considerably within a few periods after the estimation period. This is due to the fact that both the parameter estimates change over time and the fact that the variables that are significant differ between periods. Our findings indicate that chum models should be adapted regularly. We provide a framework for database analysts to reconsider their methods used for churn modeling and to assess for how long they can use an estimated model.

TI Managing the Quality of Marketing Data: Cost/benefit Tradeoffs and
   Optimal Configuration
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB A large majority of work in database marketing deals with what to do with data when it is available. This paper focuses on an aspect of data that has not been visited frequently in the database/interactive marketing literature-managing the quality of data resources from a profit point of view. While costly to achieve and sustain, high data quality is essential for effective database marketing. The notion that "more is better" very often prevails in data quality management decisions, essentially with very little consideration, if any, of cost. This paper suggests that data quality management decisions should be driven by considerations of cost benefit tradeoffs and profit maximization. It specifically addresses data quality decisions which are highly relevant in the database marketing area: the subset of data records managed, reflecting time-span coverage, and the targeted quality levels in this subset. Decisions of these types are routinely made based on satisfying technical and functional requirements. In this study, we propose a model that quantifies the benefits and the costs associated with these decisions, and permits optimizing them from a profit maximization standpoint. The paper describes the model development, discusses its implications for data quality management decisions, and highlights its potential contributions with illustrative examples.

TI Context-general and Context-specific Determinants of Online Satisfaction
   and Loyalty for Commerce and Content Sites
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We use the context-general and context-specific factor approach to examine the generalizability of satisfaction and loyalty models across two disparate online contexts-online retailing and content site browsing. Our conceptual models include the moderating effects of user-characteristic Web expertise, besides main effects of Web site factors and Web expertise. Results indicate that satisfaction and loyalty judgments are sensitive to both context-general and context-specific determinants, as well as to some interactions between them. Among context-general determinants, ease of use and customer service are positively related to satisfaction, Web community to loyalty, and Web expertise to both satisfaction and loyalty. Flow, a context-specific determinant, has a significant positive effect on satisfaction alone; security affects loyalty alone; and fulfillment/reliability and information quality are significant predictors of both satisfaction and loyalty. The results show that Web expertise moderates the effect of ease of use on satisfaction. The study contributes to marketing theory and practice by identifying satisfaction and loyalty mechanisms that are potentially generalizable across the two online contexts and providing a guiding framework for simultaneous consideration of context-specific and context-general factors in future research.

TI Determinants of Participation and Response Effort in Web Panel Surveys
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Web panels are widely employed to conduct marketing research surveys, yet little is known regarding why consumers join web panels or participate in web surveys. The present research investigated the effects of individuals' motivational traits on whether they joined web panels, participated in surveys upon joining, and the effort they put into their responses. A longitudinal study employing population profiling gathered personality measures from the entire population of potential panelists (N=751) and invited them to join a web panel. Those accepting (N=503) were sent a series of six marketing research surveys. Results revealed that consumers' need for cognition, curiosity, agreeableness and extraversion were significant predictors of joining the web panel. The first three traits also predicted survey participation, as did openness to experience. Among participants, response effort was affected the greatest by curiosity, extraversion, and conscientiousness. An additional experiment, conducted with 327 participants, ruled out a selection bias explanation for some results. These findings provide useful insights to researchers using web panels, and point out limitations with using strictly demographics-based weighting schemes when selecting web panels.

TI A Customer Lifetime Value-Based Approach to Marketing in the
   Multichannel, Multimedia Retailing Environment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper proposes a multichannel, multimedia communications framework based on the concept of Customer Lifetime Value. The framework begins with customer information from the company's database, segments the customers based on the value they provide to the company, and advocates sending targeted messages using differentiated modes of communication. The framework also closes the communication loop by identifying the appropriate modes of inbound communication for the four customer segments ("Icons," "Go-Getters," "Opulents," and "Misers"), and proposes customized firm responses based on the nature/purpose of the inbound communication call. The article presents this framework in both B2C and B2B settings, offers managerial implications for implementing this framework and outlines future research directions.

TI Consumer Behavior in a Multichannel, Multimedia Retailing Environment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Over the past decade, multichannel, multimedia retailing environments have grown in variety, scope, and sophistication. However, research regarding the implications of this trend for consumer behavior is rather scarce. We seek to address this need by providing a comprehensive yet flexible approach for formulating promising consumer behavior-related research questions based in multichannel, multimedia retailing environments. This approach adopts a consumer-centric view of multichannel, multimedia retailing and identifies a number of important dimensions of this environment. We then illustrate how this approach could be applied via specific examples involving consumer memory, product assortment, and information acquisition. We conclude by considering the managerial implications of our proposed approach. (C) 2010 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Interactive Technologies and Retailing Strategy: A Review, Conceptual
   Framework and Future Research Directions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB During the past decade, a number of interactive technologies, including the Internet, have fundamentally transformed how retailers compete in the marketplace. In a similar vein, emerging interactive technologies can be expected to significantly alter the retailing landscape through their impact on retailing strategy and operations. Furthermore, it is conceivable that certain emerging interactive technologies will be perceived by some retailers as enablers (tools to more effectively compete in the marketplace) and by other retailers as disruptors of the present ways of doing business. Interactive technologies can either be generic, a technology that is readily available from an information technology (IT) vendor and is widely adopted by retailers, or proprietary. An interactive technology that is proprietary can enable a firm to generate economic rents from the innovation for an extended duration of time. Investing in a generic interactive technology, however, may be perceived as a cost of doing business for a retailer, and not a potential source of sustainable competitive advantage. However, a retailer's complementary resource endowments may enable the retailer to more effectively leverage a generic technology relative to its competitors and thereby achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. In this paper, we review the related literature, develop a process model delineating the mechanisms by which an interactive technology can affect and necessitate changes in retailers' strategies and identify directions for future research.

TI Mobile Marketing in the Retailing Environment: Current Insights and
   Future Research Avenues
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Mobile marketing, which involves two- or multi-way communication and promotion of an offer between a firm and its customers using the mobile, a term that refers to the mobile medium, device, channel, or technology, is growing in importance in the retailing environment. It has the potential to change the paradigm of retailing from one based on consumers entering the retailing environment to retailers entering the consumer's environment through anytime, anywhere mobile devices. We propose a conceptual framework that comprises three key entities: the consumer, the mobile, and the retailer. The framework addresses key related issues such as mobile consumer activities, mobile consumer segments, mobile adoption enablers and inhibitors, key mobile properties, key retailer mobile marketing activities and competition. We also address successful retailer mobile marketing strategies, identify the customer-related and organizational challenges on this topic, and outline future research scenarios and avenues related to these issues.

TI Estimating Contagion on the Internet: Evidence from the Diffusion of
   Digital/Information Products
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Even as the Internet continues to grow as a global platform for communication and commerce, the success of new value offerings on the Internet hinges oil acquisition of new customers and retention of existing customers. Central to the flow of customers in and out of trial and repeat behavior in this burgeoning and dynamic environment, characterized by diversity among both producers and consumers of value offerings, is the process of social contagion-active word of mouth that flows among customers or passive observation of others. To estimate contagion on the Internet, the authors develop a trial-repeat purchase diffusion model for successive innovations in value offerings on the Internet. The model extends the state-of-the-art diffusion modeling by incorporating (i) dynamic market potential, (ii) heterogeneity among first-time triers, (iii) heterogeneity in word of mouth due to repeat buyers and non-repeaters (i.e., positive and negative word of mouth), and (iv) dynamic repeat purchase rate. The model also incorporates the influence of product characteristics, specifically source of innovation (i.e., whether the innovation is driven by environmental needs or competitive pressures) and product bundling, and competition. The authors test the model with weekly adoption data for 11 computer soft-ware products available on the shareware system, involving over 100 new versions in the period 1991-1994, and in a market whose size grows by a factor of fifty from early 1991 to late 1994. The findings clarify the role of word of mouth effects, competition, and product characteristics in fostering the diffusion process for digital information goods.

The analysis considers size as a moderator for the relationships between constructs, comparing small and large web-based brand communities. Findings highlight that small communities operate differently from larger ones with regard to numerous aspects, and possess specific strengths and weaknesses. Members of small communities develop higher community loyalty; brand loyalty in small community stems more from community loyalty than from brand affect; small communities engage in word of mouth for the community more than in word of mouth for the brand.

TI More than Words: On the Importance of Picture-Text Congruence in the
   Online Environment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper addresses effects of picture-text congruence in the online environment on consumer response. Based on recent theorizing on processing fluency, it is argued that congruence among symbolic meanings connoted by pictorial and textual elements of web design increases processing fluency, in turn enhancing attitude fort-nation. Since symbolic meaning integration requires elaborate processing, the influence of individual differences reflecting consumers' information processing is discussed and predictions are formulated. An experimental study was conducted requiring participants to evaluate an online hotel booking site in which symbolic meanings connoted by hotel appearance and hotel description either matched or mismatched. Results show that picture-text congruence positively affects product attitude via processing fluency but only so for participants high in need for cognition. These findings indicate that picture-text congruence in web design may impact consumer response, thereby highlighting the importance of careful consideration of the online environment.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Most companies use their websites to promote themselves, their products, and their services; these sites provide ever-increasing amounts of information. This paper examines the effects of the amount of information provided on a website on consumers' processing and attitudes. We propose that the amount of information has differential effects on consumers' information processing and attitudes. The influence of need for cognition is also examined. In our study, we create an experimental website with three versions, with each version providing different amounts of information. Results indicate that while information processing diminishes under high levels of information, attitudes remain favorable. In addition, the individual's need for cognition moderates the influence of the amount of information on both consumer information processing and attitudes.

TI Semi-Supervised Response Modeling
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Response modeling is concerned with identifying potential customers who are likely to purchase a promoted product, based on customers' demographic and behavioral data. Constructing a response model requires a preliminary campaign result database. Customers who responded to the campaign are labeled as respondents while those who did not are labeled as non-respondents. Those customers who were not chosen for the preliminary campaign do not have labels, and thus are called unlabeled. Then, using only those labeled customer data, a classification model is built in the supervised learning framework to predict all existing customers. However, often in response modeling, only a small part of customers are labeled, and thus available for model building, while a large number of unlabeled data may give valuable information. As a method to exploit the unlabeled data, we introduce semi-supervised learning to the interactive marketing community. A case study on the CoIL Challenge 2000 and the Direct Marketing Educational Foundation data sets shows that the transductive support vector machine, one of widely used semi-supervised models, can identify more respondents than conventional supervised models, especially when a small number of data are labeled. Semi-supervised learning is a viable alternative and merits further investigation. (C) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All fights reserved.

TI A Hierarchical Marketing Communications Model of Online and Offline
   Media Synergies
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We propose a new hierarchical model of online and offline advertising. This model incorporates within-media synergies and cross-media synergies and allows higher-order interactions among various media. We derive the optimal spending on each medium and the optimal total budget. We also develop three hypotheses on the effects of within- and across-media synergies on both the total budget and its allocation. We estimate media effectiveness as well as the within- and cross-media synergies of offline (television, print, and radio) and online (banners and search) ads using market data for a car brand. We show that both types of synergies -within-media (i.e., intra-offline) and cross-media (online-offline)-exist. We show how within- and cross-media synergies boost the total media budget and online spending due to synergies of the online media with various offline media.

TI Does Chatter Matter? The Impact of User-Generated Content on Music Sales
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The Internet has enabled a new era of user-generated content, threatening the hegemony of traditional content generators as the primary sources of "legitimate" information. In this study, we examine the usefulness of such content, consisting of data from blogs and social networking sites, in predicting sales in the music industry. We track changes in online chatter for a sample of 108 albums for four weeks before and after their release dates. We identify the significance of variables on the observation date in predicting future album unit sales one, two, and three weeks ahead. Our findings are that future sales are positively correlated with (a) the volume of blog posts about an album, and (b) traditional factors such as whether the album is released by a major label and reviews from mainstream sources like Rolling Stone. More generally, the study provides some preliminary answers for marketing managers interested in assessing the relative importance of the burgeoning number of "Web 2.0" information metrics that are becoming available on the Internet. The study also provides a framework for thinking about when user-generated content influences decision making. (C) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Factors Influencing Consumer Acceptance of Mobile Marketing: A
   Two-Country Study of Youth Markets
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The purpose of this study is to examine factors affecting consumers' acceptance of mobile marketing across two global markets. Drawing upon technology acceptance and uses and gratifications theories, we develop and estimate a conceptual model of the influences of antecedent factors (including risk acceptance related to the mobile platform and personal attachment related to mobile devices) on behavioral intent related to mobile marketing practice. We further propose that the above relationships are mediated by activities that consumers engage in such as downloading, forwarding content and registering with firms. Focusing on youth consumers, we empirically test the model using data collected in both an established (U.S.) and an emerging market (Pakistan). Findings across these two markets reflect cross-market similarities and differences related to consumer acceptance factors. We draw implications from these findings related to both theory and practice. (C) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We discuss consumer engagement with a website, provide a systematic approach to examining the types of engagement produced by specific experiences, and show that engagement with the media context increases advertising effectiveness. Based on experiments using measurement scales involving eight different online experiences, we advance two types of engagement with online media - Personal and Social-Interactive Engagement. Our results show that both types are positively associated with advertising effectiveness. Moreover, Social-Interactive Engagement, which is more uniquely characteristic of the web as a medium, is shown to affect advertising after controlling for Personal Engagement. Our results offer online companies and advertisers new metrics and advertising strategies. (C) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Antecedents of Online Reviews' Usage and Purchase Influence: An
   Empirical Comparison of US and Korean Consumers
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We propose a model linking consumer characteristics (consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence and Internet shopping experience), attitude toward online reviews (perceived usefulness), and the outcome of online reviews (usage frequency and purchase influence). We advance hypotheses on the interrelationships among these factors and on the moderating effects of national culture on some of the relationships. We test the hypotheses on survey data collected from U.S. and Korean consumers. The results show that national culture has important moderating effects on the relationships among online reviews and its antecedents. The results suggest that an attitude-oriented marketing communication strategy is more effective for Korean consumers while a behavior-oriented strategy is more effective for U.S. consumers.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
CT Marketing Science 2007 Conference
CY 2007
CL Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB Academic research has focused on the quality perceptions that drive customer satisfaction as the key to achieving e-service success. This paper develops a process-based model that relates perceptions of managerially actionable site characteristics to online satisfaction, which mediates the effects of site characteristics on intention to recommend e-services. A unique data set provided by Web Mystery Shoppers International Inc. (webmysteryshoppers.com), a market research supplier, enables the model to be refined using data from samples of responses to each of the competitive websites for one financial service, and then to be tested using similar data for another financial e-service and then for a travel e-service. The model, which accounts for most of the variance in online satisfaction and online intention to recommend in the fitted data, is largely confirmed on cross validation. Process evaluations and satisfaction mediate the effects of actionable website characteristics on intention to recommend e-services. (c) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

Analysis of data using structural equation modeling showed that among the website quality dimensions, interactivity, online completeness, ease of use, and entertainment significantly influence perceived information quality. Perceived information quality affects perceived value and loyalty intentions and perceived value influences loyalty intentions toward apparel retail websites. The post-hoc test revealed that entertainment and trust affect perceived value. Online completeness and entertainment were found to influence loyalty intentions. Strategic suggestions are provided for e-retailer improvement of website information quality, such as utilizing entertaining and engaging devices and designing their websites for consumer comprehension and enjoyment during the shopping experience.

TI The Roles of Modality Richness and Involvement in Shopping Behavior in
   3D Virtual Stores
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The rapid growth of e-commerce and consumers' increasing use of 3D virtual worlds to make purchases have rendered it important to understand how consumers develop their buying intentions in this novel context. Drawing from literature on modality richness, this study examined the effects of pre-experimental product involvement and the modality of marketing information presentation on consumers' product evaluations, buying intentions, and enjoyment of online shopping. The results of a 2x2 between-subjects experiment indicate significant interaction effects between modality richness and prior involvement. Consumers with low involvement are influenced by modality richness, whereas those with high involvement are not, thus confirming the moderating role of prior involvement for shopping behaviors inside 3D virtual environments. Managerial implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The Moderating Effects of Involvement on the Relationships Between
   Satisfaction, Trust and Commitment in e-Banking
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Most prior research into customer loyalty emphasizes the effects of the dimensions of online satisfaction and trust. However, research into how customer involvement moderates this relationship model - in the online environment - has been less than conclusive. On the basis of a satisfaction-trust-commitment model, and given that involvement is a significant precondition to customer loyalty, this paper explores the interaction effects of customer involvement on the evaluation of c-banking services.
   Empirical results were collected from an online survey in electronic financial forums, Usenet and mailing lists. Partial Least Squares (PLS) was used to estimate the parameters of the interaction effects model.
   The results support most of the hypotheses and, in particular, confirm the moderating role of customer involvement. The influence of online satisfaction on commitment was significantly stronger for highly involved users; conversely, the effect of satisfaction on trust was weaker. However, customer trust had a stronger effect on commitment for customers with high purchase involvement, and a weaker effect for highly ego-involved customers. The interaction role of customer involvement thus offers a more complete view of the satisfaction-trust-commitment model, providing an initial test of the efficacy of using involvement to understand online decisions. Implications for online marketing management and future research in this area are discussed. (c) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Reversing the Logic: The Path to Profitability through Relationship
   Marketing
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Many firms have experienced greater success through implementing relationship marketing strategies. This is achieved by gaining knowledge about their own customers through database marketing and about he general marketplace though marketing research. Over time, this has led firms to adopt a general framework which We call the conventional path to profitability. This conventional framework suggests that new product innovation leads to acquisition, acquisition combined with a rich experience leads to satisfaction, satisfaction leads to loyalty and customer retention, and loyalty/retention leads to profitability. However, we show that some of the links in the framework are weak based on both academic research and marketplace realities. Consequently, we reverse the logic of the conventional path to profitability. We introduce a new approach that starts the customer relationship management strategy with customer profitability and the notion that different customers should be rewarded and satisfied differently. In addition, we outline a strategy that relationship marketing firms can implement, leading to higher levels of customer profitability and offer directions for future research.

The frequency and monetary value of previous purchases generally have a positive effect on CLV although there are some contradictory findings in this regard. We identify additional issues that have received limited attention in the literature, but require further empirical study: the effects of pricing, earned rewards and promotions on CLV managing a sequence of contacts to maximize response rates and CLV, and whether CLV can be forecasted sufficiently accurately. We also discuss additional conceptual issues that merit further research. (C) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Customer-Based Valuation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Customer lifetime value (CLV) has emerged as an important metric to manage and grow customers. Marketing scholars have written many books and articles on this topic. However, most of this research has focused on tactical marketing decisions. While this is important, it is not enough to gain attention of senior managers who are concerned about firm level metrics such as stock price. To have greater impact marketing needs to go beyond brand-level profits to show the impact of marketing actions on firm profitability. In this paper we focus on customer lifetime value and its link to firm value. We discuss research that provides customer-based valuation of firms and suggest directions for future research.

TI Online Trust: State of the Art, New Frontiers, and Research Potential
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Online trust is growing in importance as a topic Of Study and its influence on Internet marketing strategies is increasing. "Online trust includes consumer perceptions of how the site would deliver on expectations, how believable the site's information is, and how much confidence the site commands." (Bart, Yakov, Venkatesh Shankar, Fareena Sultan, and Glen L. Urban [2005], "Are the Drivers and Role of Online Trust the Same for All Web Sites and Consumers? A Large-Scale Exploratory Empirical Study,"Journal of Marketing, 69(4), 133-152). In this article, we review advances in online trust research based on an overarching framework, outlining the key insights learned so far. These insights include: online trust extends beyond privacy and security, is closely connected to website design, its formation is an ongoing process, and is heterogeneous across individuals and products. We propose several ideas for future research relating to multiple aspects of online research, such as the longitudinal component, multichannel clement, global aspect, personalization and cross-disciplinary nature.

TI Interactivity's Unanticipated Consequences for Marketers and Marketing
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The digital interactive transformation in marketing is not unfolding, as some thought it would, on the model of direct marketing. That model anticipated that marketing, empowered by digital media using rich profiling data, would intrude ever more deeply and more precisely into consumer lives than broadcast media had been able to. Instead the transformation is unfolding on a model of consumer empowerment, in which consumers use digital media to communicate with one another and deal with marketing's intrusions, showing none of the passivity displayed by mass media audiences. This paper categorizes five roles for the interactive consumer and draws implications for marketing practice. It concludes that the balance of power over marketplace meaning-making is shifting from marketer to consumer to the extent that media usage migrates from broadcasting to interactivity. The new marketplace rewards more participatory, more sincere, and less directive marketing styles than the old. (C) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Marketing Strategy in an Internet-Enabled Environment: A Retrospective
   on the First Ten Years of JIM and a Prospective on the Next Ten Years
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB During the past decade, developments such as the rapid growth of the Internet, digitization of information products, and digitization of the information attributes of non-information products, has necessitated businesses to fundamentally rethink, as well as institute major changes in, their marketing strategies. Against this backdrop, we present a critical assessment of extant research on marketing strategy in an Internet-enabled environment viewed through the lens of research published in previous volumes of the Journal of Interactive Marketing (JIM), and speculate on the future of interactive marketing in the contexts of marketing practice, research in marketing and marketing education. Looking back, it is evident that marketing strategy and marketing operations have been transformed by the Internet in many ways. Looking ahead, it can be expected that marketing strategy and marketing operations will be even more extensively integrated and blended in the Internet-enabled market environment in the future.

TI Flow Online: Lessons Learned and Future Prospects
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Although the flow construct has been widely studied over the past decade in marketing and related fields, it has proven to be an elusive construct to measure and model. In this paper, we examine two of the most important themes in flow research in the last decade: the conceptualization and measurement of flow in online environments and the marketing outcomes of flow. In addition, while the unique characteristics of the Internet contributed to our belief that flow was an important construct for understanding consumer use of the Web in 1996, the environment of the Web itself has changed radically over the past decade. Thus, we consider the current context of the Internet, including virtual worlds, for the role and application of the flow construct, as well as important related constructs that will be useful for understanding compelling experiences in the contemporary online environment.

TI Probability Models for Customer-Base Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB As more firms begin to collect (and seek value from) richer customer-level datasets, a focus on the emerging concept of customer-base analysis is becoming increasingly common and critical. Such analyses include forward-looking projections ranging from aggregate-level sales trajectories to individual-level conditional expectations (which, in turn, can be used to derive estimates of customer lifetime value). We provide an overview of a class of parsimonious models (called probability models) that are well-suited to meet these rising challenges. We first present a taxonomy that captures some of the key distinctions across different kinds of business settings and customer relationships, and identify some of the unique modeling and measurement issues that arise across them. We then provide deeper coverage of these modeling issues, first for noncontractual settings (i.e., situations in which customer "death" is unobservable), then contractual ones (i.e., situations in which customer "death" can be observed). We review recent literature in these areas, highlighting substantive insights that arise from the research as well as the methods used to capture them. We focus on practical applications that use appropriately chosen data summaries (such as recency and frequency) and rely on commonly available software packages (such as Microsoft Excel).

Channels typically include the store, the Web, catalog, sales force, third party agency, call center and the like. In recent years, multichannel marketing has grown tremendously and is anticipated to grow even further. While we have developed a good understanding of certain issues such as the relative value of a multichannel customer over a single channel customer, several research and managerial questions still remain. We offer an overview of these emerging issues, present our future outlook, and suggest important avenues for future research. (C) 2009 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Interactive Services: A Framework, Synthesis and Research Directions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This article briefly reviews marketers' current knowledge about interactive services. It defines interactive services as services that have some form of customer-firm interaction in an environment characterized by any level of technology (i.e., a high or low technology environment). Customers may interact with the firm's physical elements (including technology), processes and people in both service creation and delivery. Consequently, customer participation directly influences service quality and behavioral outcomes (e.g., service usage, repeat purchase behavior and word-of-mouth) - as well as firm outcomes (efficiency, revenues and profits). Hence, a recurring theme throughout our article is that the nature of customer participation is critically important for the effective creation and delivery of interactive services. The article identifies key research areas and their relevance to managerial practice. This analysis yields a set of research questions that provides an agenda for future research.

TI Investigating cross-buying and customer loyalty
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Cross-buying (i.e., the purchase of products from multiple categories) has been associated with higher levels of customer retention, revenue generation, and loyalty. Despite these claims, debate remains as to whether cross-buying is an antecedent to such behaviors or if loyalty behaviors represent the antecedent, with cross-buying as a consequence. This research investigates the direction, strength, and nature of the relationship between customers' cross-buying behavior and associated behavioral outcomes by using a Granger-type causality modeling and two data sets. The authors determine that cross-buying is a consequence and not an antecedent of behavioral loyalty. Specifically, behavioral loyalty drives both the number of categories from which a person buys and the level of spending dispersion across those categories. These findings have significant implications for cross-selling strategies.

TI Investigating pricing solutions to combat spam: Postage stamp and bonded
   senders
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB E-mail is a powerful communication tool for marketers. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this tool is rapidly being eroded by spam. In response, one option now in play for legitimate marketers is to subscribe to services that charge postage for delivery of e-mail. This solution is consistent with economic theory and essentially amounts to a tax to reduce the supply of unwanted communications. However, it fails to harness the unique nature of the e-mail communication medium-namely, its "interactivity." A solution that utilizes the interactivity of the e-mail medium, but less commonly known, is bonded senders. It involves the posting of a bond with an intermediary that is forfeited if the recipient identifies the e-mail as an unwanted communication. Given the emergence of these two distinct pricing solutions, we ask: (1) What are the essential characteristics of each pricing solution? (2) Which pricing solution is superior? and (3) Is it sustainable without regulation? Our analytical findings reveal that the bonded senders solution dominates the postage stamp solution. Specifically, it allows marketers in more categories to participate and yields greater profit to each marketer. Surprisingly, despite offering these benefits to marketers, it also results in a lower amount of unwanted communications. Finally, incorporating the notion of rational expectations, we also find that only bonded senders emerge as a solution that is self-enforcing. Our analytical findings thus give pause to pure postage-type mechanisms but encourage investments in the bonded senders mechanism.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This research examines the impact of communication frequency on customer retention and spending and thus, ultimately, on a firm's Customer Equity (CE). We conduct an empirical study in the context of permission-based e-mail marketing in the entertainment industry and find that intercommunication timing has a dramatic impact on customer behavior. Message scheduling affects both attrition and the customer response and thus has a critical impact on the value of one's customer base. The impact of intercontact duration is asymmetric in that too long intercommunication time is less problematic than too short intercommunication time.

TI People are experience goods: Improving online dating with virtual dates
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We suggest that online dating frequently fails to meet user expectations because people, unlike many commodities available for purchase online, are experience goods: Daters wish to screen potential romantic partners by experiential attributes (such as sense of humor or rapport), but online dating Web sites force them to screen by searchable attributes (such as income or religion). We demonstrate that people spend too much time searching for options online for too little payoff in offline dates (Study 1), in part because users desire information about experiential attributes, but online dating Web sites contain primarily searchable attributes (Study 2). Finally, we introduce and beta test the Virtual Date, offering potential dating partners the opportunity to acquire experiential information by exploring a virtual environment in interactions analogous to real first dates (such as going to a museum), an online intervention that led to greater liking after offline meetings (Study 3).

TI THE EFFECTS OF REFERENCE PRICES ON BIDDING BEHAVIOR IN INTERACTIVE
   PRICING MECHANISMS
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We examine the effect of reference prices on consumer bidding behavior in interactive pricing mechanisms used in online retailing, e.g., auctions and name-your-own-price. We find significant influences of different reference price concepts on bid values. However, after controlling for internal and external reference prices, sellers only have a moderate ability to affect bid values via the provision of an advertised reference price. An exaggerated advertised reference price increases the bid value among consumers who consider it to be believable. However, its effect is reversed in the presence of an external reference price if consumers consider it unbelievable, decreasing bid values.

TI THE PERSUASIVENESS OF ONLINE SAFETY CUES: THE IMPACT OF PREVENTION FOCUS
   COMPATIBILITY OF WEB CONTENT ON CONSUMERS' RISK PERCEPTIONS, ATTITUDES,
   AND INTENTIONS
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Safety cues are frequently used in online stores to relieve consumers' risk perceptions concerning online purchases. This paper uses regulatory focus theory (RFT) to predict the persuasiveness of online safety cues. According to RFT (Higgins, 1997), people process information differently depending on whether they strive for achieving gains (promotion focus) or avoiding losses (prevention focus). The aim of the present study is to examine the impact of the regulatory focus compatibility of Web content on online consumer behavior. Using different online stores, two experiments show that the effect of online safety cues depends on the consumers' regulatory focus. A pilot study demonstrates that safety-oriented Web content lowers consumers' risk perceptions, but only when in a prevention focus. The main study replicates and extends this finding by showing that online safety cues both lower consumers' risk perceptions and engender more favorable attitudes and intentions, depending on the regulatory focus.

TI DETERMINING THE IMPACT OF INTERNET CHANNEL USE ON A CUSTOMER'S LIFETIME
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB In light of mature markets and increasing competitive pressure, retaining the existing customer base becomes crucial for the future success of a firm. As a consequence, firms are increasingly interested in understanding the factors influencing and driving customer retention. One factor that is hypothesized to have an impact on customer retention is the growing use of the Internet channel. Firms are interested in understanding whether and how the Internet use induces a change in customer retention.
   The aim of this paper is to empirically quantify the impact of Internet use on customer retention when accounting for potentially present self-selection. Furthermore,the paper will derive managerial implications on how to use customer channel migration to improve overall customer retention. The results of the empirical study indicate a strong positive impact of Internet use on customer retention. Hence, migrating customers to the Internet channel has the potential to increase overall retention rates.

TI COUPONS GOING WIRELESS: DETERMINANTS OF CONSUMER INTENTIONS TO REDEEM
   MOBILE COUPONS
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Firms are increasingly using the mobile media for communication and promotion and Short Message Service (SMS), in particular. This study investigates consumers' intentions to redeem mobile (m-) coupons. Results from a survey of 370 mobile phone users in Austria indicate that consumers' attitude toward and perceived control of m-coupons affect their intention to redeem such coupons. The effort involved in redeeming m-coupons strongly affects consumers' attitudes toward m-coupons, and fear of mobile spam influences consumers' perceived control with regard to commercial SMS. Value seekers are more sensitive to the effort involved in redeeming m-coupons and to mobile spam than are other consumers. The results suggest that firms should not overwhelm consumers with m-coupons, consider the usability of m-coupons in deciding the right offer, and educate their consumers about how to use the m-coupons.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This study examines the nature of online consumer-generated communications, focusing especially on consumer reviews of leading retail Web sites in South Korea and the U.S. The current investigation adopts a two-pronged approach that utilizes both the user control concept and a cross-cultural perspective. The active implementations of consumer review features in Korean Web sites found in this study indicate that people in high power distance countries can adopt information technology rapidly to facilitate horizontal communication. As a result, we were able to support and expand the traditional view looking at the differences between Northeast Asian business culture and Western business culture.

TI IMPROVING PREDICTIVE SCORING MODELS THROUGH MODEL AGGREGATION
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Scoring models predict responses to some contact that will be made in the future, helping an organization decide which customers to target. They are usually built from a single "proxy" contact from the past, for which responses have already been observed. This approach is risky because there could be differences between the proxy and future contact, and other exogenous factors could have changed. We propose averaging predictions from multiple scoring models and develop a rationale for this approach by showing under certain assumptions that the expected squared difference between the true responses to the future contact and the predicted values from the averaged model is less than or equal to the expected squared difference from a single previous contact. The improvement of the aggregated model over the single model increases as (1) the variation in effect sizes across contacts increases, (2) the number of averaged contacts increases, and (3) the variance of the effect estimates increases. We incorporate the effects of external factors in our model by weighting the coefficients with a general linear model (GLM). Using data from a retail catalog company and a nonprofit organization,we evaluate our model empirically by testing whether our assumptions hold, examine the extent of variation in slopes and predicted values across models build from various previous contacts, evaluate the amount of improvement over extant models in terms of prediction error and performance as measured by a gains table, and study how improvement depends on the number of averaged contacts. Conservative estimates suggest that our method could increase annual profits for the nonprofit organization by over a half-million dollars and tens of thousands of dollars for the small catalog company.

TI Unconscious processing of Web advertising: Effects on implicit memory,
   attitude toward the brand, and consideration set
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Consumers have become increasingly savvy about technology in recent years, and many of them ignore Web ads during online activities. In this context, measuring advertising effects based on the traditional cognitive models of information processing may undervalue the effectiveness of Web ads. This study experimentally examined the effects of unconscious processing of Web ads by manipulating the level of attention paid to the ad (directed vs. nondirected attention). Online advertisers should be encouraged by the findings of this study. The results suggest that, upon exposure to Web ads, consumers experience priming caused by implicit memory and build a more favorable attitude toward the advertised brand regardless of the levels of attention they paid to the advertisements. Furthermore, those who unconsciously processed Web ads did not remember seeing the ad explicitly, but they were more likely to include the advertised brand in the consideration set than those who had no exposure.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Free, content-oriented Web sites depend on advertising revenues that are based on the number of visitors to the site.To induce visitors to acquire information quickly, these sites present information items according to their popularity. We empirically examine two key determinants of a visitor's inter-acquisition time (popularity and the number of information items previously acquired by the visitor) using a hazard model estimated from data obtained from del.icio.us, a social bookmarking site. The results indicate that inter-acquisition times are longer for heavy users and for less popular information items. The results are relevant for other free content-providing sites such as cnet.corn and music.yahoo.com. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

TI Beyond trial: Consumer assimilation of electronic channels
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This paper explores the assimilation of electronic channels into consumers' routines. It proposes that consumer learning orientation for the product/service and the efficiency realized from channel use are essential determinants of post-trial assimilation and that assimilation reduces information ambiguity and improves consumers' sense of identity with the firm.These relationships are tested using data from a survey of online banking customers. The study reveals that consumer efficiency and learning orientation influence assimilation more strongly than some other determinants of consumer trial and that assimilation improves consumers' understanding of the service and facilitates a greater sense of identity with the firm. Theoretical implications are discussed and suggestions are presented on how managers can increase the rate of customer electronic channel assimilation and how to take strategic advantage of this.

TI Adoption of virtual try-on technology for online apparel shopping
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Virtual try-on technology (referred to in this article as Virtual Try-on) can deliver product information that is similar to the information obtained from direct product examination. In addition, the interactivity and customer involvement created by Virtual Try-on can enhance the entertainment value of the online shopping experience. We used focus group interviews and an online national survey to investigate online apparel shoppers' use of Virtual Try-on to reduce product risks and increase enjoyment in online shopping. We also examined the impact of two important external variables (innovativeness and technology anxiety) that are not included in the electronic Technology Acceptance Model (e-TAM) but were expected to influence adoption of Virtual Try-on and whether or not gender differences existed in the-Virtual-Try-on adoption process. We examined this dual (functional and hedonic) role of Virtual Try-on by applying a modified e-TAM model to the Virtual Try-on technology adoption process and tested model invariance among male and female shoppers using Virtual Try-on in a simulated online shopping experience. The extended research model was validated in the context of Virtual Try-on acloption.Technology anxiety and innovativeness had significant moderating effects on the relationship between attitude and use of Virtual Try-on technology; however, there was no significant gender difference in the overall adoption process for Virtual Try-on.

TI Achieving customer value from electronic channels through identity

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB How consumers feel about themselves technology-may have an important influence on their adoption and use of technology. Although research on electronic channels has shown that Web site and consumer characteristics are important predictors of consumer trust, researchers have not considered the role played by consumers' commitment to their identity as technology users. This paper explores whether consumer identity commitment and calculative commitment to electronic channels impact consumer use of electronic channels and perceived value from the service firm. More specifically, it examines whether these effects are mediated by trust in technology and trust in the firm. Using survey data from 834 consumers engaged in both offline and online banking, plus transaction frequency data supplied by a host firm, the study finds that identity commitment plays an important role in building consumer trust in technology and that calculative commitment increases transaction frequency directly, unmediated by trust in technology. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are explored. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.

Our work contributes in this direction by proposing a novel family of diffusion models that capture some of the unique aspects of the entertainment industry and testing their performance in the context of very early postrelease motion picture revenue forecasting. We show that the addition of online product review metrics to a benchmark model that includes prerelease marketing, theater availability and professional critic reviews substantially increases its forecasting accuracy; the forecasting accuracy of our best model outperforms that of several previously published models. In addition to its contributions in diffusion theory, our study reconciles some inconsistencies among previous studies with respect to what online review metrics are statistically significant in forecasting entertainment good sales.

The concept of network organization advocates flexible and open organizational structures that would improve coordination among organizational units and between firms. However, there is not yet empirical research on Internet coordination mechanisms and their implications for firm performance and service responsiveness. This study examines Internet coordination mechanisms and network organization characteristics that would improve service responsiveness and firm performance. Data for the study are obtained from a sample of 336 U.K.-based firms in the computer and electronic manufacturing industry. The main results suggest that Internet coordination mechanisms and network organization characteristics positively influence firm performance and service responsiveness. In addition,the results suggest that Internet coordination mechanisms gain further means to support coordination particularly through open systems and virtual channels.

TI Why are you telling me this? An examination into negative consumer
   reviews on the web
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Although word-of-mouth (WOM) is recognized as a powerful force in persuasion, we know little about the new communication phenomenon known as e-WOM. One of the main forms of e-WOM is the product reviews consumers post on different Web sites, and how this form of e-WOM stands up to this claim is yet unknown. For example, do consumers trust the accuracy of these reviews posted by anonymous reviewers, and, do readers trust negative and positive that people tend to weight negative reviews equally? Past research has shown that information more than positive information during evaluation. Through an observation study and two laboratory experiments, we investigate the existence of this negativity effect in e-WOM consumer reviews for utilitarian versus hedonic products,and investigate the influence of the reader's attributions regarding the reviewer's motivations on this. Both types of studies show that product type moderates the effect of review valence, and readers exhibit a negativity bias for utilitarian product reviews only. Furthermore,the lab studies show that the read er's attributions about the motivations of the reviewer mediate the effect of this moderation on their attitude about the review. We find that compared with the utilitarian case, readers of negative hedonic product reviews are more likely to attribute the negative opinions expressed, to the reviewer's internal (or non product related) reasons; and therefore are less likely to find the negative reviews useful. However, in the utilitarian case, readers' are more likely to attribute the reviewer's negative opinions to external (or product related) motivations, and therefore find negative reviews more useful than positive reviews on average.

Nevertheless, existing (offline) theory may be inappropriate to describe online WOM and its influence on evaluation and purchase. The authors report the results of a two-stage study aimed at investigating online WOM: a set of in-depth qualitative interviews followed by a social network analysis of a single online community. Combined, the results provide strong evidence that individuals behave as if Web sites themselves are primary "actors" in online social networks and that online communities can act as a social proxy for individual identification. The authors offer a conceptualization of online social networks which takes the Web site into account as an actor, an initial exploration of the concept of a consumer-Web site relationship, and a conceptual model of the,online interaction and information evaluation process.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB The Internet opens new opportunities for conducting pre-purchase information search. Lower search costs have been found to affect use of the Internet for this purpose. Benefits in terms of the large amounts of information available and freedom from physical contact with sales staff have also been found to affect the use of the Internet for information search positively. In this paper, low costs and benefits are put together in a model. The model was tested by means of structural equation modeling on a sample of Danish Internet users (n = 233). The main result is that the amount of Internet use affects use of the Internet for pre-purchase information search more than perceived low search costs and perceived availability of information. Further, the test of the model did not support that pleasure in shopping and a preference for personal contact to sales staff affect the use of the Internet for information search.

AB Evidence from traditional service settings shows that service quality is a major driver of customer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty, which ultimately lead to profitability. Regarding business on the Internet, many argue that trust and loyalty become even more important for long-term success. But does quality play the same influential role in the context of Web-based services, where it is said that price is king and competitors just one click away? In the present study, the authors develop a structural equation model that links Web-based service quality to a broad set of consequences. The model is tested with a large sample drawn from three different Web-based service domains. The results provide insights into the mechanisms leading from Web-based service quality to outcome variables. Specifically, they point to a multifaceted chain of effects, with trust playing a key mediating role.

Using the data presented in the case (a series of annual histograms showing the aggregate distribution of purchases for two different cohorts of customers newly "acquired" by a catalog marketer), it is a simple exercise to compute an estimate of "expected 5 year CLV." If we wish to arrive at an estimate of CLV that includes the customer's "life" beyond five years or are interested in, say, sorting out the purchasing process (while "alive") from the attrition process, we need to use a formal model of buying behavior that can be applied on such coarse data.
   To tackle this problem, we utilize the Pareto/NBD model developed by Schmittlein, Morrison, and Colombo (1987). However, existing analytical results do not allow us to estimate the model parameters using the data summaries presented in the case. We therefore derive an expression that enables us to do this. The resulting parameter estimates and subsequent calculations offer useful insights that could not have been obtained without the formal model. For instance, we were able to decompose the lifetime value into four factors, namely purchasing while active, dropout, surge in sales in the first year and monetary value of the average purchase. We observed a kind of "triple jeopardy" in that the more valuable cohort proved to be better on the three most critical factors.

TI In interactive marketing: The case of viral marketing at Plaxo
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB This, case study shows how interactive. marketing campaigns can be systematically fine-tuned and made more productive through adaptive experimentation experimentation in a viral marketing mentation. It details the use of adaptive experimentation in a viral marketing campaign at Plaxo Inc., a company that provides Internet-based updating of personal contact information. The experiences of Plaxo highlight that even for a,product that is amenable to viral marketing, growth is not guaranteed. To achieve a desired level of growth, Plaxo identified the product features that contributed to greater adoption conversion of recipients of its marketing message and improved them through continuous experimentation. To overcome potential negative side effects of aggressive viral growth, the company used a carefully crafted feedback loop via internet alert services that tapped into the blogging community. This practice allowed management to better under stand negative perceptions of the product and take timely corrective actions.

TI Customizing customization: A conceptual framework for interactive
   personalization
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Several scholars have proposed personalization models based on product variety breadth and the intensity of customer-firm interaction with a focus on marketing strategies ranging from basic product versioning to customerization and reverse marketing. However, some studies have shown that the explosion of product variety may generate information overload. Moreover, customers are highly heterogeneous in willingness and ability to interact with firms in personalization processes. This often results in consumer confusion and wasteful investments. To address this problem, we propose a conceptual framework of e-customer profiling for interactive personalization by distinguishing content (that is, expected customer benefits) and process (that is, expected degree of interaction) issues. The framework focuses on four general dimensions suggested by previous research as significant drivers of online customer heterogeneity: VALUE, KNOWLEDGE, ORIENTATION, and RELATIONSHIP QUALITY. We also present a preliminary test of the framework and derive directions for customer relationship management and future research.

TI The impact of consumer internet experience on channel preference and
   usage intentions across the different stages of the buying process
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB We investigate consumer preference for online versus offline purchasing of a complex service (home mortgage), across the three stages of purchasing namely, pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase. Our analysis of data from 300 consumers shows that (1) the offline channel is generally preferred over the online channel across all the stages, and (2) the channel usage intention in a particular stage is moderated by the consumer's Internet experience. Specifically, in both the pre- and post-purchase stages, the usage intention for the online channel is higher when consumers have more favorable Internet experience. In the purchase stage, consumers prefer the offline channel over the online channel, regardless of their Internet experience. Furthermore, we find that the drivers of channel preference are substantially different across the three buying stages due to (in)congruities between channel benefits desired and channel capabilities offered.

TI Interactions in virtual customer environments: Implications for product
   support and customer relationship management
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Virtual customer environments (VCE), which provide services ranging from online discussion forums to virtual design toolkits, enable firms to involve their customers in innovation and value creation. Evidently, companies can benefit from operating such VCEs; however, most firms do not seem to attach sufficient importance to the nature of customers' interactions in the VCE. In this study, we examine two critical implications of customers' interactions in a product-support focused VCE. First, we suggest that customers' perceptions of interaction-based benefits will shape their future participation in product support in the VCE. Second, customers' interactions will also generate changes in their affective states, and these, in turn, influence their attitude towards the firm. Our empirical work provides broad support for the study hypotheses and implies the need for firms to carefully design and implement VCEs that facilitate positive interaction experiences for customers. Implications with respect to customer value co-creation and customer relationship management are discussed.

TI Measuring the value of electronic word of mouth and its impact in
   consumer communities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Marketing practitioners have recognized a need to measure customer-generated media in addition to the traditional marketing metrics. Message boards, chat rooms, blogs, and virtual brand communities have become important venues for customer-generated media. These communities can be modeled as two distinct, albeit connected, networks: social and informational. These networks change over time under the influence of online word of mouth. This study introduces adapted PageRank (APR), a new metric for measuring the value of community assigns each word-of-mouth instance and the value the community assigns to the members that create them. That metric is used to empirically support a model explaining how highly valued information builds the social network. These communities are egalitarian in assigning value to informational content, without regard to the status of its source, and highly-valued content explains 10% of social network growth.
