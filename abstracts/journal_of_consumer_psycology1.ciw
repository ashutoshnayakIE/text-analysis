AB Although brand switching is one of the most researched topics in
   marketing, we still know very little about the moderators of switching
   between brands in different price-quality tiers (e.g., from Haagen-Dazs
   ice cream to Breyers or to a store brand). Building on the notion that
   buyers have a (category-specific) consideration set of price-quality
   tiers, we propose that sales promotions and the choice set composition
   (or the choice context) have compensatory effects on brand switching
   between price-quality tiers. Specifically, if one of these factors
   causes buyers to switch to a higher price-quality tier within their
   brand-tier consideration set, then the other factor is less likely to
   induce switching in the same direction (to an even higher tier) and more
   likely to induce switching in the opposite direction. This general
   proposition leads to several specific hypotheses, including (a) the
   likelihood of switching between particular brand tiers due to price
   promotions can be predicted based on the choice set composition; (b)
   asymmetric switching, whereby consumers are more likely to switch up
   from a low-tier to a promoted high-tier brand than from a high-tier to a
   promoted low-tier brand, is reduced or eliminated if consumers consider
   three price-quality tiers; and (c) the compromise effect is reduced when
   the lowest tier brand offers a price promotion. These hypotheses were
   supported in a series of studies, which also examined rival
   explanations. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings
   are discussed.

AB A recent debate in the Journal of Consumer Psychology illustrates many
   of the unresolved issues concerning the development and application of
   models to predict attitude. A central issue in the debate is whether a
   noncognitive factor, such as affect, may exert a direct influence on
   attitude, or whether its influence is mediated by the cognitive
   structure. We describe the results of two studies designed to determine
   (a) whether affect and attitude are separate constructs and (b) whether
   affect influences attitude independently of cognitive structure. The
   studies address the methodological criticisms levied against previous
   research and provide results to indicate that affect does influence
   attitudes directly and independently of cognitive structure.

AB Research has shown that an increase in perceived crowding in a retail
   store (created from either human or spatial density) can decrease the
   level of satisfaction that shoppers have with the store. The three
   studies reported here examine the retail crowding-satisfaction
   relationship to determine the extent to which it is a simple, direct
   relationship. Specifically, we consider the possibility that the
   crowding-satisfaction relationship is mediated by emotional reactions
   that are experienced while shopping. In addition, moderating variables
   such as prior expectations of crowding, tolerance for crowding, and
   store type are examined for their influence on the crowding-satisfaction
   relationship. The results of two field studies indicate that whereas
   emotions only partially mediate the relationship, the decrease in
   shopping satisfaction due to crowding is moderated by expectations of
   crowding and personal tolerance for crowding. A laboratory experiment
   replicated the field studies and shows, in addition, that although
   ceiling and floor effects may be present, the relationship between
   perceived crowding and shopping satisfaction appears to vary by store
   type.

AB A model context effects in product evaluations is tested in which brand
   alliances play a key role. This three-part study examined the extent to
   which evaluations of two restaurants are assimilated by virtue of their
   dual-branding strategic linkage. Key factors in the assimilation process
   are thought to be the ambiguity of the target restaurant's description
   and the degree of linkage between the target and the context as
   operationally defined by varying the shared features of the dual brands.
   Results support a model in which inferences about the qualities of an
   incompletely described target product arise from the assumed similarity
   between target and context, which is directly related to the degree of
   linkage between the two brands. These inferences include both specific
   attribute values and global evaluations of quality.

AB Past research on dual process models of persuasion has documented that,
   when faced with information incongruity, individuals tend to form
   product evaluations by attenuating the less diagnostic information,
   relying solely on the more diagnostic information. The current research
   suggests that this way of resolving incongruity may be culture specific.
   Consistent with recent research in cultural psychology, this study shows
   that individuals in a North American culture tend to follow the
   attenuation strategy, whereas individuals in an East Asian culture tend
   to follow an additive strategy in which both pieces of information are
   combined to jointly influence evaluations experiment 1). Experiments 2
   and 3 provide further support for the proposed psychological mechanism
   underlying these findings and also identify boundary conditions for
   these findings, implications for understanding choice mind-sets, the
   moderating role of justification on evaluations, and cultural
   limitations in incongruity resolution are discussed.

AB This study tested whether, among consumers in developing countries,
   brands perceived as having a nonlocal country of origin, especially from
   the West, are attitudinally preferred to brands seen as local, for
   reasons not only of perceived quality but also of social status. We
   found that this perceived brand nonlocalness effect was greater for
   consumers who have a greater admiration for lifestyles in economically
   developed countries, which is consistent with findings from the cultural
   anthropology literature. The effect was also found to be stronger for
   consumers who were high in susceptibility to normative influence and for
   product categories high in social signaling value. This effect was also
   moderated by product category familiarity, but not by consumer
   ethnocentrism. The results, thus, suggest that in developing countries,
   a brand's country of origin not only serves as a "quality halo" or
   summary of product quality (cf. Han, 1989), but also possesses a
   dimension of nonlocalness that, among some consumers and for some
   product categories, contributes to attitudinal liking for
   status-enhancing reasons.

AB This research examines how variations in consumers'
   connectedness-separateness (CS) self-schema, which refers to an
   individual's perceptions of others as an extension of self or of the
   self as distinct from others, may explain cultural and gender-level
   persuasion effects. Results from a cross-cultural experiment demonstrate
   that a connected advertising appeal stressing interdependence and
   togetherness results in more favorable brand attitudes among Chinese and
   women consumers than does a separated appeal stressing independence and
   autonomy. Conversely, a separated appeal results in more favorable
   attitudes among U.S. and male consumers. Most important, the results
   suggest that the interactions detected between ad appeal and culture, as
   well as between ad appeal and gender, are mediated by distinct
   dimensions of consumers' C-S. The self-orientation dimension of C-S is
   shown to account for cultural-level persuasion effects, whereas
   gender-level effects are attributable to the dependence dimension. Thus,
   individual differences in these dimensions compose an important factor
   in explaining cultural and gender variations in consumers' responses.

AB Focus group respondents are often requested to perform tasks that
   require them to convey information about themselves. However, despite
   the potential for respondents to have self-presentational concerns,
   research on focus group productivity has virtually ignored extant
   scholarship on impression management. This shortcoming is addressed by
   presenting a conceptual overview of the effects of self-presentational
   concerns on focus group participation. A product of this overview is a
   conceptual model that posits that the amount and nature of information
   that people convey about themselves to others is a function of their
   eagerness to make desired impressions and their subjective probabilities
   of doing so. According to the model, when focus group participants are
   highly motivated to make desired impressions, they may be reluctant to
   present unbiased images of themselves. However, they are not likely to
   deceive unless they are confident in their abilities to ascertain and
   enact desired images. Those who are motivated to make desired
   impressions but are doubtful of doing so are likely to protect
   themselves by concealing self-relevant information or avoiding
   self-relevant issues. Implications of this model for research and
   practice are discussed.

   shifts in valuation and changes in the choice shares. The model is also
   tested using 2 studies that extend the design of the choice sets to
   include better alternatives in a search context and the removal of an
   alternative. The strong relation justifies the case for comparative

   of gift literature and suggests their effects on the timing of
   dissolution for a romantic relationship. Products or services can be
   consumed for the purpose of enhancing self-attractiveness (self-gift),
   expressing love to partners (other-gift), and announcing a relationship
   to the outer world (joint-gift). Results indicate that the distribution
   of time until dissolution for young students' romantic relationships is
   more likely to first fall and then rise. Gifts can delay the timing of
   dissolution, but not the probability of its final destination. For
   female students, self-enhancing gifts are found to delay the timing; for
   male students, love-expressive gifts speed up the timing; and for both
   male and female students, relationship-announcing gifts delay the timing
   of dissolution. Consumers, thus, are advised to use gifts to make their
   relationships endure, but not to attempt to alter a poor relationship
   into a successful one.

AB Several studies have shown that consumer choice is often influenced by
   the context or the set of alternatives under consideration. Context
   effects have largely been explained in terms of constructive preferences
   that are consistent with 2 theoretical accounts-effort minimization and
   perceptual contrast-that emphasize different underlying motivations. We
   propose that the effect of time pressure on context effects can be used
   as a moderating variable to determine which of the 2 motives is
   supported. Specifically, if context effects bias preferences due to
   effort minimization, time pressure should increase the magnitude of such
   effects. In contrast, if context effects arise due to an excessive focus
   on the relational characteristics of the alternatives provided, time
   pressure should reduce the magnitude of such effects. We examine this
   proposition in relation to the compromise effect and a choice between an
   extreme and an all-average option. We find that the compromise effect
   and the preference for an all-average alternative are both reduced under
   time pressure. A study using Mouselab provides additional support for
   the underlying decision mechanisms. We discuss the theoretical
   implications of this research and explore its consequences for
   marketers.

   evaluating product information are modified after consumers have found
   that information they had received in the past was invalid. It shows
   that, following exposure to invalidating messages, respondents tend to
   switch their dominant mode of processing. In particular, those who
   focused on the source in making a judgment prior to invalidation (i.e.,
   those using simple processing) switch to a more complex processing of
   the product information. In contrast, those who previously relied on
   product information simplify their processing and consider information
   they have about the source in making judgments. The results are
   consistent with a cognitive resource explanation that attributes switch
   in processing mode to the enhanced cognitive demands imposed by attempts
   to cope with the invalidation.

AB Prior theoretical research has established 3 sources of pioneer brand
   advantage: exposure sequence, product trial, and pioneer status.
   Researchers have studied only 1 source at a time and have not
   differentiated among the sources. Therefore, the question as to whether
   these sources contribute additively or nonadditively to the pioneer
   brand advantage is still an unanswered question. Moreover, this question
   increases in importance in proportion to the degree to which consumers
   are able to identify which brand is the pioneer in a given product
   class.
   This research presents the results of 2 studies using an experimental
   design and survey research approach, respectively, to examine the issues
   just discussed. The main finding of the 1 st study is a moderating
   effect of exposure sequence and trial on the impact of pioneership
   labeling in terms of sales expectations. Providing pioneer awareness
   positively affects sales expectations when a pioneer brand receives 2nd
   exposure to consumers as opposed to 1 st exposure. However, when both
   products have been tried, the trial experience tends to dominate the
   benefit of the pioneer label cue. The main finding of the 2nd study is
   that consumers are typically unaware of which brand is the pioneer in a
   given product class.
   These findings suggest managers of pioneer brands should consider
   including the brand's pioneer status in marketing communications,
   particularly under the rather common occurrence when consumers have
   already been exposed to other brands and might be unaware of the
   pioneer's true status.

AB This article focuses on the relation between affect intensity and 3
   fundamental dimensions of temperament-emotionality, sociability, and
   sensory arousability. The purpose was to show that individual
   differences in affect intensity as a dimension of temperament can
   influence not only advertising responses, but also the lifestyles and
   preferences of consumers. Study 1 confirmed the emotionality dimension
   in that high affect intensity individuals responded with significantly
   stronger levels of emotion when exposed to an affectively charged
   advertising appeal, but not when exposed to a nonemotional appeal.
   Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that the fundamental dimensions of
   temperament are accompanied by heightened emotional intensity and do
   predict different preferences for lifestyle activities for high and low
   affect intensity consumers. A significant Affect Intensity x Gender
   interaction occurred indicating that both men and women expressed
   stronger emotions when experiencing activities that were
   gender-congruent (e.g., watching sports on TV for men, and smelling
   perfumes for women). Future research directions are also discussed.

AB In this article, we examine how consumers assess product quality when
   confronted with multiple cues. Based on cue diagnosticity, a conceptual
   framework is developed that differentiates between cue types and
   suggests that the diagnosticity of some cue types depends on the valence
   of other cue types in the environment. The cue diagnosticity framework
   is then used to assess the effects of manufacturer reputation, retailer
   reputation, and product warranty on consumer per. ceptions of product
   quality. Consistent with the conceptual framework, we find in 2 studies
   that warranty is not used in judgments of product quality when a
   manufacturer with a poor reputation sells directly to consumers or sells
   through a retailer with a poor reputation. However, when the same
   manufacturer sells through a reputed retailers then the warranty is used
   in making quality evaluations. The results not only support the
   conceptual framework; but also highlight the important role that the
   retailer plays in assessments of product quality. The implications of
   the findings are discussed along with directions for future research.

AB Scarcity has been widely assumed. (e.g., Cialdini, 1993) to function as
   a cue and thereby hinder evaluative scrutiny of compliance-gaining
   requests (appeals). In contrast, liberalized commodity theory (Brock &
   Brannon,1992) postulated that scarcity should augment evaluative
   scrutiny of requests and thereby enhance behavioral correspondence to
   the merits of requests. In natural-setting tests, 143 telephone
   operators and 305 fast-food customers complied more with a request in
   response to strong than to weak reasons and did so especially when the
   request was accompanied by scarcity information, operationalized as a
   time restriction on responding. Thus, restriction did not function as a
   cue. Rather, in both service and consumer settings, scarcity enhanced
   behavior that corresponded to the merits of requests. Compliance
   theorists and practitioners should reconsider the cue claim for
   compliance appeals and should weigh the implications of bidirectional
   responding to compliance appeals.

AB Prior research often emphasized a stimulus-based or bottom-up view of
   product category representations. In contrast, we emphasize a more
   purposeful, top-down perspective and examine categories that consumers
   might construct in the service of salient (i.e., highly accessible)
   goals. Specifically, we investigate how the point of view imposed by
   salient consumer goals might affect category representations assessed by
   participants' similarity judgments of food products. A key factor in our
   study is that we examine both individual and situational sources of
   variability in goal salience. In addition, we also vary the
   surface-level, visual resemblance of the stimulus pairs of foods used in
   the study. The results suggest that personal goals (e.g., health) and
   situational goals (e.g., convenience) act in conjunction and exert a
   systematic impact on category representations. Both types of goals, when
   salient, enhanced the. perceived similarity of goal-appropriate products
   and reduced the similarity of product pairs when only one product was
   ideal for the particular goal. The similarity-enhancing effect was most
   pronounced when the surface resemblance between the products was low,
   and the similarity-diminishing effect was more apparent when surface
   resemblance was high. Implications are discussed for current theoretical
   assumptions regarding categorization in consumer research.

AB In a controlled experiment, information format and prior knowledge of
   risk-related decision attributes altered the response to decision
   conflict produced by negatively correlated attributes (NCA) in choice
   under uncertainty. When dominated choice alternatives were presented in
   a format in which the displayed attributes were not negatively
   correlated, decision makers used a simple choice process based on the
   displayed information. Thus allowed them to detect the dominated
   alternatives, regardless of their prior knowledge. However, when the
   same alternatives were presented in a format in which the displayed
   attributes were negatively correlated, the more-knowledgeable decision
   makers used a compensatory choice process based on the displayed
   attributes and, consequently, missed the dominated alternatives. The
   less-knowledgeable participants, who were unable to use the displayed
   attributes because of their lack of expertise, calculated the
   nondisplayed attributes and detected the dominated alternatives. With
   NCA, the more-knowledgeable participants followed a conflict-resolution
   strategy using the displayed NCAs, whereas the less-knowledgeable
   individuals followed a conflict-avoidance strategy using the
   uncorrelated, nondisplayed attributes that inadvertently revealed the
   dominance structure of the decision. The implications of person factors
   for the effects of NCA and in other types of decisions with NCA are
   discussed.

AB This research examines the long-term ability of the consumers' need for
   uniqueness measure to predict consumers' valued possessions; shopping
   behaviors, and experiences. Consumers' need for uniqueness reflects
   individual differences in counterconformity motivation (i.e., the
   pursuit of differentness relative to others) that is manifest in
   consumer responses. This research reports on 2 longitudinal assessments
   of the scale's predictive validity using data collected at 4 stages from
   a consumer mail-survey sample. One year following initials responses to
   the trait measure, respondents participated in a second survey in which
   they photographed and rank ordered their valued possessions. In a third
   survey, the photographs served as cues to obtain responses to ratings of
   possession benefits and to questions regarding acquisition of the
   possession. Overall, the results support a number of hypotheses
   regarding the relation of consumers' need for uniqueness to salient
   possession benefits, types of goods comprising consumers' valued
   possessions, and shopping behaviors associated with acquiring valued
   possessions. Two years following initial responses to the trait measure,
   members of the consumer mail panel completed a fourth survey, indicating
   their participation in various uniqueness-enhancing consumer activities.
   Results support the stability and predictive validity of the measure

AB Over thirty years ago Krugman (1965) claimed that learning of
   advertising messages was much more like an Ebbinghaus nonsense syllable
   memory task than an exercise in rhetoric. If anything, he seems even
   more right today in a media environment that continues to become more
   cluttered. In this article, we investigate the role that memory plays in
   the development of beliefs within this context and focus on the
   formation of beliefs that develop with little intention or opportunity
   to learn. Following on previous work, we investigate the effect of
   repetition-induced increases in belief for advertising claims that are
   hierarchically related: a supenordinate general benefit claim (e.g.,
   security of a lock) and multiple subordinate feature claims (e.g., pick
   resistant and professional installation required). We find that beliefs
   in feature claims increase monotonically with number of exposures,
   although at a diminishing marginal rate. We find no evidence of
   horizontal spillover of repetition-induced increases in belief from one
   subordinate feature claim to another. However, we find a substantial
   amount of vertical spillover of repetition-induced increases in belief
   from individual subordinate feature claims to the superordinate general
   benefit. A dual mediation analysis suggests that the vertical spillover
   comes from both an increase in familiarity of the general benefit and
   greater belief in the set of subordinate feature claims.

AB Consumers often form preferences based on the presented attributes of
   choice options. Previous research has suggested that consumers tend to
   farm their preferences using the attributes that are related to common
   aspects between the options (i.e., alignable differences) and ignore
   attributes that are unique to individual options (i.e., nonalignable
   differences). We combine cognitive psychology and motivation research
   from social psychology and propose that consumers' preference formation
   can be systematically affected by whether they focus more on alignable
   differences or more on nonalignable differences of the options as a
   function of consumers' involvement with the task. The results of 3
   experiments show that preference judgment favors alignable differences
   over nonalignable differences in a low-motivation condition. In
   contrast, high motivation to process information enables consumers to
   increase their use of nonalignable differences in preference formation,
   which can result in. a preference reversal relative to the
   low-motivation condition. The results suggest that a preference reversal
   occurs when the nonalignable differences of the target option are
   superior to both the nonalignable differences and the alignable
   differences of the reference option. However, the reversal does not
   occur when the nonalignable differences of the target option are
   superior only to the nonalignable differences of the reference option.
   Theoretical and managerial implications relating to differentiation,
   positioning, and communication strategies for innovative brands are
   discussed.

AB This research examines, across 2 studies, the interplay between the
   valence and arousal components of affective states and the affective
   tone of a target ad. In the first study, music was used to induce a
   pleasant or unpleasant mood, while controlling for arousal. Participants
   were subsequently exposed to an ad that either had a positive-affective
   tone or was ambiguous in its affective tone. As predicted, the valence
   of the affective state colored the evaluation of the ad in a
   mood-congruent direction, but this coloring effect occurred only when
   the ad had an ambiguous-affective tone. In the second study, the target
   ad had a clear positive or negative affective tone, and the valence and
   arousal dimensions of the mood state were manipulated independently: As
   predicted, the arousal dimension, but not the valence dimension,
   influenced ad evaluation. Ad evaluations were more polarized in the
   direction of the ad's affective tone under high arousal than under low
   arousal. This effect was more pronounced for self-referent, evaluations
   (e.g., "I like the ad") than for object-referent evaluations (e.g., "The
   ad is good"'), favoring an attributional explanation-the excitation
   transfer hypothesis-over an attention-narrowing explanation-the dynamic
   complexity hypothesis. Taken together, the results of the 2 studies
   stress the important contingency of the affective tone of the ad, when
   examining the effects of the valence and arousal dimensions of a
   person's affective state on ad evaluation. The results also provide
   additional insights into how and when affect serves as information in
   judgment processes.

AB Research on negative word-of-mouth communication (WOMC) in general, and
   the process by which negative WOMC affects consumers' brand evaluations
   in particular, has been limited. This study uses attribution theory to
   explain consumers' responses to negative WOMC. Experimental results
   suggest that (a) causal attributions mediate the negative WOMC-brand
   evaluation relation, (b) receivers' attributions depend on the manner in
   which the negative WOMC is conveyed, and (c) brand name affects
   attributions. Results also suggest that when receivers attribute the

   however, if receivers attribute the negativity to the communicator,
   brand evaluations increase.

   positive affect enhances problem solving and decision making, leading to
   cognitive processing that is not only flexible, innovative, and
   creative, but also thorough and efficient. These results have
   implications regarding consumers'potential reactions to affect generated
   by ads, products, consumption situations, and service encounters.
   These cognitive effects of positive affect are considered in the context
   of effects on social interaction that show that positive affect leads to
   helping, generosity, and interpersonal understanding. Together, these
   findings suggest implications especially for customer satisfaction, and
   particularly for a role for employee positive affect, or employee
   satisfaction, in generating customer satisfaction.
   Moreover, studies specifically in the domain of medical decision making
   and problem solving indicate that these implications would apply to the
   specific areas of doctor-patient interaction, medical decision making,
   and medical consumer satisfaction. Finally, it is suggested that the
   benefits of positive affect be considered when formulating healthcare
   policy and be included in economic models and policy decisions more
   generally as well.

AB A common goal of value elicitation is to determine consumers'
   reservation Prices (i.e., maximum willingness to pay) for goods and
   services Because the results of such studies are often used as inputs in
   decision making, it is important to understand when reservation prices
   estimated in value elicitation studies are likely to be biased, and how
   to correct for such biases. Experiment 1 of this study investigated
   attributes of the context in which consumers' values are elicited that
   may lead to consumers overbidding their true reservation prices. The
   results demonstrate that the likelihood of overbidding is high when
   consumers perceive that they will not have to pay their stated
   reservation price, and particularly high when they also perceive that
   stating a high reservation price will increase the likelihood of
   subsequently receiving a good. Experiment 2 demonstrated that priming
   budget considerations prior to value elicitation produced value
   estimates closer to the actual price of a good compared to a condition
   in which budget was not primed. Implications for the practice of value
   elicitation and the use of estimates provided by such studies in
   decision making are discussed.

AB Research in psychology has demonstrated that people have a shared
   knowledge of emotion categories. Building on this research and our
   understanding of categorization processes, this article proposes a
   mechanism by which consumers utilize information about a brand's
   "emotion benefits" in forming attitudes. The results of 2 experimental
   studies show that (a) consumers' processing of a brand's emotion benefit
   information is consistent with categorization processes such that
   emotion category congruity effects are large in basic-versus
   subordinate-level conditions, (b) associating a brand with certain
   emotions can influence brand and ad attitudes without necessarily
   eliciting emotions during exposure to advertising, (c) emotion category
   congruity "works" through attitude-toward-the-ad and emotion benefit
   beliefs in influencing brand attitudes, and (d) subjective product
   category knowledge moderates the strength of these effects. Taken
   together, these results explicate the process by which a knowledge-based
   consideration of a brand's emotional benefits can influence consumers'
   beliefs about the brand and brand attitudes.

AB It is argued that the construct of individual susceptibility to
   normative influence (SNI) needs to be put into a wider nomological
   framework, with antecedents and consequences. Based on prior literature,
   a causal sequence is hypothesized in which values are antecedent to SNI,
   which itself shapes the importance placed by the individual on different
   attributes. It is further suggested that the relation between values and
   SNI is strongest for"external" values, and that high SNI leads to
   greater importance for attributes that provide "socially visible"
   benefits. Data from a national field survey (N= 663) on consumer
   preferences are analyzed to test these hypotheses, using confirmatory
   factor analysis via LISREL 8.30 (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1993). The analysis
   finds support for most of the hypothesized structural relations.

   influence brand-choice decisions. The results suggest that the ability
   of advertising-generated brand attitudes to predict advertising effects
   on brand choice declines when (a) consumers' motivation to deliberate is
   greater at the time of brand choice than at the time of attitude
   formation, (b) the message appeal of the brand assigned the most

AB Prior research has assumed that existing knowledge exerts its influence
   on consumer judgments primarily through abstract knowledge structures.
   Consequently, little attention has been given to the possibility that
   judgments may, under certain circumstances, be influenced by knowledge
   associated with more specific knowledge structures. This article
   examines the factors responsible for determining the impact of abstract
   versus specific knowledge on consumer judgments. Based on the Consumer
   Learning by Analogy model (CLA model; Gregan-Paxton & John, 1997), it is
   argued that the relative influence of abstract and specific knowledge is
   a function of (a) the relation between the new product and existing
   knowledge and (b) the nature of consumer's knowledge. These ideas were
   tested in a series of experiments in which participants were required to
   judge a new product that varied in its relation to an existing product
   or brand. In this context the influence of specific knowledge was most
   evident when participants were able to construct an attribute mapping,
   but not a relational mapping, to link the novel product to a familiar
   brand exemplar. When it was possible to construct a relational mapping,
   a more abstract knowledge structure, such as a schema, was retrieved and
   used as the basis of product judgments.

AB Prior research suggests that perceived performance of a product or a

   this causal relationship might be a measurement artifact and/or
   insufficient modeling of the satisfaction process rather than an
   accurate assessment of how consumers form satisfaction judgments.
   To test our hypotheses, a 2 x 2 x 2 (Performance x Expectations x Needs)
   factorial design was used with 2 types of perceived performance measures
   (value-laden and objective). The findings demonstrate that the observed
   direct link from perceived performance to overall satisfaction
   diminishes when more objective perceived performance indicators replace
   the commonly used value-laden measures. Furthermore, desire-congruency
   was found to contribute independently to satisfaction over and above a
   disconfirmation-of-expectations standard. In fact, desire-congruency was
   found to be abetter predictor of satisfaction than
   disconfirmation-of-expectations. Finally, our results suggest that the
   direct performance-satisfaction link becomes insignificant when the
   modeling of the satisfaction process is improved, Taken together, these
   findings support the view that the frequently observed high correlations
   between perceived performance and satisfaction might be a reflection of
   the type of measures used and/or insufficient capturing of the
   evaluative process leading to satisfaction, rather than support for a
   direct causal link.

   began to increase its accommodation of postmodern approaches, compared
   to more positivistic approaches. JCPs mission was thus perceived by some
   to be more methodologically homogeneous, with a greater focus on
   traditional experimental psychology in the domain of consumer behavior.
   Is JCR really more methodologically diverse than JCP? In what other ways
   are the two journals similar or different? This article attempts to

AB Consistent with calls for a dynamical social psychology (Jacoby et al.,
   1987; Nowak, Lewenstein, & Vallacher, 1994), attitude formation was
   studied using a recently developed, computer-basedsimulation technique
   termed Higher Order Cognitive Tracing (see Jacoby et al., 1994).
   Participants' attitudes toward 12 different products in 3 product
   categories were investigated as a function of incremental information
   input. As opposed to traditional memory-based models of attitude
   formation, the study explored online processing models. Results indicate
   that the impact of information tends to decrease the later in the
   sequence that information is accessed. In addition, new information that
   is affectively inconsistent with prior information tends to have a
   greater impact on attitudes than information that is affectively
   redundant. This effect is more pronounced earlier rather than later in
   the sequence of information acquisition. Implications and suggestions
   for future research are discussed.

AB Suspense is a cognitive and emotional reaction that is evoked by
   time-dependent structural characteristics of an unfolding dramatic
   narrative. Suspense within narratives is defined and its structural
   antecedents, based on characteristics of suspense that have been studied
   within the context of film and fiction, are identified. Results of three
   studies offer-evidence that suspenseful commercials can be identified
   and discriminated from other Pipes of commercials, As they watch,
   viewers of suspenseful commercials show a combination of hope and fear
   emotional responses. A parameter of online hope and fear responses is
   positively correlated with attitude toward the ad for suspenseful, but
   not for nonsuspenseful, commercials. Perceptions of suspense-related
   characteristics predict attitude toward the ad for suspenseful
   commercials, but are I of several predictors for nonsuspenseful
   commercials. A negative aspect of suspenseful commercials is that there
   is less brand-content integration.

AB Researchers argue that the effectiveness of cognitive versus affective
   persuasive appeals depends in part on whether the appeal is congruent or
   incongruent with a primarily cognitive or affective attitude base.
   However, considerable research suggests that these persuasion effects
   may hold only for predominantly affective attitudes and not cognitive
   attitudes. Indeed, results of Experiment I show that the relative
   effectiveness of congruent relative to incongruent persuasion appeals
   holds for brands with predominantly affective associations, but not
   those with predominantly cognitive associations. Experiment 2 explores
   one reason for this anomalous finding: Cognitive attitudes may be
   relatively impervious to persuasive appeals because the probability of
   targeting the specific attribute on which the cognitive attitude is
   based is smaller. The results are supportive, showing that significant
   persuasion effects are found when the specific beliefs on which
   cognitive attitudes are based are taken into account. However, these
   effects only occur under conditions of low cognitive load and not high
   cognitive load where resources for the cognitive processing of the
   appeals are limited. We discuss the implications of the research for the
   role of attitude structure in understanding persuasion effects and the
   interplay of affective and cognitive elements in persuasion processes.

AB Research in social psychology suggests that motives such as
   self-bolstering and impression management can lead people to engage in
   deliberate misrepresentations during interpersonal communications. This
   article extends our understanding of such behavior to a new domain; that
   of consumer communications. Drawing on research on lying behavior and
   symbolic consumption, we suggest that misrepresentation about products
   and possessions is particularly likely to occur when these products or
   possessions are used to create a positive self-image in the context of
   social interaction. Experiments I and 2 simulate a social interaction
   wherein misrepresentation about the purchase price of a product helps
   participants to manage impressions. A third experiment extends these
   findings by testing for wealth-related misrepresentation in the context
   of an interaction wherein participants actually communicate their
   family's wealth to a recipient. Consistent with predictions derived from
   existing research on symbolic consumption, all 3 experiments provide
   support for the critical importance of recipient status on the
   likelihood of misrepresentation. The first 2 experiments additionally
   examine the role of individual differences and brand differences.
   Results on these dimensions are also supportive of our underlying
   theoretical premise regarding the antecedents of lying behavior.

AB This article tests 2 competing explanations for the truth effect, the
   finding that repeated statements are believed more than new statements.
   Previous research has put forth 2 explanations for this
   effect-subjective familiarity and perceived source variability. The
   subjective familiarity explanation holds that repeated statements feel
   more familiar and are therefore believed more than new statements. This
   explanation has received strong support in the literature. The source
   variability explanation holds that people attribute repeated statements
   to different sources; this belief, that multiple sources endorse the
   statement, increases belief in repeated statements relative to new
   statements attributed to a single source. However, previous studies
   testing this explanation have confounded source variability with source
   credibility. This research aims to tease apart the effects of subjective
   familiarity and source variability while holding source credibility
   constant across conditions. Results of the first 2 experiments
   manipulating number of sources and measuring recognition implicate
   subjective familiarity rather than perceived source variability as the
   mechanism underlying the truth effect. However, the third study
   demonstrates that source variability does enhance belief in repeated
   statements that are initially perceived as low in plausibility.
   Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

   impact of typeface semantic cues within a marketing context. Visual
   properties of typefaces are conceptualized as communicating unique
   semantic associations to individuals distinct from the content of the
   written words they clothe. Typeface associations are investigated across
   varying levels of involvement in terms of their effect upon brand
   perceptions. These associations also influenced the memorability of
   advertised benefit claims. Memorability was enhanced as the degree of
   consistency among typeface semantic cues, advertisement visual cues, and
   advertisement copy claims increased. Extensions of this framework focus
   on obtaining a more complete understanding concerning the semantic
   pathways through which typefaces convey meaning.

   of low price guarantees (LPG) in retail advertisements within the
   framework of signaling theory. Overall, an LPG in an ad resulted in
   higher value perceptions and shopping intentions. Findings also suggest
   that the effect of an LPG is likely to be moderated by other price cues
   such as reference prices and by the price image of the store. An LPG
   resulted in higher value perception and shopping intention when
   reference prices were low or absent, but lowered search intention in the
   presence of a high reference price. Additional findings suggest that
   intention to search for a better price was lower, particularly when an
   LPG was offered by a low price image store. For high price image stores,
   an LPG increased value perceptions and shopping intentions, while also
   increasing search intentions, indicating the possibility that LPGs can
   act as a double-edged sword in certain instances. Managerial and public

AB Two experiments qualify the previously observed finding that a
   moderately incongruent brand extension is evaluated more favorably than
   a congruent or extremely incongruent brand extension and reconcile this
   finding with other outcomes that have been reported in the brand
   extension literature. A congruent brand extension is judged more
   favorably than either a moderately incongruent extension or an extremely
   incongruent extension when involvement in the task is low. Apparently,
   incongruity per se does not always prompt the elaboration required to
   reconcile a moderately incongruent extension with the parent brand and,
   thereby, enhance evaluation of the moderately incongruent extension.
   Further, when involvement is high, a moderately incongruent brand
   extension may only be judged more favorably than a congruent one if the
   extension is undifferentiated. If the extension is differentiated, the
   differentiation may provide a basis for favorable evaluation
   irrespective of the level of congruity with the brand. Recall of
   information about the performance of the extension relative to
   competitive brands and measures of attitude toward the parent brand, fit
   between the extension and the parent brand, and task satisfaction
   provide insight into the processes that underlie these effects.

AB Prior research on product design has focused predominantly on the
   importance of product aesthetics in generating favorable consumer
   response. Interestingly, little attention has been given to the
   importance of aesthetics relative to product function (a fundamental
   component of product design) or to brand strength-two factors that are
   also considered to have a significant influence on consumers' product
   evaluations and on product success. This study investigates how product
   design (conceptualized as product aesthetics and function) interacts
   with brand strength to influence consumers' product liking and quality
   evaluations. Results suggest that design and brand strength
   differentially impact liking and quality judgments. In addition,
   judgments of liking and quality are found to be different in the way
   they are formed. Specifically, product liking appears to be readily
   formed through a process that integrates design information only; brand
   strength exhibits no significant influence. Quality judgments appear to
   take longer to process, and involve the integration of design and brand
   information.

AB The role of exemplars in formation of attitudes toward a category has,
   surprisingly, been ignored in prior consumer research. In the present
   research we seek to develop a better understanding of the relationship
   between category exemplars (e.g., the products in a brand category) and
   overall attitudes toward the category. Attitude measures that
   incorporate evaluations of individual branded products may be useful,
   both conceptually and practically, and can complement more traditional
   multi-attribute measures of attitude. Across 3 studies we present
   evidence that a composite index of attitudes toward category exemplars,
   weighted by exemplar typicality, is related to overall category
   attitudes, sometimes more strongly than a traditional multi-attribute
   index. We also demonstrate that elaboration upon the individual
   exemplars further strengthens the relationship between category
   attitudes and this composite index. Theoretical implications for
   attitude theory, as well as managerial implications, are discussed.

   channels, consumers have easy access to impulse purchasing
   opportunities, but little is known about this sudden, compelling,
   hedonically complex purchasing behavior in non-Western cultures. Yet
   cultural factors moderate many aspects of consumer's impulsive buying
   behavior, including self-identity, normative influences, the suppression
   of emotion, and the postponement of instant gratification. From a
   multi-country survey of consumers in Australia, United States, Hong
   Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, our analyses show that both regional
   level factors (individualism-collectivism) and individual cultural
   difference factors (independent-interdependent self-concept)
   systernatically influence impulsive purchasing behavior.

AB I propose that different relations among basic components of
   self-regulation produce distinct types of decision value: (a) Outcome
   value is produced when the consequences of a decision are relevant to
   the regulatory orientation of the decision maker, (b) value from fit is
   produced when goal pursuit means suit the regulatory orientation of the
   decision maker, and (c) value from proper means is produced when goal
   pursuit means are in agreement with established rules and normative
   principles. I use the regulatory focus distinction between promotion
   focus concerns with aspirations and accomplishments and prevention focus
   concerns with safety and responsibilities (Higgins, 1997, 1998) to
   illustrate outcome value and value from fit. Justification of a decision
   is used to illustrate value from proper means. I propose that decision
   makers are unlikely to distinguish among their experiences of these 3
   types of value, and thus value from fit and value from proper means can
   be transferred to outcome value. I present evidence of such value
   transfer and consider its implications for value to the customer. I also
   reconsider sunk costs and the endowment effect in light of there being
   value beyond outcome value.

   consideration is given to I brand than to others in the choice set. This
   research explored how selective consideration of a brand affects
   attitudes toward the brand, relative standing of the focal brand within
   the choice category, and decision making. Experiment I demonstrated that
   when participants were prompted to consider a randomly determined focal
   alternative, that alternative was more likely to be chosen than nonfocal
   alternatives. Moreover, willingness to pay for an alternative was higher
   if it was the focus of consideration. Attitudinal data suggest that the
   selective consideration effect occurred because attitudes toward the
   focal alternative became more positive compared to those toward other
   alternatives in the choice set. Experiment 2 elucidated this attitudinal
   effect by demonstrating that selective consideration could cause the
   extremity of consumers' attitudes toward a focal brand to become more
   positive. Experiment 3 explored the potential of the selective
   consideration of a focal alternative to influence the consistency
   between consumers' attitudes and decisions and established that the
   initial attitude toward a focal alternative moderated the selective

   in partitioned (separate price for each mandatory component) or
   consolidated (single, equivalent price) fashion. In this article, we
   report on 2 experiments that examined the effects of such presentations
   on evaluations and choices as well as the underlying processing effects.
   In Experiment 1, consistent with a mental accounting analysis, a
   multicomponent product bundle was evaluated more favorably and chosen
   more often when its components were presented with partitioned (vs.
   consolidated) prices. The effects were, however, moderated by the
   component partitioned. In particular, it appeared that partitioning
   prices altered attention paid to the components partitioned and related
   product features. In Experiment 2, we found that different splits of the
   bundle price influenced evaluations and choices depending on how the
   focal product price related to that of a comparison option. These
   price-split effects were also moderated by the component partitioned,
   suggesting attention effects similar to Experiment 1. The findings show
   that although the effects of price partitioning were consistent with
   mental accounting principles, they were moderated by information
   processing effects related to the partitioned component.

   preference for advertising appeals. Recently, psychologists have

   of individualism-collectivism. Idiocentrism refers to person-level

   Drawing on individualism-collectivism theory, in this article we look at
   the lifestyle of idiocentrics and allocentrics. Our findings suggest a
   convergence between the etic- and emic-level approaches, thus
   strengthening individualism-collectivism theory. The emic-level findings
   of this study also suggest additional questions to be explored at the

   role of consumption emotions within the expectancy-disconfirmation model
   of consumer satisfaction and investigated whether consumption emotions
   are a result of product performance or disconfirmation. The findings
   show that both positive and negative emotions are primarily a function
   of product performance and influence satisfaction even when the effects
   of expectations, performance, and disconfirmation are controlled. In the
   2nd study, we proposed and tested an alternative framework for
   understanding the role of consumption emotions in the satisfaction
   response for situations in which consumers use more of an experiential
   perspective to anticipate and experience consumption. According to this
   model, consumers form affective expectations about how consumption of
   the product will make them feel, experience positive or negative
   emotions as a result of these expectations and product consumption, and
   evaluate the discrepancy between experienced and anticipated emotions.
   All 3 variables, then, impact satisfaction. The results empirically
   support many of the relations in the new model of the experiential

AB This article develops a conceptual framework to examine how consumers
   incorporate memory-based and context-based cues in estimating past and
   future credit card expenses. Focusing on memory-based information, in
   this framework we suggest that past credit card expenses may be recalled
   as holistic totals or episodic individual expenses depending on the
   accessibility of each form of expense. We tested the conceptual
   framework with 3 studies. Study I showed that the recency of past
   expenses and frequency of credit card usage moderated the extent to
   which past expenses were used in estimating future expenses. Study I
   also showed that self-awareness of estimation bias affected consumers'
   estimates of future expenses. Study 2 showed that a decomposition
   strategy (unbundling a total into subcategories), which serves to make
   episodic individual expenses more accessible, was effective in reducing
   sampling-based bias. Study 3 provided a validity check and showed that
   decomposition cues reduced estimation errors and affected estimates of
   future expense. In this article, we demonstrate the manner in which
   memory-based information is used to make estimates, and we also
   demonstrate the effectiveness of decomposition as a debiasing technique
   for past and future estimates.

   more personalized and more commonly used. The ease of pushing
   information may lead to interruptions in consumer information processing

   frequency, timing, and content and the moderating effects of consumer

   for extensions offered by desirable versus undesirable brands. When a
   favorably-evaluated core brand was involved, positive mood facilitated
   extension evaluations to a greater extent for moderate extensions than
   for near and far extensions. In contrast, mood failed to enhance the

   Theory, an experiment examined minority viewers' use of racial cues on
   exposure to product advertising. A total of 160 Black adults from a
   southeastern city rated a garment bag advertisement that featured either
   a White or a Black model and contained either strong or weak message
   arguments. Consistent with both theoretical notions, product and
   advertising evaluations were more favorable given a Black than a White
   model, but only for Black participants who identify strongly with Black
   culture. Blacks who identify weakly with Black culture evaluated the
   product and advertisement similarly given a White or a Black model. The
   results also showed that the Black model's race motivated Blacks,
   particularly those with strong racial attitudes, to process the message
   in a biased manner. In particular, the Black (versus White) model's race
   positively influenced the Black participants' thoughts about the
   product, which in turn yielded more favorable product evaluations. The
   findings suggest that Blacks appear to engage in biased processing (and
   not simple cue processing) when exposed to Black models in advertising
   messages.

AB Structural alignability refers to the readiness with which the
   attributes of one brand can be mapped on to those of another brand.
   Across three experiments, we show that as alignability in comparative
   advertising decreases, advertising-induced target brand evaluations also
   decrease. This effect is explained by the extent to which assumptions
   about attribute comparisons are needed. We further show that the effect
   of alignability on evaluation is moderated by the need for cognitive
   closure, an individual difference variable that influences preferences
   for easy comparison and less ambiguity. Although prior research has
   treated alignability as a dichotomous variable (present or absent), the
   research presented here suggests that there are different types of
   (non)alignability comparisons.

   alternatives have in common. As a result, they often evaluate products
   more favorably when the products have unique positive features but
   common negative features than when they have unique negative features
   but common positive ones. Two studies examined contingencies in the
   occurrence of these "cancellation" effects and explored their
   implications for people's evaluations of not only the products being
   compared but other products they encounter subsequently. Some
   participants were explicitly told to compare two products at the time
   they received information about them. They not only disregarded the
   products' common features when initially evaluating these products, but
   disregarded evaluatively similar features of a third product they
   encountered some time later. Other participants were initially told to
   describe each product separately. In this condition, they formed an
   overall impression of each product individually, and so cancellation
   effects were not apparent. Nevertheless, their preference for one
   product over the other was based on a comparison of the products'
   individual features that they could recall at the time of judgment
   rather than on the global impressions they had formed when the product
   information was first presented.

AB An important challenge for firms commercializing technology-based new
   products is to reduce consumers' perceptions of performance uncertainty.
   We build on prior research in consumer decision making and acceptance of
   high-technology products and focus on the role of information in
   influencing perceptions of performance uncertainty of new product
   interfaces. In contrast to prior literature, we show here that more
   information is not always better in reducing performance uncertainty. We
   argue that the effects of more (vs. less) information on the performance
   uncertainty of a new interface and consumer adoption intentions of the
   new product are moderated by the degree of newness of the particular
   functionality (i.e., set of potential benefits) that is delivered by the
   new product. We report two experiments that investigate this problem and
   show that more information helps to reduce performance uncertainty only
   when the product provides a preexisting functionality. However, high
   levels of information about the new interface actually intensify
   performance uncertainty when the product delivers a new functionality.
   We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial
   implications of the findings.

AB Consumers often focus on the characteristics of one brand and consider

   processes often result in judgments of a focal brand that are more
   extreme than warranted. This research investigates the extent to which
   this extremity effect generalizes to a consideration set consisting of
   multiple brands. Three experiments show that a set of favorably regarded
   brands is perceived as more favorable than would be possible if the
   salience manipulation had no effect. In Experiment 1, participants
   overestimated the likelihood that the best brand in the market was
   included in the presented set. In Experiment 2, the average rank
   assigned to the brands in the presented set was inflated. Extreme
   judgments were observed regardless of whether the focal set of brands
   was offered by a specialty store with a high-quality reputation or by a
   general merchandise store with a low-quality reputation. In Experiment
   3, extreme intentions to buy now from the focal store were reduced when
   a comparative (vs. singular) judgment task was performed, but only when
   the need for cognitive closure was low as opposed to high. The results
   suggest that singular evaluation processes lead to consideration set
   overvaluation regardless of which particular favorably regarded brands

AB It is commonly argued that although rewards induce behaviors, they
   undermine attitudes and motivation for subsequent action. This
   perspective has been applied in a consumer setting to suggest that sales
   promotions such as coupons will undermine consumer brand evaluations and
   brand loyalty. Instead of focusing on the undermining effects of
   promotional rewards, this research applies the availability valence
   hypothesis (Tybout, Sternthal, & Calder, 1983) to predict and explain
   when rewards will enhance recipient response. Two experiments
   demonstrate that an immediate reward from a product-related source
   enhances product evaluations by making favorable information more
   accessible than unfavorable information. Promotions enhance the relative
   accessibility of favorable information when their benefits are directly
   experienced and the salience of the promotion's task-contingency is
   diminished by maximizing consumer behavioral freedom.

   construct attitudes based on external information from others, their own
   direct experience, or some combination of the two. Evidence from two
   studies suggests that consumers' salient goals and the order and degree
   of favorability associated with the two types of information (external
   vs. experiential) are factors that may jointly determine attitude
   construction. In study 1, participants who were in an evaluative
   (nonevaluative) frame of mind were more likely to construct their
   attitudes based on initial (recent) diagnostic information regarding the
   attitude object (i.e., an advertisement). Participants appear to use an
   anchoring and adjustment process to construct their attitudes. In study
   2, to further test this anchoring and adjustment explanation, we use the
   well-established finding that people sometimes express attitude
   behaviors in line with a third party's views. When a third party created
   an external contingency, participants no longer systematically anchored
   on prior or recent information toward the attitude object. The results
   of these two studies point out the usefulness of identifying (a)
   processes of attitude construction, and (b) processes of how consumers
   determine whether a generated attitude is an appropriate guide for their
   behavior. The findings are discussed in terms of the current retrieval
   versus construction debate in the attitude literature.

AB This research investigates the developmental processes by which
   consumers become more or less materialistic. It begins with a review of
   Inglehart's work in this area, and then applies his theories to explain
   conceptions of materialism developed by Richins and Belk. Inglehart
   predicts that the subjective experience of economic deprivation and
   insecurity during one's formative years leads to adult materialism.
   Early subjective experiences of deprivation and insecurity strongly
   predict materialism as conceptualized by Belk, but are not related to
   materialism as conceptualized by Richins. Inglehart also allows for the
   social influence of family and peers to shape materialistic
   orientations. Findings indicate that the formative social influence of
   family and peers predicts both Belk's and Richins's materialism. This
   difference between Belk's and Richins's materialism is explained on the
   grounds that Belk's materialism reflects personality whereas Richins's
   reflects personal values.

AB Recently, it has been proposed that creating compelling experiences in
   the distinctive consumption environment defined by the Internet depends
   on facilitating a state of flow. Although it has been established that
   consumers do, in fact, experience flow while using the Web, consumer
   researchers do not as yet have a comprehensive understanding of the
   specific activities during which consumers actually have these
   experiences.
   One fruitful focus of research on online consumer experience has been on
   two distinct categories of consumption behavior-goal directed and
   experiential consumption behavior. Drawing distinctions between these
   behaviors for the Web may be particularly important because the
   experiential process is, for many individuals, as or even more important
   than the final instrumental result. However, the general and broad
   nature of flow measurement to date has precluded a precise investigation
   of flow during goal-directed versus experiential activities.
   In this article, we explore this issue, investigating whether flow
   occurs during both experiential and goal-directed activities, if
   experiential and goal-directed flow states differ in terms of underlying
   constructs, and what the key characteristics are-based on prior
   theory-that define "types" of flow experiences reported on the Web. Our
   approach is to perform a series of quantitative analyses of qualitative
   descriptions of flow experiences provided by Web users collected in
   conjunction with the 10th GVU WWW User Survey. In contrast with previous
   research that suggests flow would be more likely to occur during
   recreational activities than task-oriented activities, we found more
   evidence of flow for task-oriented rather than experiential activities,
   although there is evidence flow occurs under both scenarios. As a final
   note, we argue that the role that goal-directed and experiential
   activities may play in facilitating the creation of compelling online
   environments may also be important in a broader consumer policy context.

AB In the bricks-and-mortar environment, stores employ sales people that
   have learned to distinguish between shoppers based on their in-store
   behavior. Some shoppers appear to be very focused in looking for a
   specific product. In those cases, sales people may step in and help the
   shopper find what they are looking for. In other cases, the shopper is
   merely "window shopping." The experienced sales person can identify
   these shoppers and either ignore them and let them continue window
   shopping, or intercede and try and stimulate a purchase in the
   appropriate manner. However, in the virtual shopping environment, there
   is no sales person to perform that role.
   Therefore, this article theoretically develops and empirically tests a
   typology of store visits in which visits vary according to the shoppers'
   underlying objectives. By,using page-to-page clickstream data from a
   given online store, visits are categorized as a buying, browsing,
   searching, or knowledge-building visit based on observed in-store
   navigational patterns, including the general content of the pages
   viewed. Each type of visit varies in terms of purchasing likelihood. The
   shoppers, in each case, are also driven by different motivations and
   therefore would respond differentially to various marketing messages.
   The ability to categorize visits in such a manner allows the e-commerce
   marketer to identify likely buyers and design more effective, customized
   promotional message.

AB This research examines consumers' willingness to pay in an online
   environment. Specifically, I compare two price-elicitation strategies:
   price generation (i.e., "name your price") and price selection (i.e.,
   "select your price"). Contrary to the common assumption that naming a
   price will be preferred by consumers because it offers the most
   flexibility in articulating one's willingness to pay, this research
   demonstrates that consumers often prefer to select rather than to
   generate a price. In a series of three experiments, I show that the
   potential unfavorable effects of the price-generation task are
   associated with the absence of a readily available reference price
   range. I further demonstrate that the reference price range also has to
   be externally provided and that internally generated reference prices
   can as well eliminate the potential negative effect of the price

   multisensory stimuli over the Internet, giving rise to what we call
   second-generation electronic commerce, and to Web-based exchanges that
   approach in-store episodes and greatly exceed existing mass-market media
   in experiential richness. Delivery of multisensory stimuli is not
   enough, however, to fully activate, generate, and manage the embodied
   knowledge that is critical to consumer thinking about many types of
   products and services. Embodied knowledge refers to information elements
   that are generated and maintained outside the brain cavity and that are
   incorporated into consumer assessments of products and services. The
   view that consumers integrate embodied and conceptual knowledge into
   mental simulations of products and services is used as a foundation for
   a more general exposition of embodied knowledge and cognition. Three
   elements of embodied knowledge-body mapping and monitoring systems,
   proprioceptive knowledge, and body boundaries-are discussed, including
   their implications for e-commerce theory and practice and for marketing
   research in general. The methodological challenges of better
   understanding and managing embodied knowledge are also discussed.

AB This article examines the role of electronic recommendation agents in
   connection with consumers' construction of multiattribute preferences.
   We propose that such digital agents have the potential to influence
   consumers' preferences in a systematic fashion. Our key hypothesis is
   that, everything else being equal, the inclusion of an attribute in a
   recommendation agent renders this attribute more prominent in consumers'
   purchase decisions. The results of a controlled agent-assisted shopping
   experiment provide strong support for this hypothesis. We also
   demonstrate that this preference-construction effect may persist beyond
   the initial shopping experience and into subsequent choice settings in
   which no recommendation agent is available. Finally, we propose three
   possible explanations of the effect and discuss each of these in light
   of our results.

AB The rapid growth of the Internet as an information medium has given rise
   to "infomediaries" that help aid consumers in making decisions. Recent
   research in the context of recommendation agents has shown that their
   use can lead to increases in consumer welfare. However, it is not clear
   if this varies by customer and by type of product. In this article, the
   role of category risk, product complexity, and customer category
   knowledge in moderating the impact of recommendation agents on consumer
   welfare is examined. A controlled experiment simulating a recommendation
   agent was used in conducting this study. Various product characteristics
   for which the recommendation agent provided information were
   manipulated. The results support some of the hypothesized effects. It is
   shown that category risk moderates the impact of recommendation agents
   on decision quality and product complexity moderates the role of
   recommendation agents on amount of search. The implications of this for
   theory and research on the Internet are discussed.

AB Whereas the Internet itself poses unique challenges and opportunities,
   it is possible that the context of the Internet (a computer context)
   affects consumers differently than other contexts would, thereby causing
   people to think about and evaluate products differently. Drawing from
   learning theory and the functional theory of attitudes, it is predicted
   that computers, by being associated with the accessibility of detailed
   information, will elicit a need for meaning. Consequently, when a
   computer is present, people may think about and seek more product
   information than will those evaluating the product on paper (a print
   context). The results of an experiment support these hypotheses. Across
   two diverse products, the mere presence of a computer caused people to
   think more about and request more information about the product than
   those in the print context did. Furthermore, the attitudes of those in
   the computer context were more representative of both dimensions
   described in the advertisement, whereas the attitudes of those in the
   print context reflected the valence of the dimension that is typically
   used when evaluating the product. Implications for promoting products
   and conducting market research in computer environments are discussed.

AB We propose an analytical framework for studying bidding behavior in
   online auctions. The framework focuses on three key dimensions: the
   multi-stage process, the types of value-signals employed at each phase,
   and the dynamics of bidding behavior whereby early choices impact
   subsequent bidding decisions. We outline a series of propositions
   relating to the auction entry decision, bidding decisions during the
   auction, and bidding behavior at the end of an auction. In addition, we
   present the results of three preliminary field studies that investigate
   factors that influence consumers' value assessments and bidding
   decisions. In particular, (a) due to a focus on the narrow auction
   context, consumers under-search and, consequently, overpay for widely
   available commodities (CDs, DVDs) and (b) higher auction starting prices
   tend to lead to higher winning bids, particularly when comparable items
   are not available in the immediate context. We discuss the implications
   of this research with respect to our understanding of the key
   determinants of consumer behavior in this increasingly important arena

AB When consumers use computers to help make purchase decisions, how do
   they attribute responsibility for the positive or negative outcomes of
   those decisions? The results suggest that, in general, attributions of
   responsibility reflect a self-serving bias: Consumers tend to blame
   computers for negative outcomes and tend to take personal credit for
   positive ones. However, the results also suggest that, when consumers
   have a history of intimate self-disclosure with a computer, this pattern
   of attribution is significantly mitigated: Consumers are more willing to
   credit the computer for positive outcomes, and are more willing to
   accept responsibility for negative outcomes. In addition, this research
   provides evidence that the causal relation between self-disclosure and
   attributions of responsibility is partially mediated by attraction.

   how attractive a vendor's prices are. The results of a laboratory

   providing access to uncensored competitor price information may result
   in enhanced long-term preference for that vendor, especially if the

AB Consumers often search the Internet for agent advice when making
   decisions about products and services. Existing research on this topic
   suggests that past opinion agreement between the consumer and an agent
   is an important cue in consumers' acceptance of current agent advice. In
   this article, we report the results of two experiments which show that
   different types of past agreements can have different effects on the
   acceptance of current agent advice. In Study 1, we show that in addition
   to the overall agreement rate, consumers pay special attention to
   extreme opinion agreement when assessing agent diagnosticity (i.e.,
   extremity effect). In Study 2 we show that positive extreme agreement is
   more influential than negative extreme agreement when advice valence is
   positive, but the converse does not hold when advice valence is negative
   (i.e., positivity effect). We conclude by identifying promising avenues
   for future research and discuss implications of the results for
   marketers in areas such as design of intelligent online recommendation
   systems and word-of-mouth management on the Internet.

AB Internet shopping (or e-shopping) is emerging as a shopping mode and
   with its requirement of computer access and use, it is interesting to
   find out whether consumers associate e-shoppers with any gender-specific
   stereotypes. Such stereotypes may be expected because shopping is
   considered a "female typed" activity whereas technology is considered to
   be in the male domain. In this article, we address this central question
   in an empirical study that varies the shopping context in terms of
   outlet type, product type, and purchase purpose. The respondents are
   college students with Internet access and familiarity with online
   shopping. The experimental results suggest that the global stereotype,
   held by both male and female respondents, is that of a shopper as a
   woman. This stereotype reverses when the product purchased is technical
   and expensive (DVD player). In terms of personality attributions, the
   female shopper is seen to be less technical, less spontaneous, and more
   reliable and attributions regarding personal characteristics are not
   influenced significantly by product type, outlet type, or purchase
   purpose.

   process. We hypothesized that the influence of WOM and similarity
   depends on the nature of the decision-making task, which is theorized as

   model with 2 focal brands (the early and later entrants) was developed
   to test the influence of independent measures on the likelihood of (a)
   retrieval; (b) consideration, given retrieval; and (c) choice, given

   from 2 experiments provides support for the multistage conceptualization

AB Virtually every broadcast advertisement uses the voice of an announcer,
   but due to lack of guidance from the marketing literature, managers must
   rely on gut feel when choosing a voice. Drawing on research from
   psycholinguistics, we identify 3 important voice
   characteristics-syllable speed, interphrase pausation, and pitch-and
   link these characteristics to key advertising response variables. By
   considering these 3 variables simultaneously, we test competing
   explanations previously offered to explain the process by which speech
   rate affects consumer response to advertising. Specifically, we assess
   whether an increase in speech rate enhances or reduces processing of the
   advertisement and whether this effect is driven primarily by syllable
   speed or interphrase pausation. Consideration of these 2 aspects of
   speech rate independently helps identify whether the changes in
   processing stem from changes in the opportunity to process and/or the
   motivation to process. Our results show that a voice with
   faster-than-normal syllable speed and low pitch produces less negative
   advertisement-directed cognitive responses and more favorable ad
   attitudes, as well as more favorable brand attitudes, lending support to
   a motivational process explanation. No significant effects were found
   for interphrase pausation, suggesting that the results cannot be
   accounted for by the reduced opportunity to process in the compressed
   conditions.

AB We explored the way that children use brand names in making consumer
   judgments. Brand names can serve as a simple perceptual cue that
   identifies a product as one people are familiar with or one they
   associate with certain perceptual features. Brands can also be
   associated with symbolic or conceptual meanings, conveying status,
   prestige, or trendiness. We proposed that young children relate to
   brands on a perceptual level, whereas older children relate to brands on
   a conceptual basis as well. We examined this proposition in an
   experiment conducted with children 8, 12, and 16 years of age.
   Participants were asked to evaluate an advertised product (e.g.,
   athletic shoes) with a familiar brand name that was either popular
   (e.g., Nike(R)) or less popular (e.g., Kmart(R)). The advertised product
   was physically identical in both cases, allowing us to explore whether
   the brand name had meaning for children apart from its name familiarity
   or perceptual features. The use of conceptual brand meanings was
   assessed by asking participants to make several types of brand-related
   judgments including evaluations of the advertised product, impressions
   of the owners of the advertised product, and evaluations of possible
   extensions of the popular brand name advertised. Results indicate that
   by the time children reach 12 years of age, they use brand names as an
   important conceptual cue in consumer judgments.

AB In this research, we tested the effects of chronic and temporary sources
   of accessibility on impression formation. Although some research
   suggests that chronicity amplifies temporary effects because of greater
   susceptibility to external primes, other research suggests that
   chronicity masks temporary effects because of redundance. We demonstrate
   in a thought listing study that in the domain of gender stereotypes,
   trait stereotypes may be routinely applied by those with a medium or
   high tendency to stereotype women, making external primes redundant.
   Based on this redundancy, we proposed that gender stereotypical primes
   will have little influence on subsequent judgments of those with a
   medium or high tendency to gender stereotype. In contrast, gender
   stereotypical primes will result in the classic assimilation effect for
   those with a low tendency to gender stereotype. We tested these
   propositions in the domain of female role portrayals in advertising and
   examined the effect of advertisements that feature women as homemakers
   (vs. do not feature women) on trait judgments of a target woman whose
   behaviors are ambiguously described. Results from 2 experiments show
   that, as predicted by the redundancy hypothesis, judgments of medium and
   high tendency to stereotype participants are not affected by
   advertisements portraying homemakers. Also as expected, judgments of low
   tendency to stereotype participants are assimilated to the homemaker
   prime. These results hold across tendency to trait stereotype
   (Experiment 1) and tendency to role stereotype (Experiment 2) and for
   trait judgments as well as gift choice. Theoretical and practical
   implications of these findings are discussed.

   advertising executions and their relevance to the brand claims in the
   advertisement influence consumer memory for the claims. We infer the
   underlying memory processes by testing claims memory using recall,
   recognition, and indirect tests following incidental exposure to
   advertisements manipulating humor strength and claims relevance. Memory
   for the humor component was checked as corroborating evidence. We also
   validated these inferences by contrasting these effects on claims and
   humor memory with those under instructed elaboration. Study I shows that
   for humor of low claims relevance, brand claims memory is an inverted
   U-shaped function of humor strength. Compared to both nonhumor and
   high-strength humor, moderate humor facilitates both encoding and
   retrieval of the claims. The patterns of humor memory and instructed
   elaboration effects suggest that low-relevance humor is not
   spontaneously linked to the claims even when processing resources are
   available. Study 2 shows that when strong humor is made more relevant,
   brand claims memory improves even during incidental exposure.
   Corresponding humor memory and instructed elaboration effects imply that
   relevance encourages the formation of humor-claims links that facilitate
   encoding and retrieval of the claims. The results show that although
   strong humor inhibits the processing received by the brand claims,
   enhancing its claims relevance can compensate for such inhibition.

   as a source of brand associations, which can be linked to one's mental
   representation of self to meet self-verification or self-enhancement
   goals. We conceptualize this linkage at an aggregate level in terms of
   self-brand connections, that is, the extent to which individuals have
   incorporated a brand into their self-concept. In 2 studies, we show that
   brands used by member groups and aspiration groups can become connected
   to consumers' mental representation of self as they use these brands to
   define and create their self-concepts. Results from Experiment 1 show
   that the degree to which member group and aspiration group usage
   influences individual self-brand connections is contingent on the degree
   to which the individual belongs to a member group or wishes to belong to
   an aspiration group. In Experiment 2, we found that for individuals with
   self-enhancement goals, aspiration group brand use has a greater impact
   on self-brand connections; for individuals with self-verification goals,

AB Marketers often commit to matching competitors' prices by offering
   price-matching guarantees (PMGs). Theory, however, shows that PMGs can
   either foster price competition and lower market prices or facilitate
   price collusion and raise market prices. In 3 experiments, we tested if
   consumers suspect collusion in such tactics and if this suspicion in
   turn affects their preferences for PMGs. Experiment 1 showed that
   consumers prefer markets where sellers offer PMGs over those that do
   not, suggesting little or no suspicion of collusion. Experiment 2
   replicated these findings and extended them by showing that although
   most consumers prefer PMG markets, consumers higher in need for
   cognition (NFC) do, consistent with the greater suspicion hypothesized,
   prefer PMG markets more weakly. However, this weakened preference
   emerged from concerns over lower product quality in PMG markets more so
   than expectations of unduly high prices. Experiment 3 then tested the
   collusive potential of PMGs by placing participants in the role of a
   government regulator charged with finding collusion in various markets.
   Regardless of explicit primes and NFC, participants perceived PMGs as
   competitive devices that reduce prices rather than collusive devices
   that raise them. In contrast to the assumptions underlying
   game-theoretic models, consumers often lack the strategic sophistication
   necessary to detect the collusive potential of PMGs, a limitation that
   implicates legislation to moderate the use of such devices.

AB We propose that the essence of consumption is the mental process of
   generating utility from products, that this process expends consumption
   effort, and that consumers take consumption effort into account in their
   decision making. In 2 studies, we tested the hypothesis that consumption
   preferences become more ambitious-individuals become more inclined to
   choose challenging-to-consume products-when consumer energy levels are
   elevated. In Study 1, energy induced by ingesting caffeine increased
   participants' tendency to choose subtitled foreign movies rather than
   domestic remakes of those same movies. Study 2 demonstrated the same
   effect with naturally occurring energy levels and with consumption
   experiences whose effortfulness and quality were varied independently.
   In choosing among sets of poems to read, participants with higher levels
   of energy exhibited less effort aversion but neither more nor less
   quality seeking. A reanalysis of Study I showed that the energy effect
   is not simply a case of consumers using more energy when they have more
   energy, because the energy effect disappeared when participants were
   made aware of the energy source, suggesting that a preference-correction
   process occurred. The energy dependence of consumer preferences affords
   tactical opportunities for marketers, but the welfare implications for
   consumers are intriguingly unclear, because in both studies we found
   that energy increased participants' choice of challenging consumption
   experiences without increasing their liking of those experiences.

AB As an emerging value, materialism helps explain the consumer behavior of
   youth. Using a national sample of 9- to 14-year-olds, in this study we
   developed a Youth Materialism Scale. The findings suggest that more
   materialistic youth tend to shop more and save less. They are most
   interested in new products and most responsive to advertising and
   promotional efforts. Their parents view them as more expert with regard
   to products and they wield more purchase influence on their parents.
   Parents who are more materialistic tend to have children who are more
   materialistic. This study also reveals a modest negative relation
   between materialism and liking for school and school performance.

   these judgments are often insensitive to set size and why evaluations
   based on limited information tend to be stronger (more extreme and
   confident) than is warranted. The findings indicate that the importance
   of the given or known attributes is often overestimated, leading to
   evaluations that are overly extreme. The experiments also revealed
   important factors moderating this insensitivity to limited information.
   The overweighing of the given evidence was attenuated when participants
   were knowledgeable of the target domain. Overweighing and the formation
   of extreme judgments based on limited information was also diminished
   when participants considered their judgmental criteria prior to
   evaluating a target or when a comparison target described by different
   attributes was present.

   been equally influenced by an East Asian and Western cultural
   orientation, respond to various types of persuasion appeals that promote
   values unique to a particular culture. In the first experiment, I found
   that biculturals, relative to monoculturals, tend to react favorably
   toward both individually and interpersonally focused appeals due to
   their having 2 equally developed and accessible cultural dispositions.
   In the second experiment, I identified boundary conditions under which
   having relatively equal access to both cultural dispositions leads to
   favorable responses. Results indicate that biculturals who tend to
   compartmentalize each culture react less favorably toward appeals that
   are both individually and interpersonally focused than biculturals who
   tend to integrate the 2 cultures. In other words, the former type of
   bicultural prefers appeals that activate one cultural disposition,
   whereas the latter type of bicultural favors appeals that activate both
   cultural dispositions. These findings are discussed in light of the
   growing trend toward multi-culturalism and the increasing need for
   researchers to understand the impact of this trend on various consumer
   behavior issues.

AB We examined the benefits to a corporate sponsor of two types of
   philanthropic activities-cause promotions and advocacy advertising.
   Results from 4 laboratory studies indicate that perceptions of corporate
   social responsibility (CSR) are affected by consumers' elaboration
   levels. Consumer perceptions of CSR are more favorable for cause
   promotions, which do not receive much elaboration, than they are for
   advocacy advertising, which prompts more elaboration. In addition,
   perceived congruence between the sponsor and the social issue is shown
   to moderate these effects: Higher congruence between the sponsor and
   social issue increases favorable ratings of CSR for cause promotions but
   only if elaboration on the sponsorship activity is facilitated. On the
   other hand, lower congruence increases favorable ratings of CSR for
   advocacy advertising as long as elaboration on the sponsorship is not
   constrained. We also found that higher congruence enhances CSR ratings
   if participants are primed to focus their attention on the sponsor
   brand, whereas lower congruence enhances CSR if participants are primed
   to focus their attention on the social issue.

AB In this work, we examined the surprising value consumers attach to
   getting a bargain. Past research has largely understood this phenomenon
   in terms of the impact discounts have on perceptions of fairness.
   However, the evidence for this explanation is inconclusive due to a
   number of viable alternatives as well as issues relating to construct
   and external validity. The experiments we report here provide clearer
   evidence for the basic assertion that discounts increase purchase
   satisfaction due to the nonfinancial rewards that are associated with
   perceptions of fairness. Furthermore, current notions of fairness in the
   promotion literature are extended by showing that social cues such as
   the relative size of the discount received by another customer and the
   loyalty status of that customer can also have an important impact on
   fairness and purchase satisfaction. We suggest an integration of
   transaction utility theory (Thaler, 1985) and equity theory (Bagozzi,
   1975) to account for these findin.

AB Prior research suggests that consumers evaluate firms more negatively if
   they attribute the firm's business practices to firm-serving motivations
   rather than to motivations that serve the public good. We propose an
   alternative hypothesis: Firm-serving attributions lower evaluation of
   the firm only when they are inconsistent with the firm's expressed
   motive. As such, the negative effect of consumer skepticism regarding a
   firm's motives can be inhibited by public acknowledgment of the
   strategic benefits to the firm. The power of this inhibition procedure
   was demonstrated in an experiment in which we manipulated the salience
   of firm-serving benefits and the firm's publicly stated motive. Consumer
   evaluation of the sponsoring firm was lowest in conditions when
   firm-serving benefits were salient and the firm outwardly stated purely
   public-serving motives. This experiment also revealed that the potential
   negative effects of skepticism were the most pronounced when individuals
   engaged in causal attribution prior to company evaluation. Finally, in
   this study we measured the different effects on attribution and
   evaluation of 2 distinct forms of skepticism: situational skepticism,
   which is a momentary state of distrust of an actor's motivations, and
   dispositional skepticism, which is an individual's ongoing tendency to
   be suspicious of other people's motives.

   assessed cognitive responses to demonstrate that this influence of
   trustworthiness on persuasion holds for familiar endorsers likely to be
   used in actual advertisements. Study 2 demonstrated that trustworthiness
   can be influenced by individuals endorsing too many products, with
   similar persuasion consequences (i.e., untrustworthy endorsers prompt
   greater scrutiny of product-related attributes than trustworthy
   endorsers). Study 2 also found that the attitudes that resulted from an
   untrustworthy endorser came to mind faster, even when those attitudes
   were equivalently positive-thus demonstrating that elaboration can
   influence attitude accessibility. This research provides evidence that
   attitude extremity may not be a sufficient indicator of advertising
   effectiveness, in that equally extreme attitudes can vary as to the
   bases by which they were formed, their underlying strength, and their
   effectiveness. Further, this research provides theoretical and strategic

   mapping theory to reach a better understanding of their differences. In
   3 experiments, we compare consumers' responses to analogy and
   categorization cues and find that analogy places much greater
   constraints on knowledge transfer than categorization by focusing
   consumers on relational similarities. Illustrating this, the analogy
   group in Study 1 was just as likely as the categorization group to
   generate relational inferences, but much less likely to generate
   attribute inferences. Likewise, the results of Study 2 indicate that the
   analogy group restricted their processing of features lying outside the

   categorization group. Building on these findings, Study 3 demonstrates
   that, under certain circumstances, analogy and categorization work

   Desire for consumer vengeance (DCV) is conceptualized as the desire of a
   decision maker to "get even" with an entity, such as a firm, in response
   to a perceived wrongdoing. Drawing on research is psychology and
   organization behavior, a theoretical framework is proposed for
   understanding variables that influence the extent to which the DCV is
   felt and the conditions under which one acts on such feelings. The
   results of 2 experiments show that, given sufficient desire for
   vengeance, some consumers will choose a suboptimal decision outcome to
   get even with a firm. We also find that it is the interpersonal factors
   of the redress experience, rather than its tangible outcomes, that drive
   consumers to exact revenge on firms after a dissatisfying experience.

AB This article studies the presence, resilience, and direction of the
   self-positivity bias under various conditions to examine the role of
   self-esteem maintenance as an important antecedent for the bias.
   Experiment 1 manipulates the perceptions of the uncontrollability of
   cancer and presence of base-rate information as independent variables
   that together eliminate the self-positivity bias in perceptions of the
   risk of cancer. Experiment 2 shows the same effects using 4 life events
   that differ in terms of valence and perceived controllability; that is,
   base-rate information affects self-estimates for uncontrollable life
   events, reducing the self-positivity bias, but does not affect
   self-estimates for controllable events. Experiment 3 shows that these
   effects only apply to optimistic individuals who fail to incorporate
   base-rate information into their self-perceptions for controllable
   events. In contrast, pessimists use base rates to update. their
   self-estimates irrespective of the controllability of the event.
   Overall, the pattern suggests that self-positivity is attenuated in
   conditions that implicate self-esteem. Implications for health care
   marketing are discussed.

   perceptions, and choice is a problem that interests both consumer
   researchers and practitioners. We propose that the extent of
   constructive processing moderates mood effects with stronger effects
   when constructive processing is higher. In addition, we propose that
   when consumers have unrestricted versus constrained processing
   resources, moods are more likely to operate through affect priming and
   less likely to operate through the affect-as-information process. The
   results from 3 experiments support these hypotheses. We discuss
   implications of the findings for models of how affect influences

AB The sponsorship of social messages is becoming increasingly popular
   among corporations. Despite the growing involvement of corporations in
   the marketing of causes, little research has been done to guide these
   initiatives. Before corporations become more actively involved in the
   sponsorship of social messages, it is important to understand whether
   sponsor identity impacts the effectiveness of these messages. This
   article presents a preliminary investigation into the differences
   created by corporate versus nonprofit sponsorship of a social message.
   Results from two experiments suggest that consumers process
   socially-oriented messages differently based on the identity of the
   sponsor. Participants who viewed an anti-drinking and driving message
   sponsored by the nonprofit organization, MADD, tended to infer more
   positive, society-serving motives of the sponsor, whereas those who
   viewed the same ad sponsored by Budweiser, a corporation, inferred more
   negative, self-serving (ulterior) motives of the sponsor. However,
   neither message affected the participant's attitude toward the sponsor
   of the message.

AB Consumers are often confronted with value-laden decisions that challenge
   their principles and beliefs. For example, many consumers with strong
   social responsibility principles consider the effects of general
   corporate behavior (e.g., political views, environmental disasters) and
   of the product's manufacture, consumption, or disposal (e.g., animal
   testing, environmental harm) on society's overall well-being. Because
   these product dimensions do not fit easily into traditional decision
   theories, a new conceptual framework that incorporates and emphasizes
   the consumer's enduring principles and values is explored in this study.
   The results indicate that image theory (Beach & Mitchell, 1987) provides
   a useful structure for describing the decision process in a value-laden
   decision context. This study also expands our understanding of image
   theory by examining all 3 images (values, goals, and strategies)
   simultaneously in the same decision context for the first time.

AB In this research, we investigate consumers' motivations for disclosing
   personal information to relationship-seeking marketers. We explore the
   impact of consumers' relationship perceptions, the nature of benefits
   offered by marketers in exchange for requested information, and the type
   of information requested on consumers' disclosure willingness, focusing
   on consumers' forecasts of 2 types of potential disclosure-related loss
   (i.e., loss of privacy and loss of face), which are shown to mediate
   this decision. The results of an experiment revealed that although
   participants with relatively deep relationship perceptions were more
   likely to reveal "privacy-related" personal information, they were more
   reluctant to reveal embarrassing information. The findings also suggest
   that although loyal customers found the exchange of privacy-related
   personal information for customized benefit offerings (relative to
   noncustomized offerings) attractive, the reverse was true for
   embarrassing information; these participants seemed to find the exchange
   of customized offerings for this latter type of information
   unattractive. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of
   the findings for consumer researchers and relationship-seeking marketing

AB Recent research has demonstrated that merely measuring an individual's
   purchase intentions changes his or her subsequent behavior in the
   market. Several different alternative explanations have been proposed to
   explain why this "mere-measurement effect" occurs. However, these
   explanations have not been tested to date. The purpose of this article
   is to test several competing explanations for why measuring general
   intentions to purchase (e.g., How likely are you to buy a car?) changes
   specific brand-level behavior (e.g., which specific brand of car is
   purchased). The results provide a clearer understanding of the cognitive
   mechanism through which the mere-measurement effect operates. The
   results show that when asked to provide general intentions to select a
   product in a given category, respondents are more likely to choose
   options toward which they hold positive and accessible attitudes, and
   are less likely to choose options for which they hold negative and
   accessible attitudes, compared to a control group of participants who
   are not asked a general intentions question. These results provide
   support for the conjecture that asking a general purchase intent
   question influences behavior by changing the accessibility of attitudes
   toward specific options in the category.

AB Intelligent recommendation systems can be based on 2 basic principles:
   collaborative filters and individual-based agents. In this work we
   examine the learning function that results from these 2 general types of
   teaming-smart agents. There has been significant work on the predictive
   properties of each type, but no work has examined the patterns in their
   learning from feedback over repeated trials. Using simulations, we
   create clusters of "consumers" with heterogeneous utility functions and
   efforful reservation utility thresholds. The consumers go shopping with
   one of the designated smart agents, receive recommendations from the
   agents, and purchase products they like and reject ones they do not.
   Based on the purchase-no purchase behavior of the consumers, agents
   learn about the consumers and potentially improve the quality of their
   recommendations. We characterize learning curves by modified exponential
   functions with an intercept for percentage of recommendations accepted
   at Trial 0, an asymptotic rate of recommendation acceptance, and a rate
   at which learning moves from intercept to asymptote. We compare the
   learning of a baseline random recommendation agent, an individual-based
   logistic-regression agent, and two types of collaborative filters that
   rely on K-mean clustering (popular in most commercial applications) and
   nearest-neighbor algorithms. Compared to the collaborative filtering
   agents, the individual agent (a) learns more slowly, initially, but
   performs better in the long run when the environment is stable; (b) is
   less negatively affected by permanent changes in the consumer's utility
   function; and (c) is less adversely affected by error in the reservation
   threshold to which consumers compare a recommended product's utility.
   The K-mean agent reaches a lower asymptote but approaches it faster,
   reflecting a surprising stickiness of target classifications after
   feedback from recommendations made under initial (incorrect) hypotheses.

   information channels operate as substitutes as far as information
   quality is concerned; (b) during each segment of the search consumers
   tend to use multiple sources of information, and in that context
   information channels act as complements, which illustrates the
   synergistic effect of search between channels and the importance of
   jointly estimating consumers' information channel choices; and (c)
   utility derived from information search changes as time passes, which
   indicates that empirical research should use panel data to capture the

   aspect of the ad, the degree to which the ad tells a story; and I aspect
   of the ad-individual interface, whether the individual is hooked by the

   is used to identify 4 cognitive "components" of customer-based brand
   equity. These are labeled as global brand attitude, strength of
   preference, brand knowledge, and brand heuristic. A conceptual framework
   of how these components (or subconstructs) are interrelated is proposed

   categories. Covariance structure modeling is used as the analysis
   methodology. The results indicate that all the identified cognitive
   components are important determinants of customer-based brand equity.
   Specifically, the brand heuristic component serves as an important
   mediator in 2 "cognitive chains" that link global brand attitude to
   brand knowledge and global brand attitude to strength of preference,
   respectively. The study findings have important implications for
   designing equity maintenance strategies for frequently purchased

AB Marketers routinely make use of stated consumer preferences and the
   relative attribute-importance weights implied by these preferences when
   making decisions on issues such as advertising messages and product
   design. Using this information as a basis for managerial decision making
   is risky, though, if stated preferences diverge from actual choices.
   Practical evidence that such a divergence is of concern is provided by
   the current trend toward the use of stated choice-based conjoint
   analysis. This article examines differences between the
   attribute-importance weights consumers use during value elicitation and
   the attribute weights revealed to influence actual choice. The results
   of an empirical analysis of automobile stated preference and purchase
   decisions, and an experiment and subsequent qualitative analysis of wine
   choice, converge to suggest that consumers' attribute weightings differ
   in value elicitation versus choice in a reliable manner. Specifically,
   we demonstrate a tangibility effect-the tendency for tangible attributes
   to be weighted relatively more heavily than intangible attributes in
   choice as compared to in value elicitation. The process underlying the
   tangibility effect is discussed, as are the implications for researchers
   and managers.

   describing choice alternatives. Building on the concept of
   self-regulation, it is argued that attribute evaluations are moderated
   by individuals' goal orientation and, specifically, that attributes
   compatible with individuals' regulatory orientation tend to be
   overweighted in choice. This proposition is tested by examining the
   impact of goal orientation on consumer preferences in 3 different
   contexts: (a) hedonic versus utilitarian attributes, (b) performance
   versus reliability attributes, and (c) attractive versus unattractive
   (good vs. bad) attributes. The data show that prevention-focused
   individuals are more likely to overweight (in relative terms)
   utilitarian, reliability-related, and unattractive attributes than
   promotion-focused consumers, who are more likely to place relatively
   more weight on hedonic, performance-related, and attractive attributes.
   Considered together, these findings support the proposition that
   attributes compatible with individuals' goal orientation tend to be

   studies employ the same general type of framing, such as goal framing.
   This article attempts to show that by extending the heuristic-systematic
   model-based explanation of message framing effects to incorporate
   conditions that may prompt both systematic and heuristic processing,
   this theory may accommodate some of the aberrant findings. The research
   reported shows that by varying a message issue's risky implications and
   its personal relevance, 2 factors that potentially influence the type of
   processing people employ, systematic, heuristic, or concurrently both
   types of processing were evoked and influenced people's judgments,
   causing alternative patterns of message framing effects to occur. The
   results offer insight into how each of these types of processing can
   affect message framing outcomes, and they imply that certain seemingly
   aberrant findings in the literature can be reconciled with this extended
   theory.

AB This article proposes that narrative processing creates or enhances
   self-brand connections (SBC) because people generally interpret the
   meaning of their experiences by fitting them into a story. Similarly, in
   response to an ad that tells a story, narrative processing may create a
   link between a brand and the self when consumers attempt to map incoming
   narrative information onto stories in memory. Our approach rests on the
   notion that a brand becomes more meaningful the more closely it is
   linked to the self. We conceptualize this linkage at an aggregate level
   in terms of SBCs, that is, the extent to which consumers have
   incorporated the brand into their self-concepts. The results of an
   experiment show that narrative processing in response to a narratively
   structured ad is positively related to SBCs, which in turn have a
   positive relation with brand attitudes and behavioral intentions.

   as a source of information about the underlying value of the product
   offered as a free gift. The value-discounting hypothesis argues that by
   virtue of being offered as a free gift, products will be valued less as
   evinced by lower purchase intentions and a lower price that consumers
   are willing to pay for them. Conditions that inhibit the
   value-discounting effect include the (a) presence of alternate price
   information to make judgments about the value of the gift, and (b)

   understand how the human awareness of death affects materialism,
   conspicuous consumption, and consumer decisions. The pursuit of wealth
   and culturally desired commodities are hypothesized to reinforce those
   beliefs that function to protect people from existential anxieties.
   Following a brief overview of TMT and research, evidence is reviewed
   that explicates how intimations of mortality increase materialism as a
   way to enhance self-esteem and affects consumer decisions that support
   one's cultural worldview. Adverse consequences of materialistic and
   consumeristic worldviews are described and the challenges for future
   research to discover ways to alleviate them are considered.

AB Because products are rarely described completely, consumers often form
   inferences that go beyond the information given. We review research on
   the processes, bases, and the judgment contexts in which inferences are
   formed. The most basic processes are induction (inferences from specific
   instances to general principles) versus deduction (inferences front
   general principles to specific instances). Stimulus-based inferences are
   formed on-line (as information is encountered) using situationally
   available information, whereas memory-based (ortheory-based) inferences
   are formed using prior knowledge and experience. Inferences can pertain
   to a single product judged in isolation (a singular judgment context) or
   to multiple products considered in relation to one another (a
   comparative judgment context). This 2 x 2 x 2(Induction vs. Deduction x
   Stimulus-Based vs. Memory-Based x Singular vs. Comparative Judgment)
   theoretical framework suggests that there are 8 different types of
   inferences that consumers may form. Based on this framework, we identify
   gaps in the literature and suggest directions for future research.

   for each first, 200 for each second, 300 for each third purchase vs. 200
   for each first, second, and third purchase) yielded irrelevant trends
   and should have led participants to ignore loyalty points as a basis for
   choice. However, choices were influenced by points even when consumers
   were provided with other truly discriminating information (e.g., price)
   and the irrelevance of the loyalty points was readily discernable. This
   implies that irrelevant information can influence choice when other,
   easily justifiable bases for decisions are available and, therefore,
   that irrelevant information can function as more than a tie-breaker.
   Other implications for research on irrelevant attributes, medium

   comprised of a subtle, odd element in a typical scripted request, the
   "disruption," followed by a persuasive phrase, the "reframing." Based on
   the thought-disruption hypothesis (Petty & Wegener, 1999), we argue that
   its impact is generalizable across situations and that disrupting a
   conventional sales script not only increases the impact of the new
   refraining, but also increases susceptibility to influence resulting
   from other (congruence-based) persuasion techniques embedded in the
   influence setting. Three experiments provided support for our
   expectations. Specifically, the DTR technique reduced the extent of
   counter-argumentation to a sales script and boosted the impact of two
   other persuasion techniques: the continued questions procedure and
   message-goal congruence. The theoretical and practical implications of
   these findings are discussed.

   associations of celebrity endorsers on these dimensions can indeed
   reinforce equivalent consumer beliefs about a brand's fun and classiness
   benefits. However, this occurs only if a social consumption context is
   evoked, and only if the brand image beliefs are appropriate to the
   consumer schema for the product category involved. Moreover, under these
   facilitating conditions, such ad-created brand image beliefs have an
   impact only on brand purchase intentions and not on brand attitudes.
   Results have implications for the growing literature on different types

AB Metacognitive routes to judgment may be taken more often than suggested
   by Schwarz (2004). First, judgments that appear to be consistent with a
   systematic processing account maybe based on higher order metacognitive
   theories. Specifically, individuals' inferential judgments based on
   naive theories about retrieval ease may be interpreted to be potentially
   biased, resulting in an adjustment in the opposite direction of the
   initial judgment to correct for the bias. Second, whereas favorable
   attitudes may reflect the positive experience of processing fluency,
   favorable attitudes may also reflect naive theories at work. When the
   target (e.g., brand name, logo, etc.) can be more easily processed, the
   hedonic experience of processing fluency gives rise to more favorable
   attitudes toward the target. However, when information about the target
   (e.g., an ad highlighting benefits of the brand) can be more easily
   processed, individuals may interpret the experience of processing
   fluency based on naive theory and attribute the experience to the
   information being more persuasive, resulting in more favorable attitudes
   toward the target.

AB The research reported in this article examines how multiple affective
   stimuli of differing valence (i.e., both positive and negative) are
   integrated into an overall affective response. Prior research on the
   integration of positive and negative information has not focused on
   affect, and previous affect integration research has not considered both
   positive and negative feelings. Two experiments investigate how positive
   and negative affective stimuli combine to influence overall affective
   responses to an advertisement, content-specific beliefs, and overall ad
   evaluations. Both recency and contrast effects were observed on positive
   affective response and positive beliefs, but comparable effects on
   negative affective response and negative beliefs were not evident. The
   results support a motivational influence of affect on judgments.

AB This article discusses the need for more satisfactory implicit measures
   in consumer psychology and assesses the theoretical foundations,
   validity, and value of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) as a measure
   of implicit consumer social cognition. Study 1 demonstrates the IAT's
   sensitivity to explicit individual differences in brand attitudes,
   ownership, and usage frequency, and shows their correlations with
   IAT-based measures of implicit brand attitudes and brand relationship
   strength. In Study 2, the contrast between explicit and implicit
   measures of attitude toward the ad for sportswear advertisements
   portraying African American (Black) and European American (White)
   athlete-spokespersons revealed different patterns of responses to
   explicit and implicit measures in Black and White respondents. These
   were explained in terms of self-presentation biases and system
   justification theory. Overall, the results demonstrate that the IAT
   enhances our understanding of consumer responses, particularly when
   consumers are either unable or unwilling to identify the sources of
   influence on their behaviors or opinions.

   Implicit attitudes were measured using the Implicit Association Test
   (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Study 1 showed expected
   differences in implicit attitudes between users of two leading yogurt
   brands, also revealing significant correlations between IAT-measured
   implicit attitudes and explicit attitudes. In Study 2, users of two fast
   food restaurants (McDonald's and Milk Bar) showed implicit attitudinal
   preference for their favorite restaurant. In Study 3, implicit attitudes
   of users of two soft drinks (Coca-Cola and Pepsi) predicted brand
   preference, product usage, and brand recognition in a blind taste test.
   A meta-analytic combination of the three studies showed that the use of
   IAT measures increased the prediction of behavior relative to explicit
   attitude measures alone.

   products. In Study 1, valenced objects were presented moving
   horizontally or vertically on a screen, thereby inducing either head
   shaking or head nodding. Objects were also presented without movement.
   Induced nodding led to more favorable evaluations of positively valenced
   products but did not affect the evaluation of negatively valenced ones.
   Similarly, head shaking led to more unfavorable evaluations of
   negatively valenced products but did not affect the evaluation of
   positive ones. In Study 2, participants evaluated positively valenced
   products more favorably when they flexed their arms while making the
   evaluation and evaluated negatively valenced products more unfavorably
   when they extended their arms during evaluation. However, arm flexion
   had no effect on evaluations of negative products, and arm extensions
   had no effect on evaluations of positive ones. Participants' willingness
   to buy the products followed a similar pattern. The theoretical
   implications and the applications of these body feedback effects are

AB Recent research (Tormala & Petty, 2002) has demonstrated that when
   people resist persuasion, they can perceive this resistance and become
   more certain of their initial attitudes. This research explores the role
   of source credibility in determining when this effect occurs. In two
   experiments, participants received a counterattitudinal persuasive
   message. When participants counterargued this message, they became more
   certain of their attitudes, but only when it came from a source with
   high expertise. When the message came from a source with low expertise,
   resisting it had no impact on attitude certainty. This effect was shown
   using both a traditional measure of attitude certainty (Experiment 1)
   and a well-established consequence of certainty-the correspondence
   between attitudes and behavioral intentions (Experiment 2). In addition,
   the effect was confined to high elaboration conditions, and occurred
   even when participants were not explicitly instructed to counterargue.
   These results are consistent with a metacognitive framework proposed to
   understand resistance to persuasion.

   (a willingness to turn a blind eye to taboo trade-offs when it is in

   reframe behaviors that violate these norms. It further suggests that

AB The normative multiattribute utility model is not a good predictor of

   trade-offs, if they are averse to using a single metric (e.g., price or
   utility) to align non-comparable alternatives, and if there is a desire
   to take into account the identity of the actors involved (McGraw &
   Tetlock, 2005). Prescriptively, there may be some decision contexts
   (e.g., high-consequence consumer decisions) where such non-normative
   behaviors are not in the best interest of the decision makers. Methods
   to encourage more normative decision making are outlined including: (a)
   decision context mechanisms (e.g., the setting of default options or
   reference prices, the provision of an acceptable framing of the
   decision, or alternative response measures) and (b) consumer-based
   mechanisms (e.g., recommending the use of an agent, providing coping
   mechanisms, or providing social cues of acceptability).

   accurate mental representation of the text content of ads is essential
   for comprehension and can influence evaluations. Two conditions must be
   met in order to form a mental representation: referential continuity and
   coherence. A text possesses referential continuity if each of its parts
   refers, implicitly or explicitly, to an entity introduced in the
   previous part. A text is coherent if individuals can readily integrate
   its parts. Four empirical studies suggest that the repetition of certain
   verbal and pictorial cues can help provide referential continuity and
   that an ad's structure, or presentation format, can facilitate coherence
   but only when referential continuity is established.

   representations (i.e., judgments of relative "size"). The magnitude
   representation associated with the numerical value of a price may be the
   same as (congruent) or different from (incongruent) the magnitude
   representation associated with some other related dimension. We
   conducted 3 experiments to examine the effects of congruent versus
   incongruent magnitude representations on price perceptions and purchase
   intentions. We find that congruent magnitude representations result in
   more favorable price knowledge (i.e., greater value perceptions and
   lower price judgments) and increased purchase likelihood. Our findings
   suggest that consumers are not consciously aware of the role of

   competitor. In 3 experiments, we examined the conditions in which these
   decoy effects occur. When participants reported their preferences
   immediately after being exposed to the information about them, the
   influence of decoys on preferences was attributable to the justification
   they provided for choosing the target over the competitor. (That is, a
   decoy had an impact if and only if the target was superior to the decoy
   but the competitor was not.) When participants evaluated each product
   individually before making their choices, however, they based their
   preferences on these evaluations. In this case, decoys exerted their
   influence through their impact on the values that participants assigned
   to the attributes on which the evaluations were based. This influence
   was evident even when the decoy was clearly inferior to both the target
   and competitor. Moreover, it occurred under conditions in which the
   target and competitor were in different product categories and also when

   causes that are not. In this research, we examined the impact of context
   information and need for cognitive closure on these estimates. In 2
   experiments, participants with a low need for cognitive closure used the
   informational content of experimenter provided and self-generated
   context information as a basis for making likelihood estimates. In
   contrast, participants with a high need for closure did not use

AB Prior research has established that categorization plays a central role
   in new product learning. Very little is known, however, about
   category-based learning under conditions of categorization ambiguity. Of
   particular interest is whether and under what circumstances consumers
   might employ a multiple- (vs. single-) category strategy to generate
   inferences about ambiguous products. In this research, we identified 2
   factors-category familiarity and the nature of the category cue-that are
   responsible for determining whether inferences are based on a single
   category or multiple, competing categories. The results of 3 studies
   suggest that when an ambiguous product is described in terms of
   conflicting conceptual and perceptual category cues, a single category
   inference strategy is employed when the perceptually cued category is
   more familiar than the conceptually cued category. In particular,
   inferences are based largely on the perceptually cued category under
   these circumstances. However, when the perceptually cued category is
   less than or equal to the conceptually cued category in familiarity, a
   multiple category inference strategy is employed and inferences are
   based on both the perceptually and conceptually cued categories.

AB I explored advice acceptance for high-stakes decisions (i.e., those with
   subjectively important and risky outcomes), focusing on the relative
   influence of two components of consumer trust-benevolence and
   expertise-as well as perceived emotional decision difficulty.
   Participants solicited advice from experts when their decisions were low
   in perceived emotional difficulty but favored the advice of
   predominantly benevolent providers when making highly emotionally
   difficult decisions. Although consumers who faced emotionally difficult
   decisions were willing to trade off expertise for benevolence, they did
   not perceive this non-normative trade-off to influence decision quality.
   Instead, the results support a "stress buffering" effect whereby
   consumers were more confident in the accuracy of predominantly
   benevolent providers' advice.

AB In 3 experiments, we show that price-matching guarantees affect the
   process through which consumers translate price information into
   subjective judgments. In Experiment 1, we find that price-matching
   guarantees appear to change the standard used in price evaluation by
   raising consumers' estimates of the lowest and average prices in the
   market. This leads consumers to perceive products and stores that offer
   price-matching guarantees as less expensive. In Experiment 2, we show
   that evaluations of product price information are affected by the
   presence of a price-matching guarantee only when consumers do not know
   the range of market prices. In Experiment 3, we extend these findings to
   show that consumer evaluations of the cost of products in a store,
   inferred on the basis of store characteristics, are also influenced by
   the presence of a price-matching guarantee.

AB Consumers often rely heavily on price as a predictor of quality and
   typically overestimate the strength of this relation. Furthermore, the
   inferences of quality they make on the basis of price can influence
   their actual purchase decisions. Selective hypothesis testing appears to
   underlie the effects of information load and format on price-quality
   inferences. Results of 5 experiments converge on the conclusion that
   quality inferences are more heavily influenced by price when individuals
   have a high need for cognitive closure, when the amount of information
   presented is high (vs. low), and when the information presented is rank
   ordered in terms of quality rather than presented randomly. Furthermore,
   because consumers are willing to purchase more expensive brands when
   they perceive a high price-quality correlation, these variables can also
   influence their purchase decisions.

AB We investigated the antecedents of volunteer behavior within a
   hierarchical model of motivation and personality. In Study 1, we
   developed measures of altruism and volunteer orientation and combined
   them with three additional traits to predict a set of volunteer
   behaviors. In Studies 2 and 3, we added six functional motives for
   volunteering identified by Clary et al. (1998) to the model. Across the
   3 studies, the traits of altruism, the need for activity, and the need
   for learning were consistent predictors of volunteer orientation. In
   Studies 2 and 3, the measure of volunteer orientation was a significant
   predictor of the functional motives and of volunteer behaviors.
   Furthermore, the motive to help others was positively related to
   volunteering behaviors, and the motive of self-enhancement was
   negatively related to them. Overall, the results support the proposal
   that functional motives act like motivated reasons for acting and reside
   at the surface level in a hierarchical model of personality.

   both mediate and moderate the family structure-stress relation.
   Adolescents who associate happiness with material possessions report
   higher levels of family stress due to family disruption (parental
   divorce) compared with those who are less likely to associate happiness
   with material possessions. This finding runs contrary to recent

AB Consumer behavior can be influenced by mental processes that occur
   outside of conscious awareness. It is argued that in each domain of
   automaticity, researchers should specify the aspects of which consumers
   are presumably unaware. Three types of awareness are identified. These
   include awareness of (a) the environmental features that trigger an
   automatic process, (b) the automatic process itself, and (c) the outcome
   of that automatic process. Individuals may be unaware of one or more of
   these stages, thereby making the process nonconscious. With additional
   clarity regarding which aspects are nonconscious in which domains and
   the specific role that awareness plays, we can begin building a more
   comprehensive model of nonconscious processes in consumer behavior.

AB Although the argument that unconscious inputs are often key determinants
   of consumer decision making is compelling, it may be overstated,
   particularly with respect to choice. A comparison of the effect of
   conscious inputs (e.g., the attributes of options in the choice set) and
   unconscious inputs (e.g., a seemingly irrelevant observation or task)
   indicates that the former have a significant advantage. In particular,
   the impact of conscious inputs is supported by choice task norms and is
   less susceptible to being lost in the "noise" that is characteristic of
   most natural consumer environments (e.g., stores). Indeed, although
   consumers often have limited insight into influences and processes
   producing their choices, the assumption that consumers base their
   choices on conscious, willful evaluation of task-relevant inputs has
   been quite successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena. It is
   expected that future research will put greater emphasis on the
   interactions between conscious and unconscious influences on decision
   making.

   awareness for different stages of consumer decisions affected by
   environmental cues. In addition, we attempt to broaden the scope of this
   taxonomy by discussing its usefulness for consumer decisions in general.
   We generally support Simonson's (2005) claim that research based on
   consumers as conscious decision makers is indeed predictive of a wide
   variety of behavior. However, we also argue that the importance of
   consciousness should not be overstated. Conscious processes observed in
   a research laboratory are not representative of conscious processes in
   real life. The alternative model to describe effects of the environment
   on behavior by Janiszewski and van Osselaer (2005) may be useful to
   explain automaticity in goal-directed behavior, but it poorly describes
   other automatic behaviors.

   Study 2 demonstrates that these interaction effects are mediated by

   between attitude toward the salesperson and purchase intentions.
   Collectively, these results extend the persuasion literature by
   demonstrating that suspicion of motive is it dynamic state in which

   point-estimate judgments but also their range judgments about the
   attribute targeted by the information. A message consistent with the
   consumer's pretrial attitude caused the range to narrow. and a message
   that was inconsistent with the consumer's pretrial attitude caused the
   range to widen asymmetrically in the direction of the message. In Study
   2. judgment ranges were shown to have psychological validity in that a

   consequences and non-death-related consequences, they provide an
   explanation for maladaptive responses to fear appeals. Results from 2
   experiments indicate that participants who were highly committed to a

   toward drinking and driving when the message containing such attitudes
   was accompanied by a fear appeal that contained death as a consequence,

   financial and nonfinancial consequences of obtaining a deal. In
   contrast, the research reported here suggests that certain price
   deals-in this case, coupons-can also produce negative social
   consequences, such as creating an impression of cheapness or stinginess.
   Decisions to redeem coupons are shown to involve a trade-off between the
   social incentives to avoid coupons and competing economic and
   psychological incentives to redeem coupons. Consumers strategically
   adjusted their decision in response to factors that changed the relative
   strength of these incentives; specifically, they avoided coupons when
   they were concerned that coupon use would lead to negative social
   consequences but redeemed coupons when the circumstances reduced these
   concerns. Although decisions to refuse a coupon might violate principles
   of economic rationality, it is argued that such decisions are
   nevertheless functional as they serve important social goals. In this
   sense, it can be smarter for consumers to forgo a deal rather than
   obtain one.

   variables that attenuate the emotional response to negative events
   should further reduce the price disparity between buyers and sellers. In

   negative feelings (e.g., positive mood, framing of the transaction as
   involving no action) or increase the anticipated negative reaction to
   failure to act (e.g., priming errors of omission) further eliminate the

AB Consumers' reactions to a difference in price can depend on how it is
   framed. If buyers interpret paying $60 rather than $65 as getting a $5
   discount, then they are likely to consider paying $60 to be a gain and
   paying $65 to be a nongain. Alternatively, if they interpret having to
   pay $65 rather than $60 as incurring a $5 penalty, then they may
   consider paying $60 to be a nonloss and paying $65 to be a loss.
   Similarly, sellers can also experience gains, nongains, nonlosses, and
   losses. This article suggests that buyers are prevention focused and
   consequently place a greater emphasis on loss-related frames, whereas
   sellers are promotion focused and place a greater emphasis on
   gain-related frames. Therefore, for equivalent positive outcomes, buyers
   feel better about nonlosses, but sellers feel better about gains. For
   equivalent negative outcomes, buyers feel worse about losses, but
   sellers feel worse about nongains. These effects, however, disappear
   when there is little motivation to process information about the
   monetary transaction.

AB The symbolic meaning of commercial brands (often called brand
   personality) can represent the values and beliefs of a culture. When a
   set of global brands were rated on the same personality attributes in
   the United States and Korea, 6 common dimensions of brand personality
   and 2 factors unique to each culture were observed. The 2
   culture-specific factors in Korea (Passive Likeableness and Ascendancy)
   support our general hypothesis that Korean brand personality structure
   carries cultural meaning, reflecting the importance of Confucian values
   in Korea's social and economic systems. Although their cultural meaning
   is less clear, the 2 unique factors (White Collar and Androgyny) that
   emerged in the U.S. sample suggest changing cultural values associated
   with occupational status and gender roles.

AB Prior research suggests that bicultural individuals (i.e., individuals
   with 2 distinct sets of cultural values) shift the values they espouse
   depending on cues such as language. The authors examined whether the
   effects of language extend to a potentially less malleable domain,
   behavioral decisions, exploring the extent to which bilingual
   individuals shift the underlying strategies used to resolve choice
   problems. Although past research has explained language-induced shifts
   in terms of knowledge accessibility principles, the motivation to
   conform to observers' norms can also drive these shifts. This article
   focuses on shifts in the general strategy of avoiding losses rather than
   pursuing gains, which is more often exhibited by Chinese than by
   Westerners. Five studies of Hong Kong bicultural individuals found that
   language manipulation (Cantonese vs. English) increases tendencies to
   choose compromise options in a product decision task, endorse associated
   decision guidelines that advocate moderation as opposed to extreme
   paths, defer decision making in problems where it can be postponed, and
   endorse decision guidelines that advocate caution rather than decisive
   action. A motivational explanation of these effects was confirmed.

AB A successful sale depends on a customer's perception of the
   salesperson's personality, motivations, trustworthiness, and affect.
   Person perception research has shown that consistent and accurate
   assessments of these traits can be made based on very brief
   observations, or "thin slices." Thus, examining impressions based on
   thin slices offers an effective approach to study how perceptions of
   salespeople translate into real-world results, such as sales performance
   and customer satisfaction. The literature on the accuracy of thin-slice
   judgments is briefly reviewed. Then, 2 studies are presented that
   investigated the predictive validity of judgments of salespeople based
   on thin slices of the vocal channel. Participants rated 20-sec audio
   clips extracted from interviews with a sample of sales managers, on
   variables gauging interpersonal skills, task-related skills, and
   anxiety. Results supported the hypothesis that observability, of the
   rated variable is a key determinant in the criterion validity of
   thin-slice judgments. Implications for the use of thin-slice judgments
   in salesperson selection and customer satisfaction are discussed.

AB Personality research has fueled debate over whether human judgment
   should be characterized as accurate or error-prone. Research from the
   thin-slice tradition suggests that a degree of accuracy can be obtained
   when least expected. Consumer psychologists tempted to join the debate
   may be better served by identifying the contexts under which accuracy is
   most likely and least likely to be observed and by exploring the causal
   mechanisms underlying each outcome. In so doing, the substantive scope
   of consumer research may be expanded to include decision contexts that
   have been largely ignored but are of considerable importance. Moreover,
   decision processes may be illuminated that can inform the more useful
   debate over deliberative versus nondeliberative decision making.

AB Ambady, Krabbenhoft, Hogan, and Rosenthal (2006) demonstrated that "thin
   slices" or very brief observations of behavior are not only sufficient
   for drawing accurate automatic trait inferences, they actually improve
   accuracy, relative to inferences based on larger amounts of information.
   Too much information, too much knowledge, or too much analysis can
   reduce the accuracy of intuitive judgment. Who benefits most and what
   types of judgments benefit most from thin-slice data? When should people
   trust their intuition? The answers to these questions depend on
   informational variables, such as feedback quality and the consequences
   of inferential errors (Hogarth, 2001). Evidence is reviewed suggesting
   that consumers and managers should trust their intuition only when high
   quality (frequent, prompt, and diagnostic) feedback is available and
   when inferential errors are consequential and therefore easy to detect.

AB Mental accounts are often characterized as self-control devices that
   consumers employ to prevent excess spending and consumption. However,
   under certain conditions of ambiguity, the mental accounting process is
   malleable; that is, consumers have flexibility in assigning expenses to
   different mental accounts. We demonstrate how consumers flexibly
   classify expenses, or construct accounts, to justify spending. An
   expense that can be assigned to more than one account (i.e., an
   ambiguous expense) is more likely to be incurred than an unambiguous
   expense that is constrained either by existing budgets or by previously
   constructed accounts. We explore the justification processes that
   underlie these results and their implications for mental accounts as
   self-control devices.

   The results show that when the product is moderately typical of the core
   brand category, the accessibility, relevance, and distinctness of the
   manufacturer's core brand prompt participants to use the manufacturer's
   product line as a standard of comparison. Thus, they evaluate an
   extension product less favorably if it is moderately typical of a
   favorable core brand than if it is moderately typical of an unfavorable
   one. When the product description contains additional information about
   the extension, however, this difference is reversed among consumers who
   are knowledgeable about the general product category. These consumers
   use the general product category as a standard of comparison rather the
   core brand per se.

   purchases that are made on the Internet. Body esteem had a positive

   a negative influence on consumers' overall concern with the fit of
   apparel. Involvement with apparel and overall concern with fit, in turn,
   significantly influenced consumers' intentions to purchase apparel

   to buy on the Internet and those with high body boundary aberration were
   more likely to buy.

   products shortly afterward, the common features had little influence on
   their evaluations, and this was true regardless of whether they had made
   a preference rating, a similarity rating, or no rating at all before
   reporting these evaluations. In all cases, consumers apparently used one
   of the brands spontaneously as a standard of comparison for the other
   and, in doing so, discounted their common features. When their
   evaluation was delayed, however, shared features had greater impact. Two
   factors appear to be operating in the latter conditions. First, the
   alternative brand is less accessible and, therefore, is less likely to
   be used as a standard of comparison. Second, shared features are easier
   to recall than unique features, so they have a disproportional influence
   for this reason.

   appropriateness of a font for a product partly depend on the consistency
   between the connotative meaning of the font and that of the product

   appropriateness also depends on the connotative meaning of the font per

   level-or the degree of abstractness of mental representations-increases
   with temporal, spatial, or sensory distance. Three experiments show that
   the mere presence of a set of target brands at the time a choice is made
   encourages consumers to represent the brands in memory in terms of
   concrete lower-level construals. Consequently, preference stability is
   higher, preference-behavior consistency is greater, and product
   category-identification latencies for competing brands are slower.
   Furthermore, the mere presence of target brands at the time of choice
   affects preference-behavior consistency independent of the effects of

   found to be mediated by the type of self-control strategies consumers
   use in the 2 foci. Convergent evidence obtained in 4 studies,
   considering situational and dispositional aspects of regulatory focus,
   indicates that when temptations are encountered by consumers, regulatory
   focus is an important determinant of the degree of desire, and the
   nature and outcome of self-control.

AB We show that an extremely high-priced product featured among more
   moderately priced products within a catalog can increase the reservation
   price for a moderately priced target product as well as the category as
   a whole. We investigate how this increase is influenced by the degree of
   relatedness between the extreme-priced product and the target as well as
   the situational and temporal proximity (contiguity) in their
   presentation. Consistent with our conceptualization, we find that the
   presence of an extreme cue leads to greater changes in target
   reservation price when the extreme-priced referent and target are more
   related and are contiguously presented. Furthermore, the impact of an
   extreme-priced product's relatedness on reservation price appears to be
   greater when the contiguity between the extreme-priced product and the
   target product is high versus when it is low.

   situational factors that call it to attention before judgment and by
   individual differences in experiential processing style, as measured by
   the rational experiential inventory scale (Pacini & Epstein, 1999). An
   case of retrieval effect, indicated by less favorable evaluations of a
   proposal following the retrieval of many reasons advocating the proposal
   than following the retrieval of only a few, was found for
   high-experiential style processors regardless of situational factors

   model is based on the assumption that all human behaviors are a joint
   function of reflective and impulsive mechanisms. Those mechanisms have
   different principles of operation but contribute to the act of buying.
   However, the relative contribution of impulsive and reflective processes
   depends on personal and contextual circumstances. The operation and

   processing is described and applied to the dynamics of consumer
   behavior, with a special, emphasis on impulse buying.

   al. outlined the cognitive architecture of the consumer with the RIM but
   failed to specify how its most impressive feature, the reflective
   system, is powered. Drawing on the literature on self-regulation (as a
   reconceptualization of RIM incompatibility), I argue that
   self-regulatory resources drive the reflective system. Research from 5
   domains-overeating among dieters, impulsive spending, logical thinking,
   making choices, and subjective perceptions of duration-supports this
   hypothesis.

AB When a product's country of origin has a reputation for manufacturing
   high-quality products, there may be a positive impact on product
   judgments. If people feel animosity toward a country as a result of its
   political or social policies, they may react negatively to the products
   it produces. These opposing effects may depend in part on the subset of
   country-relevant knowledge that is accessible in memory at the time of
   judgment. When a product was not one on which Germany or Japan had built
   its reputation for manufacturing high-quality products, associating the
   product with these countries increased its evaluations when
   industriousness had been activated as part of an unrelated experiment.
   However, when concepts associated with brutality had been primed, the
   product's country of origin had a negative effect on judgments. When the
   product was typical of those manufactured in the country, however,
   identifying its country of origin increased product evaluations
   regardless of whether industriousness or brutality had been primed.
   Thus, animosity toward a product's country of origin had an adverse
   effect on reactions to it only if the product was not one on which the
   country's reputation was based.

AB When both independent and interdependent self-concepts are available,
   priming either self-concept will increase the accessibility in memory of
   the motivations and cognitions associated with it. Thus, priming the
   interdependent self may activate motivation to maintain harmony and
   conform to others' opinions, whereas priming the independent self is
   likely to activate motivation to be independent and to withstand social
   pressure. Two experiments investigated implications of these
   possibilities for judgments of risk when participants anticipated (or
   not) explaining their judgments to others. Participants relied on
   others' beliefs only when their interdependent self was primed and they
   expected they might have to explain their judgments to others. When
   their independent self was primed, expectations to communicate their
   judgments had no effect. Culture-based differences in individualism vs.
   collectivism had no impact on these effects.

AB The role that a given cue plays in consumer judgments depends on the

   a cue whose utilization can depend on salient goals. Research has
   suggested that store reputation does not influence product judgments
   when brand and price information are available. In 3 experiments,
   however, we show that when social identity goals are salient or are
   perceived as relevant to the product, store reputation (because it
   conveys image-relevant information) is used in evaluations of product
   quality. Specifically, store reputation has an impact on product
   judgments when either (a) consumers' social-image goals are directly
   heightened or (b) an interdependent self-construal, characterized by a
   greater concern with social identity, is salient. The role of product
   type in moderating these effects is also examined.

AB Despite the widespread belief that trust is a critical determinant of
   loyalty, empirical and anecdotal evidence calls into question the
   real-world robustness of the trust-loyalty link. An important reason for
   the fuzzy nature of the trust-loyalty link may be the fuzzy nature of
   trust itself. That is, stated trust judgments embody both a magnitude
   dimension (i.e., the position along a favorable-unfavorable continuum)
   and an uncertainty dimension (i.e., the lack of conviction with which
   the judgment is held). We investigated this possibility using data
   pertaining to consumers' reactions to a service failure and the
   provider's success in responding to their complaints. We found that the
   interplay between dissatisfaction with the complaint handling and past
   experience simultaneously influences trust magnitude and trust
   uncertainty. However, these two dimensions of trust are shaped by
   different underlying processes. Finally, uncertainty dampens the impact
   of stated trust on loyalty.

   contribution of the horizontal/vertical distinction is sometimes
   obscured by methods that conflate it with other dimensions, its impact
   is distinct from that associated with individualism-collectivism. We
   present studies that highlight several sources of value for the
   horizontal/vertical distinction-as a predictor of new consumer
   psychology phenomena and as a basis for refining the understanding of
   known phenomena. Results support the utility of examining this
   distinction for the understanding of personal values, advertising and
   consumer persuasion, self-presentational patterns, and gender
   differences. Methodological issues in studying the horizontal/vertical

   individualism-collectivism model. But this approach makes it difficult
   to disentangle the effects of power and individualism or collectivism;
   priming procedures and experimental variations of power can counter this
   limitation. Moreover, current horizontal/vertical approaches do not
   distinguish between having and not having power, although social
   cognition research documented differential effects of high and low power
   on content of self-concept, relationality, and cognition, which suggest
   previously neglected cultural differences.

AB Many facets of contemporary global problems posed by poverty pertain to
   the deprivation of consumption capability and are within the consumer
   psychologist's expertise domain. This article (based on my 2004
   Presidential Address to the Society for Consumer Psychology [SCP])
   outlines how consumer psychology research can contribute an
   understanding of the cognitive, motivational, and sociocultural
   dimensions of poverty, and how poverty depletes and alters the human
   need and capacity to consume. Consumer psychology research can also help
   suggest the nature and function of material and psychological
   interventions that can help ameliorate these conditions, focusing their
   design and monitoring their effects. These are important research
   priorities for consumer psychologists and deserve more and sustained
   attention from our community. Apart from garnering voice in policy
   conversations in government, industry, and academe, such research
   eventually will enhance our field's substantive contribution to
   improving the contemporary human condition.

   ineffective when sincerity of motives is ambiguous, and hurt the
   company's image when motives are perceived as insincere. Variables
   affecting perceived sincerity include the benefit salience of the cause,
   the source through which consumers learn about CSR, and the ratio of CSR
   contributions and CSR-related advertising. High benefit salience of the

   and were less inclined to choose, a product associated with a
   dissociative (i.e., female) reference group than a neutral product
   (Study 1). This finding was moderated by whether the product was
   consumed in public or private (Study 2) and public self-consciousness
   (Study 3). We suggest the mechanism underlying our effects is a desire
   to present a positive self-image to others. The role of dissociative

   outcome and improve future decision making. Results of an illustrative
   study are presented and discussed. Two other useful strategies are to
   match the decision effort to the decision's importance and to break big
   decisions into smaller ones. I close with a call for research examining

AB Zeelenberg and Pieter's (2007) regret regulation theory 1.0 offers a
   synthesis that brings together concepts spanning numerous literatures.
   We have no substantive disagreement with their theory, but instead offer
   3 observations to further aid regret researchers studying consumer
   decision making. First, the overall arch of any regret theory must be
   situated within an understanding of behavior regulation. Second, the
   distinction between regrets of action versus inaction is best understood
   in terms of motivational implications, particularly with regard to
   Higgin's (1998) distinction between promotion and prevention focus.
   Third, the opportunity principle offers a particularly clear means of
   summarizing the regulatory consequences of the regret experience. Regret
   is an emotion pivotal for decision making, and its cognitive
   underpinning has and continues to be elucidated in research focusing on
   counterfactual thinking.

AB Consumers' judgments of the frequency with which members of an ethnic
   minority are represented in advertisements can depend on the processing
   strategies they employ both at the time the ads are first encountered
   and at the time the judgments are reported. These strategies, in turn,
   can depend on whether the consumers personally belong to the minority
   group in question. European American and African American participants
   received a series of advertisements that varied in terms of the relative
   numbers of Black and White models that were portrayed. European
   Americans overestimated the number of Black models that appeared in the
   ads when the actual incidence of these models was low, but this
   overestimation decreased (and thus they became more accurate) as the
   number of ads containing these models increased. In contrast, African
   Americans were accurate when only a small number of Black models were
   presented, but became less accurate as the actual incidence of the
   models became greater. European Americans apparently based their
   estimates on the ease of recalling individual instances at the time of
   judgment, whereas African Americans appeared to perform an online tally
   of the number of Black models shown at the time they encountered them.

   differ in their ability to access the multiple meanings implied by
   polysemous expressions. Drawing on these studies, a novel,
   computer-based measure of automatic access to secondary meaning (SMAART)
   is developed to distinguish individuals more likely to access only a
   single, immediately available meaning from those accessing multiple
   meanings. The new measure is found to be reliable and distinct from
   several established measures assessing higher level verbal abilities
   such as the verbal SAT. Several experimental studies demonstrate the
   scale's usefulness for predicting who is most susceptible to the priming
   effects of the secondary meanings contained in the polysemous headlines
   in consumer-oriented communications.

   more negative than warranted by the situation. Results across 3
   experiments demonstrated that there are 2 types of information
   processing occurring when consumers make trust judgments in response to
   flattery. Depending on when flattery occurs, consumers engage in either
   automatic or deliberative processing of information provided by the

AB Firms routinely offer warranties, often as attempts to differentiate
   their offerings from those of competitors. Despite this practice common
   to virtually every consumer durable category, extant research has been
   inconclusive regarding the effect of warranties on quality judgments.
   One potential limitation of these prior investigations is the failure to
   model a key element of a product warranty-consumer-side transaction
   costs associated with warranty redemption. In this article, we introduce
   the role of consumer-side transaction costs associated with warranty
   redemption and examine the joint impact of warranty length and warranty
   redemption costs for brand names of varying strength on consumers'
   judgments of product quality. Two experiments show that warranty length
   signals security but not quality, and that perceived quality increases
   as consumers' warranty redemption costs decrease, provided that the
   warranty length is short. Different dimensions or aspects of warranties
   have different effects on perceived quality. The implications of the
   results for understanding conflicting findings in the warranty-quality
   literature are discussed.

AB Construal level theory (CLT) is an account of how psychological distance
   influences individuals' thoughts and behavior. CLT assumes that people
   mentally construe objects that are psychologically near in terms of
   low-level, detailed, and contextualized features, whereas at a distance
   they construe the same objects or events in terms of high-level,
   abstract, and stable characteristics. Research has shown that different
   dimensions of psychological distance (time, space, social distance, and
   hypotheticality) affect mental construal and that these construals, in
   turn, guide prediction, evaluation, and behavior. The present paper
   reviews this research and its implications for consumer psychology.

AB Understanding how consumers represent outcomes and weigh different
   decision criteria is critical to consumer behavior research.
   Construal-level theory articulates how psychological distance alters the
   mental representation of inputs and the effective weight given to
   "high-level" and "low-level" criteria. Trope, Liberman, and Wakslak
   (2007) provide a review of this literature. In this commentary, we
   illustrate the relevance of construal-level theory to issues in consumer
   psychology, particularly consumer decision making. We highlight specific
   questions that researchers could address by considering consumer
   behavior within the framework of changes in construal. We focus our
   discussion on how construal levels affect consideration sets and how
   shifts in weight from high-level to low-level features might lead to
   consumer regret and dissatisfaction. Construal level can help us
   understand follow-through on stated intentions for "really new" products
   and illuminate public-policy issues such as consumer saving for
   retirement and nonredemption of rebates. We identify open issues related
   to how construal levels for the same object evolve over time and whether
   resources differ in terms of how susceptible they are to psychological
   distance effects.

AB The three commentaries on our paper "Construal Levels and Psychological
   Distance: Effects on Representation, Prediction, Evaluation, and
   Behavior" offer insightful theoretical extensions and practical
   applications of construal level theory (CLT). We were inspired and
   challenged by the commentaries to elaborate on a number of issues,
   although our elaboration more often raises questions and speculations
   than provides definite answers. Owing to space limitations, however, we
   could discuss only some of the issues raised in the commentaries. The
   first set of issues concerns our theoretical framework, namely,
   similarities and differences among distance dimensions, the question of
   additional distances, the nature of the interaction among distances, and
   the relationship between psychological distance and construct of
   stimulus information sampling. The second set of issues concerns
   applications of CLT to consumer choice, namely, how to make better
   decisions, the nature of regret, and how people construct and process
   choice sets.

AB This research addresses refutation of false beliefs formed on the basis
   of repeated exposure to advertisements. Experiment I explores belief in
   the refutation as a function of the perceptual details shared
   (alignment) between the claim and the refutation as manipulated by
   whether the original claim was direct (assertion) or indirect
   (implication). Experiment 2 then examines whether this effect will carry
   through to belief in the original claim after exposure to the
   refutation. Findings indicate that direct refutations of indirect claims
   are believed more than refutations of direct claims. However, direct
   refutations of direct claims are more effective in reducing belief in
   the original claim. We argue that recollection of the original claim
   facilitates automatic updating of belief in that claim. Experiment 3
   demonstrates that an alternative cue (a logo) in a refutation that
   facilitates recall of the original claim enables reduction of belief in
   the original indirect claim; this finding helps to pin down the
   mechanism-recall of the original claim-underlying belief updating.
   Further, Experiment 3 finds that multiple cues to recalling the original
   claim may prevent the automatic updating process. Theoretical and
   practical implications are discussed.

AB Individuals often rely on their affect for information. However,
   positive or negative affect may not be informative for individuals who
   are more prone to feel affect of this particular valence in general,
   unless they chronically monitor their internal states. A series of
   studies demonstrates that differences in individuals' internal versus
   external focus of attention and in trait affective valence associated
   with their approach versus avoidance motivation determine reliance on
   affect as information. Specifically, our findings show that while
   positive affect is used as an input in product satisfaction judgments
   regardless of individuals' approach versus avoidance motivation,
   negative affect is used only by individuals with a predominant approach
   motivation.

   the influence of specific emotions on consumer decision making. In
   particular, the ATF addresses how and why specific emotions carry over
   from past situations to color future judgments and choices. After
   reviewing the main assumptions and the 5 main principles of the
   framework, 2 streams of research are presented. One stream addresses
   emotional carryover effects on the assessment of risk; the other
   addresses carryover effects on the assessment of monetary value. Because
   risk assessment and value assessment are fundamental psychological
   processes, understanding them has the potential to yield manifold
   implications for consumer judgment and decision making. The concluding
   sections highlight limitations and future directions of the framework.

   This article also proposes several areas in which the ATF might be

   consequences, considering how incidental and integral emotions interact,
   characterizing how both evaluative and regulatory mechanisms may
   influence the effects of emotion on judgment and choice, and extending
   the range of positive emotions and appraisal dimensions considered.

   question concerns the mechanisms whereby emotional carryover effects

AB Consumers' purchase decisions are often influenced by a simple
   assessment of how long they expect an anticipated purchase (e.g., buying
   a sports car or a new outfit) will make them happy. Unfortunately,
   affective forecasts are prone to durability bias (i.e., the
   overestimation of the duration of felt emotions in response to a future
   event). Here, this article suggests that normative beliefs, or "feeling
   rules," often underlie emotion forecasts. This account suggests that
   affective forecasts can be influenced by external normative
   communications and that conditions exist where affect duration may be
   underestimated rather than overestimated-thus demonstrating a reversal
   of durability bias. Such reversals occur when existing norms advocate
   attenuated emotional responses (e.g., one should not be overly impacted
   by minor setbacks or small imperfections). This article discusses how
   marketers can influence consumers' happiness forecasts by modifying
   salient norms for consumer groups or product categories.

AB This article introduces the framework of conceptual combinations, which
   underlies the creative ability to combine existing concepts to create
   new ones. Using this framework, two creative processes are identified,
   namely, (a) property mapping (PM), which entails combining concepts by
   transferring a property from one concept to another (e.g., shape in the
   case of notebook computers); and (b) relation linking (RL), which
   entails linking the two combining concepts by a thematic relation (e.g.,
   the "locative" relation in desktop computers). The effect of these
   processes on the comprehension of new product concepts is investigated
   in two experimental studies. In Study I it is shown that novel products
   created by RL are easier to interpret than the ones created by PM. In
   Study 2 it is found that new products combining concepts from different
   super-ordinate categories are more likely interpreted by RL, and are
   easier to comprehend than the ones from the same super-ordinate
   category, which use PM. The theoretical and managerial implications of
   using conceptual combinations in the context of new product ideation are
   discussed.

AB Consumer researchers have become increasingly interested in the study of
   coping. This research contributes to this emerging paradigm by
   investigating structural theories of coping using a hierarchical
   modeling approach to better understand the basic dimensional properties
   of this multifaceted construct. This research makes gains along several
   fronts. First, the authors empirically examine a new lower order theory
   of coping based on a comprehensive synthesis of the literature,
   reconciling nomenclatural and conceptual redundancies found in the
   structure of coping literature. Analyses across 2 studies using
   different methods offer support for a 2-dimensional higher order model
   of coping. Finally, a third study using an experimental approach
   validates these findings by showing unique effects relating an
   approach-avoidance based higher order model to theoretically predicted
   emotional antecedents. By examining the mapping of lower order coping
   strategies onto several higher order coping theories, this research
   addresses the extant disjuncture between coping theory and measurement
   found in the literature and offers reconciliation between these 2
   perspectives. The findings suggest the need for future coping research
   to focus on other 2-dimensional theories beyond problem-focused versus
   emotion-focused coping. The findings build on the synergies among the
   many coping perspectives, and the implications of a better understanding
   of coping's hierarchical structure for consumer researchers is
   discussed.

   contends that the answer is narcissists-individuals who see themselves,

   and who are prone to exhibitionism and vanity. This work hypothesizes
   that narcissists will, to validate their excessively positive
   self-views, strive to purchase the high-prestige products (i.e.,
   expensive, exclusive, new, and flashy). In so doing, they will regulate
   their own esteem by increasing their apparent status and consequently
   earning others' admiration and envy. This article also hypothesizes that
   narcissists will show greater interest in the symbolic than utilitarian
   value of products and will exhibit, even controlling for self-esteem,
   more pronounced self-enhancement phenomena such as endowment and
   self-signaling effects.

AB Purchase and consumption behaviors in daily life often are repetitive
   and performed in customary places, leading consumers to develop habits.
   When habits have formed, environmental cues can activate the practiced
   responses in the absence of conscious decision making. This research
   tested these ideas using a longitudinal design. We predicted that
   regardless of their explicit intentions, consumers would repeat habits
   to purchase fast food, watch TV news, and take the bus. The results
   yielded the anticipated pattern in which participants repeated habitual
   behaviors even if they reported intentions to do otherwise. Intentions
   only guided behavior in the absence of strong habits. This study ruled
   out a number of artifactual accounts for these findings including that
   they arise from the level of abstraction at which intentions are
   identified, the certainty with which participants held intentions, a
   restriction of range in the measures, and the strategy participants used
   to estimate frequency of past performance.

AB This article proposes that, in electoral contexts, decision makers may
   experience a desire for vengeance or a desire to "get even" with an
   entity, such as a political candidate, in response to a perceived
   wrongdoing. This article draws on research from the domains of
   psychology and sociology to develop a theoretical framework for
   examining factors that may influence the extent to which voters exact
   revenge on political candidates with their voting behavior. The results
   of 3 experiments are reported in which voters are shown to exact revenge
   on a candidate who has won an earlier round of elections by defeating a
   favored candidate. This process is mediated by damage to self-identity
   and is strengthened by perceived share of blame attributed to the
   perpetrator candidate. This research shows how vengeful voters are
   delighted when a perpetrator candidate later performs poorly while in
   office. This research also shows how making salient a shared affiliation
   with the perpetrator candidate (such as race or university major) can
   attenuate vengeful voting behavior. The research builds on a growing
   body of work that explores negative and potentially counterproductive
   emotions in choice contexts.

AB This research examines the ability of consumers to predict the appeal of
   complete visual patterns from small sample fragments. In a task designed
   to mimic the dilemma of choosing wallpaper from small swatches, study
   participants are shown fragments taken from a large pattern design and
   are asked to predict how attractive they would find the complete image.
   Drawing on prior research on affective forecasting, predictions are
   hypothesized to be driven by an anchoring-and-adjustment process that
   skews forecasts toward the attractiveness of fragments when judged in
   isolation. Results from 3 laboratory studies support this basic
   hypothesis: Respondents consistently overestimate the degree to which
   their initial reactions to fragments predict their subsequent
   evaluations of wholes. The size of this projection bias is, in turn,
   conditioned by such moderators as prior familiarity with product
   fragment, cognitive load, and visualization abilities-effects that are
   consistent with an anchoring-and-adjustment explanation for the data.

AB Consumer behavior offers a useful window on human nature, through which
   many distinctively human patterns of cognition and behavior can be
   observed. Consumer behavior should therefore be of central interest to a
   broad range of psychologists. These patterns include much of what is
   commonly understood as free will. Our approach to understanding free
   will sidesteps metaphysical and theological debates. Belief in free will
   is pervasive in human social life and contributes to its benefits.
   Evolution endowed humans with a new form of action control, which is
   what people understand by free will. Its complexity and flexibility are
   suited to the distinctively human forms of social life in culture, with
   its abstract rules, expanded time span, diverse interdependent roles,
   and other sources of opportunities and constraints. Self-control,
   planful action, and rational choice are vital forms of free will in this
   sense. The capacity for self-control and intelligent decision making
   involves a common, limited resource that uses the body's basic energy
   supply. When this resource is depleted, self-control fails and decision
   making is impaired. (c) 2007 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published

   conditions (such as ego depletion) affect the relative influence of

AB Baumeister, Sparks, Stillman, and Vohs (2007) sketch a theory of free
   will as the human ability to exert self-control. Self-control can
   produce goal-directed behavior, which free will conceptualized as random
   behavior cannot. We question whether consumer psychology can shed light
   on the ontological question of whether free will exists. We suggest that
   it is more fruitful for consumer psychology to examine consumers' belief
   in free will. Specifically, we propose that this belief arises from
   consumers' phenomenological experience of exercising self-control in the
   face of moral or intertemporal conflicts of will. Based on extant
   literature in philosophy, psychology, and economics, we offer both a
   narrower conceptualization of the nature of self-control problems and a
   more general conceptualization of self-control strategies, involving not
   only willpower but also precommitment. We conclude with a discussion of
   the consequences of consumers' belief in free will. (c) 2007 Society for

   concerns that elicited their negative affect only if(a) the description
   of these activities called attention to these concerns or (b) they were
   explicitly told to think about the situation that gave rise to their

   activities that were intrinsically attractive but irrelevant to the

AB The present research investigated consumers' intuitions about percent
   differences. We found that the perceived difference between two
   quantities compared on a percent scale varies as a function of the
   target of the comparison. The subjective price difference between a
   $1500 and a $1000 moped, for instance, increased when the former was
   described as 50% more than the latter than when the latter was described
   as 33% less than the former (Experiment 1). This effect (1) is limited
   to comparisons made on a ratio scale, (2) varies as a function of the
   percent difference between the two quantities, and (3) applies not only
   to price but also to other quantifiable attributes (Experiments 2 - 4).
   Finally, Experiment 5 found that the bias was reduced (but not
   eliminated) with financial incentives for accuracy and persisted even
   among highly numerate individuals. Discussion focuses on the source and
   the implications of this bias. (c) 2007 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB This research investigates differences and similarities between men and
   women in their spontaneous reactions to gratuitous sexual appeals in
   advertising. Earlier research suggests that both males and females will
   react negatively to such ads because of perceptions of unethicality,
   manipulativeness, etc. However, we hypothesize and find that, under the
   sort of constrained processing conditions that allow the elicitation of
   spontaneous, gut-level reactions, men on average will exhibit a more
   positive attitudinal response to gratuitous sex appeals than women
   (Experiments 1 and 2). Experiment 3 then provides support for the
   underlying process - and also demonstrates intragender variation-by
   showing that women with more liberal attitudes to sex per se react in a
   manner very similar to men; namely, they report more liking for a sexual
   ad than a nonsexual ad. (c) 2007 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB The question-behavior effect is discussed by taking an action control
   perspective. With respect to the determinants of the effect, it is asked
   whether its strength is dependent on the features of the behaviors at
   issue (e.g., difficulty), how the question targets the critical
   behaviors (e.g., in terms of attitudes or intentions, frequency or
   intensity), and in which context it is asked. With respect to the
   psychological processes, it is questioned whether the activation of
   positive implicit attitudes underlies the effect. Finally, to counter
   unwanted question-behavior effects on risky behaviors, an intervention
   treatment geared at blocking such effects is suggested that is based on
   the self-regulation of goal setting (by mental contrasting; Oettingen,
   2000) and goal implementation (by forming if-then plans; Gollwitzer,

   First, we deal with some empirical issues about whether asking questions
   really increases risky behavior. We argue that the results reviewed in
   our target article are valid, and are not due to lab-specific effects,
   or to question-wording or question-answering issues. Second, we tackle
   some issues related to the process by which questions might increase
   risky behavior. We focus on two mechanisms that seem promising for
   explaining the influence of questions on risky behavior: attitude
   activation and social norms. We also consider the impact of various
   moderators on the risky question-behavior effect, building on
   suggestions made in the commentaries. Finally, we make some suggestions
   about techniques that we-as parents, practitioners, and
   researchers-might use to reduce the impact of asking questions about

AB One of the most enduring findings from branding research is that
   consumers evaluate brand extensions on the basis of their perceived fit
   with the parent brand. In this article, we propose that the importance
   of perceived fit in extension evaluations is moderated by construal
   level. We draw upon construal level theory which posits that individuals
   can construe stimuli in their environments in terms of abstract and
   generalized features (high-level construals) or in terms of concrete and
   contextualized features (low-level construals). Results from three
   studies confirm that consumers who construe their environment at a
   higher level place more importance on perceived extension fit in
   evaluating brand extensions. These consumers evaluate high fit
   extensions more favorably than moderate fit extensions, consistent with
   prior research. However, consumers who construe their environment at a
   lower level do not evaluate high and moderate fit extensions any
   differently, unless the importance of using fit perceptions is made
   salient. (C) 2008 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier

AB This research examined whether high public self-consciousness (HPUBSC)
   consumers are more inclined than low public self-consciousness (LPUBSC)
   consumers to buy products aimed at preventing embarrassment but which
   are embarrassing to buy. Study 1 found that PUBSC is positively
   associated with increased intentions to buy such products. Study 2
   showed that an increase in the severity of the social consequences
   associated with an embarrassing situation increased participants'
   purchase intentions, regardless of their level of PUBSC. However,
   whereas an increase in the frequency of an embarrassing situation's
   occurrence increased the purchase intentions of LPUBSC participants, it
   decreased the purchase intentions of HPUBSC participants. Study 3
   revealed evidence of a reverse spotlight effect for HPUBSC participants.

   the consequences of articulating that others have considered both the
   positives and negatives of a message position, in the absence of any
   real differences in substantive content presented. Although classic
   research and theory appear to assume no clear benefit for simply framing
   a message as two sided, we develop and apply a meta-cognitive approach
   that predicts advantages for such messages with respect to attitude
   certainty and attitude-behavior correspondence. (C) 2008 Society for

AB There is a growing consensus that preferences are inherently
   constructive and largely determined by the task characteristics, the
   choice context, and the description of options. Although the fact that
   construction influences often play an important role is not in dispute,
   I argue that much of the evidence for preference construction reflects
   people's difficulty in evaluating absolute attribute values and
   tradeoffs and their tendency to gravitate to available relative
   evaluations. Furthermore, although some key demonstrations of
   constructive preferences involved rather unusual tasks and might have
   "benefited" from the effects they were demonstrating, the findings have
   led to rather sweeping, unqualified conclusions. The notion of more
   stable inherent preference components that are not determined by context
   is then introduced, suggesting that it is often meaningful and useful to
   assume that people are non/receptive to certain aspects and object
   configurations, including those that may not yet exist. Inherent
   preferences are more influential when reference points and forces of
   construction are less salient, most notably, when objects are
   experienced. The final section explores some of the implications of
   constructed and inherent preferences with respect to decision and
   marketing research. (c) 2008 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published

AB We advocate a different approach to the important questions that
   Simonson raises regarding preference construction. First, we argue that
   existing literature both acknowledges and addresses preference
   stability. In particular, we show that stable preferences are not
   incompatible with theories of preference construction. We note that
   construction can influence experienced utility as well as prediction of
   preference and argue that a careful analysis of stability must allow for
   contextual influences in both these domains. Finally, we note that
   Simonson's notion of 'inherent' preferences is unclear, and we argue
   that a better way to take up this important challenge is through
   existing literatures providing insights into conditions leading to
   preference stability. (c) 2008 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB The BDT literature has largely focused on demonstrations of violations
   of rationality (i.e. consistency) in individual decision making and has
   had little to say about the content of preferences. While researchers
   concluded that inconsistency implied preferences were constructed, some
   went so far as to presume that since preferences are constructed,
   substantive preferences do not exist prior to their revelation. In other
   words, they extended the findings that individuals do not always know
   exactly what they want to imply that consumer's do not have any
   substantive preferences. This clearly overstepped the bounds of the
   evidence, which was agnostic toward the existence of reasonably stable
   substantive preferences. We applaud Simonson for calling attention to
   this point. While we do not believe that Simonson's "inherent
   preferences" lead to preference orders that behave any more rationally
   or consistently than those studied in the BDT literature, we
   nevertheless join him in his call for further research into the content
   of preferences and make a variety of suggestions about where that
   research will bear most fruit. (c) 2008 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Scientific inquiry often advances in triadic waves of thesis,
   antithesis, and synthesis. We concur with Simonson [Simonson, I.,
   (2008). Will I Like a "Medium" Pillow: Another Look at Constructed and
   Inherent Preferences. Journal of Consumer Psychology, this issue.] that
   BDT's antithesis of preference construction, positioned against the
   normative utility thesis, may have swung the pendulum too far. Contrary
   to BDT's focus on constructed preference, inherent preferences - or what
   may be considered dispositions - are ubiquitous and critical
   determinants of choice. Thus, a synthesis in decision research is
   proposed, one in which researchers better bridge inherent and
   constructed preferences, or more broadly, marketing science and BDT.
   Such a synthesis, although uncertain and difficult, has the potential to
   explain the origins of inherent preferences, their slow evolution over
   time, and their interaction with constructed preferences. In this
   commentary, we discuss the synthesis between constructed and inherent
   preferences and how such a synthesis could be conceptualized and
   modeled. We conclude by suggesting some ways in which behavioral
   economics might evolve. (c) 2008 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Simonson holds that non-constructed "inherent preferences" influence
   many expressed attitudes as well as behavioral choices. These inherent
   preferences are not mentally represented, but amount to embodied
   constraints that (for example) make a person like a new product on an
   initial encounter. This article situates Simonson's argument in the
   social-psychological literature on attitudes. Existing evidence does
   suggest that people sometimes are surprised by their evaluations of
   experiences (failures of affective forecasting). However, the
   problematic concept of non-constructed inherent preferences need not be
   invoked to explain such effects; existing models of the role of direct
   experience in attitudes are adequate. (c) 2008 Society for Consumer

AB Commentators offer different perspectives on and reactions to the target

   look at constructed and inherent preferences. Journal of Consumer
   Psychology] reassessment of research and findings used to support the
   conclusion that preferences are inherently constructive and of the
   inherent preference concept. Focusing on the latter, this reply
   elaborates on and develops the notion of inherent preferences. Even
   before tasting a licorice candy or chili peppers for the first time,
   trying out the Nintendo Wii, and so on, the degree of dis/like for such
   objects is assumed to be largely determined, though such dispositions
   might be masked by context and other forces of construction. Dormant
   inherent preferences are not un/conscious and are not implicit or
   explicit, stored attitudes. They are likely to evolve while still
   dormant, due to changes in preference components that determine the
   overall disposition to like the composite object. I conclude with a
   discussion of the falsifiability and the study of inherent preferences.
