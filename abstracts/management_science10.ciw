AB It is widely believed that a little flexibility added at the right place
   can reap significant benefits for operations. Unfortunately, despite the
   extensive literature on this topic, we are not aware of any general
   methodology that can be used to guide managers in designing sparse
   (i.e., slightly flexible) and yet efficient operations. We address this
   issue using a distributionally robust approach to model the performance
   of a stochastic system under different process structures. We use the
   dual prices obtained from a related conic program to guide managers in
   the design process. This leads to a general solution methodology for the
   construction of efficient sparse structures for several classes of
   operational problems. Our approach can be used to design simple yet
   efficient structures for workforce deployment and for any level of
   sparsity requirement, to respond to deviations and disruptions in the
   operational environment. Furthermore, in the case of the classical
   process flexibility problem, our methodology can recover the k-chain
   structures that are known to be extremely efficient for this type of
   problem when the system is balanced and symmetric. We can also obtain
   the analog of 2-chain for nonsymmetrical system using this methodology.

   than expenditures on advertising and research and development, that are
   reported on a commingled basis with operating expenses in the selling,
   general, and administrative category of expenses. These outlays, aimed
   at improving organizational knowledge and capabilities, are the largest
   category of intangible investments and the fastest-growing category of
   operating investments. They affect future firm performance and risk.
   Predictability of future earnings and stock returns improves when these
   outlays are distinguished from operating expenses. Thus, benefits could
   accrue from reporting them separately.

AB We study the optimal pricing problem of a monopolistic firm facing
   customers with limited attention and capability to process information
   about the value (quality) of a single offered product. We model customer
   choice based on the theory of rational inattention in the economics
   literature, which enables us to capture not only the impact of true
   quality and price, but also the intricate effects of customer's prior
   beliefs and cost of information acquisition and processing. We formulate
   the firm's price optimization problem assuming that the firm can also
   use the price to signal the quality of the product to customers. To
   delineate the economic incentives of the firm, we first characterize the
   pricing and revenue implications of customer's limited attention without
   signaling, and then use these results to explore perfect Bayesian
   equilibria of the strategic pricing signaling game. As an extension, we
   consider heterogeneous customers with different information costs as
   well as prior beliefs. We discuss the managerial implications of our key
   findings and prescribe insights regarding information provision and
   product positioning.

AB Suppose that a firm in charge of a business ecosystem is a firm in
   charge of a microeconomy. To achieve the highest growth rate, how open
   should that economy be? To encourage third-party developers, how long
   should their intellectual property interests last? We develop a
   sequential innovation model that addresses the trade-offs inherent in
   these two decisions: (i) Closing the platform increases the sponsor's
   ability to charge for access, while opening the platform increases
   developer ability to build upon it. (ii) The longer third-party
   developers retain rights to their innovations, the higher the royalties
   they and the sponsor earn, but the sooner those developers' rights
   expire, the sooner their innovations become a public good upon which
   other developers can build. Our model allows us to characterize the
   optimal levels of openness and of intellectual property (IP) duration in
   a platform ecosystem. We use standard Cobb-Douglas production
   technologies to derive our results. These findings can inform innovation
   strategy, choice of organizational form, IP noncompete decisions, and

TI Competitive Strategies for Brick-and-Mortar Stores to Counter

AB Customers often evaluate products at brick-and-mortar stores to identify
   their "best-fit" product but buy it for a lower price at a competing
   online retailer. This free-riding behavior by customers is referred to
   as "showrooming," and we show that this is detrimental to the profits of
   the brick-and-mortar stores. We first analyze price matching as a
   short-term strategy to counter showrooming. Price matching allows
   customers to purchase a product from the store for less than the store's
   posted price, so one would expect the price matching strategy to be less
   effective as the fraction of customers who seek the matching increases.
   However, our results show that with an increase in the fraction of
   customers who seek price matching, the store's profits initially
   decrease and then increase. While price matching could be used even when
   customers do not exhibit showrooming behavior, we find that it is more
   effective when customers do showrooming. We then study exclusivity of
   product assortments as a long-term strategy to counter showrooming. This
   strategy can be implemented in two different ways: (1) by arranging for
   exclusivity of known brands (e.g., Macy's has such an arrangement with
   Tommy Hilfiger) or (2) through the creation of store brands at the
   brick-and-mortar store (T. J. Maxx sells a large number of store
   brands). Our analysis suggests that implementing exclusivity through
   store brands is better than exclusivity through known brands when the
   product category has few digital attributes. However, when customers do
   not showroom, the known-brand strategy dominates the store-brand
   strategy.

AB "Bespoke," or mass customization strategy, combines demand learning and
   preference learning. We develop an analytical framework to study the
   economic value of bespoke systems and investigate the interaction
   between demand learning and preference learning. We find that it is
   possible for demand learning and preference learning to be either
   complements or substitutes, depending on the customization cost and the
   demand uncertainty profile. They are generally complements when the
   personalization cost is low and the probability of having high demand is
   large. Contrary to usual belief, we show that higher demand uncertainty
   does not necessarily yield more complementarity benefits. Our numerical
   study shows that the complementarity benefit becomes weaker when
   customers are more strategic. Interestingly, the substitute loss can
   occur when the personalization cost is small and the probability of
   having high demand is large, when customers are strategic.

AB A basic assumption of the classical newsvendor model is that the
   probability distribution of the random demand is known. But in most
   realistic settings, only partial distribution information is available
   or reliably estimated. The distributionally robust newsvendor model is
   often used in this case where the worst-case expected profit is
   maximized over the set of distributions satisfying the known
   information, which is usually the mean and covariance of demands.
   However, covariance does not capture information on asymmetry of the
   demand distribution. In this paper, we introduce a measure of
   distribution asymmetry using second-order partitioned statistics.
   Semivariance is a special case with a single partition of the univariate
   demand. With mean, variance, and semivariance information, we show that
   a three-point distribution achieves the worst-case expected profit and
   derive a closed-form expression for the distributionally robust order
   quantity. For multivariate demand, the distributionally robust problem
   with partitioned statistics is hard to solve, but we develop a
   computationally tractable lower bound through the solution of a
   semidefinite program. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that
   asymmetry information significantly reduces expected profit loss
   particularly when the true distribution is heavy tailed. In
   computational experiments on automotive spare parts demand data, we
   provide evidence that the distributionally robust model that includes
   partitioned statistics outperforms the model that uses only covariance
   information.

AB This study examines how characteristics of an interfirm labor-flow
   network affect firm productivity. Using employee job histories to trace
   labor movement between organizations, we construct labor-flow networks
   for both information technology (IT) and non-IT labor and analyze how a
   firm's network structure for the two types of labor affects its
   performance. We find that hiring IT workers from a structurally diverse
   network of firms can substantially improve firm productivity, but that
   the same is not true for non-IT labor, where we find little benefit of
   network diversity. We hypothesize that these results reflect differences
   in the types of knowledge diffusion facilitated by different types of
   labor flows, with IT labor enabling the transfer of new and innovative
   firm practices, which benefits from diversity, while non-IT labor flows
   are more closely associated with implementation of complementary
   organizational practices, which may benefit from a critical mass of
   workers with a common knowledge base. Together, these results
   demonstrate the importance of incorporating a network perspective in
   understanding the full impact of spillover effects from organizational
   hiring activities.

AB In this paper, we study a conditional upgrade strategy that has recently
   emerged in the travel industry. After a consumer makes a reservation for
   a product (e.g., a hotel room), she is asked whether she would like to
   upgrade her product to a higher-quality (more expensive) one at a
   discounted price. The upgrade, however, is not fulfilled immediately.
   The firm fulfills upgrades at check-in if higher-quality products are
   still available, and the upgrade fee is charged to the consumer if and
   only if she actually gets upgraded. Consumers decide which product type
   to book and whether to accept an upgrade offer or not based on the
   anticipated upgrade probability. We find that conditional upgrades
   create value by improving demand-supply matching for the firm. The firm
   can use the conditional upgrade channel to flexibly manage capacity
   allocations and reoptimize demand segmentation. For a firm that takes
   product prices as given, offering conditional upgrades is effective in
   compensating for the firm's lack of ability in setting prices optimally.
   For a firm that has the ability to optimize product prices, conditional
   upgrades generate higher revenues than dynamic pricing.

AB The dearth of minority entrepreneurs has received increasing media
   attention but few academic analyses. In particular, the funding process
   creates challenges for either audit or correspondence methods, making it
   difficult to assess the role, or type, of discrimination influencing
   resource providers. We use a novel approach that combines analyses of
   7,617 crowdfunding projects with an experimental design to identify
   whether African American men are discriminated against and whether this
   reflects statistical, taste-based, or unconscious bias on the part of
   prospective supporters. We find that African American men are
   significantly less likely than similar white founders to receive funding
   and that prospective supporters rate identical projects as lower in
   quality when they believe the founder is an African American male. We
   conclude that the reduction in perceived quality does not reflect
   conscious assumptions of differences in founder ability or disamenity
   but rather an unconscious assumption that black founders are lower
   quality. In two additional experiments, we identify three means of
   reducing this bias: through additional evidence of quality via
   third-party endorsements (i.e., awards, evidence of prior support),
   through evidence that African American founders have succeeded
   previously, and by removing indicators of the founder's race.

   webcams during play. We then showed pairs of photos consisting of one
   responder who rejected and one responder who accepted (a low offer) to
   an independent group of observers. We find that observers are better
   than chance at detecting who rejected the low offer; they do 10% better

AB We show that temporary incentives can lead to lasting changes in
   people's daily routines through a field experiment. In randomized
   controlled trials on Singapore's subways, commuters in the treatment
   group received a full rebate of their fares for 10 weeks if they exited
   fare gates before the start of morning peak-travel time. The objective
   of the fare promotion was to alleviate peak-time congestion by
   encouraging commuters to travel prepeak. This promotion resembles an
   actual public program implemented in Singapore in 2013. Using
   participants' fare cards, we obtained a rich data set for 60 weeks'
   worth of trips. A difference-in-differences analysis reveals that the
   effect of the free-trip offer was modest but robust during the
   promotional period: on average, trips were 5.5% more likely to end
   before the morning peak time. More encouragingly, the modest shift
   toward early travel strongly persisted even seven months after the end
   of the free-trip offer. This seemingly small shift could imply large
   financial savings on infrastructure investment. We find suggestive
   evidence that travel regularity and consistency during the promotion
   appear to be important for forging persistence.

AB Incumbents can enjoy a cost advantage vis-a-vis new entrants and so
   deter new firm entry by establishing and leveraging connections with the

   the costly norms implied by a law, a regulation, or a contract. At the
   same time, they can also credibly threaten to sue new entrants.
   Therefore, a change in the institutional environment that diminishes the
   ability of incumbent firms to establish judicial connections-i.e., an
   increase in judicial independence-can promote entrepreneurship.
   Exploiting reforms that change the way in which U.S. state judges are
   selected, we confirm that this is the case, and we show that this effect
   is more salient in states and industries where the likelihood of
   entering into a business dispute is higher. The paper also sheds some

AB We analyze the words that firms use to describe their products so we can
   examine the determinants of which industries conglomerate firms operate
   within. Our central finding is that multiple-industry firms operate
   across industries with higher product language overlap.
   Multiple-industry firms also avoid industries with more distinct
   language boundaries and those with more specialized within-industry
   language. We also find evidence linking these results to specific
   synergies such as potential entry into new markets and realized
   synergies in the form of higher 10-K product description growth. These
   findings are consistent with multiple-product firms operating primarily
   in industries that lack language specialization. Our findings show that
   most conglomerates are not true diversified conglomerates with little
   overlap in their lines of business, as most firms that operate across
   multiple industries choose industries with high language overlap and
   potential synergies. Our results support theories of firm organization

AB Do superstitious traders lose money? We answer this question in the
   context of trading in the Taiwan Futures Exchange, where we exploit the
   Chinese superstition that the number 8 is lucky and the number 4 is
   unlucky. We find that individual investors, but not institutional
   investors, submit disproportionately more limit orders at 8 than at 4.
   This imbalance, defined as the "superstition index" for each investor,
   is positively correlated with trading losses. Superstitious investors
   lose money mainly because of their bad market timing and stale orders.
   Nevertheless, the reliance on number superstition for limit order
   submissions does decrease with trading experience.

AB Can distance-related information asymmetries in credit markets be
   overcome with contract design and credit scoring models? To answer this
   question, we explore differences in foreign and domestic banks' credit
   contract terms and pricing models. Using a sample of firms that borrow
   from both domestic and foreign banks in the same month, we show that
   foreign banks are more likely to demand collateral and grant shorter
   maturity loans than domestic banks. Foreign banks also base their
   pricing on internal credit ratings and collateral pledges, while
   domestic banks price according to the length, depth, and breadth of
   their relationship with a firm. These findings confirm that foreign
   banks can overcome informational disadvantages using contract design and
   credit scoring models. However, we also show that there are limitations,
   with foreign banks facing higher default rates and lower returns on
   lending if not using collateral and short maturity as disciplining
   tools.

AB We model illiquidity as a restriction on the stopping rules investors
   can follow in selling assets, and apply this framework to the valuation
   of thinly traded investments. We find that discounts for illiquidity can
   be surprisingly large, approaching 30%-50% in some cases. Immediacy
   plays a unique role and is valued much more than ongoing liquidity. We
   show that investors in illiquid enterprises have strong incentives to
   increase dividends and other cash payouts, thereby introducing potential
   agency conflicts. We also find that illiquidity and volatility are
   fundamentally entangled in their effects on asset prices. This aspect
   may help explain why some assets are viewed as inherently more liquid
   than others and why liquidity concerns are heightened during financial
   crises.

AB We study the role of risk aversion underlying son preference in
   patriarchal societies, where sons serve as better insurance for old-age
   support than daughters. The implications of an insurance motive on son
   preference are twofold. First, prior to the birth of their children,
   more-risk-averse parents have a stronger preference for sons than for
   daughters. Second, after the birth of their children, parents with sons
   are more risk seeking, compared to parents with daughters. We adopt a
   within-twin-pair fixed-effects estimator with a weak identification
   assumption, which enables us to jointly identify these two effects. We
   further conduct an incentivized choice experiment to assess parental
   risk attitude in a sample of Chinese twins with children, and follow up
   with a second twin sample to examine the replicability of the findings.
   In both samples, we find that parents with higher risk aversion before
   the birth of their children are more likely to have sons through sex
   selection than parents with lower risk aversion. Additionally, having
   sons significantly decreases parental risk aversion. These results
   contribute to the literature on the sources of son preference and help
   shed light on the nature of gender inequality.

AB Decision makers frequently have a spokesperson communicate their
   decisions. In this paper, we address two questions. First, does it
   matter who communicates an unfair decision? Second, does it matter how
   the unfair decision is communicated? We conduct a modified dictator game
   experiment in which either the decision maker or a spokesperson
   communicates the decided allocation to recipients, who then determine
   whether to punish either of them. We find that receivers punish both the
   decision maker and the spokesperson more often, and more heavily, for
   unfair allocations communicated by the spokesperson if there is room for
   shifting blame. The increased punishment results from the messenger's
   style of delivery: spokespersons are more likely than decision makers to
   express emotional regret instead of rational need. Receivers seem to
   punish the former style of communication because they view it as an
   attempt to shift blame. Our results establish more generally that the
   design of communication schemes shapes relationships among
   organizational members.

AB Currently available medication for treating many chronic diseases is
   often effective only for a subgroup of patients, and biomarkers
   accurately assessing whether an individual belongs to this subgroup
   typically do not exist. In such settings, physicians learn about the
   effectiveness of a drug primarily through experimentation-i.e., by
   initiating treatment and monitoring the patient's response. Precise
   guidelines for discontinuing treatment are often lacking or left
   entirely to the physician's discretion. We introduce a framework for
   developing adaptive, personalized treatments for such chronic diseases.
   Our model is based on a continuous-time, multi-armed bandit setting
   where drug effectiveness is assessed by aggregating information from
   several channels: by continuously monitoring the state of the patient,
   but also by (not) observing the occurrence of particular infrequent
   health events, such as relapses or disease flare-ups. Recognizing that
   the timing and severity of such events provide critical information for
   treatment decisions is a key point of departure in our framework
   compared with typical (bandit) models used in healthcare. We show that
   the model can be analyzed in closed form for several settings of
   interest, resulting in optimal policies that are intuitive and may have
   practical appeal. We illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology by
   developing a set of efficient treatment policies for multiple sclerosis,
   which we then use to benchmark several existing treatment guidelines.

AB Market competition may lead to mismatch between supply and demand. That
   is, overpricing may give rise to underselling, and underpricing may
   yield stockout. Capacity sharing is a common practice to align excessive
   capacity with excessive demand. Yet, the strategic interaction between
   competition and capacity sharing has not been adequately addressed. In
   this paper, we investigate optimal strategies and firm profitability of
   capacity sharing between competing firms under both ex ante and ex post
   contracting, depending on whether the capacity-sharing price is
   determined before or after price setting in the buyer market. We show
   that, with symmetric capacity, committing to an overly high
   capacity-sharing price may not necessarily improve firm payoffs.
   Capacity sharing softens price competition under either contracting
   scheme, whereas the optimal capacity-transfer price and equilibrium
   profits may be nonmonotonically influenced by buyer loyalty. The
   equilibrium outcome under ex ante contracting is more sensitive to
   variations in market parameters than ex post contracting. As a result,
   ex ante contracting is more likely to be preferred when the endowed
   capacity is low or buyer loyalty is high. However, when firms' capacity
   is asymmetric, capacity sharing may intensify equilibrium competition
   and hurt firm profitability through reversing the firms' relative
   pricing aggressiveness.

AB We show that a two-sided matching platform can successfully compete by
   limiting the number of choices it offers to its customers, while
   charging higher prices than platforms with unrestricted choice. We
   develop a stylized model of online dating where agents with different
   outside options match based on how much they like each other. Starting
   from these microfoundations, we derive the strength and direction of
   indirect network effects and show that increasing the number of
   potential matches has a positive effect due to larger choice, but also a
   negative effect due to competition between agents on the same side.
   Agents resolve the trade-off between these competing effects
   differently, depending on their outside options. For agents with high
   outside options, the choice effect is stronger than the competition
   effect, leading them to prefer an unrestricted-choice platform. The
   opposite is the case for agents with low outside options, who then have
   higher willingness to pay for a platform restricting choice, as it also
   restricts the choice set of their potential matches. Moreover, since
   only agents with low outside options self-select into the restricted
   choice platform, the competition effect is mitigated further. This
   allows multiple platforms offering different number of choices to
   coexist without the market tipping.

AB Many restaurants have recently implemented self-order technologies
   across both online and offline channels. Online technology, through
   websites and mobile apps, allows customers to order and pay before
   coming to the store; offline technology, such as self-service kiosks,
   allows store customers to place orders without interacting with a human
   employee. In this paper, we develop a stylized theoretical model to
   study the impact of self-order technologies on customer demand,
   employment levels, and restaurant profits. Our main results follow.
   First, customers using self-order technologies experience reduced
   waiting cost and increased demand, and moreover, these benefits may even
   carry over to customers who do not use these technologies. Second,
   although public opinion suggests that self-order technologies facilitate
   job cuts, we find instead that some firms should increase employment
   levels, and, paradoxically, this recommendation holds for firms with
   high labor costs. Finally, we find that firms should implement online
   (offline) self-order technology when customers have high (low) wait
   sensitivity.

   addition, we show that price matching benefits consumers in markets with

   broader knowledge- generalists. In other words, technology costs
   influence the composition of expertise in teamwork, with sufficiently
   large reductions leading to knowledge creation that combines more
   broadly across knowledge areas. These findings have important
   implications for organizations and policy makers in crafting incentives
   for more diverse knowledge creation through strategic investments that

   all products in her consideration set and chooses the one with the
   highest net utility. We show that the revenue-ordered assortment (i.e.,

   fails to be optimal, although it can obtain at least half the optimal
   revenue. We propose a k-quasi-attractiveness-ordered assortment and show

AB As an integrated part of a supply contract, trade credit has intrinsic
   connections with supply chain coordination and inventory management.
   Using a model that explicitly captures the interaction of firms'
   operations decisions, financial constraints, and multiple financing
   channels (bank loans and trade credit), this paper attempts to better
   understand the risk-sharing role of trade credit-that is, how trade
   credit enhances supply chain efficiency by allowing the retailer to
   partially share the demand risk with the supplier. Within this role, in
   equilibrium, trade credit is an indispensable external source for
   inventory financing, even when the supplier is at a disadvantageous
   position in managing default relative to a bank. Specifically, the
   equilibrium trade credit contract is net terms when the retailer's
   financial status is relatively strong. Accordingly, trade credit is the
   only external source that the retailer uses to finance inventory. By
   contrast, if the retailer's cash level is low, the supplier offers
   two-part terms, inducing the retailer to finance inventory with a
   portfolio of trade credit and bank loans. Further, a deeper
   early-payment discount is offered when the supplier is relatively less
   efficient in recovering defaulted trade credit, or the retailer has
   stronger market power. Trade credit allows the supplier to take
   advantage of the retailer's financial weakness, yet it may also benefit
   both parties when the retailer's cash is reasonably high. Finally, using
   a sample of firm-level data on retailers, we empirically observe the
   inventory financing pattern that is consistent with what our model
   predicts.

   responsible for ordering. SALES has better information about the demand
   than OPERATIONS and sends a nonbinding demand forecast to OPERATIONS. To
   incentivize truthful information sharing, we include a forecast error
   penalty in the incentive system of SALES. Besides monetary payoffs, we
   also add behavioral factors to the utility function of SALES. We model
   the setting as a signaling game and derive the Pareto-dominant
   separating equilibria of the game. In laboratory experiments, we observe
   human behavior that is in line with the predictions of the behavioral
   model but deviates substantially from expected-payoff-maximizing
   behavior. We use the behavioral model to design incentive systems for

   with out-of-sample treatments and out-of-sample subjects. We conduct
   additional experiments to provide further robustness to the results.

   financial institution. Using unique organization-level data, I exploit a
   change to the hierarchical organization to test whether delegation of
   authority and reduction of oversight improve the provision of effort by
   loan officers. I find that empowering loan officers increases their
   effort in producing and using soft information in their lending
   decisions. Consistent with the incentive view of delegation, loan
   officers who receive more authority rely more on soft information
   relative to hard information in their decisions than those for whom
   authority is only partially or not delegated. The results shed light on
   the importance of organizational design for the production and use of
   soft information in financial institutions.

AB This study constructs a novel data set of bankruptcy filings for a large
   sample of non-U.S. firms in 14 developed markets and sheds new light on
   the cross-sectional relation between default risk and stock returns.
   Using the reduced-form approach of Campbell et al. (2008) to estimate
   default probabilities, we offer conclusive evidence supporting the
   existence of a significant positive default risk premium in
   international markets. This finding is robust to different portfolio
   weighting schemes, data filters, risk-adjusting approaches, and holding
   period definitions. Decomposing the default risk measure into its
   systematic and idiosyncratic components, we find that the former drives
   this positive relation. We also show that the default risk premium is
   more pronounced in countries where creditor protection is stronger and
   shareholder bargaining power is lower.

   earnings less informative, renders the firm opaque, and increases
   informed traders' profitability. Under the "transparency" hypothesis,
   hedging reduces uncertainty and erodes the informed traders' information
   advantage and profitability. Our tests support the transparency
   hypothesis. Hedging is associated with lower uncertainty (lower implied
   volatility and analyst forecast dispersion, and greater breadth of
   ownership). It is also associated with a lower informed trading
   intensity, in particular for short selling. Short selling profits are
   more than twice lower on the stocks of firms engaging in corporate
   hedging.

AB Is top-down organization design worth attempting at all, or should
   organizations simply let their members learn which patterns of
   interaction are valuable by themselves, through a bottom-up process? Our
   analysis of an agent-based computational model shows that weak
   enforcement of even a randomly selected formal structure in a top-down
   manner can usefully guide the bottom-up emergence of networks of
   intraorganizational interactions between agents. In the absence of
   formal structure, interactions are prone to decline within
   organizations, because maintaining interactions requires coordination
   but breaking them does not. Formal structure regenerates the network of
   interactions between agents, who can then learn which interactions to
   keep or discard. This "network regeneration effect" of formal structure
   offers a rationale for the importance of top-down organization design,
   even if the design is limited in accuracy and enforcement.

AB Prior research suggests that social connections, including
   acquaintances, friends, and family, are valuable in a job search
   process. In these studies, the size of an average job seeker's network
   was much smaller and limited by the available modes of communication and
   the costs associated with maintaining social connections. However, the
   recent growth of online social networks has enabled job seekers to stay
   connected with many connections, weak or strong. Thus, the number of
   online connections-especially weak-has increased significantly. In this
   paper, we first examine whether an individual's social network plays a
   role in driving job search behavior, taking into account online social
   networking sites (e.g., Linkedln) and other job search modes. Second, we
   examine how ties in online social networks (both weak and strong) affect
   job search outcomes (modeled sequentially as job leads, interviews, and
   offers), and we compare the findings to job outcomes from traditional
   job search modes (e.g., career fairs, newspaper, Internet postings, and
   friends and family). To do so, we first construct an economic model of
   search behavior incorporating cost and benefit functions; we then
   estimate the model to recover structural parameters using the survey
   data of 424 users. Our findings show that users are spending more time
   searching for jobs on social networking sites. In addition, users'
   strong ties play a significant role in job search and are especially
   helpful in generating job leads, interviews, and offers; the weak ties,
   on average, are ineffective in generating positive outcomes and
   marginally negative in some cases.

AB We study how to use delay announcements to manage customer expectations
   while allowing a firm to prioritize among customers with different
   sensitivities to time and value. We examine this problem by developing a
   framework that characterizes the strategic interaction between the firm
   and heterogeneous customers. When the firm has information about the
   state of the system, yet lacks information on customer types, delay
   announcements play a dual role: they inform customers about the state of
   the system, while they also have the potential to elicit information on
   customer types based on their response to the announcements. The tension
   between these two goals has implications for the type of information
   that can be shared credibly. To explore the value of the information on
   customer types, we also study a model where the firm can observe
   customer types. We show that having information on the customer type may
   improve or hurt the credibility of the firm. While the creation of
   credibility increases the firm's profit, the loss of credibility does
   not necessarily hurt its profit.

   frequently in organizations or groups. Recent experimental evidence
   suggests that there is a stronger inclination to behave immorally in
   groups than individually. We ask if this is the case, and if so, why.
   Using a parsimonious laboratory setup, we study how individual behavior
   changes when deciding as a group member. We observe a strong dishonesty
   shift. This shift is mainly driven by communication within groups and
   turns out to be independent of whether group members face payoff
   commonality or not (i.e., whether other group members benefit from one's
   lie). Group members come up with and exchange more arguments for being
   dishonest than for complying with the norm of honesty. Thereby, group
   membership shifts the perception of the validity of the honesty norm and
   of its distribution in the population.

   can be traced to unusual firm-level news flow, which temporarily
   increases the level of investor disagreement about the firm value. At
   the same time, volatility shocks pose a barrier to short selling,
   preventing pessimistic investors from expressing their views. In the

   type and interaction process. For estimation tasks with a wide range of
   potential estimates, discussion aided accuracy by helping participants
   prevent and eliminate egregious errors. For estimation tasks with a
   naturally bounded range, discussion following independent estimates
   performed on par with averaging. Importantly, if participants did not
   first make independent estimates, discussion greatly harmed accuracy by
   limiting the range of considered estimates, independent of task type.
   Our research shows that discussion can be a powerful tool for error
   reduction, but only when appropriately structured: Decision makers
   should form independent judgments to consider a wide range of possible
   answers, and then use discussion to eliminate extremely large errors.

   predictability generated by the iterated combination is both

   macroeconomic variables play an important role in forming expected bond
   returns. Return forecasts are closely linked to the evolution of real

   profits and the value premium in a neoclassical investment-based model.
   Winner firms have higher short-term productivity and hence more negative
   exposures to the price of investment goods than loser firms as a result
   of greater investment plans. Value firms have lower long-term
   productivity and higher operating leverage and hence higher
   sensitivities to neutral productivity shocks than growth firms. The
   model reproduces the coexistence of momentum profits and the value
   premium, the failure of the unconditional capital asset pricing model,
   the predictability of momentum profits by market states, and the
   long-term reversal of momentum profits. Empirical tests confirm a
   negative price of risk for the shock to the relative price of investment

AB We document substantial management of reported and forecast earnings per

   management increasing with share price. Managers smooth the volatility
   of reported EPS by using accruals to offset cash flow shocks. Smoother
   EPS is easier to forecast, resulting in smaller forecast errors.
   Managers also differentially guide forecasts to improve accuracy.
   Whereas unmanaged forecast errors are much larger for high-price firms,
   they are compressed to the point their magnitudes resemble those for
   low-price firms. Managers also guide analyst forecasts to generate
   patterns of forecast walkdowns that again vary with share price. Given
   the remarkable level of management implied by our results, we conduct
   additional robustness analyses. The strongest evidence is observed in
   stock price responses: investors recognize efforts to manage reported
   and forecast EPS and adjust accordingly. We highlight potential biases
   caused by researchers being unaware of managerial efforts and investor
   responses, and offer ways to mitigate those biases.

   consistent with a standard model. We identify eight confounds that could
   have led to the mixed evidence-agent disutility from being viewed as
   selfish, small samples, insufficient wage raises, an effort ceiling,
   fatigue, selection of abler workers, reemployment concerns, and peer
   effects-and run a comprehensive test addressing them. Our test consisted
   of a field experiment hiring workers for a data entry job, followed by

   these confounds, we find that behavior during the field test was
   consistent with a standard model: workers did not repay fixed wage
   raises with an effort boost, but they did raise effort in response to a
   piece rate. The piece-rate scheme was also more efficient: the effort
   boost came at lower expense than paying fixed wage raises. Further,
   workers who behaved prosocially in laboratory games did not behave

AB Work scheduling research typically prescribes task sequences implemented

   prescribed sequence. Using data from 2.4 million radiological diagnoses,
   we find that doctors prioritize similar tasks (batching) and those tasks
   they expect to complete faster (shortest expected processing time).
   Moreover, they exercise more discretion as they accumulate experience.
   Exploiting random assignment of tasks to doctors' queues, instrumental
   variable models reveal that these deviations erode productivity. This
   productivity decline lessens as doctors learn from experience.
   Prioritizing the shortest tasks is particularly detrimental to
   productivity. Actively grouping similar tasks also reduces productivity,
   in stark contrast to productivity gains from exogenous grouping,
   indicating deviation costs outweigh benefits from repetition. By
   analyzing task completion times, our work highlights the trade-offs
   between the time required to exercise discretion and the potential gains
   from doing so, which has implications for how discretion over scheduling

AB We study how misaligned language between the investor and the firm
   contributes to the underweighting of foreign securities in an
   international portfolio. In particular, we document a significant U.S.
   institutional investor bias against firms located in Quebec relative to
   firms located in the rest of Canada (ROC). The differential bias is
   surprising given that (i) Quebec and the other Canadian provinces share
   the same nationality, federal law, stock exchange, and accounting
   standards; (ii) their regulatory filings are prepared in English and
   French; and (iii) U.S. institutional investors are sophisticated and
   located close to Quebec and the ROC. We also examine Quebec firms with
   different levels of French versus English online presences as well as
   those with CEOs who have U.S. work experience or board members or
   financial analysts who reside in the United States. We find that each
   factor affects the relative underweighting of investment in Quebec
   versus the ROC. Finally, we contrast the holdings of institutional
   investors located in the United Kingdom and France to bolster our
   conclusion that incongruent languages contribute to the underweighting
   of Quebec firms relative to firms in the ROC.

AB The relationship between a buyer and its suppliers often relies on
   factors beyond the terms of a contractual agreement. Buyers can
   therefore benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We argue that
   precontractual actions by a supplier, for example making costly
   buyer-specific investments without a long-term contract, can signal a
   supplier's trustworthiness. We develop a theoretical model to reflect
   supplier trustworthiness, and determine when a buyer can benefit from
   identifying trustworthy suppliers. We show that costly
   relationship-specific investments can serve as a signal of
   trustworthiness, and that supply chain profits increase when trustworthy
   suppliers are able to identify themselves in this fashion. We
   demonstrate the importance of the signaling mechanism using laboratory
   experiments. The experimental results show that relationship-specific
   investments lead to more collaborative transactions, with buyers
   offering higher prices and suppliers returning higher-quality products.
   This results in increased profits for both buyers and suppliers.
   Additionally, we design a treatment which shuts down the signaling
   mechanism and show that the benefits of the buyer-specific investment
   are no longer present in this case. Finally, we showthat the benefits of
   buyer-specific investments for both suppliers and buyers are
   strengthened when firms interact repeatedly.

AB Many online markets encourage traders to make good after an
   unsatisfactory transaction by offering the opportunity to withdraw
   negative reputational feedback in a dispute resolution phase. Motivated
   by field evidence and guided by theoretical considerations, we use
   laboratory markets with two-sided moral hazard to show that this option,
   contrary to the intended purpose, produces an escalation of dispute. The
   mutual feedback withdrawal option creates an incentive to leave negative
   feedback, independent of the opponent's behavior, to improve one's
   bargaining position in the dispute resolution phase. This leads to
   distorted reputation information and less trust and trustworthiness in
   the trading phase. Buyers who refuse to give feedback strategically,
   even when it comes at a personal cost, mitigate the detrimental impact.
   It is also mitigated in markets with one-sided moral hazard and a
   unilateral feedback withdrawal option.

   trips to a truck that is itself moving. In other words, a UAV picks up a
   package from the truck (which continues on its route), and after
   delivering the package, the UAV returns to the truck to pick up the next
   package. Although the hardware for such systems already exists, the
   extent to which such an approach can actually provide a significantly
   improved quality of service is not yet understood. By combining a
   theoretical analysis in the Euclidean plane with real-time numerical

AB We develop and estimate a dynamic game of strategic firm expansion and
   contraction decisions to study the role of firm size in future
   profitability and market dominance. Modeling firm size is important
   because retail chain dynamics are more richly driven by expansion and
   contraction than de novo entry or permanent exit. Additionally,
   anticipated size spillovers may influence the strategies of
   forward-looking firms, making it difficult to analyze the effects of
   size without explicitly accounting for these in the expectations and,
   hence, decisions of firms. Expansion may also be profitable for some
   firms while detrimental for others. Thus, we explicitly model and allow
   for heterogeneity in the dynamic link between firm size and profits as
   well as potential for persistent brand effects through firm-specific
   unobservable factors. As a methodological contribution, we surmount the
   hurdle of estimating the model by extending a two-step procedure that
   circumvents solving the game. The first stage combines semiparametric
   conditional choice probability estimation with a particle filter to
   eliminate the serially correlated unobservable components. The second
   stage uses a forward simulation approach to estimate the payoff
   parameters. Data on Canadian hamburger chains from their inception in
   1970 to 2005 provide evidence of firm-specific heterogeneity in brand
   effects, size spillovers, and persistence in profitability. This
   heterogeneous dynamic linkage shows how McDonald's becomes dominant and
   other chains falter as they evolve, thus affecting market structure and
   industry concentration.

AB We study price competition in markets with a large number (in the
   magnitude of hundreds or thousands) of potential competitors. We address
   two methodological challenges: simultaneity bias and high
   dimensionality. Simultaneity bias arises from joint determination of
   prices in competitive markets. We propose a new instrumental variable
   approach to address simultaneity bias in high dimensions. The novelty of
   the idea is to exploit online search and clickstream data to uncover
   customer preferences at a granular level, with sufficient variations
   both over time and across competitors in order to obtain valid
   instruments at a large scale. We then develop a methodology to identify
   relevant competitors in high dimensions combining the instrumental
   variable approach with high-dimensional l - 1 norm regularization. We
   apply this data-driven approach to study the patterns of hotel price
   competition in the New York City market. We also show that the
   competitive responses identified through our method can help hoteliers
   proactively manage their prices and promotions.

AB We consider a basic model of a risk-neutral principal incentivizing a

   Poisson process. The effort is costly to the agent, is unobservable to
   the principal, and affects the instantaneous arrival rate. Each arrival
   yields a constant revenue to the principal. The principal, therefore,
   devises a mechanism involving payments and a potential stopping time to
   motivate the agent to always exert effort. We formulate this problem as
   a stochastic optimal control model with an incentive constraint in
   continuous time over an infinite horizon. Although we allow payments to
   take general forms contingent on past arrival times, the optimal
   contract has a simple and intuitive structure, which depends on whether
   the agent is as patient as or less patient than the principal toward
   future income.

AB Despite the "1/N problem" associated with profit sharing, the empirical
   literature finds that sharing profits with workers has a positive impact
   on work team and firm performance. We examine one possible resolution to
   this puzzle by observing that, although the incentive to work harder
   under profit sharing is weak, it might be sufficient to motivate workers
   to report each other for shirking, especially if the workers are
   reciprocally minded. Our model provides the rationale for this
   conjecture, and we discuss the results of an experiment finding that
   workers who share in firm profits are more willing to provide accurate
   information about their peers to management and that profit sharing is
   most effective when peer reporting is possible.

AB Products such as Nike running shoes, Gillette razors, and Gatorade
   sports drink serve as the standard against which consumers evaluate
   other members of the category. Empirical evidence suggests that
   consumers care about not only the consumption utility derived from a
   product, but also the gain-loss utility in comparison to the reference
   product of the category. This paper examines how reference-dependent
   utility affects price competition in a horizontally differentiated
   market where consumers' tastes are diverse. When consumer valuations are
   low, the reference product is priced lower than a nonreference product.
   In contrast, when consumer valuations are high, the reference product is
   priced higher than a nonreference product. Moreover, loss aversion on
   the price dimension always intensifies competition among low-valuation
   goods, whereas loss aversion on the taste dimension softens competition
   among high-valuation goods only if consumer sensitivity to the
   difference in match quality is above a threshold. We also find that an
   increase in the diversity of consumers' tastes reduces equilibrium
   profits if consumer valuation is low but has the opposite effect if
   consumer valuation is high. We further explore how an increase in the
   popularity of the reference product affects price competition. Finally,
   we assess the robustness of the findings by extending the model in
   different directions.

   Investors have possibly different dogmatic beliefs about the mean,

   higher and higher orders of beliefs. Even when every investor's
   first-order expectations are unbiased, overvaluation results when
   investors have inconsistent higher-order beliefs that their own

AB I provide novel empirical evidence grounded in an original theoretical
   framework to explain why colocation matters for the rate, direction, and
   quality of scientific collaboration. To address endogeneity concerns due
   to selection into colocation and matching, I exploit the constraints
   imposed on the spatial allocation of labs on the Jussieu campus of Paris
   by the removal of asbestos from its buildings. Consistent with search
   costs constituting a major friction to collaboration, colocation
   increases the likelihood of joint research by 3.5 times, an effect that
   is mostly driven by lab pairs that face higher search costs ex ante.
   Furthermore, separation does not negatively affect collaboration between
   previously colocated labs. However, while colocated labs grow
   increasingly similar in topics and literature cited, separated ones
   embark on less correlated research trajectories. Research outcomes,
   instead, seem to be mostly influenced by how distance affects execution
   costs: after colocation, labs are more likely to pursue both
   lower-quality projects (a selection effect) and high-quality projects
   (an effort effect). Opposite effects on quality are observed after
   separation. Whereas search costs affect which scientists are likely to
   collaborate together, execution costs shape the quality of their output.

AB Despite criticisms regarding their effectiveness, reward programs today
   represent a prevalent and apparently successful form of marketing
   investment for several industries such as airlines, hotels, gas
   stations, and credit cards. To understand what might contribute to their
   success, this paper investigates the purchase behavior of consumers who
   participate in a reward program from the travel industry. We estimate a
   dynamic demand model of gasoline purchase, and compare the value that
   consumers attach to rewards with the value they attach to the money
   spent for gasoline. We find that there exists a significant portion of
   frequent travelers who extract more value from one dollar's worth of
   rewards than from one dollar spent for gasoline. Most of the
   effectiveness of the reward program is due to the behavior of these
   consumers. Their insensitivity to price induces firms to increase fuel
   prices by 1 euro cent per liter, which corresponds to about 10% increase
   in their margins. The program also contributes to softening competition,
   increasing margins by 4%.

AB Some corporations attempt to lessen their tax burden through involvement
   in the legislative process. We identify firms that contributed to
   congressional candidates who favor reductions in the U.S. corporate
   statutory tax rate. This support created a temporary incentive to manage
   effective tax rates (ETRs) up. We document that these firms increased
   their reported effective tax rate in the two calendar quarters preceding
   the 2012 election relative to adjacent periods and other firms
   supporting candidates in the same election. We find that the variation
   in upward ETR management is correlated with firm-level proxies for
   potential reputational costs, capital markets costs, and long-run tax
   burdens. The variation in upward ETR management is also correlated with
   firm-candidate-level proxies for strength of relationships and
   competitiveness of election races. Our findings provide new evidence on
   accounting choices in support of corporate political activity and on the

AB In war zones and economically deprived regions, because of extreme
   resource restrictions, a single provider may be the sole person in
   charge of providing emergency care to a group of patients. An important
   question the provider faces under such circumstances is whether or not
   to perform triage and how to prioritize the patients. By choosing to
   triage a particular patient, the provider can determine the health
   condition and thus the urgency of the patient, but that will come at the
   expense of delaying the actual service (stabilization or initial
   treatment) for that patient as well as all the other patients. Motivated
   by this problem, which also arises in other service contexts, we
   consider a service system where finitely many patients, all available at
   time zero, belong to one of the two possible triage classes, where each
   class is characterized by its waiting cost and expected service time.
   Patients' class identities are initially unknown, but the service
   provider has the option to spend time on triage to determine the class
   of a patient. Our objective is to identify policies that balance the
   time spent on triage with the time spent on service by minimizing the
   total expected cost. We provide a complete characterization of the
   optimal dynamic policy and show that the optimal dynamic policy that
   specifies when to perform triage is determined by a switching curve, and
   we provide a mathematical expression for this curve. One insight that
   comes out of this characterization is that the server should start with
   performing triage when there are sufficiently many patients and never
   perform triage when there are few patients. Finally, we carry out a
   numerical study in which we demonstrate how one can use our mathematical
   results to develop policies that can be used in mass-casualty triage and
   prioritization, and we find that there are substantial benefits to using
   one of these policies instead of the simpler benchmarks.

AB Catastrophe aversion and risk equity are important concepts both in risk
   management theory and practice. Keeney [Keeney RL (1980) Equity and
   public risk. Oper. Res. 28(3):527-534] was the first to formally define
   these concepts. He demonstrated that the two concepts are always in
   conflict. Yet his result is based on the assumption that individual
   risks are independent. It has therefore limited relevance for real-world
   catastrophic events. We extend Keeney's result to dependent risks and

AB Does creativity, on average, increase or decrease during bereavement?
   Dates of death of relatives and close friends of 33 French artists and
   15 American artists were gathered from electronic sources and
   biographies, and information on over 15,000 paintings was collected from
   the Blouin Art Sales Index and the online collections of the
   Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the National
   Gallery of Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Musee d'Orsay,
   including more than 12,000 observations on price. An event study
   indicates that there is no evidence that the death of a friend or
   relative makes an artist more creative, and there is some evidence that
   prices of paintings are significantly lower during the first year
   following the year of death of a friend or relative. Furthermore,
   paintings that were created during this bereavement period are less
   likely to be included in a major museum's collection.

AB A growing body of correlational studies suggests that sex hormones such
   as those contained in, or affected by, oral contraceptives (OCs) may
   impact economic behavior. However, despite widespread use of OCs among
   women in Western countries, little is known about their potential
   behavioral effects. The present study investigates whether OCs causally
   influence economic preferences. We randomly allocate 340 women aged
   18-35 to three months of a widely used OC or placebo treatment. At the
   end of treatment, we conduct an economic experiment measuring altruism,
   financial risk taking, and willingness to compete. The statistical power
   is 80% to detect an effect size equal to a Cohen's d of 0.30 at the 5%
   level. We find no significant effects of OCs on any of the measured
   preferences, indicating that this widely used OC treatment, commonly
   used throughout the world, does not significantly affect the measured
   economic preferences. Further, we find no relation between menstrual
   cycle phase and economic preferences in the placebo group.

   should a company's strategy be developed by its CEO versus by some

   with vision (in the sense of a strong belief about the right course of

   of strategy as "the smallest set of choices to optimally guide other
   choices." Among other things, the paper shows that strategy formulation
   by the CEO leads to both better strategy and better execution, and that

   a Chilean beverage company face exogenous variations in monthly sales
   goals. Confirming our predictions, we found that (1) absent strategic
   considerations-no goal ratcheting-salespersons increase (decrease) sales
   in the product category for which the return to effort increases
   (decreases), (2) including strategic considerations behavior reverses:
   salespersons who expect high goal ratcheting decrease (increase) sales

   (3) sales did not change for the average salespersons, reflecting
   heterogeneity in the expectations of goal ratcheting rather than

AB Firms often finance their inventory through debt and subsequently sell
   it to generate profits and service the debt. Pricing of products is
   consequently driven by inventory and debt servicing considerations. We
   show that limited liability under debt induces sellers to charge higher
   prices and to discount products at a slower pace. We find that these
   distortions result in revenue losses that compound over time, leading to
   some form of performance spiral down. We quantify the extent to which
   these inefficiencies can be mitigated by practical debt contract terms
   that emerge as natural remedies from our analysis, and find debt
   amortization or financial covenants to be the most effective, followed
   by debt relief and early repayment options.

AB Mobile-promotion platforms enable advertisers (individual users or
   businesses) to directly launch their personalized mobile advertising
   campaigns. These platforms contract with advertisers to provide a
   certain number of impressions on mobile apps in their desired sets of
   geographic locations (usually cities or zip codes) within their desired
   time durations (for example, a month); the execution of each such a
   contract is referred to as a campaign. To fulfill the demands of the
   campaigns, the platform bids in real time at an ad exchange to win
   mobile impressions arising over the desired sets of locations of the
   campaigns and then allocates the acquired impressions among the ongoing
   campaigns. The core features that characterize this procurement
   problem-supply is uncertain, supply cannot be inventoried, and there are
   demand-side commitments to be met-are applicable to a variety of other
   business settings aswell. Our analysis in this paper offers near-optimal
   policies for both a static model and a dynamic model of campaign
   arrivals. The static model represents a subscription-based setting,
   where customers provide information of their campaigns in advance to the
   platform. The dynamic model represents a setting where campaigns arrive
   randomly and the platform reacts to these arrivals in real time; for
   this model, our rolling-horizon policy periodically recomputes the
   platform's procurement (or bidding) and allocation decisions. We
   establish performance bounds on our policies for both models and
   demonstrate the attractiveness of these bounds on real data. By
   isolating important structural features of a given set of campaigns, we
   discuss practical implementation issues and offer procurement-policy
   recommendations for a variety of settings based on these features.

AB Firms employ various techniques to obtain information about consumer
   taste/location and valuation prior to making product design decisions.
   User-generated content has become an important information source. The
   vast variety and volume of user-generated content makes firms better
   informed about consumers (precision-improving effect), and the common
   and public nature of user-generated content makes firms' information
   more correlated (correlation-increasing effect). We examine the impact
   of user-generated content in a setting in which two competing firms that
   are uncertain about consumer location or valuation design and sell
   horizontally differentiated products. We find that user-generated
   content has very different implications for competing firms' location
   decisions and quality decisions. When firms are uncertain about consumer
   taste and choose their product locations, whether firms and/or consumers
   benefit from the user-generated content depends on which of the two
   effects dominates. We find that only when the correlation-increasing
   effect is moderate, a win-win scenario for both firms and consumers
   occurs, but the society always benefits from user-generated content.
   Stronger consumer preference strengthens the overall impact of
   user-generated content. In sharp contrast, when firms face uncertain
   consumer valuation of quality and choose product quality, they do not
   benefit from user-generated content, but consumers may benefit or lose
   from it. When the correlation-increasing effect is significant, both
   firms and consumers, and therefore the society, are hurt by
   user-generated content. Stronger consumer preference mitigates the
   negative impact but amplifies the positive impact of user-generated
   content in this case.

AB Online product ratings offer information on product quality. Scholars
   have recently proposed the potential of designing multidimensional
   rating systems to better convey information on multiple dimensions of
   products. This study investigates whether and how multidimensional
   rating systems affect consumer satisfaction (measured by product
   ratings), based on both observational data and two randomized
   experiments. Our identification strategy of the observational study
   hinges on a natural experiment on TripAdvisor when the website started
   to allow consumers to rate multiple dimensions of the restaurants, as
   opposed to only providing an overall rating, in January 2009. We further
   obtain rating data on the same set of restaurants from Yelp, which
   controls for the unobserved restaurant quality over time and allows us
   to identify the causal effect using a difference-in-differences
   approach. Results from the econometric analyses show that ratings in a
   single-dimensional rating system have a downward trend and a higher
   dispersion, whereas ratings in a multidimensional rating system are
   significantly higher and convergent. Findings from two randomized
   experiments suggest that the multidimensional rating system helps
   consumers find products that better fit their preferences and increases
   the confidence of their choices. We also show that the observed results
   cannot be explained by the priming effect due to rating system interface
   or a list of other alternative explanations. The combined evidence from
   the natural experiment and randomized experiments support the view that
   the multidimensional rating system enhances rating informativeness and
   provide implications for designing online rating systems that help
   consumers match their preferences with product attributes.

AB This paper explores how state genetic privacy laws affect the diffusion
   of personalized medicine, using data on genetic testing for cancer
   risks. State genetic privacy regimes employ and combine up to three
   alternative approaches to protecting patient privacy: Rules requiring
   that an individual is notified about potential privacy risks; rules
   restricting discriminatory usage of genetic data by employers or
   insurance companies; and rules limiting redisclosure without the consent
   of the individual. We find empirically that approaches to genetic and
   health privacy that give users control over redisclosure encourage the
   spread of genetic testing, but that notification deters individuals from
   obtaining genetic tests. We present some evidence that the latter
   reflects costs imposed on the supply of genetic testing by hospitals. We
   find no effects of state genetic antidiscrimination laws on genetic
   testing rates.

   crowd out nonmonetary motives towork hard. Empirical evidence from the
   field, however, has been based on between-subjects designs that are best
   suited for detecting crowding out due to low-powered incentives.
   High-powered incentives in the workplace tend to increase output, but it
   is unknown whether this masks crowding out. This paper uses a
   within-subject experimental design and finds evidence that crowding out
   also extends to high-powered incentives in a real work setting with paid
   workers. There is individual heterogeneity, however, with a minority of
   workers reporting crowding in of motivation. Thus, the impact of
   performance pay might depend on the mix of worker types.

AB We consider a situation in which agents have mutual claims on each
   other, summarized in a liability matrix. Agents' assets might be
   insufficient to satisfy their liabilities, leading to defaults. In case
   of default, bankruptcy rules are used to specify the way agents are
   going to be rationed. A clearing payment matrix is a payment matrix
   consistent with the prevailing bankruptcy rules that satisfies limited
   liability and priority of creditors. Since clearing payment matrices and
   the corresponding values of equity are not uniquely determined, we
   provide bounds on the possible levels equity can take. Unlike the
   existing literature, which studies centralized clearing procedures, we
   introduce a large class of decentralized clearing processes. We show the
   convergence of any such process in finitely many iterations to the least
   clearing payment matrix. When the unit of account is sufficiently small,
   all decentralized clearing processes lead essentially to the same value
   of equity as a centralized clearing procedure. As a policy implication,
   it is not necessary to collect and process all the sensitive data of all
   the agents simultaneously and run a centralized clearing procedure.

AB This paper investigates a decomposition approach for binary optimization
   problems with nonlinear objectives and linear constraints. Our
   methodology relies on the partition of the objective function into
   separate low-dimensional dynamic programming (DP) models, each of which
   can be equivalently represented as a shortest-path problem in an
   underlying state-transition graph. We show that the associated
   transition graphs can be related by a mixed-integer linear program
   (MILP) so as to produce exact solutions to the original nonlinear
   problem. To address DPs with large state spaces, we present a general
   relaxation mechanism that dynamically aggregates states during the
   construction of the transition graphs. The resulting MILP provides both
   lower and upper bounds to the nonlinear function, and it may be embedded
   in branch-and-bound procedures to find provably optimal solutions. We
   describe how to specialize our technique for structured objectives
   (e.g., submodular functions) and consider three problems arising in
   revenue management, portfolio optimization, and healthcare. Numerical
   studies indicate that the proposed technique often outperforms
   state-of-the-art approaches by orders of magnitude in these
   applications.

AB It iswell known that selecting a good mixed-integer programming (MIP)
   formulation is crucial for effectively obtaining a solution with
   state-of-the art solvers. Although best practices and guidelines for
   constructing good formulations abound, there is rarely a single
   systematic construction approach that leads to the best possible
   formulation. Here, we introduce embedding formulations and complexity as
   a new MIP formulation paradigm for systematically constructing
   formulations for disjunctive constraints that are optimal with respect
   to size. More specifically, they yield the smallest possible ideal
   formulation (i.e., one whose LP relaxation has integral extreme points)
   among all formulations that only use 0-1 auxiliary variables. We use the
   paradigm to characterize optimal formulations for special ordered sets
   of type 2 and certain piecewise linear functions of two variables. We
   also show that the resultant formulations can provide a significant
   computational advantage over all known formulations for piecewise linear
   functions.

   consequence, reputational concerns may induce the certifier to reduce
   information quality, thus depressing welfare. The entry of a second

   certifier, competition plays a disciplining role and the region where
   reputation is bad shrinks. Conversely, this region may expand when

   Misreporting firms pay greater loan spreads than matched firms for at

   uncertain management ability. Each director receives a noisy private
   signal about CEO ability, after which directors discuss this ability and
   vote to retain or replace the CEO. Directors care about true CEO
   ability, since it affects their equity holding values; however, a CEO
   may impose costs of dissent on a director who votes to fire but fails to
   oust her. We relate the equilibrium CEO firing decision to board size,
   board composition, the effect of an imprecise public signal, and the
   cost and probability of finding a good replacement CEO.

AB We evaluate the efficiency of capital deployment for acquiring firms
   before mergers and acquisitions (M&As), defined as the return on
   invested capital net of the cost of capital, and link this measure to
   firms' postacquisition performance. Acquirers with higher preacquisition
   net returns on investment have superior long-run operating and stock
   performance than do acquirers with lower returns. Acquirers with low net
   returns on investment also underperform matching nonacquirers. The
   relationship between preacquisition investment return and
   postacquisition performance is weakened when chief executive officer
   turnover occurs after deal completion. These results imply that
   managerial ability in deploying capital and creating value for
   shareholders persists through M&As.

   to illustrate the mechanism through which JIT affects cash and quantify
   its impact. In the model, both cash and inventory can serve as working
   capital. As firms switch from the traditional system to JIT, they shift
   resources from inventory to cash to facilitate transactions with
   suppliers. On average, this switchover accounts for a
   4.1-percentage-point increase in the cash-to-assets ratio, which is

AB Prior studies attribute analysts' forecast superiority over time-series
   forecasting models to their access to a large set of firm, industry, and
   macroeconomic information (an information advantage), which they use to
   update their forecasts on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (a timing
   advantage). This study leverages recently developed mixed data sampling
   (MIDAS) regression methods to synthesize a broad spectrum of high
   frequency data to construct forecasts of firm-level earnings. We compare
   the accuracy of these forecasts to those of analysts at short horizons
   of one quarter or less. We find that our MIDAS forecasts are more
   accurate and have forecast errors that are smaller than analysts' when
   forecast dispersion is high and when the firm size is smaller. In
   addition, we find that combining our MIDAS forecasts with analysts'
   forecasts systematically outperforms analysts alone, which indicates
   that our MIDAS models provide information orthogonal to analysts. Our
   results provide preliminary support for the potential to automate the
   process of forecasting firm-level earnings, or other accounting
   performance measures, on a high-frequency basis.

   Perfect screening enables the principal to fine-tune the contract to the

   is contingent on subjective interim performance measures. Given that
   interim performance measures are critical for motivating first-stage
   effort, the principal may benefit from adopting no screening or partial

AB We study the dynamic mechanism design problem of a seller who repeatedly
   sells independent items to a buyer with private values. In this setting,
   the seller could potentially extract the entire buyer surplus by running
   efficient auctions and charging an upfront participation fee at the
   beginning of the horizon. In some markets, such as Internet advertising,
   participation fees are not practical since buyers expect to inspect
   items before purchasing them. This motivates us to study the design of
   dynamic mechanisms under successively more stringent requirements that
   capture the implicit business constraints of these markets. We first
   consider a periodic individual rationality constraint, which limits the
   mechanism to charge at most the buyer's value in each period. While this
   prevents large upfront participation fees, the seller can still design
   mechanisms that spread a participation fee across multiple initial
   auctions. These mechanisms have the unappealing feature that they
   provide close-to-zero buyer utility in earlier auctions in exchange for
   higher utility in later auctions. To address this problem, we introduce
   a martingale utility constraint, which imposes the requirement that from
   the perspective of the buyer, the next item's expected utility is equal
   to the present one's. Our main result is providing a dynamic auction
   satisfying martingale utility and periodic individual rationality whose
   loss in profit with respect to first-best (full extraction of buyer
   surplus) is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. The proposed
   mechanism is a dynamic two-tier auction with a hard floor and a soft
   floor that allocates the item whenever the buyer's bid is above the hard
   floor and charges the minimum of the bid and the soft floor.

AB Telemedical physician triage (TPT) is an example of a hierarchical
   knowledge-based service system (HKBSS) in which a second level of
   decision agent (telemedical physician) renders a decision on cases
   referred to him or her by the primary level agents (triage nurses).
   Managing the speed-versus-quality trade-off in such systems presents a
   unique challenge because of the interplay between agent knowledge and
   flow of work between the two levels. We develop a novel model of agent
   knowledge, based on the beta distribution, and deploy it in a partially
   observable Markov decision process model to describe the optimal policy
   for deciding which cases (patients) to refer to the second level for
   further evaluation. We show that this policy has a monotone
   control-limit structure that reduces the fraction of decisions made at
   the upper level as workload increases. Because the optimal policy is
   complex, we use structural insights from it to design two practical
   heuristics. These heuristics enable an HKBSS to adapt efficiently to
   workload shifts by adjusting the criteria for referring decisions to the
   upper level based on partial real-time queue length information.
   Finally, we conduct analytic and numerical analyses to derive insights
   into the management of a TPT system. We find that (1) the telemedical
   physician should evaluate more patients as congestion in the emergency
   room waiting area increases; (2) training that improves accuracy of the
   physician and/or nurses can be effective even if it only does so for a
   single patient type, but training that improves consistency must do so
   for all patient types to be effective; and (3) patient classification in
   triage should consider environmental and operational conditions in
   addition to the patient's medical condition.

AB We test for a "hot hand" (i.e., short-term predictability in
   performance) in Major League Baseball using panel data. We find strong
   evidence for its existence in all 10 statistical categories we consider.
   The magnitudes are significant; being "hot" corresponds to between
   one-half and one standard deviation in the distribution of player
   abilities. Our results are in notable contrast to the majority of the
   hot-hand literature, which has generally found either no hot hand or a
   very weak hot hand in sports, often employing basketball shooting data.
   We argue that this difference is attributable to endogenous defensive
   responses: basketball presents sufficient opportunity for transferring
   defensive resources to equate shooting probabilities across players,
   whereas baseball does not. We then develop a method to test whether
   baseball teams do respond appropriately to hot opponents. Our results
   suggest teams respond in a manner consistent with drawing correct
   inference about the magnitude of the hot hand except for a tendency to
   overreact to very recent performance (i.e., the last five attempts).

   improvements based both on program participation and postprogram health
   changes. Sick and healthy individuals who improved their health
   increased productivity by about 10%, with surveys indicating sources in
   improved diet and exercise. Although the small worker sample limits both
   estimate precision and our ability to isolate mechanisms behind this
   increase, we argue that our results are consistent with improved worker

   that improve both workers' wellness and economic value, and provides a

   highlighting racial bias among professional basketball referees that
   occurred in May 2007 following the release of an academic study. Using
   new data, we confirm that racial bias persisted in the years after the
   study's original sample but prior to the media coverage. Subsequent to
   the media coverage, though, the bias disappeared. Several potential
   mechanisms may have produced this result, including voluntary behavior
   changes by individual referees, adjustments by players to new
   information, and changes in referee behavior due to institutional
   pressure. These results suggest a new kind of Hawthorne effect in which
   greater scrutiny of even subtle forms of bias can bring about meaningful

AB In recent years, several firms have decided to withdraw from profitable
   markets, believing the move will be beneficial for their overall
   business. For instance, CVS dropped tobacco products from its shelves in
   2014, while Aldi dropped confectionery from its checkout lines in 2016.
   Findings from consumers' evaluation of such moves suggest there exists a
   negative market spillover from selling in a market, such that a firm's
   participation in one market reduces consumers' willingness to pay for
   the firm's products in other markets. On the other hand, certain
   socially favorable markets, such as markets for environment-friendly
   products, have been shown to create a positive market spillover for
   their sellers, increasing consumers' willingness to pay in other markets
   the sellers participate in. We build an analytical model of two
   competing firms to examine how firms react to a market spillover and
   find the conditions under which different firms would sell in the
   spillover-producing market. Our analysis of how firms' profits are
   affected by market spillovers identifies the consumers' reservation
   value in the spillover-producing market, the relative size of the two
   markets, and the extent of the market spillover as key factors
   determining which firms benefit from a market spillover. Interestingly,
   we find it is possible for both firms to make more profit with a
   negative market spillover compared to when there is no market spillover,
   while a positive market spillover can actually result in lower profits
   for both firms compared to no market spillover.

AB Using hourly traffic and readership data from a major news website, and
   taking advantage of a global Facebook outage, we study the relationship
   between social networks and online news consumption. More specifically,
   we test if online social networks compete with content providers or
   instead play a complementary role by promoting and attracting traffic to
   external websites. During the outage, consistent with a promotional
   effect, we observe a significant decrease in traffic and unique visitors
   to the news website lasting beyond the outage hours. We further find
   that direct referrals from Facebook links grossly underestimated the
   actual impact of Facebook in generating traffic. Instead, during the
   outage, we observe a more significant reduction in visitors arriving at
   the news website from search engines or directly typing the website URL
   or using bookmarks. Additionally, readership of articles and types of
   pages viewed also changed during the outage. Although we observe a drop
   in news consumption during the outage hours for all news categories, the
   subsequent news consumption differs across categories. Time sensitive
   categories like sports and local news see an increase in consumption,
   whereas news on women issues or health topics see a decrease. Analysis
   of individual-level visit and readership behavior during the outage also
   reveals that Facebook not only introduces selectivity bias by attracting
   shallower readers but also changes readership patterns (in the absence
   of Facebook, visitors engage in more in-depth reading). To test the
   generalizability of our results, we study the impact of the outage on
   referrals from other social media outlets, on other news sites, and on
   other content and e-commerce sites. We find similar effects on other
   news providers, whereas data from nonnews sites, including e-commerce,
   show no major outage effects. Overall, our results have important
   managerial implications. We highlight how our results unearth the
   importance of search engine optimization and of strong branding for news

AB A key goal of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation is to
   provide incentives for producers to design their products for
   recyclability. EPR is typically implemented in a collective system,
   where a network of recycling resources are coordinated to fulfill the
   EPR obligations of a set of producers, and the resulting system cost is
   allocated among these producers. Collective EPR is prevalent because of
   its cost efficiency advantages. However, it is considered to provide
   inferior design incentives compared to an individual implementation
   (where producers fulfill their EPR obligations individually). In this
   paper, we revisit this assertion and investigate its fundamental
   underpinnings in a network setting. To this end, we develop a new biform
   game framework that captures producers' independent design choices
   (noncooperative stage) and recognizes the need to maintain the voluntary
   participation of producers for the collective system to be stable
   (cooperative stage). This biform game subsumes the network-based
   operations of a collective system and captures the interdependence
   between producers' product design and participation decisions. We then
   characterize the manner in which design improvement may compromise
   stability and vice versa. We establish that a stable collective EPR
   implementation can match and even surpass an individual implementation
   with respect to product design outcomes. In particular, we show that
   when the processing technology efficiency and product recyclability are
   substitutes (complements), a recycling network where processor capacity
   pooling leads to sufficiently low (high) cost reduction will lead to
   superior designs in the collective system and maintain its stability,
   and we propose cost allocation mechanisms to achieve this dual purpose.

   associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments,
   shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content-like
   mentions of price and deals-is associated with lower levels of
   engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement
   levels when provided in combination with brand personality-related
   attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals
   and promotions, drive consumers' path to conversion (click-throughs).
   These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom
   targeting of Facebook's EdgeRank (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect
   more closely user reaction to content than Facebook's behavioral
   targeting. Our results suggest that there are benefits to content
   engineering that combines informative characteristics that help in
   obtaining immediate leads (via improved click-throughs) with brand
   personality-related content that helps in maintaining future reach and
   branding on the social media site (via improved engagement). These
   results inform content design strategies. Separately, the methodologywe
   apply to content-code text is useful for future studies utilizing
   unstructured data such as advertising content or product reviews.

AB The relationship between market structure and advertising has been
   extensively studied, but has generated sharply opposing theoretical
   predictions, as well as inconclusive empirical findings, likely because
   of severe endogeneity concerns. We exploit the 2008 merger of Miller and
   Coors in the U.S. brewing industry to examine how changes in local
   concentration affect firms' advertising behavior. Well-established
   regional preferences over beer brands, and the sharp increase in
   concentration from the merger, make this an excellent setting to analyze
   this question. We find a significant positive effect of local market
   concentration on advertising expenditures: a 100-point increase in the
   Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index measure of concentration increases
   advertising per capita by about 5%. Our findings shed light on how and
   when firms choose to deploy advertising.

AB Web-based firms often rely on cloud-based computational resources to
   serve customers, but the number of customers they will serve is rarely
   known at the time of product launch. A recent innovation in cloud
   computing, known as autoscaling, allows companies to automatically scale
   their computational load up or down to match customer demand. We build a
   game theory model to examine how autoscaling will affect firms'
   decisions to enter a new market and the resulting equilibrium prices,
   profitability, and consumer surplus. The model produces novel results
   depending on the likelihood of a firm's success in the new market,
   differentiation among potential entrants, and the cost of computational
   capacity. For instance, in contrast to previous capacity commitment
   models with demand certainty, we show that autoscaling can mitigate
   price competition if the likelihood of a firm's success in the market is
   moderate and the cost of capacity is sufficiently low. This is because
   without autoscaling, the firms' uncertainty about demand would lead to
   excessive computational capacities and thus aggressive price
   competition. We also find that when the likelihood of success is
   sufficiently high, autoscaling facilitates entry for one firm yet deters
   a second firm from simultaneously entering the market.

AB We extend the extant research on neutral recommendation agents (RAs) to
   those that lack recommendation neutrality and are biased toward
   sponsors. We first investigate the effects of recommendation neutrality
   on users' trust and distrust in RAs by comparing a biased RA with
   sponsorship disclosure with a neutral RA. We then apply a contingency
   approach to examine the effects of sponsorship disclosure on users'
   trust and distrust in biased RAs, with explanations for organic
   recommendations as a contingent factor. A laboratory experiment was
   conducted in the United States. We determine that users' trust in the
   biased RA with sponsorship disclosure is lower and that their distrust
   is higher than that in the neutral RA. Results also show that user trust
   in a biased RA increases only when explanations for organic
   recommendations and sponsorship disclosure are both provided. Users'
   perceived psychological contract violations of an RA have been verified
   as a key mediator of the examined effects. However, explanations for
   organic recommendations, sponsorship disclosure, or their combination
   fail to significantly lower users' distrust in a biased RA. A second
   experiment conducted in Hong Kong confirms the major findings of the
   experiment conducted in the United States. Theoretical contributions and

AB This paper presents a parsimonious model of the bricks-and-mortar entry
   choice of online retailers in light of consumer sales taxes. On the one
   hand, a retailer benefits by entry since the second distribution channel
   enables it to reach new customers, giving it a leg up on rivals. On the
   other hand, physical entry typically compels the retailer to start
   collecting sales taxes even for online transactions, making its
   consumers particularly price sensitive. This paper examines this
   trade-off to characterize a retailer's entry decision, as well as the
   market-level equilibrium of bricks-and-mortar penetration. The paper
   then layers in supply market considerations-namely, the retailer's
   procurement of products from upstream suppliers. The analysis
   demonstrates that sales taxes not only reduce the consumers' willingness
   to pay for products in the retail market, but also dampen the retailer's
   willingness to pay for the products in the wholesale arena. This
   reluctance influences the clearing price in the supply market and, thus,
   the firm's decision to establish the physical retail store.

AB In knowledge-intensive projects, one of the challenges project team
   leaders often face is how to combine their roles of direction and
   contribution. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic model of team
   leadership of coproductive projects and study how team leaders should
   combine their directing and contributing efforts depending on the team
   and project characteristics. Our analysis reveals that two types of team
   leadership approaches arise in equilibrium, namely, "participatory" team
   leadership, under which the team leader gives the team members full
   discretion on their choice of effort, and "directive" team leadership,
   under which the team leader demands team members exert higher effort
   than what they would choose to exert voluntarily. We find that directive
   team leadership is optimal when the team members have low incentives,
   that is, when their rewards are low, the size of the team is large, or
   failure is not too costly (e.g., continuation is possible); otherwise,
   participatory team leadership is optimal. Moreover, we show that a
   higher degree of effort complementarity (as in innovative projects)
   leads to greater alignment between the team leader's and team members'
   contributing efforts, which, under directive team leadership, also
   implies greater alignment between the team leader's directing and
   contributing efforts. Finally, the team leader should set the team size
   and team members' rewards in a way that accentuates the difference
   between the two team leadership approaches. That is, under directive
   team leadership, she should set a large team size and offer the team
   members low rewards whereas under participatory team leadership she
   should set a small team size and offer the team members high rewards.

AB Information about the future may be instrumentally useful yet scary. For
   example, many patients shy away from precise genetic tests about their
   dispositions for severe diseases. They are afraid that a bad test result
   could render them desperate as a result of anticipatory feelings. We
   show that partially revealing tests are typically optimal when
   anticipatory utility interacts with an instrumental need for
   information. The same result emerges when patients rely on probability
   weighting. Optimal tests provide only two signals, which renders them
   easily implementable. While the good signal is typically precise, the
   bad one remains coarse. This way, patients have a substantial chance to
   learn that they are free of the genetic risk in question. Yet even if
   the test outcome is bad, they do not end in a situation without hope.

AB I decompose inflation risk into (i) a component that is correlated with
   factors that determine investors' preferences and investment
   opportunities and real returns on real assets with risky cash flows
   (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate, commodities, etc.), and (ii) a
   residual inflation risk component. In equilibrium, only the first
   component earns a risk premium. Therefore, investors should avoid
   exposure to the residual component. All nominal bonds, including
   money-market accounts, have constant nominal cash flows, and thus their
   real returns are equally exposed to residual inflation risk. In
   contrast, inflation-protected bonds provide a means to avoid cash flow
   and residual inflation risk. Hence, every investor should put 100% of
   herwealth in real assets (inflation-protected bonds, stocks, corporate
   bonds, real estate, commodities, etc.) and finance every long/short
   position in nominal bonds with an equal amount of other nominal bonds or
   by borrowing/lending cash; that is, investors should hold a
   zero-investment portfolio of nominal bonds and cash.

AB Behavioral theory predicts that investor overconfidence leads to
   overpricing because overconfident investors overestimate the quality of
   their information and underestimate risk. We test this prediction by
   using a measure of investor overconfidence derived from the
   characteristics and holdings of U.S. equity mutual fund managers. We
   find that firms with more overconfident investors are relatively
   overvalued based on the market-to-book ratio and a misvaluation measure.
   The result is stronger among stocks with greater mutual fund ownership,
   particularly by active mutual funds. Firms with more overconfident
   investors also exhibit lower subsequent stock returns, issue more
   equity, and invest more. Overall, our findings suggest that investor
   overconfidence is significantly related to firm valuation and corporate

AB Bankruptcy costs depend not only on the laws that govern financial

   firms. This paper tests whether Chapter 11 restructuring outcomes are
   affected by time constraints in busy bankruptcy courts. Using the
   passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act
   as an exogenous shock to caseloads, I find that commercial banks report
   lower charge-offs on business lending when court caseloads decline,
   suggesting that the costs of financial distress are lower in
   less-congested courts. Further, court caseload affects how restructuring
   takes place. Less-busy bankruptcy judges liquidate fewer small firms,
   but more large firms. When caseload declines, large firms spend less
   time in court and firms that are dismissed from court are less likely to
   refile for bankruptcy. In addition, firms are less likely to sell assets
   or obtain debtor-in-possession financing in less-busy courts.

   paradigms often attained uncertainty via adding an unexplained

   behavior that appears to reflect risk aversion could instead reflect an
   aversion to weird transactions. Specifically, willingness to pay drops
   just as much when adding risk to a transaction as when adding
   unexplained features. Holding transaction features constant, adding
   additional risk does not further reduce willingness to pay. We interpret
   our work as generalizing ambiguity aversion to riskless choice.

AB We consider the fruits of integrating agent-based modeling (ABM) with
   lab-based experimental research with human subjects. While both ABM and
   lab experiments have similar aims-to identify the rules, tendencies, and
   heuristics by which individual agents make decisions and respond to
   external stimuli-they work toward their common goal in notably different
   ways. Behavioral-lab research typically exposes human subjects to
   experimental manipulations, or treatments, to make causal inferences by
   observing variation in response to the treatment. ABM researchers
   ascribe individual simulated "agents" with decision rules describing
   their behavior and subsequently attempt to replicate "macro" level
   empirical patterns. Integration of ABM and lab experiments presents
   advantages for both sets of researchers. ABM researchers will benefit
   from exposure to a larger set of empirically validated mechanisms that
   can add nuance and refinement to their models of human behavior and
   system dynamics. Lab-oriented researchers will gain from ABM a method
   for assessing the validity and magnitude of their findings, adjudicating
   between competing mechanisms, developing new theory to test in the lab,
   and exploring macro-level, long-run implications of subtle, micro-level
   observations that can be difficult to observe in the field. We offer an

AB The majority of extant studies involving status argue that status enters
   into choice and evaluation because people personally believe that status
   serves as a signal of quality. However, this mechanism seems less
   plausible in cases when consensus on the meaning of quality is lacking.
   To understand how and why status often nonetheless enters into
   evaluation in those cases, this paper contributes to a growing body of
   work that proposes that individuals and organizations are particularly
   likely to base their choices and evaluations on status when they are
   concerned with the reactions of others. We provide an empirical test of
   this argument by analyzing how the sales gap between prizewinning books
   and their shortlisted-only peers (as well as a second similar-content
   control group) changes during the December holidays, when the purchase
   of books as gifts increases relative to purchases for one's own personal
   use. Results show that the sales gap widens with the increased
   orientation toward gift giving, consistent with our theoretical
   arguments about how attending to audience reactions drives the use of
   status. Analyses of two online experiments allow for further
   clarification of the mechanism behind our findings.

   sacrifice of new patients: physicians accept 15% fewer new patients each
   month following e-visit adoption. Our data set on nearly 100,000

AB We propose a new medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) model with endogenous
   uncertainty in the casualty delivery times. The goal is to provide
   timely evacuation and medical treatment to injured soldiers. The model
   enforces the "Golden Hour" evacuation doctrine, attempts to maximize the
   expected number of severely injured soldiers evacuated within one hour
   without delay, and represents the availability of air ambulances as an
   endogenous source of uncertainty. The MEDEVAC model is a mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming problem whose continuous relaxation is in general
   nonconvex and for which we develop an algorithmic method articulated
   around (i) new bounding techniques obtained through the solution of
   restriction and relaxation problems and (ii) a spatial branch-and-bound
   algorithm solving conic mixed-integer programs at each node. The
   computational study, based on data from Operation Enduring Freedom,
   reveals that the bounding problems can be quickly solved regardless of
   problem size, the bounds are tight, and the spatial branch-and-bound
   dominates the CPLEX and BARON solvers in terms of computational time and
   robustness. Compared to the MEDEVAC myopic policy, our approach
   increases the number of casualties treated timely and can contribute to
   reducing the number of deaths on the battlefield. The benefits increase
   as the MEDEVAC resources become tighter and the combats intensify. The
   model can be used at the strategic level to design an efficient MEDEVAC
   system and at the tactical level for intelligent tasking and
   dispatching.

AB We examine how the entry of gig-economy platforms influences local
   entrepreneurial activity. On the one hand, such platforms may reduce
   entrepreneurial activity by offering stable employment for the
   unemployed and underemployed. On the other hand, such platforms may
   enable entrepreneurial activity by offering work flexibility that allows
   the entrepreneur to redeploy resources strategically in order to pursue
   the nascent venture. To resolve this tension, we examine the entry of
   the ridesharing platform Uber X into local areas. We use two measures of
   entrepreneurial activity: crowdfunding campaign launches at Kickstarter,
   the world's largest reward-based crowdfunding platform, and levels of
   self-employment from the Current Population Survey. Results indicate a
   negative and significant relationship between platform entry and both
   measures of entrepreneurial activity. Importantly, the effect manifests
   primarily amongst unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns and unincorporated
   entrepreneurial ventures, suggesting that gig-economy platforms
   predominantly reduce lower quality entrepreneurial activity, seemingly
   by offering viable employment for the unemployed and underemployed.
   These relationships are corroborated with a first-hand survey conducted
   with gig-economy service providers.

   compactly capture preferences of agents who value items based on the
   features they possess. Such preferences are relevant in many important
   practical settings, such as Internet advertising markets (where
   impressions have associated attributes), labor markets (where workers'
   skills/titles correspond to features), and long-term bond markets (where
   coupon payments can be associated with features). We focus on settings
   where features can be organized in a tree network, and features
   possessed by items are captured by paths on the tree. In such settings,
   under appropriate consistency conditions, we establish that Walrasian
   equilibria exist. In addition, we provide a computationally tractable

AB Firms in several industries, such as medicine, apparel, and publishing,
   must jointly determine the price and production quantity of their
   products well in advance of the selling season. Normative prescriptions
   to solve this problem have generally ignored behavioral aspects of
   decision making while behavioral research has paid limited attention to
   interdependent, multidimensional decisions. We experimentally examine
   subjects' performance when they jointly determine price and quantities.
   We find that subjects systematically deviate from the theoretically
   optimal price and quantity levels. Contrary to expectation, decomposing
   the price and quantity decisions does not improve subjects' decisions.
   In a series of follow-up experiments, we isolate the effects of (a)
   interdependence between decisions and (b) demand uncertainty. We show
   that decisions improve by making subjects more aware of interdependence
   and by reducing the uncertainty. However, reducing complexity through
   partial automation of the interdependent dimensions does not improve the
   decisions made by subjects. We also find that subjects anchor on cost
   for price decisions and on mean demand potential for quantity decisions,
   thereby explaining the consistent underpricing and overordering behavior
   across experiments.

AB This paper examines the impact of improvements in marketing skills
   relative to finance skills among small-scale entrepreneurs. It addresses
   three important questions: (1) What is the impact of marketing or
   finance skills on business profits? (2) How do improvements in marketing
   and finance skills respectively affect different business outcomes? (3)
   When are increases in marketing relative to finance skills more
   beneficial? Through a randomized control study of 852 firms in South
   Africa, the analysis finds significant improvements in profitability
   from both types of business skills training. However, the pathways to
   achieve these gains differ substantially between the two groups. The
   marketing group achieves greater profits by adopting a growth focus on
   higher sales, greater investments in stock and materials, and hiring
   more employees. The finance group achieves similar profit gains but
   through an efficiency focus on lower costs. Both groups show
   significantly higher adoption of business practices related to their
   respective training program. Consistent with a growth focus,
   marketing/sales skills are significantly more beneficial to businesses
   run by entrepreneurs with ex ante less exposure to different market
   contexts. In contrast and in line with an efficiency focus, it is the
   more established businesses that benefit significantly more from
   finance/accounting skills.

AB We study the selection and dynamics of two popular pricing
   policies-fixed price and flexible price-in competitive markets. Our
   paper extends previous work in marketing, for example, Desai and Purohit
   (2004) by focusing on decentralized markets with a dynamic and fully
   competitive framework while also considering possible noneconomic
   aspects of bargaining. We construct and analyze a competitive search
   model, which allows us to endogenize the expected demand depending on
   pricing rules and posted prices. Our analysis reveals that fixed and
   flexible pricing policies generally coexist in the same marketplace, and
   each policy comes with its own list price and customer demographics.
   More specifically, if customers dislike haggling, then fixed pricing
   emerges as the unique equilibrium, but if customers get some additional
   satisfaction from the bargaining process, then both policies are
   offered, and the unique equilibrium exhibits full segmentation: haggler
   customers avoid fixed-price firms and exclusively shop at flexible
   firms, whereas nonhaggler customers do the opposite. We also find that
   prices increase in customer satisfaction, implying that sellers take
   advantage of the positive utility enjoyed by hagglers in the form of
   higher prices. Finally, considering the presence of seasonal cycles in
   most markets, we analyze a scenario in which market demand goes through
   periodic ups and downs and find that equilibrium prices remain mostly
   stable despite significant fluctuations in demand. This finding suggests
   a plausible competition-based explanation for the stability of prices.

AB How do firms manage to collude without communicating? Why do we find
   more collusion in price competition than in quantity competition? Why is
   collusion so hard to detect? We examine strategic behavior in
   competitive interactions by developing and applying the concept of
   virtual bargaining. When decision makers virtually bargain, they
   mentally simulate, and choose among, agreements that they could reach if
   they were able to explicitly negotiate with each other. Virtual
   bargainers focus on agreements that offer some protection against the
   possibility that their counterparts may deviate and best respond to
   these agreements. We develop a formal account of virtual bargaining and
   demonstrate that it leads to collusion in Bertrand, but not in Cournot,
   competition. In this framework, collusion is a result of virtual
   bargaining as a mode of reasoning and requires neither communication nor
   dynamic considerations, such as rewards and punishments, between the
   players.

AB We partner with a major multinational telecommunications provider to
   analyze the effect of subscription video-on-demand (SVoD) services on
   digital piracy. For a period of 45 consecutive days, a group of randomly
   selected households who used BitTorrent in the past were gifted with a
   bundle of TV channels with movies and TV shows that could be streamed as
   in SVoD. We find that, on average, households that received the gift
   increased overall TV consumption by 4.6% and reduced Internet downloads
   and uploads by 4.2% and 4.5%, respectively. However, and also on
   average, treated households did not change their likelihood of using
   BitTorrent during the experiment. Our findings are heterogeneous across
   households and are mediated by the fit between the preferences of
   households in our sample for movies and the content available as part of
   the gifted channels. Households with preferences aligned with the gifted
   content reduced their probability of using BitTorrent during the
   experiment by 18% and decreased their amount of upload traffic by 45%.
   We also show using simulation that the size of the SVoD catalog and
   licensing window restrictions limit significantly the ability of content
   providers to match SVoD offerings to the preferences of BitTorrent
   users. Finally, we estimate that households in our sample are willing to
   pay at most $3.25 USD per month to access a SVoD catalog as large as
   Netflix's in the United States. Together, our results show that, as a
   stand-alone strategy, using legal SVoD to curtail piracy will require,
   at the minimum, offering content much earlier and at much lower prices
   than those currently offered in the marketplace, changes that are likely
   to reduce industry revenue and that may damage overall incentives to
   produce new content while, at the same time, curbing only a small share
   of piracy.

AB Small suppliers often face challenges to obtain financing for their
   operations. Especially in developing economies, traditional financing
   methods can be very costly or unavailable to such suppliers. To reduce
   channel costs, large buyers have recently begun implementing their own
   financing methods that intermediate between suppliers and financing
   institutions. In this paper, we analyze the role and efficiency of buyer
   intermediation in supplier financing. Building a game-theoretical model,
   we show that buyer intermediated financing can significantly improve
   channel performance, and can simultaneously benefit both supply chain
   participants. Using data from a large Chinese online retailer and
   through structural regression estimation, we demonstrate that buyer
   intermediation lowers interest rates and wholesale prices, increases
   order fill rates, and boosts supplier borrowing. Based on counterfactual
   analysis on the data, we predict that the implementation of buyer
   intermediated financing will improve channel profits by 13.05%,
   increasing supplier and retailer profits by more than 10% each, and
   yielding approximately $44 million projected savings for the retailer.

AB We know a job applicant's social category affects an employer's
   likelihood of hiring the applicant, but we do not know whether, or how,
   employers update their beliefs regarding these social categories. I
   portray hiring as a cognitive decision and examine how prior negative
   and positive hiring experiences of employees from particular countries
   affect an employer's subsequent likelihood of hiring applicants from
   those countries. I hypothesize that employer reactions will reflect loss
   aversion-that employers will react more strongly to negative hiring
   experiences than positive ones. Furthermore, I expect that the
   similarity of the prior job will moderate this effect. Analyses of 3.9
   million applications, from freelancers worldwide, for over 290,000 jobs
   on an online labor market demonstrate that employers are 15% less likely
   (versus 8% more likely) to hire freelancers from a country following a
   prior negative (versus positive) experience. Prior negative experiences
   with similar jobs (versus dissimilar jobs) lead employers to be 82% less
   likely (versus 8% less likely) to hire from that country. Conversely,
   positive experiences with similar jobs (versus dissimilar jobs) lead
   employers to be 25% more likely (versus 3% more likely) to subsequently
   hire from that country. The consequences for switching countries,
   following negative experiences, are analyzed and wage differences to
   compensate for employer reactions, are calculated. Contributions to the
   hiring discrimination, impression formation, and gig-economy literatures
   are discussed.

   the ability to offer personalized prices based on customer information
   affects prices and profit over the two periods. When product
   differentiation is exogenously fixed, asymmetric information leads to
   two asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive pricing
   to secure a larger first-period market share. When product
   differentiation is also chosen endogenously, there continue to exist two
   asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive
   positioning. The more aggressive firm, whether through pricing or
   positioning, can force the game to be played to its advantage. But both
   firms end up worse off compared to when they use simpler pricing
   strategies or commit to substantial product differentiation.

   members' respective abilities to act as network brokers. Based on the
   cofounding networks of 9,461 entrepreneurs and 2,446 large-scale
   industrial enterprises over 45 years in Russia's emerging economy
   (1869-1913), our findings show that variation among team members'
   brokering ability significantly predicts the starting capital raised by
   their firm. The effect is moderated by the team's average brokering
   potential. When both the team's average and variation in brokering
   potential is high, firms raise greater starting capital. By using
   multiple membership models, we demonstrate that greater starting capital
   is largely attributable to team factors rather than the attributes of
   the individual team members. We also take advantage of discriminatory
   laws that were passed in 1887 in an instrumental variable analysis to

AB Margin requirements for derivative contracts serve as a buffer against
   the transmission of losses through the financial system by protecting
   one party to a contract against default by the other party. However, if
   margin levels are proportional to volatility, then a spike in volatility
   leads to potentially destabilizing margin calls in times of market
   stress. Risk-sensitive margin requirements are thus procyclical in the
   sense that they amplify shocks. We use a GARCH model of volatility and a
   combination of theoretical and empirical results to analyze how much
   higher margin levels need to be to avoid procyclicality while reducing
   counterparty credit risk. Our analysis compares the tail decay of
   conditional and unconditional loss distributions with comparable stable
   and risk-sensitive margin requirements. Greater persistence and
   burstiness in volatility leads to a slower decay in the tail of the
   unconditional distribution and a higher buffer needed to avoid
   procyclicality. The tail decay drives other measures of procyclicality
   as well. Our analysis points to important features of price time series
   that should inform "antiprocyclicality" measures but are missing from
   current rules.

AB This paper investigates the joint effects of manager-shareholder agency
   conflicts and macroeconomic risk on corporate policies and firm value. I
   first derive the implications of a structural model of a firm with
   assets in place and an investment opportunity, run by a self-interested
   manager who captures part of the firm's net income as private benefits.
   The model implies that dynamic aggregate agency costs are driven by
   firms in the upper half of the distribution of private benefits.
   Managers of those firms capture 0.8% of firms' net income on average,
   thereby decreasing aggregate firm value by 1.7%. These agency costs are
   procyclical (1.9% in booms and 1.4% in recessions) because managerial
   underleverage decreases default costs particularly in recessions.
   Furthermore, the model can explain empirical regularities, including the
   joint level and cyclicality of leverage.

   investment is significantly weaker for firms that hedge their output
   price risk. Our analysis highlights that, in the presence of financial
   frictions, high price uncertainty has significant dampening effects on
   capital investment of small firms by exacerbating their financial
   constraints, and that this negative effect is amplified by firm-level
   constraints on ability to hedge risk exposures.

AB This paper presents a theory of disclosure in a market where investors
   have heterogeneous beliefs and face short-sale constraints. Assets trade
   above fundamentals reflecting the value of the option to sell to more
   optimistic investors in the future. The initial seller has an incentive
   to commit to an imprecise disclosure policy, despite the negative effect
   this has on the fundamental value of the asset, in order to increase the
   potential for disagreement and hence the magnitude of the speculative
   premium. I show that there is a strategic complementarity between
   sellers in their disclosure decisions. This explains why financial
   misreporting and episodes of speculation occur together in waves and
   demonstrates that the endogenous choice of imprecise disclosure
   amplifies the extent to which assets are overpriced.

AB We examine the role of cultural difference in the pricing of positive
   extreme returns (MAX) for 47,000 stocks from 42 countries from 1990 to
   2012. We find that investors overpay for stocks with high MAX and that
   MAX-premium, the spread from long-short strategy based on low- and
   high-MAX stocks, is both statistically and economically significant
   worldwide. The negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and
   expected returns, or idiosyncratic volatility puzzle, exists only for
   stocks with high MAX, implying that the puzzle may arise from the
   overpayment for stocks with high MAX and the subsequent return reversal.
   Consistent with the expectation that overpayment will be stronger for
   overconfident investors, the MAX-premium is larger in countries with
   high individualism index (IDV) than it is in countries with low IDV.
   Furthermore, we find the MAX-premium to be larger and the difference in
   the MAX-premium between high- and low-IDV countries to be more
   pronounced when VIX and volatility are high. Our findings suggest that
   the attention-grabbing feature of stocks with high MAX affects the
   pricing of extreme positive returns asymmetrically depending on the
   cultural differences across countries.

   LinkedIn to identify revolving rating analysts with structured finance
   rating experience, we find that the more the issuers employ such

   issuances are inflated compared with otherwise similarly rated
   securities. Additional analyses show that the impact of revolving rating
   analysts is more pronounced in complex deals and when the revolving
   analysts are more senior, indicating that rating expertise in structured

   find that at least for AAA-rated MBS and ABS, investors fail to see
   through the rating inflation associated with revolving rating analysts.

   Moreover, we find that compared to a statistical aggregation of

   at least one female group member; in contrast, group discussion actually
   harms confidence calibration for all-male groups. Overall, our findings

   negative tone leads to temporary stock mispricings. Our findings are

AB Most theories of decision making are consequentialist. They presume that
   people evaluate prospects on the basis of potential outcomes. However,
   people may often conceptualize prospects in part nonconsequentially.
   Consider someone evaluating a new, "focal" prospect given an unresolved
   "background" position to which that person is already exposed. If the
   two are positively correlated, the individual may conceptualize the
   focal prospect as a bet "with" the individual's background position; if
   they are negatively correlated, the individual may conceptualize the
   focal prospect as a bet "against" the individual's background position.
   Because people like to be consistent, this nonconsequentialist
   conceptualization may induce a taste for betting "with" the background
   position. Such bets constitute risk-seeking doubling down, not
   risk-averse hedging. Indeed, we observe that relative to corresponding
   background-less choices, participants with unresolved background
   positions are relatively risk-seeking, favoring positively rather than
   negatively correlated focal prospects. They also sometimes show a
   simultaneous taste for both doubling down and hedging.

AB I exploit exogenous changes in local credit supply from shale

   Changes in local credit supply have significant real effects in lending
   markets dominated by small banks, while there is no effect in other
   markets. These results suggest that small banks, which do not benefit
   from deep internal capital markets, face economically meaningful
   frictions in accessing external interbank markets to fund loans. The
   effect in other markets, which have large multimarket banks, indicates
   that these markets are not as dependent on local funding sources for

   that delaying e-book availability results in a 43.8% decrease in e-book
   sales but no increase in print book sales on Amazon.com or among other
   online or offline retailers. We also find that the decrease in e-book
   sales is greater for books with less prerelease buzz. Together, we find
   no evidence of strong cannibalization between print books and e-books in
   the short term and no support for the sequential distribution of books

AB The agriculture industry plays a critical role in the U.S. economy, and
   various industry sectors depend on the output of farms. To protect and
   raise farmers' income, the U.S. government offers two subsidy programs
   to farmers: the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program, which pays farmers a
   subsidy when the market price falls below a reference price, and the
   Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) program, which is triggered when
   farmers' revenue is below a threshold. Given the unique features of PLC
   and ARC, we develop models to analyze their impacts on consumers,
   farmers, and the government. Our analysis generates several insights.
   First, while PLC always motivates farmers to plant more acres compared
   to the no-subsidy case, farmers may plant fewer acres under ARC, leading
   to a lower crop supply. Second, despite the prevailing intuition that
   ARC generally dominates PLC, we show that both farmers and consumers may
   be better off under PLC for a large range of parameter values, even when
   the reference price represents the historical average market price.
   Third, the subsidy that increases consumer surplus results in higher
   government expenditure. Finally, we calibrate our model with U.S.
   Department of Agriculture (USDA) data and provide insights about the
   effects of crop and market characteristics on the relative performance
   of PLC and ARC. We provide guidelines to farmers for enrolling crops in
   the subsidy programs, and show that our guidelines are supported by
   farmers' enrollment statistics. We also show that if the economic and
   political frictions caused by running the subsidy programs is
   significant, the subsidy that benefits both consumers and farmers may
   actually result in lower social welfare.

AB In addition to setting price discounts, retailers need to decide how to
   schedule promotion vehicles, such as flyers and TV commercials. Unlike
   the promotion pricing problem that received great attention from both
   academics and practitioners, the promotion vehicle scheduling problem
   was largely overlooked, and our goal is to study this problem both
   theoretically and in practice. We model the problem of scheduling
   promotion vehicles to maximize profits as a nonlinear bipartite
   matching-type problem, where promotion vehicles should be assigned to
   time periods, subject to capacity constraints. Our modeling approach is
   motivated and calibrated using actual data in collaboration with Oracle
   Retail, leading us to introduce and study a class of models for which
   the boost effects of promotion vehicles on demand are multiplicative.
   From a technical perspective, we prove that the general setting
   considered is computationally intractable. Nevertheless, we develop
   approximation algorithms and propose a compact integer programming
   formulation. In particular, we show how to obtain a (1 -
   epsilon)-approximation using an integer program of polynomial size, and
   investigate the performance of a greedy procedure, both analytically and
   computationally. We also discuss an extension that includes cross-term
   effects to capture the cannibalization aspect of using several vehicles
   simultaneously. From a practical perspective, we test our methods on
   actual data through a case study, and quantify the impact of our models.
   Under our model assumptions and for a particular item considered in our
   case study, we show that a rigorous optimization approach to the
   promotion vehicle scheduling problem allows the retailer to increase its
   profit by 2% to 9%.

AB We investigate procurement in a setting in which the buyer is bound by
   sourcing rules. Sourcing rules may limit the minimum and maximum amounts
   of business that can be awarded to a single supplier or dictate the
   minimum number of suppliers who are awarded business, thus necessitating
   split awards. The buyer announces the splits before the auction, and
   suppliers bid accordingly. We consider two auction formats: the
   sealed-bid first-price auction, and a version of the open-bid
   descending-price auction. We characterize the suppliers' symmetric
   equilibrium bidding strategy for both formats and find that the two
   formats yield the same expected buyer's cost. We characterize the cost
   of multisourcing, showing among other things that it is always costly
   for the buyer to split its award among more suppliers if the suppliers'
   costs are regularly distributed, but that doing so can actually reduce
   the buyer's expected auction payment if the suppliers' costs are not
   regularly distributed. The results from controlled laboratory
   experiments, involving human subjects, indicate that expected cost
   equivalence fails when costs are regularly distributed because suppliers
   bid more aggressively in the sealed-bid auction. However, for
   split-award auctions with nonregularly distributed costs, the sealed-bid
   prices are actually higher than predicted by theory. We explain these
   mismatches between observations and theory through a behavioral model
   based on bidders' aversion to anticipated regret. The experimental
   results indicate that the theory does a good job of predicting the
   relationship between the buyer's average cost and the award splits, as
   well as the cost of multisourcing. Importantly, the experiments confirm
   that when suppliers' costs come from a nonregular distribution, it may
   be to the buyer's advantage to diversify the supply base more than is
   strictly necessitated by sourcing rules.

   distribution, which depends on the correlation between the point
   forecasts and on the number of forecasts. We show that ignoring

   unrealistically narrow predictive distribution. We further illustrate
   the implications in a newsvendor context, where our model leads to an

AB Financial institutions, government-sponsored enterprises, and
   asset-backed security investors are often exposed to delinquency and
   prepayment risk from large numbers of loans. Examples include mortgages,
   credit cards, and auto, student, and business loans. Because of the size
   of the pools, the measurement of these exposures is computationally
   expensive. This paper develops and tests efficient numerical methods for
   the analysis of large pools of loans as well as asset-backed securities
   backed by such pools. For a broad class of statistical and machine
   learning models of loan-level risk in discrete time, we prove a law of
   large numbers and a central limit theorem for the pool-level risk. The
   asymptotics are then used to construct computationally efficient
   approximations for a large pool. The approximations aggregate the full
   loan-level dynamics, making it possible to take advantage of the
   detailed loan-level data often available in practice. We furthermore
   prove a convergence rate for the approximation and a uniform
   integrability result. The latter allows the approximation to be applied
   to a wide class of pool-level risk statistics. To demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our approach, we implement it on a data set of over 25
   million mortgages. The results show the accuracy and speed of the
   approximation in comparison to brute-force simulation of a pool, for a
   variety of pools with different risk profiles.

   capital-constrained manufacturer that competes with an alternative
   supplier for the business of a large industrial buyer. Through a series
   of game-theoretic models, we characterize when it is beneficial for the
   buyer to offer EE instruments, including assessment assistance and
   procurement commitment, and how these instruments interact with
   third-party assessment assistance to affect the supplier's EE investment
   level. We find that assessment assistance helps reduce the EE gap but
   procurement commitment is required to eliminate it. We also find that
   the availability of third-party assessment assistance reduces the
   buyer's incentive to offer both of its instruments, a scenario that
   potentially lowers the supplier's EE investment level. Our findings
   provide insights for buyers and policy makers interested in improving
   supply-chain EE.

AB Dynamic pricing is designed to increase the revenues or profits of firms
   by adjusting prices in response to changes in the marginal value of
   capacity. We examine the impact of dynamic pricing on social welfare and
   consumers' surplus. We present a dynamic pricing formulation designed to
   maximize welfare and show that the welfare-maximizing dynamic pricing
   policy has the same structural properties as the revenue-maximizing
   policy. For systems with scarce capacity, we show that the
   revenue-maximizing dynamic pricing policy and the market-clearing price
   are both asymptotically optimal for welfare. We also find in most cases
   that revenue-maximizing dynamic pricing improves consumers' surplus
   compared to the revenue-maximizing static price. Our findings can
   potentially transform the public image of dynamic pricing and provide
   new managerial insights as well as policy implications: (1) in
   large-scale systems with scarce capacity, a central planner would
   essentially implement the same pricing policy as a firm with monopoly
   power; (2) the revenue-maximizing dynamic pricing policy can benefit
   customers when the demand elasticity is in a small bounded interval as
   is the case for several important demand functions.

AB In this paper, we study systems that allocate different types of scarce
   resources to heterogeneous allocatees based on predetermined priority
   rules-the U.S. deceased-donor kidney allocation system or the public
   housing program. We tackle the problem of estimating the wait time of an
   allocatee who possesses incomplete system information with regard, for
   example, to his relative priority, other allocatees' preferences, and
   resource availability. We model such systems as multiclass, multiserver
   queuing systems that are potentially unstable or in transient regime. We
   propose a novel robust optimization solution methodology that builds on
   the assignment problem. For first-come, first-served systems, our
   approach yields a mixed-integer programming formulation. For the
   important case where there is a hierarchy in the resource types, we
   strengthen our formulation through a drastic variable reduction and also
   propose a highly scalable heuristic, involving only the solution of a
   convex optimization problem (usually a second-order cone problem). We
   back the heuristic with an approximation guarantee that becomes tighter
   for larger problem sizes. We illustrate the generalizability of our
   approach by studying systems that operate under different priority
   rules, such as class priority. Numerical studies demonstrate that our
   approach outperforms simulation. We showcase how our methodology can be
   applied to assist patients in the U.S. deceased-donor kidney waitlist.
   We calibrate our model using historical data to estimate patients' wait
   times based on their kidney quality preferences, blood type, location,
   and rank in the waitlist.

AB This paper studies the strategies employed by Catholic and Protestant
   nonprofit hospitals in Germany and traces them back to the theological
   foundations of those religions. Using a unique data set, we find that
   Catholic nonprofit hospitals follow a strategy of horizontal
   diversification and maximization of the number of patients treated. By
   contrast, Protestant hospitals pursue a strategy of horizontal
   specialization and focus on vertical differentiation, putting in more
   sophisticated inputs and producing more complex services. These effects
   increase if the environment of a hospital gets more competitive. We
   present a model that rationalizes the strategic differences as a result
   of the difference between Catholic and Protestant values identified in
   the literature. We then test alternative explanations to the observed
   empirical differences and show that none of them is supported by the
   data.

AB This paper analyzes a setting in which a manufacturer (he) and a
   retailer (she) face uncertain demand, but the retailer has an
   information advantage in the form of a private demand forecast. Such
   information asymmetry causes the manufacturer to incur a hidden
   information cost. The results show that a manufacturer can leverage his
   timing advantage to strategically implement a temporary contract
   adjustment (TCA) mechanism, which allows him to counter his
   informational disadvantage and either eliminate or reduce the hidden
   information cost. The manufacturer implements the TCA mechanism by
   designing the supply contract with two sets of terms: presignal and
   postsignal. Presignal terms engage the retailer before observing the
   forecast signal and induce her to decide under high uncertainty. As a
   result, she overinvests when the forecast signal is low. Postsignal
   terms engage her after the signal, allowing her to make use of the
   information and purchase additional stock efficiently based on the
   forecast signal. This ability to utilize the forecast information allows
   the manufacturer to set more efficient contract terms. By applying the
   TCA mechanism to a simple wholesale price contract, the manufacturer can
   achieve the effect of free, partial information revelation as if he
   observes a coarse version of the retailer's private forecast. By
   applying the TCA mechanism to a (stronger) quantity-transfer menu, the
   manufacturer can achieve the effect of free, full information revelation
   (i.e., full information profits) as if he fully observes the same
   version of the forecast, without the retailer directly sharing her
   private information.

AB The standard framework for modeling stochastic choice, the random
   utility model, is agnostic about the temporal dynamics of the decision
   process. In contrast, a general class of bounded accumulation models
   from psychology and neuroscience explicitly relate decision times to
   stochastic choice behavior. This article demonstrates that a random
   utility model can be derived from the general class of bounded
   accumulation models, and characterizes how the resulting distribution of
   random utility depends on response time. This relationship can bias the
   estimation of structural preference parameters. The bias can be
   alleviated via the inclusion of standard observables directly in the
   econometric specification, or through incorporating novel observables
   such as response time or neurobiological data. Examples of estimating
   risk and brand preferences are pursued.

   from machine learning, for the estimation of aggregate discrete-choice
   models with high-dimensional choice sets. Initially, high-dimensional
   data are projected into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space using random
   projections. Subsequently, estimation proceeds using cyclical
   monotonicity moment inequalities implied by the multinomial choice
   model; the estimation procedure is semiparametric and does not require
   explicit distributional assumptions to be made regarding the random
   utility errors. Our procedure is justified via the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
   lemma-the pairwise distances between data points are preserved through
   random projections. The estimator works well in simulations and in an
   application to a supermarket scanner data set.

AB We provide a dynamic, game-theoretic model to examine a firm's quality
   and pricing decisions for its new experience goods. Early consumers do
   not observe product quality prior to purchase but can learn it after
   purchase and share that product-quality information with later
   consumers-for example, through online reviews. Both the firm's quality
   decision and its cost efficiency are the firm's private information and
   not directly observed by the consumer. The early consumers can make a
   rational inference from the firm's price about its cost and quality
   taking into account the firm's profit incentive from the later informed
   consumers. We find that in equilibrium a more cost-efficient firm
   chooses higher quality than does an inefficient firm. One might intuit
   that a firm will offer higher quality if its high efficiency is known to
   consumers than if its efficiency is not known, because it will no longer
   need to convince consumers that it is not the inefficient firm. Our
   analysis shows that, surprisingly, the opposite may be true-when a
   firm's high efficiency is publicly known, the firm may reduce its
   product quality rather than increase it. Furthermore, consumers'
   knowledge about the firm's cost efficiency can reduce the consumer
   surplus. We also show that an improvement in the average cost efficiency
   in the market can lower the consumer surplus.

AB Coupons have been a mainstay of marketing for decades all over the
   world, but their short- and long-run effects on sales are still not
   understood fully. We develop a model of consumer demand to empirically
   study whether firms can indeed use coupons as a means to price
   discriminate by attracting new consumers without losing (cannibalizing)
   revenue from existing ones, and whether these new consumers return to
   the firm after the price promotion. In addition, we ask what types of
   businesses are most likely to benefit from such promotions. Following
   alcohol revenue for restaurants using e-coupons, we find that offering a
   coupon increases demand during the promotion, and to a lesser degree
   after the promotion, suggesting that coupons can be used to price
   discriminate, while an advertising effect is less obvious. While coupons
   increase profits on average, the effect on each firm's profits depends
   on the firm's characteristics.

AB A number of studies have examined the effect of public and private
   ownership on the cost of debt and concluded that the cost of debt of
   privately owned firms is higher, driven mainly by the poorer information
   environment in which these firms operate. We extend this strand of
   research in two ways. First, we identify and empirically establish the
   mechanisms that bring about a higher cost of debt to privately owned
   firms-namely, the limited access that these firms have to the equity
   capital market, their high rate of management and private-equity
   ownership, and their less conservative reporting. Second, we improve the
   reliability of the estimates of the effect of ownership type on the cost
   of debt by controlling for the different information environments in
   which privately and publicly owned firms operate. This is accomplished
   through the use of a sample consisting of publicly owned and privately
   owned firms that have public debt and are therefore subject to identical
   reporting and disclosure requirements. Certain data and design features
   allow us to better control for other factors that might lead to the
   observed difference in the cost of debt between the two groups of firms.
   The results contribute to our understanding of the role of ownership
   type on the cost of capital.

   your content benefited others), individualism (e.g., your content was of
   high quality), and competition (e.g., your content was better than
   others). We hypothesize how gender (a proxy for SVO) moderates response
   to each framing, and we report on two randomized experiments, one in
   partnership with a mobile-app-based recipe crowdsourcing platform, and a
   follow-up experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk involving an ideation

   effective for motivating female subjects, whereas competitively framed
   feedback is most effective at motivating male subjects. Our work
   contributes to the literatures on performance feedback and UGC
   production by introducing cooperative performance feedback as a

   As a result, regulated entities facing capital constraints had an

   money for themselves, higher wages lead to higher effort with relatively
   muted targeting behavior. When individuals earn money for a charity,
   higher wages instead lead to lower effort with substantial targeting
   behavior. A reference-dependent theoretical framework suggests an
   explanation for this differential impact: when individuals place less
   value on earnings, such as when accruing earnings for a charity instead
   of themselves, more targeting behavior and a more sluggish response to
   incentives should result. Results from an additional experiment add
   support to this explanation. When individuals select into earning money
   for a charity and thus likely place a higher value on those earnings,
   targeting behavior is muted and no longer generates a negative effort
   response to higher wages.

   an experiment to test how the oath affects truth telling in two
   contexts: a neutral context replicating the typical experiment in the

   lie is a lie." We consider four payoff configurations, with differential
   monetary incentives to lie, implemented as within-subjects treatment
   variables. The results are reinforced by robustness investigations in
   which each subject made only one lying decision. Our results show that
   the oath reduces lying, especially in the loaded environment-falsehoods
   are reduced by 50%. The oath, however, has a weaker effect on lying in
   the neutral environment. The oath did affect decision times in all
   instances: the average person takes significantly more time deciding
   whether to lie under oath.

   connections and forecast accuracy is stronger when the teams are just

AB We show that firms with chief executive officers (CEOs) who gain general
   managerial skills over their lifetime of work experience produce more
   patents. We address the potential endogenous CEO-firm matching bias
   using firm-CEO fixed effects and variation in the enforceability of
   noncompete agreements across states and over time during the CEO's
   career. Our findings suggest that generalist CEOs spur innovation
   because they acquire knowledge beyond the firm's current technological
   domain, and they have skills that can be applied elsewhere should
   innovation projects fail. We conclude that an efficient labor market for
   executives can promote innovation by providing a mechanism of tolerance
   for failure.

AB We describe an equilibrium model of peer-to-peer product sharing, or
   collaborative consumption, where individuals with varying usage levels
   make decisions about whether or not to own a homogeneous product. Owners
   are able to generate income from renting their products to nonowners
   while nonowners are able to access these products through renting on an
   as-needed basis. We characterize equilibrium outcomes, including
   ownership and usage levels, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We
   compare each outcome in systems with and without collaborative
   consumption and examine the impact of various problem parameters. Our
   findings indicate that collaborative consumption can result in either
   lower or higher ownership and usage levels, with higher ownership and
   usage levels more likely when the cost of ownership is high. Our
   findings also indicate that consumers always benefit from collaborative
   consumption, with individuals who, in the absence of collaborative
   consumption, are indifferent between owning and not owning benefitting
   the most. We study both profit-maximizing and social-welfare- maximizing
   platforms and compare equilibrium outcomes under both in terms of
   ownership, usage, and social welfare. We find that the difference in
   social welfare between the profit-maximizing and
   social-welfare-maximizing platforms is relatively modest.

AB Rank-order relative-performance evaluation, in which pay, promotion,
   symbolic awards, and educational achievement depend on the rank of
   individuals in the distribution of performance, is ubiquitous. Whenever
   organizations use rank-order relative-performance evaluation, people
   receive feedback about their rank. Using a real-effort experiment, we
   aim to discover whether people respond to the specific rank that they
   achieve. In particular, we leverage random variation in the allocation
   of rank among subjects who exerted the same effort to obtain a causal
   estimate of the rank response function that describes how effort
   provision responds to the content of rank-order feedback. We find that
   the rank response function is U-shaped. Subjects exhibit "first-place
   loving" and "last-place loathing": that is, subjects work hardest after
   being ranked first or last. We discuss implications of our findings for
   the optimal design of performance feedback policies, workplace
   organizational structures, and incentives schemes.

AB Studies of bond return predictability find a puzzling disparity between
   strong statistical evidence of return predictability and the failure to
   convert return forecasts into economic gains. We show that resolving
   this puzzle requires accounting for important features of bond return
   models such as volatility dynamics and unspanned macro factors. A
   three-factor model comprising a forward spread, a weighted combination
   of forward rates, and a macro factor generates notable gains in
   out-of-sample forecast accuracy compared with a model based on the
   expectations hypothesis. Such gains in predictive accuracy translate
   into higher risk-adjusted portfolio returns after accounting for
   estimation error and model uncertainty. Consistent with models featuring
   unspanned macro factors, our forecasts of future bond excess returns are
   strongly negatively correlated with survey forecasts of short rates.

AB It is notoriously difficult to provide outside parties with adequate
   incentives for innovation. Contests-in which solvers compete for a prize
   offered by the contest holder-have been shown to be an effective
   incentive mechanism. Despite considerable interest in this concept, we
   lack a thorough understanding of important aspects of contests; in
   particular, feedback from the contest holder to the solvers has received
   only limited attention. This paper discusses how contest holders can
   improve contest outcomes by devising an optimal information structure
   for their feedback policies. We first identify when, and when not, to
   give feedback as well as which type of feedback to give: public (which
   all solvers can observe) or private (which only the focal solver can
   observe). We uncover a nontrivial relationship between contest
   characteristics and optimal feedback choices. Second, we examine whether
   the contest holder should mandate interim feedback or instead allow
   solvers to seek feedback at their own discretion. Third, we discuss how
   changing the granularity of feedback information affects its value to
   solvers.

AB How does a firm decide whether to employ professionals and control how
   they deliver services to clients, or to operate as a platform enabling
   independent professionals to provide services directly to clients?
   Similarly, how does a manufacturer decide whether to allow sales agents
   to choose certain costly actions (e.g., kickbacks to clients) or to take
   control of these actions itself? We answer this question using a
   principal-agent framework in which both the principal and the agent must
   be incentivized to carry out investments (or effort) that increase the
   revenue they jointly create. Our theory explains when the principal
   should take control over a particular decision ("control") or should
   instead allow the agent to make the decision ("enable"). It does so both
   for the case when there are multiple such transferable decisions for a
   single agent, and for the case when there are many agents and one
   transferable decision for each. We also consider the possibility of cost
   asymmetries between the principal and the agent, spillovers across
   agents, and the misclassification of the principal as an employer even
   though agents are allocated the relevant control rights. Finally, we
   explain how the "control versus enable" choice and its associated
   trade-offs differ from the classic "make versus buy" choice.

AB Dominant platform businesses often develop products in adjacent markets
   to complement their core business. One common approach used to gain
   traction in these adjacent markets has been to pursue a tying strategy.
   For example, Microsoft preinstalled Internet Explorer into Windows, and
   Apple set Apple Maps as the iOS default. Policy-makers have raised
   concerns that dominant platforms may be leveraging their market power to
   gain traction for lower quality products when they use a tying strategy.
   In this paper, we empirically explore this question by examining
   Google's decision to tie its new reviews product to its search engine.
   We experimentally vary the reviews displayed above Google's organic
   search results to show either exclusively Google reviews (Google's
   current tying strategy) or reviews from multiple platforms determined to
   be the best-performing by Google's own organic search algorithm. We find
   that users prefer the version that does not exclude competitor reviews.
   Furthermore, looking at observational data on user traffic to Yelp from
   search engines, we find that Google's exclusion of downstream
   competitors may have been effective. The share of Yelp's traffic coming
   from Google has declined over this period, relative to traffic from Bing
   and Yahoo (which do not exclude other companies' reviews), and Google
   reviews has grown more quickly than Yelp and TripAdvisor during the
   period in which they excluded these (and other) reviews providers.
   Overall, these results suggest that tying has the potential to
   facilitate entry in complementary markets even when the tied product is
   of worse quality than competitors.

AB We develop a modular and tractable framework for solving an adaptive
   distributionally robust linear optimization problem, where we minimize
   the worst-case expected cost over an ambiguity set of probability
   distributions. The adaptive distributionally robust optimization
   framework caters for dynamic decision making, where decisions adapt to
   the uncertain outcomes as they unfold in stages. For tractability
   considerations, we focus on a class of second-order conic (SOC)
   representable ambiguity set, though our results can easily be extended
   to more general conic representations. We show that the adaptive
   distributionally robust linear optimization problem can be formulated as
   a classical robust optimization problem. To obtain a tractable
   formulation, we approximate the adaptive distributionally robust
   optimization problem using linear decision rule (LDR) techniques. More
   interestingly, by incorporating the primary and auxiliary random
   variables of the lifted ambiguity set in the LDR approximation, we can
   significantly improve the solutions, and for a class of adaptive
   distributionally robust optimization problems, exact solutions can also
   be obtained. Using the new LDR approximation, we can transform the
   distributionally adaptive robust optimization problem to a classical
   robust optimization problem with an SOC representable uncertainty set.
   Finally, to demonstrate the potential for solving management decision
   problems, we develop an algebraic modeling package and illustrate how it
   can be used to facilitate modeling and obtain high-quality solutions for
   medical appointment scheduling and inventory management problems.

   upstream firms should optimally treat downstream firms who may have
   different marginal costs of distribution. Our analysis also explains why

AB Recently, online matching platforms (e.g., Craigslist, FreeCycle,
   Gumtree) have enabled consumers to directly connect with each other to
   buy/sell used consumer goods (electronics, furniture, packaging, etc.)
   that would have otherwise ended up in the waste stream. Such matching
   platforms can facilitate the creation of consumer-to-consumer (C2C)
   closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) for used goods, which can enhance
   product reuse and limit reliance on recycling and disposal alternatives.
   Yet, the true environmental benefits of these internet-enabled C2C CLSCs
   remain to be ascertained. In this study, I use a quasi-experimental
   setup to examine how Craigslist's entry into various U.S. geographic
   markets impacts a key environmental outcome: municipal solid waste
   (MSW). I assemble a data set from various disparate sources to test my
   hypothesis. I find that, on average, Craigslist's entry into a
   geographic market results in a 2%-6% annual reduction in MSW per capita
   generated. I conduct a variety of robustness checks, falsification
   tests, and validation checks to provide support to my findings. Overall,
   this study provides deeper insights into the potential of online reuse
   platforms for the creation and coordination of C2C CLSCs. To my
   knowledge, this is the first study of closed-loop supply chains in a C2C

AB Governments use consumer incentives to promote green technologies (e.g.,
   solar panels and electric vehicles). Our goal in this paper is to study
   how policy adjustments over time will interact with production decisions
   from the industry. We model the interaction between a government and an
   industry player in a two-period game setting under uncertain demand. We
   show how the timing of decisions affects the risk sharing between the
   government and the supplier, ultimately affecting the cost of the
   subsidy program. In particular, we show that when the government commits
   to a fixed policy, it encourages the supplier to produce more at the
   beginning of the horizon. Consequently, a flexible subsidy policy is on
   average more expensive, unless there is a significant negative demand
   correlation across time periods. However, we show that the variance of
   the total sales is lower in the flexible setting, implying that the
   government's additional spending reduces the adoption level uncertainty.
   In addition, we show that for flexible policies, the supplier is better
   off in terms of expected profits, whereas the consumers can either
   benefit or not depending on the price elasticity of demand. Finally, we
   test our insights with a numerical example calibrated on data from a
   solar subsidy program.

AB We consider a day-ahead electricity market that consists of multiple
   competing renewable firms (e.g., wind generators) and conventional firms
   (e.g., coal-fired power plants) in a discrete-time setting. The market
   is run in every period, and all firms submit their price-contingent
   production schedules in every day-ahead market. Following the clearance
   of a day-ahead market, in the next period, each (renewable) firm chooses
   its production quantity (after observing its available supply). If a
   firm produces less than its cleared day-ahead commitment, the firm pays
   an undersupply penalty in proportion to its underproduction. We
   explicitly characterize firms' equilibrium strategies by introducing and
   analyzing a supply function competition model. The purpose of an
   undersupply penalty is to improve reliability by motivating each firm to
   commit to quantities it can produce in the following day. We prove that
   in equilibrium, imposing or increasing a market-based undersupply
   penalty rate in a period can result in a strictly larger renewable
   energy commitment at all prices in the associated day-ahead market, and
   can lead to lower equilibrium reliability in all periods with
   probability 1. We also show in an extension that firms with diversified
   technologies result in lower equilibrium reliability than
   single-technology firms in all periods with probability 1.

   is free to choose the sequence of stations that she visits, with the
   objective of minimizing her expected total system time. We propose a
   two-station game with all customers present at the start of service and
   deterministic service times, and we find that strategic customers
   "herd," that is, in equilibrium all customers choose the same route. For
   unobservable systems, we prove that the game is supermodular, and we
   then identify a broad class of learning rules-which includes both
   fictitious play and Cournot best response-that converges to herding in
   finite time. By combining different theoretical and numerical analyses,
   we find that the herding behavior is prevalent in many other congested
   open-routing service networks, including those with arrivals over time,
   those with stochastic service times, and those with more than two
   stations. We also find that the system under herding performs very close

AB Many service systems have servers with different capabilities and
   customers with varying needs. One common way this occurs is when servers
   are hierarchical in their skills or in the level of service they can
   provide. Much of the literature studying such systems relies on an
   understanding of the relative costs and benefits associated with serving
   different customer types by the different levels of service. In this
   work, we focus on estimating these costs and benefits in a complex
   healthcare setting where the major differentiation among server types is
   the intensity of service provided. Step-down units (SDUs) were initially
   introduced in hospitals to provide an intermediate level of care for
   semicritically ill patients who are not sick enough to require intensive
   care but not stable enough to be treated in the general medical/surgical
   ward. One complicating factor is that the needs of customers is
   sometimes uncertain-specifically, it is difficult to know a priori which
   level of care a particular patient needs. Using data from 10 hospitals
   from a single hospital network, we take a data-driven approach to
   classify patients based on severity and empirically estimate the
   clinical and operational outcomes associated with routing these patients
   to the SDU. Our findings suggest that an SDU may be a cost-effective way

   admitted from the emergency department and may result in increased
   mortality risk and hospital length of stay for patients who should be
   treated in the ICU. Our results imply that more study is needed when
   using SDU care this way.

AB We study a new class of scheduling problems that capture common settings
   in service environments, in which one has to serve a collection of jobs
   that have a priori uncertain attributes (e.g., processing times and
   priorities) and the service provider has to decide how to dynamically
   allocate resources (e.g., people, equipment, and time) between testing
   (diagnosing) jobs to learn more about their respective uncertain
   attributes and processing jobs. The former could inform future
   decisions, but could delay the service time for other jobs, while the
   latter directly advances the processing of the jobs but requires making
   decisions under uncertainty. Through novel analysis we obtain surprising
   structural results of optimal policies that provide operational
   managerial insights, efficient optimal and near-optimal algorithms, and
   quantification of the value of testing. We believe that our approach
   will lead to further research to explore this important practical
   trade-off.

AB We consider a one-warehouse, N-retailer, multiperiod, stock allocation
   problem in which holding costs are identical at each location and no
   stock is received from outside suppliers for the duration of the
   planning horizon. No shipments are allowed between retailers. The only
   motive for holding inventory at the central warehouse for allocation in
   future periods is the so-called risk pooling motive. We apply robust
   optimization to this problem extending the inventory policy to allow for
   an adaptive, nonanticipatory shipment policy. We consider two
   alternatives for the uncertainty set, one in which risk pooling is
   implicit and another for which risk pooling is explicit. The explicit
   risk pooling uncertainty set grows by no more than the square of the
   number of retailers. The general problem can be solved using Benders'
   decomposition. A special case gives rise to closed-form solutions for
   both uncertainty set alternatives. The explicit risk pooling uncertainty
   set leads to a square root law in which the optimal stock to reserve at
   the central warehouse grows with the square root of the number of
   retailers. The experimental results confirm the value of the robust
   optimization approach and provide managerial insights into the operation
   of such systems.

AB This paper considers a monopolist's product-launch strategy in the
   presence of network effects, focusing on how to exploit these effects to
   the maximum possible extent. In our formal framework, the firm sets a
   price for its product and chooses a sales scheme, which effectively
   determines how consumers can learn from each other about the product's
   popularity. Our results on the profitability of different schemes
   provide insights on a variety of managerial issues that are of practical
   relevance for product launch. Specifically, to best exploit network
   effects, our results suggest releasing preorder and sales information to
   consumers. They also suggest taking a sequential approach to multimarket
   product launch, launching first in smaller markets before larger ones.
   Moreover, they identify possible benefits of promoting prerelease
   consumer communication, and they support the idea of targeting
   independent-minded consumers, so they can serve as opinion leaders for
   those who follow.

   contracts approach to show that the anticipation and observability of
   such behavior are typically not enough to prevent it when parties can
   renegotiate contractual outcomes. This is because contractually
   specified incentives inevitably have conflicting effects: they
   simultaneously increase the likelihood of welfare-improving investments
   and welfare-reducing opportunistic behavior. The possibility of such
   opportunism thus limits the effectiveness of contractual incentives. We
   also discuss how our results relate to contracting practices observed in

AB This study focuses on the market identities of firms and suggests that
   identity ambiguity is caused not only by bridging horizontal product
   categories but also by status inconsistency stemming from bridging
   vertical status categories. Focusing specifically on how firms reduce
   status inconsistency by restructuring their business portfolios, we
   argue that status inconsistency motivates firms to divest business units
   to present a more coherent vertical market identity. Emphasizing the
   interplay between horizontal and vertical identity ambiguity, we argue
   furthermore that status-inconsistent units that are related to the core
   business units within a firm are more likely to be divested. Using a
   comprehensive sample of publicly traded U.S. firms from 1998 to 2014, we
   report that status inconsistency increases the likelihood of divestiture
   that decreases status inconsistency, particularly for high-status firms.
   Moreover, although status-inconsistent units are generally more likely
   to be divested, this effect is stronger for core business units.

   is perfect and managers optimize, firm alliances disproportionately
   increase the value of high-resource-level firms, resulting in higher
   variance and higher skewness of the distribution of firm value;
   moreover, higher-value alliances are subject to regression to the mean
   at a faster rate. These effects are magnified if the degree of
   complementarities is endogenously determined by each firm's investment.
   We also consider alliances where matching and/or information about firm
   resources are imperfect, and show that complementarities are a necessary
   but not sufficient condition for alliances to cause an increase in firm
   value; and that complementarities are neither a necessary nor a

AB Many jobs are connected to a prosocial mission-namely, to a social
   purpose beyond profit maximization. I use three laboratory experiments
   to investigate if employers can use the mission to economize on monetary
   incentives. In my first experiment, I exogenously vary whether the
   agents' effort generates a donation to a charity of their choice
   (matched mission), generates a donation to a charity chosen by another
   subject (random mission), or generates no donation (no mission). I find
   that the mission, whether matched or random, increases effort compared
   to the no-mission condition. Consistent with the theory, nonmotivated
   principals exploit the agents' motivation by offering lower piece rates,
   whereas very motivated principals pay higher piece rates to boost the
   donation. I find no difference in the effort and piece rate between the
   matched- and random-mission conditions. In my second experiment, I use a
   selected pool of motivated subjects but still observe no difference
   between these two treatments. In my third experiment, I explore whether
   the effect of mission-matching may arise through gift exchange:
   principals decide between choosing the mission or delegating the choice
   to the agent. I do not find evidence that agents who are delegated the
   mission choice reciprocate with higher effort. These findings suggest
   that while a prosocial mission allows for economizing on monetary
   incentives, there are no further gains from increasing the quality of
   the mission-matching.

AB Firms commonly undertake philanthropic campaigns as a means of
   attracting and retaining customers. Such campaigns often take the form
   of charity-linked promotions, whereby a firm donates a specific amount
   to a charitable cause when a customer takes up the promotion through a
   related purchase. We carried out three field experiments to study such
   promotions in the context of an online taxi-booking platform. Customers
   were randomly assigned to different treatment groups, which received
   either a charity linked or a discount-based promotion from a range of
   monetary amounts. Take-up rates for charity-linked promotions were not
   only much smaller than for discount-based promotions but also less
   sensitive to the exact amount involved, consistent with a view that the
   decision to take up a charity-linked promotion was driven in part by a
   "warm glow" from mere association with giving. We also find a selection
   effect in promotion take-up: charity-linked promotions were
   disproportionately taken up by people who had already been more active
   customers. Although a promotion take-up does seem to represent new
   demand rather than mere substitution of a booking that would have
   occurred anyway, longitudinal data analysis reveals little evidence of a
   lasting treatment effect on long-term demand beyond the promotion period
   for either kind of promotion. Given the high cost relative to benefit
   for the promotional bookings themselves, this finding raises concerns
   regarding the prevalent practice of firms devoting significant funds for
   short-term promotions without rigorously examining their exact impact.

AB This study employs a randomized field experiment to causally identify
   what type of signal is likely to complement another signal in the
   context of financing technology ventures. The study examines the effect
   of product certification by expert intermediaries, prominent customers,
   and social proof (that is, others' interest in investing in a venture)
   on interest in investing. These three signals are primarily signals of a
   venture's product, market, and investment characteristics, respectively.
   The study finds that signals of product certification and prominent
   customers, and product certification and social proof are complements.
   In particular, investors who were able to view the combined product
   certification and prominent customer signals have a 72% higher
   likelihood of indicating an interest in making an equity investment than
   those who did not receive any of the three signals. Similarly, investors
   who were able to view the combined product certification and social
   proof signals have a 65% higher likelihood of indicating an interest in
   investing. These results suggest that in the context of technology
   ventures, a signal about product characteristics is the key to unlocking
   the value of signals of market or investment characteristics.

AB Medical specialists treating chronic conditions typically face a
   heterogeneous set of patients. Such heterogeneity arises because of
   differences in medical conditions as well as the travel burden each
   patient faces to visit the clinic periodically. Given this
   heterogeneity, we compare the strategic behavior of revenue-maximizing
   and welfare-maximizing specialists and prove that the former will serve
   a smaller patient population, spend more time with the patients, and
   have shorter waiting times. We also analyze the impact of telemedicine
   technology on patient utility and the specialists' operating decisions.
   We consider both the case when specialists can freely set their own fee
   for service and the case when fees are set exogenously by a third-party
   payer. We prove that with the introduction of telemedicine, the
   specialists become more productive and the overall social welfare
   increases, although some patients, unexpectedly, will be worse off. Our
   analytical results lead to some important policy implications for
   facilitating the further deployment of telemedicine in the care of
   chronically ill patients.

AB This paper analyzes the effects of financial integration on the
   stability of the banking system. Financial integration allows banks in
   different regions to smooth local liquidity shocks by borrowing and
   lending on a world interbank market. We show under which conditions
   financial integration induces banks to reduce their liquidity holdings
   and to shift their portfolios toward more profitable but less liquid
   investments. Integration helps reallocate liquidity when different banks
   are hit by uncorrelated shocks. However, when a correlated (systemic)
   shock hits, the total liquid resources in the banking system are lower
   than in autarky. Therefore, financial integration leads to more stable
   interbank interest rates in normal times but to larger interest rate
   spikes in crises. These results hold in a setup in which financial
   integration is welfare improving from an ex ante point of view. We also
   look at the model's implications for financial regulation and show that,
   in a second-best world, financial integration can increase the welfare
   benefits of liquidity requirements.

   mutual funds over the period 1983-2014. Liquidity risk premia explain an
   insubstantial fraction of this spread; instead, the spread can be
   attributed to the differential ability of high liquidity beta funds to
   outperform across high and low market liquidity states, due to a
   differential rate of either mispricing correction or intensity of
   informed trading. Tests based on mispricing, proxied by a comprehensive
   set of 68 anomalies, and tick-by-tick trades, from a large proprietary

AB Recent Medicare legislation seeks to improve patient care quality by
   financially penalizing providers for hospital-acquired infections
   (HAIs). However, Medicare cannot directly monitor HAI rates and instead
   relies on providers accurately self-reporting HAIs in claims to
   correctly assess penalties. Consequently, the incentives for providers
   to improve service quality may disappear if providers upcode, i.e.,
   misreport HAIs (possibly unintentionally) in a manner that increases
   reimbursement or avoids financial penalties. Identifying upcoding in
   claims data is challenging because of unobservable confounders (e.g.,
   patient risk). We leverage state-level variations in adverse event
   reporting regulations and instrumental variables to discover
   contradictions in HAI and present-on-admission (POA) infection reporting
   rates that are strongly suggestive of upcoding. We conservatively
   estimate that 10,000 out of 60,000 annual reimbursed claims for POA
   infections (18.5%) were upcoded HAIs, costing Medicare $200 million. Our
   findings suggest that self-reported quality metrics are unreliable and,
   thus, that recent legislation may result in unintended consequences.

AB Customers often resent priority queues even though priorities are often
   necessary to maximize either social welfare or revenue. Consequently, it
   is useful to consider the level of social inefficiency introduced when
   the design of a priority scheme is turned over to a revenue-maximizing
   firm. In this paper we study how the priority scheme chosen by a
   revenue-maximizing firm differs from the one a social planner would use.
   We study a single-server queue with customers who draw their valuations
   from a continuous distribution and have a per-period waiting cost that
   is proportional to their realized valuations. The decision maker must
   post a menu offering a finite number of waiting time-price pairs. There
   are then three dimensions on which a revenue maximizer and social
   planner can differ: coverage (i.e., how many customers in total to
   serve), coarseness (i.e., how many classes of service to offer), and
   classification (i.e., how to map customers to priority levels).
   We show that differences between the decision-makers' priority policies
   are all about classification. Both are content to offer very coarse
   schemes with just two priority levels, and they will have negligible
   differences in coverage. However, differences in classification are
   persistent. Further, a revenue maximizer may-relative to the social
   planner-have too few or too many high-priority customers. Whether the
   revenue maximizer overstuffs or understuffs the high-priority class
   depends on a measure of consumer surplus that is captured by the mean
   residual life function of the valuation distribution.

AB We offer a new anchoring explanation for the ex-day abnormal returns of
   stock distributions, including stock dividend distributions, splits, and
   reverse splits. We propose that investors tend to anchor on cum-day
   prices in valuating ex-distribution stocks, resulting in a positive
   association between ex-day returns and adjustment factors. We find that
   this positive return-factor relation exists for all three types of stock
   distributions and in both the pre- and post-decimalization periods.
   Furthermore, we find that this positive return-factor relation is more
   pronounced among events that are more subject to investors' anchoring
   propensity, featured by less investor attention, greater arbitrage
   difficulty, greater valuation uncertainty, less investor sophistication,
   and higher market sentiment. Last, using brokerage account data, we show
   that stocks that are traded by investors with more investment experience
   demonstrate a weaker return-factor relation.

   this trade-off in a workplace lab environment and find that, in line

   pay when the relationship between effort and output is noisier.
   Unexpectedly, agents produce substantially more in the noisy environment

AB In classical inverse linear optimization, one assumes that a given
   solution is a candidate to be optimal. Real data are imperfect and
   noisy, so there is no guarantee that this assumption is satisfied.
   Inspired by regression, this paper presents a unified framework for cost
   function estimation in linear optimization comprising a general inverse
   optimization model and a corresponding goodness-of-fit metric. Although
   our inverse optimization model is nonconvex, we derive a
   closed-formsolution and present the geometric intuition. Our
   goodness-of-fit metric, rho, the coefficient of complementarity, has
   similar properties to R-2 from regression and is quasi-convex in the
   input data, leading to an intuitive geometric interpretation. While rho
   is computable in polynomial time, we derive a lower bound that possesses
   the same properties, is tight for several important model variations,
   and is even easier to compute. We demonstrate the application of our
   framework for model estimation and evaluation in production planning and
   cancer therapy.

AB Maintenance service plans (MSPs) are contracts for the provision of
   maintenance by a service provider to an equipment operator. These plans
   can have different payment structures and risk allocations, which induce
   various types of incentives for agents in the service chain. How do such
   structures affect service performance and service chain value? We
   provide an empirical answer to this question by using unique panel data
   covering the sales and service records of more than 700 diagnostic body
   scanners. We exploit the presence of a standard warranty period and
   employ a matching approach to isolate the incentive effects of MSPs from
   the confounding effects of endogenous contract selection. We find that
   moving the equipment operator from a basic, pay-per-service plan to a
   fixed-fee, full-protection plan not only reduces reliability but also
   increases equipment service costs. Furthermore, that increase is driven
   by both the operator and the service provider. Our results indicate that
   incentive effects arising from MSPs leads to losses in service chain
   value, and we provide the first evidence that a basic pay-per-service
   plan-under which risk of equipment failure is borne by the operator-can
   improve performance and reduce costs.

AB Motivated by recent empirical evidence, we consider a large service
   system in which the patience time of each customer depends on his
   service requirement. Our goal is to study the impact of such dependence
   on key performance measures, such as expected waiting times and average
   queue length, as well as on optimal capacity decisions. Since the
   dependence structure renders exact analysis intractable, we employ a
   stationary fluid approximation that is based on the entire joint
   distribution of the service and patience times. Our results show that
   even moderate dependence has significant impacts on system performance,
   so considering the patience and service times to be independent when
   they are in fact dependent is futile. We further demonstrate that
   Pearson's correlation coefficient, which is commonly used to measure and
   rank dependence, is an insufficient statistic, and that the entire joint
   distribution is required for comparative statics. Thus, we propose a
   novel framework, incorporating the fluid model with bivariate dependence
   orders and copulas, to study the impacts of the aforementioned
   dependence. We then demonstrate how that framework can be applied to
   facilitate revenue optimization when staffing and abandonment costs are
   incurred. Finally, the effectiveness of the fluid-based approximations
   and optimal-staffing prescriptions is demonstrated via simulations.

   Among the many forms taken by digital piracy, we focus on an
   increasingly common one-namely, online piracy-that is facilitated by
   torrent sites and cyberlockers who bring together consumers of pirated
   content and its suppliers. Motivated by recent empirical literature that
   makes a clear distinction between antipiracy efforts that restrict
   supply of pirated goods (supply-side enforcement) and ones that penalize
   illegal consumption (demand-side enforcement), we develop a simple
   economic model and discover some fundamental differences between these
   two types in terms of their impacts on innovation and welfare. All in
   all, supply-side enforcement turns out to be the "longer arm"-it has a
   more desirable economic impact in the long run. Our results have clear
   implications for manufacturers, consumers, and policy makers.

   study measures the firm-level productivity impact of nonpecuniary (free)
   OSS and finds a positive and significant value-added return for firms
   that have an ecosystem of complementary capabilities. There is no such
   impact for firms without this ecosystem of complements. Dynamic panel
   analysis, instrumental variables, and a variety of robustness checks are
   used to address measurement error concerns and to add support for a more
   causal interpretation of the results. For firms with an ecosystem of
   complements, a 1% increase in the use of nonpecuniary OSS leads to an
   increase in value- added productivity of between 0.002% and 0.008%. This
   effect is smaller for larger firms, and the results indicate that prior

AB Many online retailers provide real-time inventory availability
   information. Customers can learn from the inventory level and update
   their beliefs about the product. Thus, consumer purchasing behavior may
   be impacted by the availability information. Based on a unique setting
   from Amazon lightning deals, which displays the percentage of inventory
   consumed in real time, we explore whether and how consumers learn from
   inventory availability information. Identifying the effect of learning
   on consumer decisions has been a notoriously difficult empirical
   question because of endogeneity concerns. We address this issue by
   running two randomized field experiments on Amazon in which we create
   exogenous shocks on the inventory availability information for a random
   subset of Amazon lightning deals. In addition, we track the dynamic
   purchasing behavior and inventory information for 23,665 lightning deals
   offered by Amazon and use their panel structure to further explore the
   relative effect of learning. We find evidence of consumers learning from
   inventory information: a decrease in product availability causally
   attracts more sales in the future; in particular, a 10% increase in past
   claims leads to a 2.08% increase in cart add-ins in the next hour.
   Moreover, we show that buyers use observable product characteristics to
   moderate their inferences when learning from others; a deep discount
   weakens the learning momentum, whereas a good product rating amplifies
   the learning momentum.

AB Motivated by diverse application areas such as healthcare, call centers,
   and crowdsourcing, we consider the design and operation of service
   systems that process tasks with types that are ex ante unknown, and
   employ servers with different skill sets. Our benchmark model involves
   two types of tasks, Easy and Hard, and servers that are either Junior or
   Senior in their abilities. The service provider determines a resource
   allocation policy, i.e., how to assign tasks to servers over time, with
   the goal of maximizing the system's long-term throughput. Information
   about a task's type can only be obtained while serving it. In
   particular, the more time a Junior server spends on a task without
   service completion, the higher her belief that the task is Hard and thus
   needs to be rerouted to a Senior server. This interplay between service
   time and task-type uncertainty implies that the system's resource
   allocation policy and staffing levels implicitly determine how the
   provider prioritizes between learning and actually serving. We show that
   the performance loss due to the uncertainty in task types can be
   significant and, interestingly, that the system's stability region is
   largely dependent on the rate at which information about tasks' types is
   generated. Furthermore, we consider endogenizing the servers'
   capabilities: assuming that training is costly, we explore the problem
   of jointly optimizing over the training levels of the system's server
   pools, the staffing levels, and the resource allocation policy. We find
   that among optimal designs there always exists one with a "hierarchical"
   structure, where all tasks are initially routed to the least skilled
   servers and then progressively move to more skilled ones, if necessary.
   Comparative statics indicate that uncertainty in task types leads to
   significantly higher staffing cost and less specialized server pools.

AB We study the impact of multidimensional bargaining and the location of
   inventory risk on the performance of a two-stage supply chain. We
   conduct a controlled human subjects experiment where a retailer and
   supplier either interact through ultimatum offers or dynamically bargain
   over contract terms, including a wholesale price and, potentially, an
   order quantity. We also manipulate whether the risk associated with
   unsold inventory lies with the retailer or the supplier or is
   endogenously determined in the bargaining process. One key insight is
   that supply chain efficiency is significantly higher when the order
   quantity is included in the negotiation and that, contrary to the
   normative theory, this leads to a Pareto improvement whereby both the
   supplier and retailer earn higher profits. A second important result,
   also counter to the normative theory, is that the party incurring the
   cost of unsold inventory always earns a lower profit than its
   counterpart, regardless of the bargaining environment or inventory risk
   location. To explain these data, we posit that retailers and suppliers
   are affected by an anchoring bias and demonstrate that it can explain
   many of our results.

AB We model the interaction of a single buyer with a single supplier within
   a market in a developing country with homogeneous local suppliers and
   homogeneous buyers from developed nations. The buyer sources a product
   from a supplier and then inspects and sells it on the market, subject to
   quality standards such as regulations about chemical content. Suppliers
   decide howmuch effort to exert to ensure compliance with quality
   standards. Buyers are assumed to comply with contracts because they are
   based in countries with strong legal systems. We assume that legal
   enforcement of the supplier's contractual obligations is not possible.
   We model the interaction between buyer and supplier as a repeated game
   in which the partnership can be terminated by the buyer if the supplier
   refuses to pay penalties for quality violations. After termination, the
   buyer and supplier each search for a new business partner. We model the
   interaction between buyer and supplier using relational contacts in
   which penalties for quality failures are set so that the supplier
   voluntarily pays them. We show that optimal relational contracts have
   dynamic form in this setting because the value of the outside option
   available to the parties, if the relationship is terminated, is
   determined by the contract terms. We characterize the properties of the
   optimal dynamic equilibria and analyze the use of third-party quality

AB This work focuses on the business-to-business interaction between a
   service requester and a service provider in a healthcare environment.
   The requester is the primary caregiver responsible for managing the
   health of a population of patients. When a patient requires advanced
   care outside of the requester's expertise, the requester refers the
   patient to a provider and pays for the referral services. Treatment may
   succeed or fail, and in the case of failure, the requester incurs
   further follow-up costs. The requester may exert preventive effort to
   reduce the volume of referrals. The provider may exert nonreimbursable
   effort to reduce the chance of treatment failure. We analyze payment
   contracts between the two firms. We find that fee-for-service (FFS)
   induces neither system nor social optimum effort outcomes. However, a
   penalty contract can generally coordinate the effort decisions with
   either the system optimum or the social optimum. Furthermore, we find
   that patients may benefit from having a coordinating contract replace
   FFS. However, the types of procedures that make a coordinating contract
   most advantageous for the requester and provider are not necessarily the
   same as those that make the patients better off than under FFS. Yet, in
   most cases, the coordinating contract improves social welfare, as
   compared to FFS, and brings it close to the social optimum. Hence, the
   requester-provider coordinating contract can be considered as an
   improvement over FFS for the entire system.

   can prevent such use by paying a "privacy cost." Unlike a monopolist,
   competing duopolists do not always benefit from a higher privacy cost
   because each firm's profit decreases-and consumer surplus increases-with
   that cost. Under such competition, the optimal strategy for an owner of
   consumer data that sells information in a single block is selling to
   only one firm, thereby maximizing the stakes for rival buyers. The

AB It is now well understood that social media plays an increasingly
   important role in consumers' decision making. However, an overload of
   social media content in product search engines can hinder consumers from
   efficiently seeking information. We propose a structural econometric
   model to understand consumers' preferences and costs on search engines
   to improve user experience under unstructured social media. Our model
   combines an optimal stopping framework with an individual-level random
   utility choice model and analyzes click behavior in conjunction with
   purchase choices. Our model accounts for three major constraints in a
   consumer's decision-making process: (1) interdependency in decision
   making for different alternatives, (2) sequential arrival of information
   revealed by click-throughs, and (3) nonnegligible search cost. Our
   approach allows us to jointly estimate consumers' heterogeneous
   preferences and search costs under the interplay of social media and
   search engines, and to predict search and purchase behavior for each
   consumer. We validate the model using an individual session-level data
   set of approximately seven million observations resulting in room
   bookings in 2,117 U.S. hotels. Interestingly, our analysis allows us to
   quantify the trade-off between consumers' benefits and cognitive costs
   from using large-scale unstructured social media information during
   decision making. Our policy experiments show that providing a carefully
   curated digest of social media content during the earlier stages of
   consumer search (i.e., on the search results summary page) can lead to a
   12.01% increase in the overall search engine revenue.

AB We conduct a laboratory experiment in which participants can make
   donations to real charities. We vary whether the experimenter provides
   matching funds for any such donations, and whether there is individual
   or team competition for these matching funds. Our results indicate that
   providing matching funds for all donations does increase donations from
   23% to 33% of the endowment. While individual competition for matching
   funds had nearly the same effectiveness as matching all donations, by
   far the most effective approach was to form (anonymous) teams that
   competed for matching funds; this led to donations of 47% of the
   endowment. We appeal to the notion of group identity to explain our
   results-participants seemed to be reluctant to "let down their team" in
   a competition. Our results can be seen as providing support for the
   notion that combining group identity and competition creates a
   motivation that can potentially be harnessed effectively for prosocial
   purposes.

AB Companies struggle with timely project execution despite employing
   sophisticated management methods. Although help across projects is
   critical for time performance, it has not been explicitly incorporated
   into project management ( PM) systems. We model a PM system, based on an
   innovative real-life practice, that both incorporates and shapes project
   managers' helping behavior. A help process is at the core of this
   system, in which project managers may ask for and provide help while top
   management facilitates such exchanges. We find that companies should
   take a nuanced approach when designing help exchange and time-based
   incentives in tandem. A company that faces high project rewards after
   delays and highly effective help can benefit from inducing help because
   doing so enables the pursuit of projects it might abandon if delayed or
   even at the outset. The formal help process delivers value by creating
   and exploiting interdependencies between projects. These
   interdependencies allow project prioritization by inducing different
   effort levels in otherwise identical projects. A help process also
   allows the company to "tune" the timing of efforts by front-loading or
   back-loading project work. The benefits of a help system accrue through
   cost efficiencies, increased probability of success under help, and
   intertemporal incentive effects that encourage early efforts. However,
   because the help process creates the opportunity for free riding, a help
   system is not always recommended and a no-help system may perform
   better, especially when there are low project rewards after delay and
   low opportunity costs for project work.

AB Why do individuals volunteer their time even when recipients receive far
   less value than the donor's opportunity cost? Previous models of
   altruism that focus on the overall impact of a gift cannot rationalize
   this behavior, despite its prevalence. We develop a model that allows
   for differential warm glow depending on the form of the donation. In a
   series of laboratory experiments that control for other aspects of
   volunteering, such as its signaling value, subjects demonstrate behavior
   consistent with the theoretical assumption that gifts of time produce
   greater utility than the same transfers in the form of money. Subjects
   perform an effort task, accruing earnings at potentially different wage
   rates for themselves or a charity of their choice, with the ability to
   transfer any of their personal earnings to charity at the end of the
   experiment. Subjects exhibit strong preferences for donating time even
   when differential wage rates make it costly to do so. The results
   provide new insights on the nature of volunteering and gift giving.

AB What is the relationship between inventory and sales? Clearly, inventory
   could increase sales: expanding inventory creates more choice (options,
   colors, etc.) and might signal a popular/desirable product. Or,
   inventory might encourage a consumer to continue her search (e.g., on
   the theory that she can return if nothing better is found), thereby
   decreasing sales (a scarcity effect). We seek to identify these effects
   in U.S. automobile sales. Our primary research challenge is the
   endogenous relationship between inventory and sales-e.g., dealers
   influence their inventory in anticipation of demand. Hence, our
   estimation strategy relies on weather shocks at upstream production
   facilities to create exogenous variation in downstream dealership
   inventory. We find that the impact of adding a vehicle of a particular
   model to a dealer's lot depends on which cars the dealer already has. If
   the added vehicle expands the available set of submodels (e.g., adding a
   four-door among a set that is exclusively two-door), then sales
   increase. But if the added vehicle is of the same submodel as an
   existing vehicle, then sales actually decrease. Hence, expanding variety
   across submodels should be the first priority when adding inventory-
   adding inventory within a submodel is actually detrimental. In fact,
   given how vehicles were allocated to dealerships in practice, we find
   that adding inventory actually lowered sales. However, our data indicate
   that there could be a substantial benefit from the implementation of a
   "maximize variety, minimize duplication" allocation strategy: sales
   increase by 4.4% without changing the total number of vehicles at each
   dealership.

AB Consumers often consult the reviews of their peers before deciding
   whether to purchase a new experience good; however, their initial
   quality expectations are typically set by the product's observable
   attributes. This paper focuses on the implications of social learning
   for a monopolist firm's choice of product design. In our model, the
   firm's design choice determines the product's ex ante expected quality,
   and designs associated with (stochastically) higher quality incur higher
   costs of production. Consumers are forward-looking social learners, and
   may choose to strategically delay their purchase in anticipation of
   product reviews. In this setting, we find that the firm's optimal policy
   differs significantly depending on the level of the ex ante quality
   uncertainty surrounding the product. In comparison to the case where
   there is no social learning, we show that (i) when the uncertainty is
   relatively low, the firm opts for a product of inferior design
   accompanied by a lower price, while (ii) when the uncertainty is high,
   the firm chooses a product of superior design accompanied by a higher
   price; interestingly, we find that the product's expected quality
   decreases either in the absolute sense (in the former case), or relative
   to the product's price (in the latter case). We further establish that,
   contrary to conventional knowledge, social learning can have an ex ante
   negative impact on the firm's profit, in particular when the consumers
   are sufficiently forward-looking. Conversely, we find that the presence
   of social learning tends to be beneficial for the consumers only
   provided they are sufficiently forward-looking.

AB We provide the first empirical evidence of the role that calibration
   committees play in subjective performance evaluation systems. Using
   proprietary data from a large multinational organization, we begin by
   showing that calibration committees adjust ratings sparingly (i.e., 25%
   adjustment rate), but when they do, downward adjustments are
   significantly more frequent and of greater magnitude than upward
   adjustments. Calibration committees tend to downward (upward) adjust
   ratings of supervisors who give higher (lower) than average initial
   ratings. Taken together, calibration committees improve the consistency
   of ratings across supervisors and mitigate leniency bias, but exacerbate
   centrality bias. We also show that calibration committees facilitate the
   appropriate allocation of decision rights by deferring rating decisions
   to supervisors who possess a relatively greater information advantage.
   That is, calibration committees are less likely to adjust the rating of
   a subordinate who is further removed from committee members in the
   organizational hierarchy. Finally, we show that calibration committees
   promote supervisor learning about organizational performance rating
   expectations through calibration adjustments. This study contributes to
   the literature on performance evaluation by providing new insights
   regarding the organizational dynamics of subjective performance
   evaluation systems when decision rights span hierarchical levels of the

   introduces a new theoretical lens, the signal-detection perspective,

   significantly higher rates of R&D and patenting in richer information
   environments. The effects of transparency are strongest in industries
   that rely on external equity rather than bank debt, indicating that
   transparency facilitates innovation by reducing the information costs
   associated with arm's-length financing. In contrast, transparency has no

AB This paper shows that operational flexibility interacting with
   informational uncertainty may lead to truthful information exchange in
   equilibrium even when the communication is nonbinding and unverifiable,
   i.e., "cheap talk." We consider a model consisting of a manufacturer
   releasing a new product with uncertain release date and demand, and a
   retailer who must determine the allocation of limited capacity between a
   preexisting third-party product and the manufacturer's new product that
   may or may not be released on time. The manufacturer has a private
   forecast about the likelihood of the product release and/or about the
   demand, which he shares (either truthfully or not) with the retailer. We
   show that under the "traditional" supply chain structure (one-time
   opportunity to order) no truthful equilibrium can emerge. However, if
   (1) the supply chain structure allows for postponement, i.e., the
   ability to delay orders at a certain cost by the retailer, and (2) the
   manufacturer has informational uncertainty about the retailer's
   capacity, then truthful information exchange may emerge in equilibrium,
   where the manufacturer transmits his true forecast and the retailer
   treats the transmission as truthful. The genesis of this effect is
   preference reversal, where the manufacturer is not sure which way to
   distort the forecast to best motivate the retailer to wait for the new
   product. Thus, we show that a truth-revealing mechanism can emerge from
   a relatively rich setup featuring two-sided information asymmetry
   interacting with postponement.

   the analogous concept to process flexibility from manufacturing. We
   study the flexibility of players (plants) on a baseball team who produce
   innings-played at different positions (products). We develop models and
   metrics to evaluate expected and worst-case performance under Injury
   risk (capacity uncertainty) with continuous player-position
   capabilities. Using Major League Baseball data, we quantify the Impact
   of flexibility on team and individual performance and explore the player
   chains that arise when injuries occur. We discover that top teams can
   attribute at least one to two wins per season to flexibility alone,
   generally as a result of long subchains in the infield or outfield. The
   least robust teams to worst-case injury, those whose performance is
   driven by one or two star players, are over four times as fragile as the
   most robust teams. We evaluate several aspects of individual
   flexibility, such as how much value individual players bring to their
   team in terms of average and worst-case performance. Finally, we
   demonstrate the generalizability of our framework for player evaluation
   by quantifying the value of potential free agent additions and
   uncovering the true "MVP" of a team.

AB Social logins, such as "Log in with Facebook," improve a website's user
   experience and therefore enjoy great popularity among content providers
   (CPs) and users alike. Moreover, they also enable the social network and
   the CPs to share data, which individually improves their ability to
   place targeted advertising. On the basis of a game-theoretic model that
   offers a microfoundation for CPs' competition for advertisements, on the
   one hand, and CPs' competition for users, on the other hand, we
   demonstrate the strategic effects of social logins in the online
   advertising ecosystem. We fully characterize the market conditions under
   which social logins are offered and adopted, and when the adoption is
   actually profitable for the CPs. In particular, we show across several
   model extensions that the voluntary adoption of the social login may
   yield a prisoner's dilemma outcome for the CPs.

AB Many studies show that time preference data from experiments and surveys
   are related to field behavior. Time preference measures in these studies
   typically depend simultaneously on utility curvature, the level of
   impatience, and the change in the level of impatience. Thus, these
   studies do not allow one to establish which of these three components
   drivels) the field behavior of interest. Of these components, the change
   in the level of impatience is theoretically thought to be the main
   driver of time inconsistencies and self-control problems. To test this
   theoretical presumption, one has to measure the change in the level of
   impatience independently from utilities and levels of impatience. This
   paper introduces a measure of the degree of decreasing impatience, the
   DI-index. It measures the change of impatience independently from the
   level of impatience and independently from utility. It can also be used
   to test various discounting models. An experiment finds no correlation
   between the degree of decreasing impatience and self-reported
   self-control problems in daily life, suggesting that changing impatience
   is not the sole driver of self-control problems.

AB Firms have an incentive to test competitors' products to reveal
   violations of safety and environmental standards, in order to have
   competitors' products blocked from sale. This paper shows that testing
   by a regulator crowds out testing by competitors, and can reduce firms'
   efforts to comply with the product standard. Relying on competitor
   testing (i.e., having the regulator test only to verify evidence of
   violations provided by competitors) is most effective in large or
   concentrated markets in which firms have strong brands and high quality,
   and for standards that are highly valued by consumers. Under those
   conditions, firms tend to test competitors' products and exert high
   compliance effort. Conversely, unless compliance is highly valued by
   consumers, a firm with low quality does not draw testing from
   competitors, and so does not comply. Enforcing a product standard
   through competitor testing encourages entry by such low-quality,
   noncompliant firms and can reduce quality investment by incumbents.
   Stripping offending products of labels (such as "Energy Star"), instead
   of blocking them from the market, eliminates the problem of entry by
   low-quality, noncompliant firms, but may reduce incumbents' compliance
   efforts.

AB It is now widely accepted that a retailer's use of strategic inventory
   can mitigate double marginalization and improve the coordination of a
   supply chain, potentially benefiting both the downstream retailer and an
   upstream manufacturer. However, this conclusion has typically been based
   on the assumption that the manufacturer can observe the retailer's level
   of inventory before making wholesale pricing decisions. In reality,
   there are many situations in which neither the retailer's sales nor
   inventory are observable to the manufacturer, effectively concealing the
   action taken by the retailer. We investigate the implications of such a
   lack of observability on the use of strategic inventory in a supply
   chain consisting of a single retailer and a single manufacturer. We find
   that the manufacturer's inability to observe inventory has significant
   implications for the amount of inventory and the range of holding cost
   for which it is held in equilibrium. In addition, we find that, in the
   absence of any form of uncertainty, which the manufacturer could benefit
   from responding to, he may prefer not to observe the retailer's
   inventory. On the other hand, the retailer's willingness to make her
   inventory visible depends on the holding cost.

AB Algorithmic matches in fielded kidney exchanges do not typically result

   proposed matches failing after the matching algorithm has committed to
   them. We show that failure-aware kidney exchange can significantly
   increase the expected number of lives saved (i) in theory, on random
   graph models; (ii) on real data from kidney exchange match runs between
   2010 and 2014; and (iii) on synthetic data generated via a model of
   dynamic kidney exchange. This gain is robust to uncertainty over the
   true underlying failure rate. We design a branchand-price-based optimal
   clearing algorithm specifically for the probabilistic exchange clearing
   problem and show that this new solver scales well on large simulated
   data, unlike prior clearing algorithms. Finally, we show that
   failure-aware matching can increase overall system efficiency and
   simultaneously increase the expected number of transplants to highly

AB Typically, shareholders are not sure whether boards act in their

   informed than boards about firm investment opportunities and operating
   conditions. We develop a model, consistent with these observations, in
   which discretionary compensation payments to managers might increase
   firm value or might simply enrich managers at the expense of
   shareholders. After observing the board's compensation and investment
   policies, shareholders use Bayes's rule to update the probability that
   the board is captured. Shareholders are "outraged" if this updated
   probability is sufficiently large. Outrage is costly for the board.
   Shareholder democracy, by enabling outrage to constrain board actions,
   typically lowers firm value relative to either governance regimes that
   insulate boards from shareholder outrage or regimes that ban
   discretionary compensation altogether.

AB This paper documents the fact that in options markets, the (percentage)
   implied volatility bid-ask spread increases at an increasing rate as the
   option's maturity date approaches. To explain this stylized fact, this
   paper provides a market microstructure model for the bid-ask spread in
   options markets. We first construct a static equilibrium model to
   illustrate the aforementioned phenomenon where risk averse and
   competitive option market makers quote bid and ask prices to minimize
   their inventory risk in an incomplete market with both directional and
   volatility risk. We extend this model to multiperiods and show that the
   same phenomenon occurs there as well. Two new implications are
   generated: a volatility level effect and a volatility variance effect.
   These implications are empirically tested, and the empirical results
   confirm the model's validity. Finally, we document the importance of
   detrending the maturity effect by showing that the detrended percentage
   volatility spread explains future jump intensities better than the
   original percentage volatility spread.

   free to choose if and how much to pay for a service. Customers'
   voluntary payments are significantly affected by subtle information
   cues: cues that signal a high rather than a low payment norm increase
   payments by some 27%. Consistent with the conjecture that this effect is
   in large part driven by customers' uncertainty about the actual norm,
   responses are mitigated when explicit norm-relevant information is
   provided. Additional treatments suggest that the reactions to the cues
   are not driven by mere saliency but by the information deduced from the
   cues in the presence of uncertainty.

AB We study dynamic unstructured bargaining with deadlines and one-sided
   private information about the amount available to share (the "pie
   size"). Using mechanism design theory, we show that given the players'
   incentives, the equilibrium incidence of bargaining failures ("strikes")
   should increase with the pie size, and we derive a condition under which
   strikes are efficient. In our setting, no equilibrium satisfies both
   equality and efficiency in all pie sizes. We derive two equilibria that
   resolve the trade-off between equality and efficiency by favoring either
   equality or efficiency. Using a novel experimental paradigm, we confirm
   that strike incidence is decreasing in the pie size. Subjects reach
   equal splits in small pie games (in which strikes are efficient), while
   most payoffs are close to either the efficient or the equal equilibrium
   prediction, when the pie is large. We employ a machine learning approach
   to show that bargaining process features recorded early in the game
   improve out-of-sample prediction of disagreements at the deadline. The
   process feature predictions are as accurate as predictions from pie
   sizes only, and adding process and pie data together improves
   predictions even more.

AB We study the pricing of cardinality bundles, where firms set prices that

   increasingly being adopted by industry. The model we study, where
   consumer choices are discrete, was originally proposed by Hitt and Chen
   [Hitt L, Chen P (2005) Bundling with customer self-selection: A simple
   approach to bundling low-marginal-cost goods. Management Sci. 51
   (10):1481-1493], and it requires that consumers' preferences obey the
   Spence-Mirrlees single-crossing property. We correct prior approaches
   and develop various structural and managerial insights. We develop a
   fast combinatorial technique to obtain the optimal prices. We extend our
   analysis to address a quantity discount problem originally proposed in
   Spence [Spence M (1980) Multi-product quantity-dependent prices and
   profitability constraints. Rev. Econom. Stud. 47(5):821-841]. We provide
   examples that demonstrate that the proposed approach of Spence (1980)
   only identifies local optima without providing guidance on selecting the
   globally optimal pricing function. Our insights from the discrete model
   are extended to this context to develop a scheme that provides solutions
   within an arbitrary prespecified tolerance. Consequently, we also solve
   the continuous version of the cardinality bundling problem.

AB How does competition impact firms' incentive to innovate by investing in
   information technology (IT)? Prior literature suggests opposite
   predictions on the direction in which competition drives IT investment.
   This paper analyzes a game theoretic model of duopoly competition and
   shows that an important feature of IT sheds new light on firms'
   investment decisions: IT implementation can fail. Without the
   possibility of implementation failure, the opportunity to invest in IT
   hurts firms' profits because the productivity gains are competed away.
   Implementation failure creates a possibility of cost-based
   differentiation and mitigates competition, although these two effects
   can drive firms' IT investment in opposite directions. Interestingly, a
   higher probability of implementation failure can lead to lower
   investment risks and higher expected profits. Firms in highly
   competitive markets are better able to recoup the returns to their IT
   investments and, therefore, more motivated to invest in risky IT than
   firms in less competitive markets.

AB I examine the effect of the disclosure of pending lawsuits in 10-K/Q
   filings on the contractual terms of newly issued bonds. I find that
   firms' decisions to disclose pending lawsuits and the amount of
   disclosed information (i.e., the level of disclosure) have opposite
   effects. Specifically, firms that disclose a higher proportion of their
   pending lawsuits face higher yields and are more likely to include
   default clauses pertaining to court judgments in the bond prospectuses.
   However, within the subsample of firms that disclose their lawsuits, I
   find that firms with a higher level of disclosure regarding their
   pending lawsuits are rewarded with lower yields. This evidence suggests
   that bond investors interpret the decision to disclose pending lawsuits
   as a sign that the potential losses due to these lawsuits are material
   and reasonably possible and thus demand more stringent bond terms.
   However, bond investors associate a higher level of disclosure with a
   lower likelihood of withholding bad news and thus accept lower yields.

   of the network, as measured by emergency department wait times. Our
   numerical results indicate that the level of coordination that can be
   achieved is limited by the patients' sensitivity to waiting, the load of

   method hospitals use to estimate delays. We show that delay estimators

   notice. To manage fluctuating demand across market locations (zones),
   on-demand platforms share market forecasts with workers to inform them
   where they should be available, and use surge pricing-wherein the price
   at a particular zone is temporarily raised above the regular price. We
   analyze these platform strategies in an on-demand marketplace where
   independent workers can move between adjacent zones, explicitly
   accounting for the strategic interaction in their moving decisions. We
   show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, surge pricing can be useful
   even in zones where supply exceeds demand. Specifically, because workers
   are strategic agents facing costs to move and competition from other
   workers who move, simply informing workers where they should be
   available may not ensure that enough workers move to that zone.
   Interestingly, more workers can be made to move from a zone with excess
   supply of workers by strategically using a surge price to throttle
   demand in that zone. Such strategic surge pricing can increase total
   platform profit across zones, and even be more profitable than offering
   workers bonuses to move. Surge pricing in a zone with excess supply can
   also be useful to credibly communicate the need for more workers to
   move. In other instances, such surge pricing may be useful to avoid too
   many workers from moving. Our analysis offers insights for effectively
   managing on-demand service with independent workers.

AB We analyze the optimal execution problem of a portfolio manager trading
   multiple assets. In addition to the liquidity and risk of each
   individual asset, we consider cross asset interactions in these two
   dimensions, which substantially enriches the nature of the problem.
   Focusing on the market microstructure, we develop a tractable order book
   model to capture liquidity supply/demand dynamics in a multiasset
   setting, which allows us to formulate and solve the optimal portfolio
   execution problem. We find that cross asset risk and liquidity
   considerations are of critical importance in constructing the optimal
   execution policy. We show that even when the goal is to trade a single
   asset, its optimal execution may involve transitory trades in other
   assets. In general, optimally managing the risk of the portfolio during
   the execution process affects the time synchronization of trading in
   different assets. Moreover, links in the liquidity across assets lead to
   complex patterns in the optimal execution policy. In particular, we
   highlight cases where aggregate costs can be reduced by temporarily
   "overshooting" one's target portfolio.

AB The risk of patient harm resulting from medical care affects hundreds of
   thousands of patients and costs tens of billions of dollars every year.
   Advanced electronic medical records (EMRs) are expected to improve
   patient safety, but the evidence of their impact on patient safety is
   inconclusive. A key challenge to evaluating advanced EMRs' impact has
   been the lack of reliable patient safety data. We address this issue by
   analyzing a new patient safety data set from the Pennsylvania Patient
   Safety Authority (PSA), a state agency that aggregates patient safety
   data from Pennsylvania hospitals. Using a 2005-2014 panel from PSA, we
   identify advanced EMRs' effect using the difference-indifferences
   method. We find that advanced EMRs lead to a 17.5% decline in patient
   safety events, driven by reductions in medication errors, falls, and
   complication errors. Further, our analysis shows a decline in medium-
   and high-severity events.

AB This paper examines crop planning decisions in sustainable
   agriculture-that is, how to allocate farmland among multiple crops in
   each growing season when the crops have rotation benefits across growing
   seasons. We consider a farmer who periodically allocates the farmland
   between two crops in the presence of revenue uncertainty where revenue
   is stochastically larger and farming cost is lower when a crop is grown
   on rotated farmland (where the other crop was grown in the previous
   season). We characterize the optimal dynamic farmland allocation policy
   and perform sensitivity analysis to investigate how revenue uncertainty
   of each crop affects the farmer's optimal allocation decision and
   profitability. Using a calibration based on a farmer growing corn and
   soybeans in Iowa, we show that growing only one crop over the entire
   planning horizon, as employed in industrial agriculture, leads to a
   considerable profit loss-that is, crop planning based on principles of
   sustainable agriculture has substantial value. We propose a simple
   heuristic allocation policy, which we characterize in closed form. Using
   our model calibration, we show that (i) the proposed policy not only
   outperforms the commonly suggested heuristic policies in the literature,
   but also provides a near-optimal performance and (ii) compared with the
   optimal policy, the proposed policy has a higher allocation of crops to
   rotated farmland, and thus, it is potentially more environmentally
   friendly.

AB We consider an online retailer facing heterogeneous customers with
   initially unknown product preferences. Customers are characterized by a
   diverse set of demographic and transactional attributes. The retailer
   can personalize the customers' assortment offerings based on available
   profile information to maximize cumulative revenue. To that end, the
   retailer must estimate customer preferences by observing transaction
   data. This, however, may require a considerable amount of data and time
   given the broad range of customer profiles and large number of products
   available. At the same time, the retailer can aggregate (pool)
   purchasing information among customers with similar product preferences
   to expedite the learning process. We propose a dynamic clustering policy
   that estimates customer preferences by adaptively adjusting customer
   segments (clusters of customers with similar preferences) as more
   transaction information becomes available. We test the proposed approach
   with a case study based on a data set from a large Chilean retailer. The
   case study suggests that the benefits of the dynamic clustering policy
   under the MNL model can be substantial and result (on average) in more
   than 37% additional transactions compared to a data-intensive policy
   that treats customers independently and in more than 27% additional
   transactions compared to a linear-utility policy that assumes that
   product mean utilities are linear functions of available customer
   attributes. We support the insights derived from the numerical
   experiments by analytically characterizing settings in which pooling
   transaction information is beneficial for the retailer, in a simplified
   version of the problem. We also show that there are diminishing marginal
   returns to pooling information from an increasing number of customers.

AB Economic policymakers express concern that procyclical lending by banks
   imperils financial stability. Prior research finds that banks that
   record timelier loan loss provisions originate more loans during
   downturns, consistent with loan loss-provision timeliness mitigating
   loan-origination procyclicality. Motivated by this concern and research,
   we examine whether banks' credit risk modeling disciplines both their
   loan loss provisions and loan origination. We identify two forms of
   credit risk modeling from banks' financial report disclosures:
   statistical modeling of the drivers of past loan losses and stress
   testing of future loan losses to adverse scenarios. We show that banks'
   credit risk-modeling disclosures are positively associated with their
   loan loss-provision timeliness, with the ability of their provisions to
   predict future loan charge-offs, and with their loan origination during
   downturns. We further show that these associations vary in predictable
   ways across the two forms of credit risk modeling when we distinguish
   homogeneous from heterogeneous loans and stable periods from downturns.

AB A newsvendor game allows the players to collaborate on inventory pooling
   and share the resulting total cost. There are several possible ways to
   allocate the cost. Previous studies have focused on the core of the
   game. It is known that the core of the newsvendor game is nonempty, and
   one can use duality theory in stochastic programming to construct an
   allocation-referred to as the dual-based allocation-belonging to the
   core. Yet, an allocation that lies in the core does not necessarily
   guarantee the unhindered formation of a coalition, as some existing
   members' allocated costs may increase when new members are added in the
   process. In this work, we use the concept of population monotonic
   allocation scheme (PMAS), which requires the cost allocated to every
   member of a coalition to decrease as the coalition grows, to study
   allocation schemes in a growing population. We show that when the
   demands faced by the newsvendors are independent, log-concavity of their
   distributions is sufficient to guarantee the existence of a PMAS.
   Specifically, for continuous demands, log-concavity ensures that the
   game is convex, which in turn implies a PMAS exists. We also show that
   under the same condition the dual-based allocation scheme is a PMAS. For
   discrete and log-concave demands, however, the game may no longer be
   convex, but we manage to show that, even so, the dual-based allocation
   scheme is a PMAS. When the demands are dependent, the game is in general
   not convex. We derive a sufficient condition based on the dependence
   structure, measured by the copula, to ensure that the dual-based
   allocation scheme is still a PMAS. We also include an example of a game
   with no PMAS.

AB Markdown as a pricing modality is ubiquitous in retail whereas everyday
   low price (EDLP) remains relatively rare (despite its several
   advantages, such as simplicity). This paper explores whether and why
   retailers can use either of these pricing modalities as an effective
   defense against a competitor entering the market with the alternative
   pricing modality. Various studies have shown that consumers are
   strategic and heterogeneous in their valuation of a product. Consumers
   are also shown to be regret-prone, and anticipation of regret affects
   their purchase decisions. Consumers experience availability regret when
   they are unable to purchase products due to stockouts and high-price
   regret when they miss an opportunity to purchase products at low prices.
   Considering such factors, consumers decide whether, when, and from which
   retailer to purchase the product. In such a market environment, we find
   that the possible entry of a competitor should deter retailers from
   using the EDLP pricing modality but not markdown. We also identify a new
   reason for the markdown retailer to ration stock (in addition to the
   reason for discouraging consumers to wait for the markdown). In
   particular, we show that the markdown retailer can use inventory
   rationing to preclude a cutthroat competition and bankruptcy after the
   entry of an EDLP retailer. We also quantify how consumer regret affects
   both retailers' decisions and resulting profits. In particular, in a
   competitive market, the EDLP retailer cannot simply disregard consumers'
   availability and high-price regret (even when it stocks ample inventory
   and does not discount prices). We show that high-price regret and
   availability regret have complementary effects on the markdown
   retailer's rationing strategy and the EDLP retailer's price decision.
   Finally, using a proprietary price data set from a large department
   store, we show that ignoring regret factors causes the markdown retailer
   to leave up to 20% of its profits on the table. In addition, in a
   competitive market, the markdown retailer rations too aggressively when
   regret is ignored and, as a result, leaves some of the forgone profit to
   its competitor-the EDLP retailer. The retail industry is often
   characterized by its slim profit margins. In such an environment, the
   aforementioned results also suggest that retailers should seriously
   consider investing in developing the capacity to estimate and quantify
   the role of regret in consumers' purchase decisions.

AB Product expiration is an important problem in the consumer packaged
   goods (CPG) industry costing 1%-2% of gross retail sales and eroding
   industry profits substantially. It can be caused by several factors
   related to store operations, supply chain practices, and product
   characteristics. Existing methods used in the industry are inadequate to
   identify the causes of expiration, leading to inadequate efforts to
   reduce expiration. Using retail data for 768 SKUs and 10,000 stores
   (745,638 store-SKU-level observations), as well as upstream supply chain
   data from a CPG manufacturer, we show the extent to which expiration of
   products in retail stores is driven by case size, inventory aging in the
   supply chain, minimum order rules, manufacturers' incentive programs for
   the sales force, replenishment workload, and many control variables. A
   counterfactual analysis based on the model shows that our subject
   manufacturer can reduce expiration by up to $38.82 million per year by
   implementing four selected initiatives involving case size, supply chain
   aging, minimum order rules, and sales incentives. Further, targeted
   initiatives can be designed using combinations of these variables for
   subsets of products with the highest occurrence of expiration.

AB The sunk cost effect has been widely observed in individual decisions.
   Building on an intrapersonal self-management game, the paper
   theoretically shows that the sunk cost effect may stem from an attempt
   to overcome the underinvestment problem associated with a high degree of
   present bias or to resolve the multi-selves coordination problem when
   the degree of present bias is low. Especially for individuals with
   severe present bias, the current self may take a costly action (which is
   a sunk cost for the future self) to signal the individual's high success
   probability that motivates his future self-disciplining behaviors. In
   equilibrium, a higher level of sunk cost is more likely to give rise to
   a higher probability for the individual to continue the project. We then
   conduct a laboratory experiment. The empirical findings are consistent

AB The referral priority program-an emerging business practice adopted by a
   growing number of technology companies that manage a waitlist of
   customers-enables existing customers on the waitlist to gain priority
   access if they successfully refer new customers to the waitlist. Unlike
   more commonly used referral reward programs, this novel mechanism does
   not offer monetary compensation to referring customers, but leverages
   customers' own disutility of delays to create referral incentives.
   Despite this appealing feature, our queueing-game-theoretic analysis
   finds that the effectiveness of such a scheme as a marketing tool for
   customer acquisition and an operational approach for waitlist management
   depends crucially on the underlying market conditions, particularly the
   base market size of spontaneous customers. The referral priority program
   does not generate referrals when the base market size is either too
   large or too small. When customers do refer, the program could actually
   backfire-namely, by reducing the system throughput and customer
   welfare-if the base market size is intermediately large. This phenomenon
   occurs because the presence of referred customers severely cannibalizes
   the demand of spontaneous customers. We also compare the referral
   priority program with the referral reward program when the service
   provider optimally sets the admission price. Numerical study suggests
   that the referral priority program is more profitable than the referral
   reward program when the base market size is intermediately small.

   changes in choice frames implemented by service providers can influence
   consumers' upstream disclosure settings, often in ways that they are
   unaware of and that may be destructive to them. Whether the effects of
   choice frames upstream are ultimately detrimental to individuals'
   privacy, however, depends on whether they are offset by more or less
   protective downstream choices. Thus, we also examine whether such
   upstream effects of choice architecture are "mitigated" through changes
   in downstream self-disclosure. We find, first, that various
   manipulations of decision frames, common in privacy contexts,
   significantly impact participants' upstream choice of disclosure
   settings. Second, we do not find evidence that the impact of choice
   architecture upstream is mitigated downstream: participants'
   self-disclosure rates do not adjust or change in response to choice
   architecture-induced changes in upstream choices. These findings call
   into question both policy makers' and industry advocates' reliance on
   choice-based privacy protection mechanisms, contribute to an emerging
   behavioral perspective on privacy decision making, and highlight the
   importance of accounting for the cascaded nature of privacy decision
   making in both policy and managerial settings.

AB Using the wisdom of crowds-combining many individual judgments to obtain
   an aggregate estimate-can be an effective technique for improving
   judgment accuracy. In practice, however, accuracy is limited by the
   presence of correlated judgment errors, which often emerge because
   information is shared. To address this problem, we propose an
   elicitation procedure in which respondents are asked to provide both
   their own best judgment and an estimate of the average judgment that
   will be given by all other respondents. We develop an aggregation
   method, called pivoting, which separates individual judgments into
   shared and private information and then recombines these results in the
   optimal manner. In several studies, we investigate the method and
   examine the accuracy of the aggregate estimates. Overall, the empirical
   data suggest that the pivoting method provides an effective judgment
   aggregation procedure that can significantly outperform the simple crowd
   average.

AB We introduce a new type of utility that we call "process utility," which
   pertains to individuals' preference about how they want to obtain an
   outcome. We posit that decision makers derive utility not only from the
   outcome itself, but also from the process through which that outcome is
   obtained. We focus on two normatively equivalent processes for obtaining
   an outcome: action and inaction. We argue that inducing differences in
   how outcomes are obtained can lead to significant preference reversals.
   We examine process utility in binary choice where one outcome is
   predominantly preferred over the other. We find that when the frequently
   selected ("advantaged") alternative is framed as an inaction, its choice
   share decreases, but that when the infrequently selected
   ("disadvantaged") alternative is framed as an inaction, its choice share
   increases. Finally, we discuss potential moderators of our effects.

   The assets of the insolvent bank can be appropriated by the forgiving
   bank in the two-bank network, but not the three-bank network, where they
   may be appropriated by the third bank, leading to a renegotiation

AB Grocery retailers increasingly use acquisitions to expand their
   presence. Such acquisitions are risky, especially when retailers decide
   to subsume the acquired stores under their own banner, which can take
   years and demands careful planning. We show how the dynamics of consumer
   valuations of the old and new banner affect the traffic implications of
   various (spatio-temporal) rollouts, and how this can be incorporated in
   the conversion planning. In a store-choice model with Bayesian learning,
   consumers update their perceptions about the old banner as its value
   deteriorates, and learn about the new banner through visits. Our model
   thus captures consumers' responses to store conversion over time, in
   function of the local presence of other (own and competitive) outlets
   and new-banner advertising. An application to the national rollout of a
   Dutch EDLP player after its acquisition of a HILO chain, analyzes the
   shopping patterns of about 1,500 households over four years, involving
   over 100 store conversions. Our findings show that (i) uncertainty about
   the new banner dampens traffic to converted stores initially, while (ii)
   value deterioration of the old banner jeopardizes traffic to stores
   converted late, and (iii) the magnitude of these effects strongly
   depends on local-market characteristics, that is, competition and access
   to other old-banner and new-banner stores. With simulations, we show
   that to attract and keep customers, (i) outlets in competitive markets
   should not always get precedence and (ii) in locations with multiple
   outlets, conversions are better separated. Retailers can use these
   demand-side effects to their benefit in planning the rollout.

AB Compared to offline matching markets, online matching platforms improve
   search in the matching process but at the same time increase the problem
   of authenticating the features and credentials of prospective matches.
   This paper examines the interplay between these two processes in online
   matching, using game-theoretic models. We examine whether an online
   matching platform should target a broad market of match-seekers or an
   exclusive group of high-value match-seekers, and how the platform should
   price its search and authentication services. Our results provide
   valuable insights for online matching platforms regarding the decision
   to offer authentication services in addition to search services, and
   guidelines for the pricing and positioning of these services. For
   instance, we show that the complementarity of the platform's optimal
   pricing for search and authentication services can justify the
   platform's offering an authentication service as a loss leader, and that
   higher-quality authentication services may not always justify higher
   authentication fees. We also develop guidelines for the platform's
   optimal strategies for different market conditions.

AB Real markets evolve over time. They often exhibit complex behaviors,
   such as autocorrelation, continuity, and nonstationarity. How do these
   behaviors affect channel contracting? We study the problem in a
   bilateral channel where the retailer has private information on evolving
   market conditions. We characterize the optimal contract under arbitrary
   market evolution. The central notion is market inertia: it prices
   retailer's information advantage, dictates price and quantity response
   over time, and determines the contract complexity. Using market inertia,
   we identify a general property-stochastic linearity-that justifies the
   use of simple contracts for a much larger class of channel conditions.
   For practitioners, we offer refined guidance: (i) when the market has
   linear dynamics, simple contracts are sufficient; (ii) when the market
   is continuous, the quantity distortion should be pervasive; and (iii)
   when the market is nonstationary, the distortion can vanish, intensify,
   stay constant, or even go nonmonotonic over time. By highlighting the
   central role of realistic market behaviors, this paper advances our
   understanding of channel theory and practice.

AB The paper considers a model of competition among firms that produce a

   the production quantities at the unique equilibrium of the resulting
   game for any given network. Our results identify a novel connection
   between the equilibrium outcome and supply paths in the underlying
   network structure. We then proceed to study the impact of changes in the
   competition structure, for example, due to a firm expanding into a new
   market or two firms merging, on firms' profits and consumer surplus. The
   modeling framework we propose can be used in assessing whether expanding
   in a new market is profitable for a firm, identifying opportunities for
   collaboration, for example, a joint venture between competing firms, and
   guiding regulatory action in the context of market design and antitrust
   analysis.

AB Scholars have recently suggested the reorganization of general hospitals
   into organizationally separate divisions for routine and non-routine
   services to overcome operational misalignments between the two types of
   services. We provide empirical evidence for this proposal from a quality
   perspective, using over 250,000 patient discharge records from 60 German
   hospitals across 39 high-mortality disease segments, and focusing on
   in-hospital mortality as outcome. Disentangling the effects of high,
   absolute, and relative hospital volumes in a disease group, our analysis
   suggests that routine and complex patients would benefit from a hospital
   organization with a multi-specialty hub for emergency and non-routine
   elective services at its core, complemented by organizationally separate
   disease-focused hospitals-within-hospitals for routine services. We also
   provide evidence that the hub hospital can further improve service
   quality for complex patients by adopting a disease-based rather than
   medical specialty-based departmental routing strategy for newly arriving
   patients. A counterfactual analysis, based on a simultaneous equations
   probit model that simultaneously controls for endogeneity of volume,
   focus, and routing strategy, suggests that the proposed reorganization
   could have reduced mortality in the sample by 13.43% (95% CI [6.87%;
   18.95%]) for routine patients and by 11.67% (95% CI [6.13%; 16.86%]) for

AB We analyze product design implications of extended producer
   responsibility (EPR)-based take-back legislation on durable goods. In
   particular, we observe that durable product design incentives under EPR
   may involve an inherent trade-off that has not been explored to date:
   Durable goods producers can respond to EPR by making their products more
   recyclable or more durable, where the former decreases the unit
   recycling cost and the latter reduces the volume the producer has to
   recycle. When these two design attributes do not go hand in hand, as is
   the case for many product categories, product design implications of EPR
   can be counterintuitive. We find that more stringent collection targets
   (defined as the portion of total product volume to be collected) or
   recycling targets (defined as the portion of each collected product unit
   to be recycled) may imply reduced recyclability or durability. Moreover,
   although collection and recycling targets appear to be similar EPR
   implementation levers for increasing the total amount of materials
   recycled, they, in fact, have opposing effects in driving producers'
   design choices. As a result, EPR may have unintended consequences for
   the environment. A calibrated numerical study on the photovoltaic panel
   (PVP) industry allows us to show that more stringent EPR requirements
   (such as those proposed by the recent recast of the WEEE directive) can
   lead to a PVP technology choice with lower recyclability and higher
   durability and, consequently, result in higher greenhouse gas emissions.
   These results call for a careful analysis of the benefits of EPR
   legislation in the context of durable goods.

AB The regulatory use of banks' internal models makes capital requirements
   more risk sensitive but invites regulatory arbitrage. I develop a
   framework to study bank regulation with strategic selection of risk
   models. A bank supervisor can discourage arbitrage by auditing risk
   models and implements capital ratios less risk sensitive than in the
   first-best to reduce auditing costs. The optimal capital ratios of a
   national supervisor can be different from those set by supranational
   authorities, in which case the supervisor optimally tolerates biased
   models. I discuss the empirical implications of this "hidden model"
   problem, and policy answers such as leverage ratios and more reliance on
   backtesting mechanisms.

AB A puzzling feature of many retail markets is the coexistence of large
   multiproduct firms and smaller firms with narrow product ranges. This
   paper provides a possible explanation for this puzzle, by studying how
   consumer search frictions influence the structure of retail markets. In
   our model, single-product firms that supply different products can merge
   to form a multiproduct firm. Consumers wish to buy multiple products
   and, due to search frictions, value the one-stop shopping convenience
   associated with a multiproduct firm. We find that, when search frictions
   are relatively large, all firms are multiproduct in equilibrium.
   However, when search frictions are smaller, the equilibrium market
   structure is asymmetric, with different retail formats coexisting. This
   allows firms to better segment the market and, as such, typically leads
   to the weakest price competition. When search frictions are low, this
   asymmetric market structure is also the worst for consumers. Moreover,
   due to the endogeneity of market structure, a reduction in the search
   friction can increase market prices and harm consumers.

   give increased attention to their order-fulfillment operations. We study
   "chaotic storage" fulfillment systems in which dissimilar items are
   stored together in a single location. This necessitates a searching task
   as part of the picking process, which has not been previously studied.
   We show that pick times increase by as much as 16% as the searching task
   becomes more difficult. However, the deleterious effect of searching
   decreases with pick-worker experience. Using simulation, we show that
   pick times can be improved by incorporating distance, bin density, and
   picker experience into pick assignments and pick routing. Through
   properly combining the details of the task and the workers,
   order-fulfillment productivity can be increased by approximately 5%.

AB This paper studies the strategic interaction between a monopolistic
   seller of an information product and a set of potential buyers that
   compete in a downstream market. The setting is motivated by information
   markets in which (i) sellers have the ability to offer information
   products of different qualities and (ii) the information product
   provides potential buyers not only with more precise information about
   the fundamentals, but also with a coordination device that can be used
   in their strategic interactions with their competitors. Our results
   illustrate that the nature and intensity of competition among the
   information provider's customers play first-order roles in determining
   the information provider's optimal strategy. We show that when the
   customers view their actions as strategic complements, the provider
   finds it optimal to offer the most accurate information at the
   provider's disposal to all potential customers. In contrast, when buyers
   view their actions as strategic substitutes, the provider maximizes the
   provider's profits by either (i) restricting the overall supply of the
   information product or (ii) distorting its content by offering a product
   of inferior quality. We also establish that the provider's incentive to
   restrict the supply or quality of information provided to the downstream
   market intensifies in the presence of information leakage.

AB This paper studies intertemporal price discrimination (IPD) with
   complementary products in the context of e-readers and e-books. Using
   individual-level data (2008-2012), I estimate a dynamic demand model for
   e-reader adoption and subsequent book quantity, reading format, and
   retailer choices in several book genres. I use the estimates to simulate
   a monopolist's optimal dynamic pricing strategies when facing
   forward-looking consumers. The results illustrate how
   skimming/penetration pricing incentives for e-readers and
   harvesting/investing incentives for e-books interact in this novel
   setting. The optimal joint IPD strategy is skimming for e-readers and
   investing for e-books. Counterfactual results suggest that combining IPD
   with complementary product pricing improves firm profitability because
   it attenuates the limitations of each pricing approach. In a
   single-product IPD setting, firms' pricing power is limited when
   consumers anticipate future price changes and delay purchases. Adding
   complementary products offers firms two pricing instruments; opposite
   price trajectories provide conflicting incentives for consumers,
   limiting intertemporal arbitrage. In a static complementary product
   setting, firms' pricing power is limited when the relative elasticity
   between the two products is heterogeneous and conflicting among
   consumers. Adding IPD sorts heterogeneous consumers into different
   periods and reduces the need to balance across consumer types.

AB This paper seeks to understand the relational factors that may affect
   the decisions of both third-party raters and service providers in a
   setting where service providers compete with one another. We employ
   laboratory economics experiments to examine how removing anonymity and
   allowing for repeated interactions between the rater and the service
   provider impact both the ratings assigned by the rater and the quality
   levels expended by the service provider. Our methodology enables us to
   observe the true quality level chosen by a service provider, which
   allows us to accurately detect any bias in the assessment of the
   third-party rater. The experimental results show that the decisions of
   both the rater and the service provider are very sensitive to the
   relational factors that govern their interaction. When the rater and the
   service provider know each other's identities, we observe a high
   proportion of overrating even though raters earn less monetary rewards
   for doing so, and the propensity to overrate is even stronger with
   repeated interactions. Furthermore, the service provider chooses low
   quality levels. We develop and estimate a model that captures the
   rater's psychological trade-off between remaining objective and helping
   the service provider compete in the marketplace, and the evolution of
   the service provider's beliefs about the rater's preferences.

AB In this paper, we use mobile messaging to leverage recipients' social
   ties and encourage offline prosocial activities in groups. In
   particular, we conduct a randomized field experiment with 80,000 blood
   donors and study how behavioral interventions and economic rewards
   motivate offline group formation. We find that two commonly used
   interventions-reminder messages and individual reward-are ineffective in
   motivating group formation because they do not compensate donors for the
   cost of bringing friends. In contrast, we find that group reward-a new
   reward that is contingent on a donor bringing a friend-is effective in
   motivating group formation. Furthermore, group reward tends to attract
   different types of donors, especially those who are traditionally less
   active in online social settings but have more local social ties.
   Structural estimation further reveals the underlying mechanisms,
   suggesting that group reward is four times more cost-effective than
   individual reward in driving total donation. Our study suggests that
   motivating offline group formation is a promising approach to boost
   prosocial activities.

AB Based on a dynamic model of the stochastic repayment behavior exhibited
   by delinquent credit-card accounts in the form of a self-exciting point
   process, a bank can control the arrival intensity of repayments using
   costly account-treatment actions. A semi-analytic solution to the
   corresponding stochastic optimal control problem is obtained using a
   recursive approach. For a linear cost of treatment effort, the optimal
   policy in the two-dimensional (intensity, balance) space is described by
   the frontier of a convex action region. The unique optimal policy
   significantly reduces a bank's loss given default and concentrates the
   collection effort onto the best possible actions at the best possible
   times so as to minimize the sum of the expected discounted outstanding
   balance and the discounted cost of the collection effort, thus
   maximizing the net value of any given delinquent credit-card account.

AB As multisourcing becomes a widely adopted strategy in dynamic
   procurement planning, firms inevitably source from suppliers with
   dependent material flows, and such supply dependence, created by common
   second-tier suppliers or a common economic environment, is often
   positive. We show that firms can experience significant profit loss when
   implementing a policy computed based on a model that ignores the
   dependence among suppliers' stochastic material flows. The profit loss
   is particularly significant when a firm earns a low margin or faces an
   unreliable and fragmented supplier base. Analysis of the firm's dynamic
   multisourcing strategy under dependent supply uncertainties, however, is
   challenging. By expanding the space of ordering decision to a class of
   contingency policies, we identify conditions under which the dynamic
   planning model has a concave transformation. This approach allows us to
   characterize the optimal procurement policy. Moreover, our analysis
   suggests that the firm may order more from a less reliable supplier than
   from a more reliable one who charges the same procurement cost. The
   order allocation to the less reliable supplier can be even larger when
   the capacities are more dependent. Though the analysis of our base model
   is conducted for dependent supply capacities that are independent across
   periods, we show that the results can be generalized to Markov-modulated
   supplies or general supply functions that are stochastically linear in
   midpoint.

AB In most organizations, the agent has superior information about the
   relative costs of different products or activities. This handicaps the
   principal when the principal seeks to adjust the product mix. Our main
   conceptual finding is that there is "mix stickiness." The agent's
   superior information about the relative costs of different products or
   activities leads to an advantage for the status quo; that is, there is
   inertia (or stickiness) in the mix of products or activities pursued.
   The historical mix has an advantage because the asymmetric information
   about relative costs has less of an impact when the mix does not change.
   If the mix changes, the producer can extract information rents by
   claiming high costs on the least reduced or most expanded products. Only
   in the case of larger shifts in the environment will the mix change.
   Changing the mix comes with the advantage of making rationing cheaper.
   Our analysis gives new insight into several business practices. It
   suggests, for example, that for moderate downsizing, a reinforcement
   approach of proportionally cutting all activities (lawn mowing) is
   optimal. When more dramatic downsizing is called for, a reorientation
   approach of eliminating certain activities (divesting) is optimal. It
   also suggests that outsourcing may come at the cost of reduced
   adaptability, and it may help explain why most, if not all, healthcare
   systems struggle to control cost.

   agents does not "put himself in their shoes" but rather chooses a best
   response to a uniform distribution over all possible configurations

   We demonstrate the special features of a PS by analyzing a modified
   coordination game. In the first stage, each of the other
   participants-who are treated as conventional players-chooses a location.
   The PS then receives some partial information about their moves and
   chooses his location. The PS wishes to coordinate with any one of the
   conventional players and they wish to coordinate with him but not with
   each other. Equilibria are characterized and shown to have different
   properties than those of Nash equilibria when the PS is treated as a

   The experimental design generates situations where participants work and

   Third-party arbitrators are randomly assigned to determine how the

   claimants. Our main finding is that there is a striking support for the
   pari passu principle. We estimate a random utility model that allows for
   the arbitrators to differ in what they consider a fair solution to the
   bankruptcy problem and find that about 85% of the participants endorse
   the proportional rule. We also find that a nonnegligible fraction of the

AB Organizations often implement changes that can signal their values.
   However, the most objectively efficient changes do not necessarily serve
   as the best signals. Across seven experiments, we investigate how
   different rates of transition influence people's perceptions of how
   committed organizations are to the values underlying changes or
   improvements. We find that slower, less efficient transitions signal
   greater commitment compared with faster, more efficient transitions that
   reach otherwise identical endpoints (Experiment 1). Using mediation and
   moderation strategies, we demonstrate that this discontinuity occurs
   because people assume slower transitions require relatively more effort
   to enact (Experiments 2 and 3). Moreover, these commitment inferences
   persist beyond the point at which changes end (Experiment 4), when
   further improvement along the same dimension is no longer possible
   (Experiment 5), and regardless of whether the organization decided to
   transition either quickly or slowly (Experiment 6). This effect
   reverses, however, when people can directly compare slower and faster
   transitions that ultimately reach identical endpoints (Experiment 7).
   Taken together, these findings suggest that people often infer greater
   commitment from slower transitions that unfold over time, even when
   those transitions are objectively inferior to faster alternatives.

AB We study an economy with incomplete information in which two agents are
   uncertain and disagree about the length of business cycles. That is, the
   agents do not question whether the economy is growing or not, but
   instead continuously estimate how long economic cycles will last-i.e.,
   they learn about the persistence of fundamentals. Learning about
   persistence generates high and persistent stock return volatility mostly
   during recessions, but also (to a smaller extent) during economic booms.
   Disagreement among agents fluctuates and earns a risk premium. A clear
   risk-return trade-off appears only when conditioning on the sign and
   magnitude of disagreement. We confirm these predictions empirically.

AB This study examines the effect of psychological contract breach on
   budgetary misreporting. Psychological contracts are mental models or
   schemas that govern how employees understand their exchange
   relationships with their employers. Psychological contract breach leads
   to feelings of violation and can occur even when employees' economic
   contracts are fulfilled. We study the effects of psychological contract
   breach on three common types of employee participation in budgeting that
   differ in the degree of employees' influence over their approved
   budgets. These include affirmative budgeting (full influence),
   consultative budgeting (moderate influence), and authoritative budgeting
   (low influence). When organizations communicate that employees will be
   involved in budgeting, employees develop psychological contracts of
   affirmative budgeting. If employees subsequently experience
   authoritative or consultative budgeting, their psychological contracts
   are breached. Employees who experience psychological contract breach
   seek redress through budgetary misreporting. Experimental results
   indicate that psychological contract breach partially mediates the
   relation between budgeting type and budgetary misreporting. Results also
   indicate asymmetry in the effects of psychological contract breach
   versus repair. Effects of breach on budgetary misreporting persist even
   after the breach no longer occurs.

   receives a political promotion is positively related to firm
   performance. We also find that CEOs with a higher likelihood of
   political promotion have lower pay levels and lower pay-performance

AB This paper studies the potential benefits of responsive pricing and
   demand learning to sellers of seasonal fashion goods. As typical in such
   markets, demand uncertainty is high at the beginning of a season, but
   there is a potential opportunity to learn about demand via early sales
   observations. Additionally, although the consumers have general
   preference for purchasing a fashion product earlier rather than later in
   the season, they may exhibit strategic behavior-contemplating the
   benefits of postponing their purchase in anticipation of end-of-season
   discounts. Our results demonstrate that the benefits of responsive
   pricing, in comparison with a benchmark case of a fixed-price policy,
   depend sharply on the nature of the consumers' behavior. Interestingly,
   in stark contrast to markets of myopic consumers, when the consumers are
   all strategic, the benefits of responsive pricing tend to worsen when
   there is a higher potential for learning. We explain this
   counterintuitive outcome by pointing to two phenomena: the spread effect
   and information shaping. For example, sellers of fashion products that
   consider upgrading their pricing systems to incorporate "accurate
   response" strategies (i.e., integrating learning and responsive pricing)
   should be aware of the possibility that such action might lead them to a
   new and potentially worse equilibrium, particularly when there is a
   higher opportunity to learn. Despite the fact that price commitment
   completely eliminates the seller's ability to learn, it appears to
   increasingly dominate responsive pricing as the portion of strategic
   consumers in the market increases. But, although performing better than
   responsive pricing, a price-commitment policy is typically limited in
   performing effective discrimination. Finally, we studied the potential
   benefits of quick response strategies-ones that embed both dynamic
   pricing and quick inventory replenishment during the sales season-and
   found that they are particularly significant under strategic consumer
   behavior. We explain this result by arguing that quick response provides
   the seller with a real option that serves as an effective implicit
   threat to the consumers: encouraging them to buy earlier at premium
   prices rather than wait for discounts at the end of the season.

   data from a laboratory experiment. We find no gender differences in

   explain the fund flow effect. We conduct an implicit association test
   and find that subjects with stronger gender bias according to this test
   invest significantly less in female-managed funds. Our results suggest
   that gender bias affects investment decisions and thus offer a new

AB Most research on firm financing studies debt versus equity issuance. We
   model an alternative source, non-core asset sales, and identify three
   new factors that contrast it with equity. First, unlike asset
   purchasers, equity investors own a claim to the firm's balance sheet
   (the "balance sheet effect"). This includes the cash raised, mitigating
   information asymmetry. Contrary to the intuition of Myers and Majluf
   [Myers SC, Majluf NS (1984) Corporate financing and investment decisions
   when firms have information that investors do not have. J. Financial
   Econom. 13(2):187-2211, even if non-core assets exhibit less information
   asymmetry, the firm issues equity if the financing need is high. Second,
   firms can disguise the sale of low-quality assets-but not equity-as
   motivated by dissynergies (the "camouflage effect"). Third, selling
   equity implies a "lemons" discount for not only the equity issued but
   also the rest of the firm, since both are perfectly correlated (the
   "correlation effect"). A discount on assets need not reduce the stock
   price, since non-core assets are not a carbon copy of the firm.

AB We examine the equity market reaction to events associated with the
   passage of a directive in the European Union (EU) mandating increased
   nonfinancial disclosure. These disclosures relate to firms'
   environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, and would be
   applicable to firms listed on EU exchanges or with significant
   operations in the EU. We predict and find (i) an average negative market
   reaction of -0.79% across all firms, (ii) a less negative market
   reaction for firms having higher predirective nonfinancial performance,
   and (iii) a less negative reaction for firms having higher predirective
   nonfinancial disclosure levels. In addition, results are accentuated for
   firms having the most material ESG issues, as well as investors
   anticipating proprietary and political costs as a result of the mandated
   disclosures. Finally, we find that the negative market reaction is
   concentrated in firms with weak preregulation ESG performance and
   disclosure, which exhibit an average return of -1.54%; in contrast,
   firms with strong preregulation disclosure and performance exhibit an
   average positive return of 0.52%. Overall, the results are consistent
   with the equity market perceiving net costs (benefits) for firms with
   weak (strong) nonfinancial performance and disclosure around key events
   surrounding the mandatory disclosure regulation of nonfinancial
   information.

AB We show that the beta with respect to an index of global ex ante tail
   risk concerns (GRIX), which we construct using out-of-the-money options
   on multiple global assets, negatively drives cross-sectional return
   variations across asset classes, including international equity indices,
   foreign currencies, and government bond futures. The pricing power of
   GRIX becomes stronger when more asset-class-level tail risk concerns are
   incorporated in the index construction. GRIX also dominates
   asset-class-level tail risk concerns in pricing assets within each asset
   class. These evidences imply that the pricing effect of tail risk
   concerns works predominantly as a global channel. The GRIX pricing
   effect is distinct from that of tail risk factors based on historical
   realizations, consistent with the interpretation that tail risk concerns
   likely reflect investors' ex ante subjective belief about tail risk.

AB Product and content personalization is now ubiquitous in e-commerce.
   There are typically not enough available transactional data for this
   task. As such, companies today seek to use a variety of information on
   the interactions between a product and a customer to drive
   personalization decisions. We formalize this problem as one of
   recovering a large-scale matrix with side information in the form of
   additional matrices of conforming dimension. Viewing the matrix we seek
   to recover and the side information we have as slices of a tensor, we
   consider the problem of slice recovery, which is to recover specific
   slices of "simple" tensors from noisy observations of the entire tensor.
   We propose a definition of simplicity that on the one hand elegantly
   generalizes a standard generative model for our motivating problem and
   on the other hand subsumes low-rank tensors for a variety of existing
   definitions of tensor rank. We provide an efficient algorithm for slice
   recovery that is practical for massive data sets and provides a
   significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art incumbent
   approaches to tensor recovery. Furthermore, we establish near-optimal
   recovery guarantees that, in an important regime, represent an order
   improvement over the best available results for this problem.
   Experiments on data from a music streaming service demonstrate the
   performance and scalability of our algorithm.

AB When should a firm diversify its supply base? Most extant theories
   attribute supplier diversification to supplier risk. Herein, we develop
   a new theory that attributes supplier diversification to buyer risk.
   When suppliers are subject to the risk of buyer default, buyers may take
   costly action to signal creditworthiness so as to obtain more favorable
   terms. But once signaling costs are sunk, buyers sourcing from a single
   supplier become vulnerable to future holdup. Although ex ante supply
   base diversification can be effective at alleviating the holdup problem,
   we show that it comes at the expense of higher up-front signaling costs.
   We resolve the ensuing trade-off and show that diversification emerges
   as the preferred strategy in equilibrium. Our theory can help explain
   sourcing strategies when risk in a trade relationship originates from
   the sourcing firm, for example, a small-to-medium enterprise or a
   start-up; a setting that has eluded existing theories so far.

AB We present a model with dynamic investment flows, where fund managers
   have the ability to generate excess returns, and study how forcing them
   to commit part or all of their personal wealth to the fund they manage
   affects fund risk taking. We contrast the behavior of a manager who may
   invest her personal wealth in a private account to a manager who is
   either forced to commit her wealth to the fund she manages or not
   allowed to hold risky assets held by the fund privately. We show that a
   fund managed by a manager with higher ability does not necessarily
   achieve higher expected returns but achieves lower idiosyncratic
   volatility. For a manager with constant ability, restrictions placed on
   her personal account do not influence her choices in the fund, while for
   a manager whose ability varies stochastically, they result in higher
   expected returns and idiosyncratic volatilities. Fund strategies can be
   nonmonotone both in the manager's commitment level and the ratio of
   manager to investor wealth. Our results are robust to incomplete
   information and to competing managers with correlated ability.

AB Yardstick competition is a regulatory scheme for local monopolists
   (e.g., hospitals), where the monopolist's reimbursement is linked to
   performance relative to other equivalent monopolists. This regulatory
   scheme is known to provide cost-reduction incentives and serves as the
   theoretical underpinning behind the hospital prospective reimbursement
   system used throughout the developed world. This paper uses a
   game-theoretic queueing model to investigate how yardstick competition
   performs in service systems (e.g., hospital emergency departments),
   where in addition to incentivizing cost reduction the regulator wants to
   incentivize waiting time reduction. We first show that the form of
   cost-based yardstick competition used in practice results in
   inefficiently long waiting times. We then demonstrate how yardstick
   competition can be appropriately modified to achieve the dual goal of
   cost and waiting-time reduction. In particular, we show that full
   efficiency (first-best) can be restored if the regulator makes the
   providers' reimbursement contingent on their service rates and is also
   able to charge a provider-specific "toll" to consumers. More important,
   if such a toll is not feasible, as may be the case in healthcare, we
   show that there exists an alternative and particularly simple
   yardstick-competition scheme, which depends on the average waiting time
   only, that can significantly improve system efficiency (second-best).
   This scheme is easier to implement because it does not require the
   regulator to have detailed knowledge of the queueing discipline. We
   conclude with a numerical investigation that provides insights on the
   practical implementation of yardstick competition for hospital emergency
   departments, and we also present a series of modelling extensions.

AB In this paper we study the impact of time shifting on TV consumption and
   ad viewership. We analyze the results of a field experiment in which a
   random sample of "triple-play" households were given a set of premium TV
   channels broadcasting popular movies and TV shows without commercial
   breaks. A random subset of these households were given access to these
   channels with time shifting (automated cloud recording for later viewing
   or rewinding of broadcasted programs), while the remainder were not.
   This design allowed us to identify the effects of time shifting on TV
   consumption. On average, we found that receiving access to the channels
   with time shifting increased total TV consumption because it increased
   time-shifted viewership while leaving live viewership unchanged. The
   increase in the live viewership of these channels was similar to the
   reduction in the live viewership of the originally available channels,
   resulting in a net zero effect on live viewership. It appears that time
   shifting does not change the concentration of live viewership, but it

AB The identification of optimal product and package designs is challenged
   when attributes and their levels interact. Firms recognize this by
   testing trial products and designs prior to launch, during which the
   effects of interactions are revealed. A difficulty in conducting
   analysis for product design is dealing with the high dimensionality of
   the design space and the selection of promising product configurations
   for testing. We propose an experimental criterion for efficiently
   testing product profiles with high demand potential in sequential
   experiments. The criterion is based on the expected improvement in
   market share of a design beyond the current best alternative. We also
   incorporate a stochastic search variable selection method to selectively
   estimate relevant interactions among the attributes. A validation
   experiment confirms that our proposed method leads to improved design
   concepts in a high-dimensional space compared with alternative methods.

AB This paper considers a traditional problem of resource allocation:
   scheduling jobs on machines. One such recent application is cloud
   computing; jobs arrive in an online fashion with capacity requirements
   and need to be immediately scheduled on physical machines in data
   centers. It is often observed that the requested capacities are not
   fully utilized, hence offering an opportunity to employ an
   overcommitment policy, that is, selling resources beyond capacity.
   Setting the right overcommitment level can yield a significant cost
   reduction for the cloud provider while only inducing a very low risk of
   violating capacity constraints. We introduce and study a model that
   quantifies the value of overcommitment by modeling the problem as bin
   packing with chance constraints. We then propose an alternative
   formulation that transforms each chance constraint to a submodular
   function. We show that our model captures the risk pooling effect and
   can guide scheduling and overcommitment decisions. We also develop a
   family of online algorithms that are intuitive, easy to implement, and
   provide a constant factor guarantee from optimal. Finally, we calibrate
   our model using realistic workload data and test our approach in a
   practical setting. Our analysis and experiments illustrate the benefit
   of overcommitment in cloud services and suggest a cost reduction of 1.5%
   to 17%, depending on the provider's risk tolerance.

AB The gender difference in competitiveness has been cited as an important
   factor driving the gender gap in labor market outcomes. Using a field
   experiment with more than 35,000 university students, I explore the
   impact of compensation scheme on willingness to apply for a job. I find
   that competitive compensation schemes that depend on relative
   performance disproportionately deter women from applying. I do not find
   the same deterrence effect under a compensation scheme in which students
   face uncertain payoffs independent of performance. I also test the
   impact of describing the job as helping a charity, and this increases
   the willingness to apply but does not affect the gender gap. My findings
   are important for managers, who need to understand the impact of
   different compensation schemes on the share of women recruited for a job
   posting.

AB Stochastic programming and distributionally robust optimization seek
   deterministic decisions that optimize a risk measure, possibly in view
   of the most adverse distribution in an ambiguity set. We investigate
   under which circumstances such deterministic decisions are strictly
   outperformed by random decisions, which depend on a randomization device
   producing uniformly distributed samples that are independent of all
   uncertain factors affecting the decision problem. We find that, in the
   absence of distributional ambiguity, deterministic decisions are optimal
   if both the risk measure and the feasible region are convex or
   alternatively, if the risk measure is mixture quasiconcave. We show that
   some risk measures, such as mean (semi-)deviation and mean (semi-)moment
   measures, fail to be mixture quasiconcave and can, therefore, give rise
   to problems in which the decision maker benefits from randomization.
   Under distributional ambiguity, however, we show that, for any
   ambiguity-averse risk measure satisfying a mild continuity property, we
   can construct a decision problem in which a randomized decision strictly
   outperforms all deterministic decisions.

AB Since the financial crisis in 2007-2008, the vulnerability of a
   financial system has become a major concern in financial engineering. In
   this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of a financial network based on
   the linear optimization model introduced by Eisenberg and Noe [Eisenberg
   L, Noe TH (2001) Systemic risk in financial systems. Management Sci.
   47(2):236-249.], in which the right-hand side of the constraints is
   subject to market shock and only limited information regarding the
   liability matrix is exposed. We develop a new extended sensitivity
   analysis to characterize the conditions under which a bank is solvent,
   in default, or bankrupted and estimate the probability of insolvency and
   the probability of bankruptcy under mild conditions on the market shock
   and the network structure. Particularly, we show that although an
   increment in the total asset may not be able to improve the stability of
   the financial system, a larger asset inequality in the system will
   reduce its stability. Moreover, under a certain assumption on the market
   shock and the network structure, we show that the least stable network
   can be attained at some network with a monopoly node, which also has the
   highest probability of insolvency. The probability of bankruptcy in the
   network when all the nodes receive shocks is estimated. We also estimate
   the impact of bankruptcy of the monopoly node in a well-balanced network
   and explore the domino effect of bankruptcy when the network has a
   tridiagonal structure. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the
   theoretical conclusions.

AB We study strategic communication between a customer and an advisor who
   is privately informed about the most suitable choice for the customer
   but whose preferences are misaligned with the customer's preferences.
   The advisor sends a message to the customer who, in turn, can secure
   herself from bad advice by acquiring costly information on her own. In
   our experiments, we find that making the customer's information
   acquisition less costly leads to less prosocial behavior of the advisor.
   This can be explained by a model of shared guilt, which predicts a shift
   in causal attribution of guilt from the advisor to the customer if the
   latter could have avoided her ex post disappointment. We conclude that
   providing better access to information through, for example, consumer
   protection regulation or digital information aggregation and
   dissemination, may have unintended negative consequences on peoples'
   willingness to take responsibility for each other.

AB Healthy eating goals influence many consumer choices, such that
   evaluating the healthiness of food portions is important. Given that
   both the type and quantity of food jointly contribute to weight and
   overall health, evaluations of a food portion's healthiness ought to
   consider both type and quantity. However, existing literature tends to
   examine food type and food quantity separately. Across seven studies, we
   show that consumers treat type as a primary dimension and quantity as a
   secondary dimension, such that a change in type (versus quantity) has a
   greater impact on perceived healthiness or health goal impact, even when
   holding objective impact constant in terms of calories. We also examine
   whether one reason this effect occurs is because most consumers consider
   type (a categorical attribute) before quantity (a continuous attribute).
   We conclude by discussing extensions of these ideas to other perceptual
   assessments involving both type and quantity (e.g., price perceptions).

AB For a social media community to thrive and grow, it is critical that
   users of the site interact with each other and contribute content to the
   site. We study the role of social ties in motivating user preference
   expression, a form of user content contribution, in an online social
   media community. We examine the role of three types of ties,
   reciprocated, follower, and followee ties, and assess whether the
   structural and relational properties of a user's social network moderate
   the social influence effect in user contribution. A unique disaggregate
   level panel data set of users' contributions and social tie formation
   activities from an online music platform is employed to study the impact
   of social ties. To address identification issues, we adopt a
   quasi-experimental approach based on dynamic propensity score matching.
   The results provide strong evidence of the influence of online network
   ties in online contribution behavior. We find that the influence of
   reciprocated ties is the greatest, followed by influence from followee
   ties and then follower ties. Additional analysis reveals that
   reciprocated and followee ties have even greater influence when they
   contribute new information for a focal user. Structural embeddedness and
   tie strength among network ties are found to amplify the effect of
   social contagion in online contribution. We conduct several sensitivity
   and robustness checks that lend credible support to our findings. The
   results add to the greater understanding of social influence in online
   contribution and provide valuable managerial insights into designs of
   online communities to enable greater user participation.

   smartphone applications ("apps"). Developers offer their apps at lower
   prices in return for greater access to personal information, and
   consumers choose between low prices and more privacy. We provide
   evidence for this pattern using data from 300,000 apps obtained from the
   Google Play Store (formerly Android Market) in 2012 and 2014. Our
   findings show that the market's supply and demand sides both consider an
   app's ability to collect private information, measured by the apps's use
   of privacy-sensitive permissions: (1) cheaper apps use more
   privacy-sensitive permissions; (2) given price and functionality, demand
   is lower for apps with sensitive permissions; and (3) the strength of
   this relationship depends on contextual factors, such as the targeted
   user group, the app's previous success, and its category. Our results
   are robust and consistent across several robustness checks, including
   the use of panel data, a difference-in-differences analysis, "twin"
   pairs of apps, and various measures of privacy-sensitivity and app
   demand.

AB Employers in an online labor market often pursue workers with little
   capacity to take on more work. The pursuit of low-capacity workers is
   consequential, as these workers are more likely to reject employer
   inquires, causing a reduction in the probability that a job opening is
   ultimately filled. In an attempt to shift more employer attention to
   workers with greater capacity, the market-designing platform examined in
   this paper introduced a new signaling feature into the market. It was
   effective, in that when a worker signaled having high capacity, he or
   she received more invitations from employers, rejected a smaller
   fraction of those invitations, quoted lower prices to do the work, and
   was more likely to be hired. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests
   the signaling feature alone could increase market surplus by as much as
   6%, both by increasing the number of matches formed and by helping to
   allocate projects to workers with lower costs.

AB Using a large sample of business groups from more than 100 countries
   around the world, we show that group information matters for parent and
   subsidiary default prediction. Group firms may support each other when
   in financial distress. Potential group support represents an off-balance
   sheet asset for the receiving firm and an off-balance sheet liability
   for the firm offering support. We find that subsidiary information
   improves parent default prediction over and above group-level
   consolidated information possibly because intragroup exposures are
   netted out upon consolidation. Moreover, we document that improvements
   in parent default prediction decrease in the extent of parent-country
   financial reporting transparency, a finding that suggests that
   within-group information matters most when consolidated financial
   statements are expected to be of lower quality. We also show that parent
   and other group-firms' default risk exhibits predictive power for
   subsidiary default. Lastly, we find that within-group information
   explains cross-sectional variation in CDS spreads. Taken together, our
   findings contribute to the prior literature on default prediction and
   have direct relevance to investors, credit-rating agencies, and
   accounting regulators.

AB Customers looking for service providers often face search frictions and
   have to trade off quality and availability. To understand customers'
   search behavior when they are confronted with a large collection of
   vertically differentiated, congested service providers, we build a model
   in which arriving customers conduct a costly sequential search to
   resolve uncertainty about service providers' quality and queue length
   and select one to join by optimal stopping rules. Customers search, in
   part, because of variations in waiting time across service providers,
   which, in turn, is determined by the search behavior of customers. Thus,
   an equilibrium emerges. We characterize customers' equilibrium
   search/join behavior in a mean field model as the number of service
   providers grows large. We find that reducing either the search cost or
   customer arrival rate may increase the average waiting time in the
   system as customers substitute toward high-quality service providers.
   Moreover, with lower search costs, the improved quality obtained by
   customers may not make up for the prolonged wait, therefore degrading
   the average search reward and, more importantly, decreasing customer
   welfare; when customers search, their welfare can even be lower than if
   they are not allowed to search at all.

   holds particularly true if acquirer analysts and target analysts reside

AB This study examines whether firms with private loan contracts that
   contain debt covenants based on earnings before interest, taxes,
   depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) are more likely to misclassify
   core expenses as special items (i.e., classification shift).
   Misclassifying core expenses as income-decreasing special items allows
   the firm to increase EBITDA and thereby potentially avoid debt covenant
   violations. Consistent with our expectation, firms misclassify core
   expenses as special items when at least one EBITDA-related financial
   covenant is close to being violated. In addition, classification
   shifting is more prominent when financially distressed firms are close
   to violating at least one EBITDA-related covenant. Whereas prior
   research on classification shifting focuses primarily on equity market
   incentives (e.g., meeting analysts' earnings forecasts), our study
   extends this research to private loan contracts to highlight that
   creditors also affect classification shifting. Classification shifting
   appears to be an additional earnings management technique used by
   managers to avoid debt covenant violations.

AB The price fluctuation in agricultural markets is an obstacle to poverty
   reduction for small-scale farmers in developing countries. We build a
   microfoundation to study how farmers with heterogeneous production
   costs, under price fluctuations, make crop-planting decisions over time
   to maximize their individual welfare. We consider both strategic
   farmers, who rationally anticipate the near-future price as a basis for
   making planting decisions, and naive farmers, who shortsightedly react
   to the most recent crop price. The latter behavior may cause recurring
   overproduction or underproduction, which leads to price fluctuations. We
   find it important to cultivate a sufficient number of strategic farmers
   because their self-interested behavior alone, made possible by
   sufficient market information, can reduce price volatility and improve
   total social welfare. In the absence of strategic farmers, a
   well-designed preseason buyout contract, offered by a social
   entrepreneur or a for-profit firm to a fraction of contract farmers,
   brings benefit to farmers as well as to the firm itself. More
   strikingly, the contract not only equalizes the individual welfare in
   the long run among farmers of the same production cost, but it also
   reduces individual welfare disparity over time among farmers with
   heterogeneous costs regardless of whether they are contract farmers or
   not. On the other hand, a nonsocially optimal buyout contract may
   reflect a social entrepreneur's over-subsidy tendency or a for-profit
   firm's speculative incentive to mitigate but not eliminate the market
   price fluctuation, both preventing farmers from achieving the most
   welfare.

AB This paper explains why banks derive a benefit from being highly
   interconnected. We show that when banks are protected by government
   guarantees, they can significantly increase their expected returns by
   channeling funds through the interbank market before these funds are
   invested in real assets. If banks that are protected by implicit or
   explicit government guarantees act as intermediaries between other banks
   and real investments, there is the possibility that these intermediary
   banks will be rescued by their governments if the real assets fail. This
   additional hedge increases the likelihood that banks and their creditors
   are repaid relative to a direct investment in those same real assets. We
   show that this incentive to exploit the government guarantees of other
   banks leads to long intermediation chains and a degree of
   interconnectedness that is above the welfare-optimal level, which
   justifies regulatory intervention.

AB This paper studies the effect of providing feedback to college students
   on their position in the grade distribution by using a natural field
   experiment. This information was updated every six months during a
   three-year period. We find that greater grades transparency decreases
   educational performance, as measured by the number of examinations
   passed and grade point average (GPA). However, self-reported
   satisfaction, as measured by surveys conducted after feedback is
   provided but before students take their examinations, increases. We
   provide a theoretical framework to understand these results, focusing on
   the role of prior beliefs and using out-of-trial surveys to test the
   model. In the absence of treatment, a majority of students underestimate
   their position in the grade distribution, suggesting that the updated
   information is "good news" for many students. Moreover, the negative
   effect on performance is driven by those students who underestimate
   their position in the absence of feedback. Students who overestimate
   initially their position, if anything, respond positively. The
   performance effects are short lived-by the time students graduate, they

AB Sometimes we desire change, a break from the same, or an opportunity to
   fulfill different aspects of our needs. Noting that consumers seek
   variety, several approaches have been developed to diversify items
   recommended by personalized recommender systems. However, current
   diversification strategies operate under a one-shot paradigm without
   considering the evolution of preferences resulting from recent
   consumption. Therefore, such methods often sacrifice accuracy. In the
   context of online media, we show that by recognizing that consumption in
   a session is the result of a sequence of utility-maximizing selections
   from various categories, one can increase recommendation accuracy by
   dynamically tailoring the diversity of suggested items to the diversity
   sought by the consumer. Our approach is based on a multicategory utility
   model that captures a consumer's preference for different categories of
   content, how quickly the consumer satiates with one category and wishes
   to substitute it with another, and how the consumer trades off costly
   search efforts with selecting from a recommended list to discover new
   content. Taken together, these three elements allow us to characterize
   how an individual selects a diverse set of items to consume over the
   course of a session and how likely the individual is to click on
   recommended content. We estimate the model using a clickstream data set
   from a large media outlet and apply it to determine the most relevant
   content to recommend at different stages of an online session. We find
   that our approach generates recommendations that are on average about
   10% more accurate than optimized alternatives and about 25% more
   accurate than those diversified using existing diversification
   strategies. Moreover, the proposed method recommends content with
   diversity that more closely matches the diversity sought by readers,
   exhibiting lower concentration-diversification bias than other
   personalized recommender systems. Using a policy simulation, we estimate
   that recommending content using the proposed approach would result in
   visitors reading 23% additional articles at the studied website and
   deriving 35% higher utility. This could lead to immediate gains in
   revenue for the publisher and longer-term improvements in customer
   satisfaction and retention at the site.

AB The rising cost of prescription drugs is a concern in the United States.
   To manage drug costs, insurance companies induce patients to choose
   less-expensive medications by making them pay higher copayments for
   more-expensive drugs, especially when multiple drug options are
   available to treat a condition. However, drug manufacturers have
   responded by offering copay coupons-coupons intended to be used by those
   already with prescription drug coverage. Recent empirical work has shown
   that such coupons significantly increase insurer costs without much
   benefit to patients, who incur lower out-of-pocket expenses with coupons
   but may eventually see higher costs passed to them. As a result, there
   is pressure from the insurance industry and consumer advocacy groups to
   ban copay coupons. In this paper we analyze how copay coupons affect
   patients, insurance companies, and drug manufacturers, while addressing
   the question of whether insurance companies would in fact always benefit
   from a copay coupon ban. We find that copay coupons tend to benefit drug
   manufacturers with large profit margins relative to other manufacturers,
   while generally, but not always, benefiting patients; insurer costs tend
   to increase with coupons from high-price drug manufacturers and decrease
   with coupons from low-price manufacturers. Although often helping drug
   manufacturers and increasing insurer costs, we also identify situations
   in which copay coupons benefit both patients and insurers. Thus, a
   blanket ban on copay coupons would not necessarily benefit insurance
   companies. In addition to the policy implications of our work, we make
   concrete managerial recommendations to insurers. We discuss how they
   should set formulary selection policies taking into account the fact
   that drug manufacturers may offer coupons; and we suggest how they can
   benefit from subsidizing coupons from drug manufacturers with low-price
   drugs, or from having drug manufacturers compete on price, to receive a
   favorable formulary position (i.e., copay).

AB The mere preannouncement of a new product can affect consumer choice,
   thus complicating preannouncement strategy. This is because a
   preannounced product that is unavailable immediately can still be one of
   the alternatives in a consumer's mind at the time of choice. Such
   unavailable products, also known as phantom products, influence the
   reference point that consumers compare alternatives to when making a
   choice, as has been widely demonstrated in experimental studies. Thus,
   in addition to encouraging consumers to postpone purchase in favor of a
   future product, preannouncement also changes their preference for the
   currently available products when consumers do not prefer to postpone.
   In this paper we explore preannouncement strategy by analyzing a model
   that incorporates the effect of new product preannouncement (NPP) on
   consumer preferences and compare the results with a benchmark case in
   which consumer preferences across the existing products are not
   influenced by preannouncement. We find that when we take into account
   the effect of NPP on consumer preferences across the existing products,
   although postponement of purchase by some consumers remains beneficial,
   the preference for the current product offering with a lower quality can
   suffer so much that the significant lowering of current profits is not
   offset by future gains. Thus, preannouncement may no longer be the
   optimal strategy for the firm with a lower-quality product, which in
   turn explains the "Osborne effect." Our results also challenge the
   conventional wisdom in new product preannouncement literature.

   approach is also able to quantify the strength of association between

   the coach cabin changes after introducing the option to upgrade to a new
   type of premium economy seating within the coach cabin. We first provide
   a theoretical analysis that highlights two competing pressures that the
   new premium economy seating upgrades created on coach class prices. On
   the one hand, the airline benefits from lowering its prices because by
   allowing more customers to purchase in the first place, it increases the
   probability of selling upgrades (admission effect). On the other hand,
   for some customers, the value of flying with the airline increases
   because of the upgrade availability, therefore the airline may find it
   optimal to increase its prices (valuation effect). In the second part of
   the paper, we conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of
   upgrade introduction on coach class prices, based on a proprietary
   transaction-level data set from a major U.S. airline company. The
   empirical analysis tests the main predictions of our theoretical model
   and examines further nuances. The results show that the introduction of
   the premium economy seating upgrades is associated with an increase in
   the price dispersion and revenues in the coach class, the admission
   effect is stronger than the valuation effect on the low end of the price
   distribution, and the opposite is true on the high end of the price
   distribution. Finally, we discuss implications of our results for firm
   revenues and consumer welfare.

AB We develop a dynamic structural model of competitive bidding in
   multiunit sequential business-to-business auctions. Our model accounts
   for two notable characteristics of these auctions: (i) bidders have
   multiple purchase opportunities for the same product, and (ii) winning
   bidders in each round can acquire multiple units of the same product. We
   apply the model to bidding data from the world's largest flower
   wholesale market at which trades are facilitated through fast-paced,
   sequential, Dutch auctions. Using a two-step estimation approach, we are
   able to recover the structural parameters effectively and efficiently.
   We then conduct policy counterfactuals to evaluate the performance of
   alternative design choices. The results suggest that the current auction
   practice still has ample room for improvement. In light of this, we
   propose an optimization framework that can facilitate auctioneers'
   decisions in making the trade-off between revenue maximization and
   operational efficiency.

AB Gift-giving customs are ubiquitous in social, political, and business
   life. Legal regulation and industry guidelines for gifts are often based
   on the assumption that large gifts potentially influence behavior and
   create conflicts of interest, but small gifts do not. However,
   scientific evidence on the impact of small gifts on business
   relationships is scarce. We conducted a natural field experiment in
   collaboration with sales agents of a multinational consumer products
   company to study the influence of small gifts on the outcome of business
   negotiations. We find that small gifts matter. On average, sales
   representatives generate more than twice as much revenue when they
   distribute a small gift at the onset of their negotiations. However, we
   also find that small gifts tend to be counterproductive when purchasing
   and sales agents meet for the first time, suggesting that the nature of
   the business relationship crucially affects the profitability of gifts.

AB A little-understood phenomenon of customer reward programs is the
   prevalent use of finite reward expiration terms. We develop a
   theoretical framework to investigate the economic rationale behind this
   phenomenon and the trade-off between short and long expiration terms. In
   our model, a monopolistic firm sets the expiration term, along with the
   price and reward size, and interacts with consumers over an infinite
   horizon. Consumers are heterogeneous in shopping probabilities and
   product valuations and forward-looking in making purchase decisions. We
   find that a customer reward program with a finite expiration term can
   increase firm profits when (i) the valuation difference within the
   consumer population is intermediate and (ii) the shopping probabilities
   and valuations are negatively correlated among consumers. Several model
   extensions confirm the robustness of these results. Finally, we conduct
   an empirical investigation on the reward program practice of the top 100
   U.S. retailers, which provides directional support for several key
   theoretical predictions.

AB Can an organization avoid blame for an unpopular action when an adviser
   advises it to do it? We present experimental evidence suggesting this is
   the case-advice to be selfish substantially decreases punishment of
   being selfish. Further, this result is true despite advisers' misaligned
   incentives, known to all: Through a relational contract incentive,
   advisers are motivated to tell the decision makers what they want to
   hear. Through incentivized elicitations, we find suggestive evidence
   that advice moves punishment by affecting beliefs of how necessary the
   selfish action was. In follow-up treatments, however, we show advice
   does not decrease punishment solely through a beliefs channel. Advice
   not only changes beliefs about what happened, but also the perceived
   morality of it. Finally, in treatments in which advisers are available,
   the data suggest selfish decision makers act more selfishly.

AB In online advertising markets, advertisers often purchase ad placements
   through bidding in repeated auctions based on realized viewer
   information. We study how budget-constrained advertisers may compete in
   such sequential auctions in the presence of uncertainty about future
   bidding opportunities and competition. We formulate this problem as a
   sequential game of incomplete information, in which bidders know neither
   their own valuation distribution nor the budgets and valuation
   distributions of their competitors. We introduce a family of practical
   bidding strategies we refer to as adaptive pacing strategies, in which
   advertisers adjust their bids according to the sample path of
   expenditures they exhibit, and analyze the performance of these
   strategies in different competitive settings. We establish the
   asymptotic optimality of these strategies when competitors' bids are
   independent and identically distributed over auctions, but also when
   competing bids are arbitrary. When all the bidders adopt these
   strategies, we establish the convergence of the induced dynamics and
   characterize a regime (well motivated in the context of online
   advertising markets) under which these strategies constitute an
   approximate Nash equilibrium in dynamic strategies: the benefit from
   unilaterally deviating to other strategies, including ones with access
   to complete information, becomes negligible as the number of auctions
   and competitors grows large. This establishes a connection between
   regret minimization and market stability, by which advertisers can
   essentially follow approximate equilibrium bidding strategies that also
   ensure the best performance that can be guaranteed off equilibrium.

AB We study the interaction between the design of a premium-status loyalty
   program, revenue management, and strategic consumer behavior.
   Specifically, we consider a contemporaneous change where firms across
   several industries switch their loyalty programs from quantity-based
   toward spending-based designs. This change has been met with fierce
   opposition from the media and consumers. Building on the
   microfoundations of strategic, forward-looking, and status-seeking
   consumer behavior, we endogenize strategic consumer response to firms'
   pricing and loyalty program design decisions, and we characterize
   conditions under which, by coordinating these decisions, firms can
   benefit from strategic consumer behavior. We further show that by
   switching to a spending-based design, firms can benefit from strategic
   behavior even more, under broader conditions, and in a Pareto-improving
   way. Finally, we also analyze combined designs, which utilize a
   combination of quantity and/or spending requirements, and show how they
   can be used to better manage the transition toward spending-based
   designs, possibly minimizing negative consumer reactions.

AB We show that recent prominent equity factor models are to a large degree
   compatible with the Intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM) framework. Factors
   associated with alternative profitability measures forecast the equity
   premium in a way that is consistent with the ICAPM. Several factors
   based on firms' asset growth predict a significant decline in stock
   market volatility, thus being consistent with their positive prices of
   risk. The investment-based factors are also strong predictors of an
   improvement in future economic activity. The time-series predictive
   ability of most equity state variables is not subsumed by traditional
   ICAPM state variables. Importantly, factors that earn larger risk prices
   tend to be associated with state variables that are more correlated with
   future investment opportunities or economic activity. Moreover, these
   risk price estimates can be reconciled with plausible risk-aversion
   parameter estimates. Overall, the ICAPM can be used as a common
   theoretical background for recent multifactor models.

AB I study a continuous-time principal-agent model in which a multitasking
   agent engages in unobserved risk-taking. Risk-taking creates short-term
   profits but also increases the chance of large losses. The optimal
   contract incentivizes excessive risk-taking when the agent has
   insufficient skin in the game. Moreover, if the low effort is not too
   value-destroying and the private benefit of shirking is low enough, the
   principal can eliminate risk-taking by implementing the low effort.
   However, with variable project scale, addressing the risk-taking
   incentives by downsizing projects is not optimal. The implementation of
   the optimal contract shows that risk management should take agency
   problems into account. Complete hedging against downside risks provides
   incentives for the agent to gamble.

AB Agents' decisions to exert effort depend on the incentives and the
   potential costs involved. So far, most of the attention has been on the
   incentive side. However, our laboratory experiments underline that both
   the incentive and the cost side can be used separately to shape work
   performance. In our experiment, subjects work on a real-effort slider
   task. Between treatments, we vary the incentive scheme used for
   compensating workers. Additionally, by varying the available outside
   options, we explore the role of implicit costs of effort in determining
   workers' performance. We observe that incentive contracts and implicit
   costs interact in a nontrivial manner. In general, performance decreases
   as implicit costs increase. Yet the magnitude of the reaction differs
   across incentive schemes and across the offered outside options, which,
   in turn, alters estimated output elasticities. In addition, comparisons
   between incentive schemes crucially depend on the implicit costs.

   However, dealers cut back on liquidity provision as they suffer losses,
   mispricing becomes wider, or the funding situation worsens, consistent

   show that the unwinding of basis arbitrage trading can amplify
   mispricing by documenting that bond returns following the Lehman

   activity and for bonds underwritten by Lehman Brothers. Liquidity demand

AB Emergency care necessitates adequate and timely treatment, which has
   unfortunately been compromised by crowding in many emergency departments
   (EDs). To address this issue, we study patient scheduling in EDs so that
   mandatory targets imposed on each patient's door-to-provider time and
   length of stay can be collectively met with the largest probability.
   Exploiting patient flow data from the ED, we propose a hybrid
   robustst-ochastic approach to formulating the patient scheduling
   problem, which allows for practical features, such as a time-varying
   patient arrival process, general consultation time distributions, and
   multiple heterogeneous physicians. In contrast to the conventional
   formulation of maximizing the joint probability of target attainment,
   which is computationally excruciating, the hybrid approach provides a
   computationally amiable formulation that yields satisfactory solutions
   to the patient scheduling problem. This formulation enables us to
   develop a dynamic scheduling algorithm for making recommendations about
   the next patient to be seen by each available physician. In numerical
   experiments, the proposed hybrid approach outperforms both the sample
   average approximation method and an asymptotically optimal scheduling
   policy.

   use of both futures and forecasts, instead of using only forecasts,
   generates expected spot curves that do not differ considerably in the
   short/medium term, but long term estimations are significantly
   different. The inclusion of analysts' forecasts in addition to futures,
   instead of only futures prices, does not alter significantly the
   short/medium part of the futures curve but does have a significant
   effect on long-term futures estimations.

AB This paper investigates the extent to which index membership affects
   small firm financing. Using a regression discontinuity specification
   around the lower cutoff of the Russell 2000 small-cap index, we find
   that index membership causes small firms to transition away from bank
   financing in favor of seasoned equity offerings. These effects are
   concentrated in the year following Russell 2000 additions and do not
   reverse immediately upon deletions. Liquidity, the elasticity of demand
   for equity, and analyst coverage also significantly increase following
   Russell 2000 additions but do not significantly decrease following
   deletions. Finally, firms added to the Russell 2000 obtain lower spreads
   and have fewer covenants on the bank loans that they do initiate. Our
   findings are consistent with index membership mitigating the financing
   frictions of small firms by improving their information environment
   through increased investor awareness.

AB An affine no-arbitrage asset pricing framework is developed that allows
   for agents to have rational but heterogeneous expectations. The
   framework can match both bond yields and the observed dispersion of
   yield expectations in survey data. Heterogeneous information introduces
   a speculative component in bond prices that is (i) statistically
   distinct from classical components such as risk premia and expectations
   about future short rates and (ii) quantitatively important, at times
   accounting for up to 125 basis points of U.S. yields. Allowing for
   heterogeneous expectations also changes the estimated relative
   importance of risk premia and expectations about future short rates in
   historical bond yields compared to a standard affine model. The
   framework imposes weaker restrictions than existing heterogeneous
   information asset pricing models and is thus well suited to empirically
   quantify the importance of relaxing the common information assumption.

AB Several of the auction-driven exchanges that facilitate programmatic
   buying of internet display advertising have recently introduced "soft
   floors" in addition to standard reserve prices (called "hard floors" in
   the industry). A soft floor is a bid level below which a winning bidder
   pays his own bid instead of paying the second-highest bid as in a
   second-price auction most ad exchanges use by default. This paper
   characterizes soft floors' revenue-generating potential as a function of
   the distribution of bidder independent private values. When bidders are
   symmetric (identically distributed), soft floors have no effect on
   revenue, because a symmetric equilibrium always exists in strictly
   monotonic bidding strategies, and standard revenue-equivalence arguments
   thus apply. The industry often motivates soft floors as tools for
   extracting additional expected revenue from an occasional high bidder,
   for example a bidder retargeting the consumer making the impression.
   Such asymmetries in the distribution of bidder preferences do not
   automatically make soft floors profitable. This paper presents two
   examples of tractable modeling assumptions about such occasional high
   bidders, with one example implying low soft floors always hurt revenues
   because of strategic bid-shading by the regular bidders, and the other
   example implying high soft floors can increase revenues by making the
   regular bidders bid more aggressively.

AB We study a model in which a monopoly firm designs the quality profile of
   its inventory and then dynamically updates its pricing menu for a finite
   selling horizon to maximize revenue. In a counterfactual scenario, a
   social planner goes through the same process to maximize total welfare.
   We show that in both scenarios the problem of dynamically pricing
   heterogeneous-quality (vertically differentiated) inventories is
   equivalent to that of dynamically pricing homogeneous-quality
   inventories, in the sense that a solution to one implies a solution to
   the other. Moreover, we prove a strong scarcity result, which suggests
   that the sale of a product drives up the prices on all remaining
   products, whether of higher or lower quality. We then consider product
   line design under a production technology that utilizes costly and
   potentially limited resources. We show that with unlimited (but costly)
   resources, the revenue maximizer undersupplies quality to all products
   compared with the social planner. With limited resources, we show that
   the revenue maximizer exhibits elitism: he overallocates
   (underallocates) resources on the production of high-quality
   (low-quality) products. However, as the volume of expected consumer
   arrivals increases to infinity, both the revenue maximizer and the
   welfare maximizer allocate resources equally across products.

AB We propose a Bayesian framework for assessing the relative strengths of
   data-driven ambiguity sets in distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
   when the underlying distribution is defined by a finite-dimensional
   parameter. The key idea is to measure the relative size between a
   candidate ambiguity set and a specific asymptotically optimal set. As
   the amount of data grows large, this asymptotically optimal set is the
   smallest convex ambiguity set that satisfies a novel Bayesian robustness
   guarantee that we introduce. This guarantee is defined with respect to a
   given class of constraints and is a Bayesian analog of more common
   frequentist feasibility guarantees from the DRO literature. Using this
   framework, we prove that many popular existing ambiguity sets are
   significantly larger than the asymptotically optimal set for constraints
   that are concave in the ambiguity. By contrast, we construct new
   ambiguity sets that are tractable, satisfy our Bayesian robustness
   guarantee, and are at most a small, constant factor larger than the
   asymptotically optimal set; we call these sets Bayesian near optimal. We
   further prove that asymptotically, solutions to DRO models with our
   Bayesian near-optimal sets enjoy strong frequentist robustness
   properties, despite their smaller size. Finally, our framework yields
   guidelines for practitioners selecting between competing ambiguity set
   proposals in DRO. Computational evidence in portfolio allocation using
   real and simulated data confirms that our framework, although motivated
   by asymptotic analysis in a Bayesian setting, provides practical insight
   into the performance of various DRO models with finite data under
   frequentist assumptions.

AB One of the central issues in auction design is how much information
   should be disclosed to bidders. In this paper, we examine bidder's
   identity disclosure in sequential business-to-business (B2B) auctions.
   Specifically, we compare two information disclosure policies, one that
   publicly discloses winners' identities (the status quo) and an
   alternative policy that conceals winners' identities. Using a
   large-scale field experiment in the Dutch flower auction market, we find
   that concealing winners' identities can significantly increase the
   average winning price and thereby raise the seller's revenue. We further
   explore the underlying mechanism that drives the observed effect. The
   empirical analysis of bidding behavior in these auctions suggests that
   bidders tend to imitate some of their competitors who have won in
   previous rounds of auctions and shade their bids accordingly. Concealing
   winners' identities can disrupt such imitation heuristic, which in turn
   mitigates the price-declining trend in sequential rounds. Our findings
   have important implications for the design of information disclosure
   policies in B2B auction markets.

AB Motivated by the increasing use of online appointment booking platforms,
   we study how to offer appointment slots to customers to maximize the
   total number of slots booked. We develop two models, nonsequential
   offering and sequential offering, to capture different types of
   interactions between customers and the scheduling system. In these two
   models, the scheduler offers either a single set of appointment slots
   for the arriving customer to choose from or multiple sets in sequence,
   respectively. For the nonsequential model, we identify a static
   randomized policy, which is asymptotically optimal when the system
   demand and capacity increase simultaneously, and we further show that
   offering all available slots at all times has a constant factor of two
   performance guarantee. For the sequential model, we derive a closed form
   optimal policy for a large class of instances and develop a simple,
   effective heuristic for those instances without an explicit optimal
   policy. By comparing these two models, our study generates useful
   operational insights for improving the current appointment booking
   processes. In particular, our analysis reveals an interesting
   equivalence between the sequential offering model and the nonsequential
   offering model with perfect customer preference information. This
   equivalence allows us to apply sequential offering in a wide range of
   interactive scheduling contexts. Our extensive numerical study shows
   that sequential offering can significantly improve the slot fill rate
   (6%-8% on average and up to 18% in our testing cases) compared with
   nonsequential offering. Given the recent and ongoing growth of online
   and mobile appointment booking platforms, our research findings can be
   particularly useful to inform user interface design of these booking
   platforms.

AB The disclosure of compensation peer groups is argued to provide
   shareholders with valuable information that can be used to scrutinize
   chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. However, research suggests
   that there are substantial incentives for executives and directors to
   bias the compensation peer group upward such that the CEO can extract
   additional rent. We leverage the idea that reciprocated peer nominations
   are unlikely to be biased to construct counterfactual peer groups that
   allow us to measure the bias of disclosed peer groups. Analyses of 11
   years of comprehensive data on compensation peer groups demonstrate that
   the average firm uses an upwardly biased peer group. The size of the
   bias increases when incentives and opportunities to do so are more
   pronounced. Specifically, results show that bias is larger when
   financial targets are not met and when exercising discretion in the
   selection of peer firms is justifiable. More importantly, upward bias in
   compensation peer groups is highly predictive of an increase in CEO
   compensation, suggesting that there is a strong incentive for CEOs to
   strategically select peers. Finally, although average peer group bias
   has gone down in recent years, the predictive effect of bias on pay has
   gone up. These findings call into question the practical impact of
   recent efforts to introduce greater transparency into the process for
   determining executive compensation.

   how violations of rational choice theory will depend on frames. An

AB Group testing (i.e., testing multiple subjects simultaneously with a

   accuracy-, efficiency- and equity-based objectives, and characterize
   important structural properties of optimal testing designs. These
   properties allow us to model the testing design problems as partitioning
   problems, develop efficient algorithms, and derive insights on equity
   versus accuracy trade-off. One of our models reduces to a constrained
   shortest path problem, for a special case of which we develop a
   polynomial-time algorithm. We also show that determining an optimal

   tests is tractable, resolving an open conjecture. We demonstrate the

AB Performance measurement systems (PMSs) are used to diagnose and
   remediate problems, termed the "decision-facilitating" or feedback role
   of management control. We examine whether use of PMSs by individual
   decision makers is associated with better performance. Experimental
   studies have isolated individual-level effects of feedback on decision
   quality; however, it is difficult to extend these findings to natural
   settings. Archival and survey studies offer evidence on the association
   between the presence of PMSs and performance but have had limited
   success in measuring decision makers' actual use of PMSs and addressing
   endogeneity of the decision to use PMSs. We use unobtrusively collected
   data on actual PMS use in 30 K-12 charter schools over three years to
   test whether teachers who make greater use of two PMSs are associated
   with greater growth in student learning. We find that teachers' use of
   PMSs is associated with increased student learning, consistent with the
   premise that PMSs facilitate teacher interventions and improve student
   outcomes. The results are both statistically and materially significant,
   and they are better explained by PMS use than by selection effects of
   better teachers using PMSs. Consistent with the organization's focus on
   "at-risk" students, the strongest effects of teachers' use of one PMS
   are concentrated among the lowest-performing students. In sum, we find
   broad support for the thesis that the feedback role of PMSs is
   associated with meaningful performance improvement.

   premiums. The estimates reveal a dynamic two-way relationship between

AB The value added by an active investor is traditionally measured using
   alpha, tracking error, and the information ratio. However, these
   measures do not characterize the dynamic component of investor activity,
   nor do they consider the time horizons over which weights are changed.
   In this paper, we propose a technique to measure the value of active
   investment that captures both the static and dynamic contributions of an
   investment process. This dynamic alpha is based on the decomposition of
   a portfolio's expected return into its frequency components using
   spectral analysis. The result is a static component that measures the
   portion of a portfolio's expected return resulting from passive
   investments and security selection and a dynamic component that captures
   the manager's timing ability across a range of time horizons. Our
   framework can be universally applied to any portfolio and is a useful
   method for comparing the forecast power of different investment
   processes. Several analytical and empirical examples are provided to
   illustrate the practical relevance of this decomposition.

AB This paper presents an industry equilibrium model where firms have a
   choice to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. We
   model CSR as an investment to increase product differentiation that
   allows firms to benefit from higher profit margins. The model predicts
   that CSR decreases systematic risk and increases firm value and that
   these effects are stronger for firms with high product differentiation.
   We find supporting evidence for our predictions. We address a potential
   endogeneity problem by instrumenting CSR using data on the political
   affiliation of the firm's home state.

AB Milton Friedman famously suggested that firms ought not divert profits
   toward public goods because shareholders can better make these
   contributions themselves. Despite this, activist shareholders are
   increasingly successful in persuading firms to be "socially
   responsible." We study firm behavior when shareholders care about public
   goods as well as profits and when managerial contracts reflect these
   concerns. Under these ideal conditions, managers redirect more profits
   toward public goods than shareholders would when acting
   separately-shareholders are poorer but happier. Further, so long as the
   public good is sufficiently desirable, the manager selects the socially
   optimal level of output, despite the mismatch between shareholder
   preferences and those of society at large.

   an exemption provided to a group of firms based on their public float.
   We find that the regulation increased the level of CEO pay and the
   fraction of performance-linked pay in the companies that had to comply
   with the new rule. This increase was larger for CEOs with higher
   ownership and longer tenure. Moreover, the market reacted negatively to
   the exemption from the Say-on-Pay rule suggesting general support for

AB We find that student debt is negatively related to the propensity to
   start a firm, particularly larger and more successful ventures. An
   exogenous change due to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, which
   made student debt completely nondischargeable through personal
   bankruptcy, reduced the likelihood of entrepreneurship by student loan
   borrowers that were already in four-year college at the time of this
   regulation. Moreover, an exogenous shock to the level of student debt
   due to the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 negatively impacts
   entrepreneurship rates for students already in four-year college at the
   time of this regulation. Entrepreneurs with more student debt are more
   likely to fall behind on their student debt payments, and this relation
   is mitigated when their ventures are successful. Our evidence indicates
   that student debt inhibits entrepreneurship by exacerbating the effect
   of negative business outcomes on the individual.

AB The patching approach to security in the software industry has been less
   effective than desired. One critical issue with the status quo is that
   the endowment of "patching rights" (the ability for a user to choose
   whether security updates are applied) lacks the incentive structure to
   induce better security-related decisions. However, producers can
   differentiate their products based on the provision of patching rights.
   By characterizing the price for these rights, the optimal discount
   provided to those who relinquish rights and have their systems
   automatically updated in a timely manner, and the consumption and
   protection strategies taken by users in equilibrium as they
   strategically interact because of the security externality associated
   with product vulnerabilities, it is shown that the optimal pricing of
   these rights can segment the market in a manner that leads to both
   greater security and greater profitability. This policy greatly reduces
   unpatched populations and has a relative hike in profitability that is
   increasing in the extent to which patches are bundled together. Social
   welfare may decrease when automated patching costs are small because
   strategic pricing contracts usage in the market and also incentivizes
   loss-inefficient choices. However, welfare benefits when the policy
   either (1) greatly expands automatic updating in cases in which it is
   minimally observed or (2) significantly reduces the patching process
   burden of those who most value the software.

AB Classical queueing theory has typically focused on customers, and server
   availability has been taken for granted. However, data accessibility and
   the emergence of complex service systems, for example, call centers,
   revealed the need to stochastically model the complex behavior of
   servers. In this work, we propose a new model that accommodates such
   behavior; we call it Erlang-S, where "S" stands for servers. Our model
   assumes a pool of present servers, some of whom are available to serve
   customers from the queue while others are not, and the process of
   becoming available or unavailable is modeled explicitly. Our focus here
   is on applying the model to real systems, specifically call centers.
   Estimating the parameters of the new model from call-center data is
   challenging because reality is observed discretely in time as opposed to
   its continuous evolution. We therefore use an expectation-maximization
   algorithm that computes the expected number of relevant quantities given
   the discrete-time data. Erlang-S differs from the Erlang-A model, which
   has been commonly used for modeling call centers: the latter model
   assumes that all agents who are present are, in fact, available for
   service. When comparing predictions of the two models against
   call-center data, we find that Erlang-A generally overestimates queue
   length and consequently also the fraction of abandonment, and Erlang-S
   predicts reality more closely and usefully. Our conclusion is that it is
   important to model explicitly server dynamics to obtain accurate and
   valuable models of complex service systems.

AB We introduce a new class of adaptive policies called periodic-affine
   policies, which allows a decision maker to optimally manage and control
   large-scale newsvendor networks in the presence of uncertain demand
   without distributional assumptions. These policies are data-driven and
   model many features of the demand such as correlation and remain robust
   to parameter misspecification. We present a model that can be
   generalized to multiproduct settings and extended to multiperiod
   problems. This is accomplished by modeling the uncertain demand via
   sets. In this way, it offers a natural framework to study competing
   policies such as base-stock, affine, and approximative approaches with
   respect to their profit, sensitivity to parameters and assumptions, and
   computational scalability. We show that the periodic-affine policies are
   sustainable-that is, time consistent-because they warrant optimality
   both within subperiods and over the entire planning horizon. This
   approach is tractable and free of distributional assumptions, and,
   hence, suited for real-world applications. We provide efficient
   algorithms to obtain the optimal periodic-affine policies and
   demonstrate their advantages on the sales data from one of India's
   largest pharmacy retailers.

AB We analyze the optimal allocation of trades to portfolios when the cost
   associated with an allocation is proportional to each portfolio's risk.
   Our investigation is motivated by changes in the over-the-counter
   derivatives markets, under which some contracts may be traded
   bilaterally or through central counterparties, splitting a set of trades
   into two or more portfolios. A derivatives dealer faces risk-based
   collateral and capital costs for each portfolio, and it seeks to
   minimize total margin requirements through its allocation of trades to
   portfolios. When margin requirements are submodular, the problem becomes
   a submodular intersection problem. Its dual provides per-trade margin
   attributions, and assigning trades to portfolios based on the lowest
   attributed costs yields an optimal allocation. As part of this
   investigation, we derive conditions under which standard deviation and
   other risk measures are submodular functions of sets of trades. We
   compare systemwide optimality with individually optimal allocations in a
   market with multiple dealers.

   Following the preemption ruling, national banks significantly increased
   their origination of loans with prepayment penalties relative to
   national banks in states without anti-predatory-lending laws. We
   highlight a competition channel: in counties where OCC-regulated lenders
   had larger market shares, non-OCC-regulated lenders responded by
   increasing their supply of contracts with riskier features, such as
   deferred amortization, which were not restricted by the state
   anti-predatory-lending law. Non-OCC lenders were able to lure borrowers

AB We investigate heterogeneous customer choice behavior in the presence of
   main products-ancillary services with options of pay-per-use and
   subscription-and outside option. The willingness to pay for a service
   subscription is derived as a dosed-form expression, which enables us to
   characterize the optimal pricing strategy and the impact of service
   subscriptions on customer surplus. Analytical results and numerical
   experiments show that offering service subscriptions may result in
   "win-win," "win-win-win," "win-win-lose," or "lose-lose-win" scenarios
   or in other situations for the firm, competitors, and customers in a
   variety of monopolistic and duopolistic scenarios. The advantages of
   service subscription still remain with heterogeneous customers differing
   on multiple dimensions including the nominal utility, uncertainty in the
   need of ancillary service, and purchase frequency. We find that if the
   product quality for both firms, measured by nominal utility, is not
   significantly different, more fierce price competition by offering a
   service subscription may result in a higher customer surplus, compared
   with that without a service subscription. Ancillary service subscription
   can help firms to better price-discriminate heterogeneous customers
   through different subscription decisions and subsequent purchase
   behavior.

AB Rather than organizing disposal of consumer-generated waste themselves,
   many states and countries have passed legislation that makes producers
   responsible for the proper disposal (i.e., recycling) of the products
   that they bring to the market. We study the stability of producers'
   strategies emerging under such legislation. In our paper, the producers
   compete with multiple differentiated products in consumer markets but
   may consider cooperating when recycling those products to benefit from
   economies of scale. Products made by different producers or sold in
   different markets might still be considered for joint recycling. Our
   main questions are when and whether firm-based recycling strategies
   (i.e., separately recycling products falling under same brand) or
   market-based recycling strategies (i.e., separately recycling products
   falling in the same product category) emerge as stable outcomes. To that
   end, we analyze a series of simple producer-market configurations. We
   first look at an asymmetric market model with two producers making three
   products in two markets, and then, we look at a symmetric market model
   with two producers competing with four products in two markets. Our
   results show that, with intense market competition and differentiated
   market sizes, producers may recycle their products on their own without
   cooperating with others. In some instances, they can add a product from
   their competitor to their recycling mix. Because these outcomes are
   never socially optimal, they may reduce social welfare and require
   government intervention. Otherwise, with less intense competition or
   more equitable market shares, all-inclusive (market-based) recycling is
   the most common stable outcome with high (low) scale economies, and the
   firms' independent choices might lead to social optima.

AB We consider a decentralized supply chain consisting of a retailer and a
   supplier that serves forward-looking consumers in two periods. In each
   period, the supplier and the retailer dynamically set the wholesale and
   retail price to maximize their own profits. The consumers are
   heterogeneous in their evaluations of the product and are strategic in
   deciding whether and when to buy the product, choosing the option that
   maximizes their utility, including waiting for a price markdown. We
   derive the equilibrium and study the value of price and quantity
   commitments from both the retailer's and the supplier's perspectives. We
   find that, although a centralized system always benefits from making
   price and quantity commitments, this is not true for a firm in a
   decentralized supply chain due to how the other firm responds to these
   commitments. We show that the retailer suffers from making a price or
   quantity commitment and that, similarly, the supplier does not benefit
   from making a price commitment. In these cases, commitments can harm not
   only the firm itself but also profitability of the other firm in the
   supply chain, thereby disadvantaging the entire supply chain. This
   happens because such commitments aggravate double-marginalization
   inefficiency in the supply chain. Furthermore, we show that eliminating
   this inefficiency through a coordinating contract (e.g., a two-part
   tariff or quantity discount) makes commitments beneficial.

AB We study the contagious switching behavior related to a consumer's
   choice of wireless carriers, that is, that a consumer is more likely to
   switch wireless carriers if more of their contacts from the same carrier
   have switched. Contagious switching (or a positive network effect) can
   be driven by information-based social learning, as well as other
   mechanisms related to network size. Although previous marketing
   literature has documented the social-learning effect, most of the
   applications studied involve products in which consumers usually do not
   enjoy any direct benefits from a large network other than from
   information-based social learning. We explore the importance of the
   social-learning effect relative to other mechanisms that may also lead
   to the network effect. We propose a dynamic structural model with
   interpersonal interactions. To model the social-learning effect, a
   consumer uses feedback from his or her contacts who have switched from a
   focal carrier to update his or her quality expectations of alternative
   carriers. Our model further accounts for two unique aspects of consumer
   strategic learning: (i) the individual's perception on the signal of
   alternative carriers from contacts who switch is systematically
   different according to whether the signal comes from a loyal contact;
   and (ii) that the perceived noisiness of the signal on alternative
   carriers from a contact who has switched depends on the strength of the
   relationship between the individual and the contact. The remaining
   network effect not captured through social learning is modeled as a
   function of the size of the network. We solve the model with a two-step
   dynamic programming algorithm, with the assumption that a consumer is
   forward-looking and decides whether to stay with the same service
   carrier in each period by maximizing the total utility received from
   that day onward. We apply the proposed model to the data set of a mobile
   network operator in a European country. We find that churning/switching
   behavior is contagious in the network context and that one-third of
   general network effects can be attributed to social learning. We also
   detect strategic learning by consumers from their contacts in two ways:
   the experience signal on alternative carriers from a more loyal contact
   who has switched from the focal carrier is perceived to be more positive
   than that from a less loyal contact; and the social-learning effect is
   stronger from an individual's closest contacts. The simulation analysis
   demonstrates the value of our model in helping a company prioritize its
   customer relationship management effort.

   and more aggressively take profits from appreciated stock option awards.
   Legal sanctions against individual managers are infrequent, with

AB In a paper published in Management Science in 2015, Stewart, Reimers,
   and Harris (SRH) demonstrated that shapes of utility and probability
   weighting functions could be manipulated by adjusting the distributions
   of outcomes and probabilities on offer as predicted by the theory of
   decision by sampling. So marked were these effects that, at face value,
   they profoundly challenge standard interpretations of preference
   theoretic models in which such functions are supposed to reflect stable
   properties of individual risk preferences. Motivated by this challenge,
   we report an extensive replication exercise based on a series of
   experiments conducted as a quasi-adversarial collaboration across
   different labs and involving researchers from both economics and
   psychology. We replicate the SRH effect across multiple experiments
   involving changes in many design features; importantly, however, we find
   that the effect is also present in designs modified so that decision by
   sampling predicts no effect. Although those results depend on
   model-based inferences, an alternative analysis using a model-free
   comparison approach finds no evidence of patterns akin to the SRH
   effect. On the basis of simulation exercises, we demonstrate that the
   SRH effect may be a consequence of misspecifkation biases arising in
   parameter recovery exercises that fit imperfectly specified choice
   models to experimental data. Overall, our analysis casts the SRH effect
   in an entirely new light.

AB Data-analytics technology can accelerate the innovation process by
   enabling existing knowledge to be identified, accessed, combined, and
   deployed to address new problem domains. However, like prior advances in
   information technology, the ability of firms to exploit these
   opportunities depends on a variety of complementary human capital and
   organizational capabilities. We focus on whether analytics is more
   valuable in firms where innovation within a firm has decentralized
   groups of inventors or centralized ones. Our analysis draws on prior
   work measuring firm-analytics capability using detailed employee-level
   data and matches these data to metrics on intrafirm inventor networks
   that reveal whether a firm's innovation structure is centralized or
   decentralized. In a panel of 1,864 publicly traded firms from the years
   1988-2013, we find that firms with a decentralized innovation structure
   have a greater demand for analytics skills and receive greater
   productivity benefits from their analytics capabilities, consistent with
   a complementarity between analytics and decentralized innovation. We
   also find that analytics helps decentralized structures to create new
   combinations and reuse of existing technologies, consistent with the
   ability of analytics to link knowledge across diverse domains and to
   integrate external knowledge into the firm. Furthermore, the effect
   primarily comes from the analytics capabilities of the noninventor
   employees as opposed to inventors themselves. These results show that
   the benefit of analytics on innovation depends on existing
   organizational structures. Similar to the IT-productivity paradox, these
   results can help explain a contemporary analytics-innovation paradox-the
   apparent slowdown in innovation despite the recent increase in analytics
   investments.

AB In this study, we examine whether imposing a penalty based on an earlier
   positive signal and a bad realized outcome can be welfare-improving. We
   find that imposing a penalty helps to improve investment efficiency, but
   it also brings a deadweight cost of potential penalty for entrepreneurs
   with good projects. We show that when a good project has a much larger
   chance to achieve a good outcome than a bad project or when a large
   proportion of the penalty can be reimbursed to the investor, it is
   optimal to impose a penalty to deter entrepreneurs with bad projects
   from reporting positive signals to the greatest degree, as the benefit
   from reducing the investment inefficiency outweighs the expected
   deadweight cost. Otherwise, it is optimal not to impose any penalty. We
   also find that a larger penalty may induce more manipulation by a good
   entrepreneur. This is because, although a larger penalty directly
   discourages manipulation for both good and bad types by increasing the
   expected penalty cost, it also encourages upward manipulation by
   lowering the implicit financing cost upon a high signal. The encouraging
   effect is mostly pronounced for the good entrepreneur when the good
   entrepreneur has a much larger chance of success than the bad
   entrepreneur or when the reimbursement proportion is very high.

AB This paper studies the role of institutional investors in influencing

   analyzing the relation between institutional ownership and toxic release
   from facilities to which institutions are geographically proximate. We
   develop a local preference hypothesis based on the delegated
   philanthropy and transaction-costs theories. Consistent with the
   hypothesis, local institutional ownership is negatively related to
   facility toxic release. The negative relation is stronger for local
   socially responsible investing (SRI) funds, local public pension funds,
   and local dedicated institutions. We also find that the relation is more
   negative in communities that prefer more stringent environmental
   policies and in communities of greater collective cohesiveness. Local
   institutional ownership, particularly local ownerships by SRI funds and
   public pension funds, is positively related to the probability that an
   ESG proposal is either introduced or withdrawn. The paper sheds light on
   the drivers behind institutions' ESG engagement and their effectiveness
   in influencing ESG.

AB We propose a new predictor of U.S. real economic activity (REA)-namely,
   the representative investor's implied relative risk aversion (IRRA)
   extracted from S&P 500 option prices. IRRA is forward-looking and hence
   is expected to be related to future economic conditions. We document
   that U.S. IRRA predicts U.S. REA both in- and out-of-sample once we
   control for well-known REA predictors and take into account their
   persistence. An increase (decrease) in IRRA predicts a decrease
   (increase) in REA. We extend the empirical analysis by extracting IRRA
   from the South Korean, UK, Japanese, and German index option markets. We
   find that South Korea IRRA predicts the South Korea REA both in- and
   out-of-sample, as expected given the high liquidity of its index option
   market. We show that a parsimonious yet flexible production economy
   model calibrated to the U.S. economy can explain the documented negative
   relation between risk aversion and future economic growth.

   From the 1930s to the mid-1970s, the level of executive pay, inequality
   among executives across and within firms, and mobility were low. These
   patterns have reversed since then. I document that an increase in the
   importance of general managerial human capital can account for this
   change. The level of general skills, measured by the type of education
   and occupational mobility of managers, correlate with higher pay and
   turnover. Other factors may have also contributed to these changes, but

AB We study a multiperiod dynamic pricing problem with contextual
   information, where the seller uses a misspecified demand model. The
   seller sequentially observes past demand, updates model parameters, and
   then chooses the price for the next period based on time-varying
   features. We show that model misspecification leads to a correlation
   between price and prediction error of demand per period, which, in turn,
   leads to inconsistent price elasticity estimates and hence suboptimal
   pricing decisions. We propose a "random price shock" (RPS) algorithm
   that dynamically generates randomized price shocks to estimate price
   elasticity, while maximizing revenue. We show that the RPS algorithm has
   strong theoretical performance guarantees, that it is robust to model
   misspecification, and that it can be adapted to a number of business
   settings, including (1) when the feasible price set is a price ladder
   and (2) when the contextual information is not IID. We also perform
   offline simulations to gauge the performance of RPS on a large fashion
   retail data set and find that is expected to earn 8%-20% more revenue on
   average than competing algorithms that do not account for price
   endogeneity.

   reduce the risk of financial distress. However, empirical support for
   these theories is mixed. Our paper addresses the "why" by directly
   asking the managers that make risk management decisions. Our results
   suggest that personal risk aversion in combination with other executive
   traits plays a key role in hedging. Our analysis also indicates that
   risk-averse executives are more likely to rely on (more conservative)
   fat-tailed distributions to estimate risk exposure. While most theories
   of risk management ignore the human dimension, our results suggest that

AB Rapid improvements in the precision of mobile technologies now make it
   possible for advertisers to go beyond real-time static location and
   contextual information on consumers. In this paper we propose a novel
   "trajectory-based" targeting strategy for mobile recommendation that
   leverages detailed information on consumers' physical-movement
   trajectories using fine-grained behavioral information from different
   mobility dimensions. To analyze the effectiveness of this new strategy,
   we designed a large-scale randomized field experiment in a large
   shopping mall that involved 83,370 unique user responses for a 14-day
   period in June 2014. We found that trajectory-based mobile targeting
   can, as compared with other baselines, lead to higher redemption
   probability, faster redemption behavior, and higher transaction amounts.
   It can also facilitate higher revenues for the focal store as well as
   the overall shopping mall. Moreover, the effect of trajectory-based
   targeting comes not only from improvements in the efficiency of
   customers' current shopping processes but also from its ability to nudge
   customers toward changing their future shopping patterns and, thereby,
   generate additional revenues. Finally, we found significant
   heterogeneity in the impact of trajectory-based targeting. It is
   especially effective in influencing high-income consumers.
   Interestingly, however, it becomes less effective in boosting the
   revenues of the shopping mall during the weekends and for those shoppers
   who like to explore across products categories. Our overall findings
   suggest that highly targeted mobile promotions can have the inadvertent
   impact of reducing impulse-purchasing behavior by customers who are in
   an exploratory shopping stage. On a broader note, our work can be viewed
   as a first step toward the study of large-scale, fine-grained digital
   traces of individual physical behavior and how they can be used to
   predict and market according to individuals anticipated future behavior.

AB People vary in what they view as a fair distribution of earnings in
   organizations and, more generally, society. Where do these different
   views originate? We study the question of whether the experience of
   failure or success in a winner-take-most competition shapes people's
   perspectives about distributive justice. In a laboratory experiment,
   subjects generated a high or low income either through a lottery or
   through a performance-based tournament. A subset of subjects could then
   redistribute the income of another subset of subjects. We find that the
   tournament losers redistribute significantly more than all of the other
   distributors when the inequality is generated by the tournament, whereas
   the lottery losers redistribute significantly more than all of the other
   distributors when the inequality is generated by the lottery. The effect
   still holds when controlling for potential self-selection into different
   outcomes of the tournament. We replicate the results in a second
   experiment and show that the underlying psychological mechanisms include
   an in-group bias and a self-serving bias in responsibility attribution.
   These findings have implications for the design of compensation schemes
   in organizations and for public policies in general.

   the well-known phenomenon that "long chain is almost as good as the
   fully flexible network": for given target fill rates, the required
   capacity level in a long-chain network is close to that in a fully
   flexible network and is much lower than a dedicated system. We apply
   these insights and techniques on problems arising in the design of
   last-mile delivery operations and in semiconductor production planning,
   using real data from two companies.

AB When complex procurement projects are conducted, it is often not
   possible to write complete contracts. As a consequence, the relationship
   between buyer and supplier is important for the success of the project.
   In this paper we investigate the claim that auctions in procurement can
   be detrimental for the buyer supplier relationship, which is in line
   with the observation that reverse auctions are less frequently conducted
   if projects are complex. A poor relationship can result in a decrease in
   trust on the part of the buyer during the sourcing process and an
   increase in the supplier's opportunistic behavior following sourcing. We
   consider a setting in which the winning supplier decides on the level of
   quality to provide to the buyer, and we compare a standard reverse
   auction and a buyer determined reverse auction, both analytically and in
   the laboratory. We find that the buyer-determined reverse auction can
   perform better than the standard reverse auction from both the buyer's
   and the suppliers perspective. In a buyer-determined reverse auction, it
   may be optimal for the buyer to select the supplier who submitted a
   higher bid, which may in turn induce this supplier to deliver higher
   quality. Standard auctions, however, yield lower prices but reduce
   cooperation. The degree of trust, as reflected by a larger number of
   transactions and a higher average efficiency of trade, is significantly
   higher in buyer-determined reverse auctions. Theoretical reasoning based
   on other-regarding preferences organizes our data well.

AB We study a firm's capacity choice under demand uncertainty given that it
   must finance this investment externally. Sharing profits with investors
   causes governance problems affecting both capacity and demand: the firm
   may "steal" capital, which reduces effective capacity, and "shirk" on
   market development, which reduces demand. We adopt an optimal
   contracting approach whereby the firm optimizes among feasible financial
   claims derived endogenously. We characterize its optimal financing and
   capacity choices. First, debt financing is optimal: it minimizes the
   incentives to both divert and shirk. Second, the firm underinvests
   (overinvests) if the effort problem is mild (severe) enough relative to
   the diversion problem. Thus, a worsening of the same governance problem
   can lead to over-or underinvestment depending on circumstances. Third,
   we find that the diversion and shirking problems interact in their
   impact on capacity investment. in particular, if the shirking problem is
   mild enough, the more severe the diversion problem, the less the firm
   invests. However, if the shirking problem is severe enough, the effect
   of diversion is reversed: the more severe the diversion problem, the
   more the firm invests.

AB We study the value of short-lived and experientially oriented pop-up
   stores, a popular type of omnichannel retail strategy, on both retailers
   that participate in pop-up store events and retailing platforms that
   host these retailers. We conduct a large-scale, randomized field
   experiment with Alibaba Group involving approximately 800,000 customers.
   We randomly assign customers to either receive a message about an
   upcoming weeklong pop-up store event organized by Alibaba's
   business-to-consumer platform (Tmall.com) or not receive any message
   about the event. We find that our message increased foot traffic to the
   pop-up store and in turn boosted expenditure at participating retailers'
   online stores at Tmall after the event ended. Furthermore, we use
   advanced Wi-Fi technology to track customers' visits to the pop-up store
   a missing component from past research that commonly relies on
   point-of-sale data. We find that pop-up store visits substantially
   increased customers' subsequent expenditure at participating retailers
   Tmall stores. In addition, from a platform perspective we show that
   pop-up store visits increased customers' purchases at retailers that
   sell related products on Tmall but did not participate in the pop-up
   store event. Additional analyses shed light on possible mechanisms
   underlying the cross-channel and spillover effects of pop-up stores and
   demonstrate that these effects were concentrated on prospective
   consumers.

AB Complementarity between performance pay and other organizational design
   elements has been argued to be one potential explanation for stark
   differences in the observed productivity gains from performance pay
   adoption. Using detailed data on internal organization for a nationally
   representative sample of firms, we empirically test for the existence of
   complementarity between performance pay incentives and decentralization
   of decision-making authority for tasks. To address endogeneity concerns,
   we exploit regional variation in income tax progressivity as an
   instrument for the adoption of performance pay. We find systematic
   evidence of complementarity between performance pay and decentralization
   of decision making from principals to employees. However, adopting
   performance pay also leads to centralization of decision-making
   authority from nonmanagerial to managerial employees. The findings
   suggest that performance pay adoption leads to a concentration of
   decision-making control at the managerial employee level, as opposed to
   a general movement toward more decentralization throughout the
   organization.

   Citizens make contributions to public goods of value to them. The amount

   franchisor-owned Applebee's stores in Texas being sold to franchisees as
   a source of exogenous variation. I first find evidence that both
   observable and unobservable location-level factors were important in

   understanding the dynamic effect of sales calls across heterogeneous
   physicians, we provide guidance on the design of optimal call patterns
   for route sales. The findings reveal that the long-term persistence
   effect of detailing is more pronounced for specialist physicians,
   whereas the contemporaneous marginal effect is higher for generalists.
   The paper also provides a key methodological insight to the marketing
   and economics literature. In the Nerlove-Arrow framework, moment
   conditions that are typically used in conventional dynamic panel data
   methods become vulnerable to serial correlation in the error structure.
   We discuss the associated biases and present a robust set of moment
   conditions for both lagged dependent and predetermined explanatory
   variables. Furthermore, we show that conventional tests to detect serial
   correlation have weak power, resulting in the misuse of moment
   conditions that leads to incorrect inference. Theoretical illustrations
   and Monte Carlo simulations are provided for validation.

AB We provide a new theory of ad valorem contracts (i.e., contracts that
   vary with the value of the transaction), which can explain why such
   contracts are widely used between vertically related parties (e.g., in
   franchising and licensing). Ad valorem contracts allow upstream firms
   (principals) to preserve their own incentives to make ongoing
   investments in the channel and deal with pricing distortions caused by
   channel coordination problems, while at the same time adjusting their
   investment on the basis of demand shocks that are only observed by the
   downstream firms (agents). We show that the optimal ad valorem contract
   allows the principal to achieve the same profits as if it could observe
   the demand shocks and control price. This optimal contract makes use of
   revenue sharing (to balance investment incentives and make the
   principal's investment responsive to demand through price), upfront
   fixed fees (to extract the agents' expected profit), and an additional
   term that depends nonlinearly on either price or demand (to correct for
   remaining pricing distortions). Our results are robust to the
   introduction of competition between agents, production costs, and
   imperfect monitoring of the agents' prices.

AB Firms are increasingly giving consumers the vote. Eight studies show
   that, when firms empower consumers to vote, consumers infer a series of
   implicit promises-even in the absence of explicit promises. We identify
   three implicit promises to which consumers react negatively when
   violated: representation (Experiments 1A-1C), consistency (Experiment
   2), and nonsuppression (Experiment 3). However, when firms honor these
   implicit promises, voting can mitigate the disappointment that arises
   from receiving an undesired outcome (Experiment 4). Finally, Experiment
   5 identifies one instance when suppressing the vote outcome is condoned:
   when voters believe that the process of voting has resulted in an
   unacceptable outcome. More generally, we show that procedural justice
   plays a key mediating role in determining the relative success or
   failure of various empowerment initiatives-from soliciting feedback to
   voting. Taken together, we offer insight into how firms can realize the
   benefits of empowerment strategies while mitigating their risks.

AB Our dynamic model of information technology (IT) outsourcing integrates
   incomplete contracts, moral hazard, and adverse selection under both
   perfect and, more realistically, bounded rationality. In addition to the
   classical profit-maximizing firm unconstrained by ethics, we model an
   ethically constrained (but otherwise profit-maximizing) firm that honors
   its contractual obligations irrespective of legal restraints. We prove
   that under bounded rationality, the ethically constrained firm can
   obtain strictly greater profits than the unconstrained profit-maximizing
   firm, even when (i) the unconstrained firm has access to a superset of
   the ethical firm's strategies and (ii) the ethical firm is unable to
   reveal its ethical commitment to its contracting partner anytime during
   the contractual relationship. Thus, a commitment to ethics, while of
   course being morally desirable, can lead to higher profits than the
   unbridled profit-maximization of classical economics. We also prove that
   ethics is foundational to both intellectual property (IP) sharing and
   reputation effects, two well-known facilitators of IT outsourcing. In
   fact, the mere possibility of ethical firms (a) forces across-the-board
   IP sharing even if it lowers profits and (b) induces even an ethically
   unconstrained firm to invest in developing a reputation for ethics. Our
   model provides a novel explanation, rooted in ethics, for why IT
   outsourcing is booming despite the formidable impediments of incomplete
   contracts, moral hazard, and adverse selection.

AB Bank lending standards vary over time. Periods in which firms find it
   relatively easy to borrow are followed by periods in which banks
   scrutinize borrowers more and tighten lending. We predict that changes
   in lending standards affect the accounting conservatism of
   bank-dependent firms. Using (i) a natural experiment that leads to
   certain banks tightening lending standards for plausibly exogenous
   reasons and (ii) time series variation in economy-wide bank lending
   standards, we find that borrowers increase their asymmetric timely loss
   recognition in response to the tightening of lending standards. Further,
   riskier borrowers, borrowers less likely to violate loan covenants, and
   borrowers whose banks tighten lending standards to a greater extent
   display larger increases in conservatism following the tightening of
   lending standards. These results suggest that borrowers internalize the
   costs and benefits of increasing conservatism. Finally, borrowers do not
   seem to decrease conservatism immediately after the lending standards
   are loosened. Overall, our results illuminate a commonly observed
   banking phenomenon that can influence firms' incentives to recognize
   losses, suggesting that developments in the banking sector can shape the
   information produced by firms in the real sector.

AB We analyze relational contracts between a principal and a set of
   risk-neutral agents whose outputs are correlated. When only the agents'
   aggregate output can be observed, a team incentive scheme is shown to be
   optimal, where each agent is paid a bonus for aggregate output above a
   threshold. We show that the efficiency of the team incentive scheme
   depends on the way in which the team members' outputs are correlated.
   The reason is that correlation affects the variance of total output and
   thus, the precision of the team's performance measure. Negatively
   correlated contributions reduce the variance of total output, and this
   improves incentives for each team member in the setting that we
   consider. This also has implications for optimal team size. If the team
   members' outputs are negatively correlated, more agents in the team can
   improve efficiency. We then consider the case where individual outputs
   are observable. A tournament scheme with a threshold is then optimal,
   where the threshold depends on an agent's relative performance. We show
   that correlation affects both the efficiency and design of the optimal
   tournament scheme.

AB Using transaction data from a sample of 1.8 million credit card
   accounts, we provide the first field test of a major prediction of
   Prelec and Loewenstein's theory of mental accounting: that consumers
   will pay off expenditure on transient forms of consumption more quickly
   than expenditure on durables. According to the theory, this is because
   the pain of paying can be offset by the future anticipated pleasure of
   consumption only when money is spent on consumption that endures over
   time. Consistent with this prediction, we found that repayment of debt
   incurred for nondurable goods is an absolute 10% more likely than
   repayment of debt incurred for durable goods. The strength of this
   relationship is comparable to an increment in 15 percentage points in
   the credit card annualized percentage rate. Our results have not only
   managerial implications for the structuring of financial transactions
   (e.g., that credit card customers should be given the option of paying
   off specific purchases) but also more general implications for
   exploiting variations in the pain of paying in incentive schemes aimed
   at customers and employees.

AB We analyze how relationship finance, such as venture capital and
   relationship lending, affects growth firms' capital structure choices.
   We show that relationship investors that obtain a strong bargaining
   position because of their privileged information about the firm
   optimally cash in on their dominance by pushing it to finance follow-up
   investments with equity. The firm underinvests if its owner refuses to
   accept the associated dilution. However, this problem is mitigated if
   the firm's initial relationship financing involves high leverage or
   offers initial investors preferential treatment in liquidation. By
   contrast, if initial investors are unlikely to gain a dominant position,
   firms optimally lever up only in later rounds. Our implications for
   relationship and venture capital financing highlight that the degree of
   investor dominance is of key importance for growth firms' capital
   structure decisions.

   markets. We find that a select group of analysts persistently issue
   price-correcting recommendation changes for stocks experiencing mutual
   fund flow-driven mispricing. Such recommendation changes are accompanied
   by little change to their concurrent earnings forecasts and appear to be
   driven by the superior research skill of these "mispricing-sensitive"
   analysts. Stocks receiving price-correcting recommendation changes
   experience less severe liquidity deterioration, more immediate price
   correction, and consequently smaller subsequent long-run return
   reversal. Our findings highlight analysts' unique role in facilitating
   liquidity provision and stabilizing capital markets during severe

   Furthermore, heterogeneous treatment effects are consistent with a

AB We provide the first large-sample evidence on the behavior and impact of
   nonpracticing entities (NPEs) in the intellectual property space. We
   find that, on average, NPEs appear to behave as opportunistic "patent
   trolls." NPEs sue cash-rich firms and target cash in business segments
   unrelated to alleged infringement at essentially the same frequency as
   they target cash in segments related to alleged infringement. By
   contrast, cash is neither a key driver of intellectual property lawsuits
   by practicing entities (e.g., IBM and Intel) nor of any other type of
   litigation against firms. We find further suggestive evidence of NPE
   opportunism: targeting of firms that have reduced ability to defend
   themselves, repeated assertions of lower-quality patents, increased
   assertion activity nearing patent expiration, and forum shopping. We
   find, moreover, that NPE litigation has a real negative impact on
   innovation at targeted firms: firms substantially reduce their
   innovative activity after settling with NPEs (or losing to them in
   court). Meanwhile, we neither find any markers of significant NPE
   pass-through to end innovators, nor of a positive impact of NPEs on
   innovation in the industries in which they are most prevalent.

AB This paper studies multitier supply chain networks in the presence of
   disruption risk. Firms decide how much to source from their upstream
   suppliers so as to maximize their expected profits, and prices of
   intermediate goods are set so that markets clear. We provide an explicit
   characterization of (expected) equilibrium profits, which allows us to
   derive insights into how the network structure-that is, the number of
   firms in each tier, production costs, and disruption risk-affect firms'
   profits. Furthermore, we establish that networks that maximize profits
   for firms that operate in different stages of the production
   process-that is, for upstream suppliers and downstream retailers-are
   structurally different. In particular, the latter have relatively less
   diversified downstream tiers and generate more variable output than the
   former. Finally, we consider supply chains that are formed endogenously.
   Specifically, we study a setting where firms decide whether to engage in
   production by considering their (expected) postentry profits. We argue
   that endogenous entry may lead to chains that are inefficient in terms
   of the number of firms that engage in production.

   risk change measures that capture managers' ex ante risk choices, we
   find that portfolio manager ownership reduces both intrayear and
   across-year risk-taking activities. The relationship between ownership
   and risk reduction is particularly strong among managers with high
   agency issue-induced risk-taking incentives-for example, managers who
   face a more convex flow-performance relationship, have poor past
   performance, or are not compensated based on long-term fund performance.
   Funds with greater managerial ownership are also associated with lower
   levels of total risk and downside risk. Overall, portfolio manager
   ownership serves as an incentive alignment mechanism and has important
   implications for mutual fund investors.

AB We consider a canonical revenue management (RM) problem wherein a
   monopolist seller posts prices for multiple products that are for sale
   over a fixed horizon so as to maximize expected revenues. Products are
   differentiated and subject to joint capacity constraints. Arriving
   customers are forward looking and strategize on the timing of their
   purchase, an empirically confirmed aspect of modern customer behavior.
   In the event that customers were myopic, foundational work has
   established that static prices are asymptotically optimal for this
   problem in the regime where inventory and demand grow large. In stark
   contrast, for the case where customers are forward looking, available
   results in mechanism design and dynamic pricing suggest substantially
   more complicated prescriptions. Notably, these results apply to settings
   with merely a single product type, and they are also often constrained
   by restrictive assumptions on customer type. We demonstrate that static
   prices surprisingly remain asymptotically optimal in the face of
   strategic customers for a multi-product setting and fora broad class of
   customer utility models. For the single-product case, we further show
   that an optimally set static price guarantees the seller revenues that
   are within at least 63.2% of that under an optimal dynamic pricing
   policy, irrespective of regime. For utility models outside the class we
   consider, we show that static prices need not be asymptotically optimal.
   Nevertheless, the class of customer utility models we consider is
   parsimonious, enjoys empirical support, and subsumes many of the models
   considered for this problem in existing mechanism design research. We
   allow for multidimensional customer types and for a customer's
   disutility from waiting to be positively correlated with his valuation.
   Therefore, our findings are likely to be robust and provide for a
   canonical RM problem a simple prescription that is near-optimal across a
   broad set of modeling assumptions.

AB Pricing products such as used cars, houses, and artwork is often
   challenging, because each item is unique, and the seller, ex ante, lacks
   information about the demand for individual items. This paper develops a
   dynamic pricing model for products with significant item-specific demand
   uncertainty, in which a forward-looking seller learns about the
   item-specific demand through an initial assessment, as well as during
   the selling process. The model demonstrates how seller learning, through
   several mechanisms, can lead to the commonly observed downward trend in
   the prices of individual items. These mechanisms include the seller's
   optimal adjustment of prices over time to account for the dynamic
   adverse selection of unsold items and the diminishing option value in
   future learning. The model is estimated using novel panel data of a
   leading used-car dealership. Counterfactual experiments show that the
   value of learning in the selling process is $203 per car. Conditional on
   subsequent learning in the selling process, the initial assessment
   further improves profit per car by $139. With the dealer's net profit
   per car being about $1,150, these estimates suggest a potentially high
   return to taking an information-based approach toward pricing products
   with item-specific demand uncertainty.

AB This paper modifies the standard returns-earnings regression in
   accounting research to show that financial reports convey both cash-flow
   news and discount-rate (expected-return) news. The paper points to the
   realization principle, associated as it is with the resolution of risk,
   as the accounting feature that conveys expected-return news. The
   modified returns-earnings regressions indicate that the information so
   conveyed pertains to priced risk. In corroboration, the paper also shows
   that the identified expected-return news forecasts changes in both stock
   return betas and earnings betas, and expected-return news predicts
   future returns, whereas cash-flow news does not. The analysis yields a
   number of additional insights: financial statements distinguish
   expected-return news associated with operations from that associated
   with financing activities; given accounting information, there is not
   much news in dividends; and, in comparing the information content of
   earnings versus cash flows, cash flows largely convey expected-return
   news rather than cash-flow news. In sum, the paper shows that the
   objective of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and International
   Accounting Standards Board to provide information about the amount and
   uncertainty of future cash flows is (as least, partially) satisfied by
   accounting principles underlying current financial reporting.

   Participants in the role of firms can make offers before information

   hard than when it is easy. We show that the treatment effect works
   through a shift in beliefs; that is, under-confident agents are more
   likely to accept early offers than overconfident agents. The experiment
   identifies a behavioral determinant of unraveling, namely biased
   self-assessments. The treatment with the hard task entails more

AB This paper determines categories of contracts that facilitate vertical
   information sharing in a supply chain while precluding horizontal
   information leakage among competing newsvendors. We consider a supply
   chain in which retailers replenish inventory from a common supplier to
   satisfy uncertain demand and are engaged in newsvendor competition. Each
   retailer has imperfect demand information. Yet one of the retailers (the
   incumbent) has a more accurate demand forecast than the other (the
   entrant). Information leakage among such competing retailers precludes
   vertical information sharing and is often the reason for many retailers
   to abandon collaborative forecast-sharing initiatives, leading to
   suboptimized supply chains. We show that whether a contract can prevent
   information leakage depends on how the inventory risk (i.e., cost of
   supply-demand mismatch) is allocated among the supplier and retailers in
   conjunction with the allocation of profits. We categorize contracts
   according to how they allocate inventory risk among firms when compared
   with a wholesale-price contract. This comparison yields four mutually
   exdusive and collectively exhaustive categories of contracts. A
   downside-protection contract is one that effectively reduces retailers'
   cost of excess inventory by shifting some of their overage cost to the
   supplier. Examples of such contracts include buy-back and
   revenue-sharing contracts. An upside-protection contract is one that
   effectively increases retailers' cost of inventory shortage by shifting
   some of the supplier's underage cost to retailers. Examples of such
   contracts include penalty and rebate contracts. A two-sided protection
   contract combines the properties of the previous two categories. A
   no-protection contract is one that fails to shift firms' cost of
   inventory shortage or excess from one to the other. Examples of such
   contracts include wholesale-price and two-part tariff contracts. We show
   that no-protection contracts, which are extensively used in practice,
   cannot prevent information leakage, whereas others may do so. We also
   show that preventing information leakage could be costly for the supply
   chain (i.e., low channel efficiency). We conclude by illustrating how
   our unified framework to study a variety of contracts can enable a firm
   to determine the best-performing contract (among many) that precludes
   information leakage while almost coordinating the channel. For example,
   we show why buy-back contracts perform significantly better than
   revenue-sharing or rebate contracts.

   project operations. We study the effect of oversight on delays and
   overruns with 262,857 projects spanning 71 federal agencies and 54,739

   project's budget is above a cutoff, procurement officers actively
   oversee the contractor's operations; otherwise, most operational checks
   are waived. We find that oversight increases delays by 6.1%-13.8% and
   overruns by 1.4%-1.6%. We also show that oversight is most obstructive
   when the contractor has no experience in public projects, is paid with a
   fixed-fee contract with performance-based incentives, or performs a
   labor-intensive task. Oversight is least obstructive-or even
   beneficial-when the contractor is experienced, paid with a

AB Using brokerage mergers and closures as natural experiments, we examine
   how exogenous changes in the information environment affect a firm's
   financing choice. Our difference-in-differences approach shows that
   exogenous increases in information asymmetry lead firms to substitute
   away from equity and public debt toward bank debt. Firms with higher
   risk tend to substitute equity for bank debt, and firms with lower risk
   tend to substitute bonds for bank debt. The effect of the change in the
   information environment on a firm's financing choice is more pronounced
   for firms with worse information environments, such as those with few
   initial analysts and younger firms. We demonstrate that the mechanism of
   the change is through a reduction of the issuance of equity and bonds
   but with an increase of the issuance of bank loans. Further analysis
   reveals that such firms tend to reduce long-term borrowing, reduce their
   issuance of subordinated debt, and increase their revolving credit

AB We quantify the pervasiveness of informed trading activity in target
   companies' equity options before the announcements of 1,859 U.S.
   takeovers between 1996 and 2012. About 25% of all takeovers have
   positive abnormal volumes, which are greater for short-dated,
   out-of-the-money calls, consistent with bullish directional trading
   before the announcement. Over half of this abnormal activity is unlikely
   due to speculation, news and rumors, trading by corporate insiders,
   leakage in the stock market, deal predictability, or beneficial
   ownership filings by activist investors. We also examine the
   characteristics of option trades litigated by the Securities and
   Exchange Commission (SEC) for alleged illegal insider trading. Although
   the characteristics of such trades closely resemble the patterns of
   abnormal option volume in the U.S. takeover sample, we find that the SEC
   litigates only about 8% of all deals in it.

AB Using a unique data set of dealer-level trading data in bookbuilding
   initial public offerings (IPOs), we find strong evidence that lead
   underwriter trades in IPO firms are significantly related to subsequent
   IPO abnormal returns. This relation is concentrated among issues in
   which underwriters' information advantage is likely greater,
   specifically among IPOs with higher information asymmetry or subject to
   higher investor sentiment and among underwriters with the most industry
   experience. In contrast, we find no similar relation for trades by other
   syndicate members, who are not involved in due diligence or pricing, or
   around auction IPOs, which are characterized by less underwriter
   involvement. Our results are consistent with the joint hypothesis that
   underwriters of bookbuilding IPOs gain unique insight into the values of
   these client firms and that they trade on this information advantage.

AB We argue that dynamic pricing motivated by the management of inventory
   holding and ordering costs leads to increased operational efficiencies
   that could benefit firms without hurting consumers. To demonstrate this
   point, we equip the traditional economic order quantity (EOQ) setting
   with a rich set of demand models and compare social outcomes under two
   alternatives, dynamic and static pricing. We show that dynamic pricing
   generates higher retailer profits, a lower average price per unit sold,
   and higher sales volumes than static pricing. The mechanism behind the
   result is that with dynamic pricing the retailer ties the price of each
   unit to its holding costs, which allows him to increase the order
   quantity compared with static pricing and thus save on fixed ordering
   costs. Some of these cost savings are passed to consumers. Moreover, we
   demonstrate that this mechanism is robust to the presence of
   price-anticipating (strategic) consumer behavior.

   revisions and stack recommendations are more informative than those of
   the remaining analysts who followed the same companies. To the extent
   that star analysts are superior to their nonstar counterparts in terms

AB A major challenge laced by marketers attempting to optimize their
   advertising campaigns is to deal with budget constraints. The problem is
   even harder in the face of multidimensional budget constraints,
   particularly in the presence of many decision variables involved and the
   interplay among the decision variables through such constraints. Concise
   bidding strategies help advertisers deal with this challenge by
   introducing fewer variables upon which to act. In this paper, we study
   the problem of finding optimal concise bidding strategies for
   advertising campaigns with multiple budget constraints. Given bid
   landscapes-that is, the predicted value (e.g., number of clicks) and the
   cost per click for any bid-that are typically provided by ad-serving
   systems, we optimize the value of an advertising campaign given its
   budget constraints. In particular, we consider bidding strategies that
   consist of no more than k different bids for all keywords. For constant
   k, we provide a polynomial-time approximation scheme to optimize the
   profit, whereas for arbitrary k we show how a constant-factor
   approximation algorithm can be obtained via a combination of solution
   enumeration and dependent LP rounding techniques, which can be of
   independent interest. In addition to being able to deal with
   multidimensional budget constraints, our results do not assume any
   specific payment scheme and can be applied on pay-per-click,
   pay-per-impression, or pay-per-conversion models. Also, no assumption
   about the concavity of value or cost functions is made. Finally, we
   evaluate the performance of our algorithms on real data sets in regimes
   with up to six-dimensional budget constraints. In the case of a single
   budget constraint, in which uniform bidding (currently used in practice)
   has a provable performance guarantee, our algorithm beats the state of
   the art by an increase of 1%-6% in the expected number of clicks. This
   is achieved by only two or three clusters in contrast with the single
   cluster permitted in uniform bidding. With multiple budget constraints,
   the gap between the performance of our algorithm and an enhanced version
   of uniform bidding grows to an average of 5%-6% (and as high as 35% in
   higher dimensions).

AB When entering into a negotiation, individuals have the choice to enact a
   variety of communication styles. We test the differential impact of
   being "warm and friendly" versus "tough and firm" in a distributive
   negotiation when first offers are held constant and concession patterns
   are tracked. We train a natural language processing algorithm to
   precisely quantify the difference between how people enact warm and
   friendly versus tough and firm communication styles. We find that the
   two styles differ primarily in length and their expressions of
   politeness (Study 1). Negotiators with a tough and firm communication
   style achieved better economic outcomes than negotiators with a warm and
   friendly communication style in both a field experiment (Study 2) and a
   laboratory experiment (Study 3). This was driven by the fact that offers
   delivered in tough and firm language elicited more favorable
   counteroffers. We further find that the counterparts of warm and
   friendly versus tough and firm negotiators did not report different
   levels of satisfaction or enjoyment of their interactions (Study 3).
   Finally, we document that individuals' lay beliefs are in direct
   opposition to our findings: participants believe that authors of warmly
   worded negotiation offers will be better liked and will achieve better

AB This paper provides evidence on public firms' initial 8-K disclosures
   that mention Blockchain and investors' response to these disclosures. We
   categorize the description of Blockchain activities in firms' 8-Ks as
   Speculative (e.g., a vague future plan that involves Blockchain) or
   Existing (e.g., a description of Blockchain product). We document a
   sharp increase in the number of initial 8-K disclosures of Blockchain,
   particularly by Speculative firms, coinciding with the rise of Bitcoin
   prices and excitement in Blockchain technology in the last quarter of
   2017. Investors react positively to the Blockchain 8-Ks issued by
   Speculative firms in the initial seven-day event window although the
   reaction is mostly reversed over the 30 days following the disclosure.
   The reaction is stronger when Bitcoin returns are more positive.
   Overall, our results are consistent with a situation that troubles the
   SEC and the financial press: investors overreact to a firm's first 8-K
   disclosure of a potential foray into Blockchain technology and that
   overreaction is a function of the Bitcoin price bubble.

   characteristics of banks taking long or short interest rate derivative
   positions are tested and supported by the data. Therefore, banks'

   taking. More broadly, the results challenge the view that "hedging" and

   risk and bank-level credit supply shocks. We find that a 1 percentage
   point increase in capital requirements reduces lending by 2.3%-4.5%.
   Firms can attenuate this reduction by substituting borrowing across
   banks, but only to a limited extent. The resulting reduction in
   borrowing capacity affects significantly both investment and employment:
   for firmswhose effective capital requirements increase by 1 percentage

AB This paper exploits an administrative regulation in Singapore that
   allows individuals to withdraw between 10% and 30% of their pension
   savings at age 55. We find a large and highly significant increase in
   individuals' bank account balances within the first month of turning 55,
   which declines by about a third by the end of 12 months. Consumers use
   the increase in disposable income to pay down credit card debt.
   Liquidity constrained individuals are significantly more likely to
   increase their spending upon turning 55 than unconstrained
   individuals-nonetheless, the spending response of constrained
   individuals is concentrated on nondurable and nonvisible goods rather
   than visible goods. We also provide evidence that withdrawal behavior is
   responsive to the prices of durable goods such as cars. Consumers appear
   willing to forego much higher interest rates in their retirement
   accounts by leaving a sizeable portion of their withdrawn savings in a
   low-interest accruing bank account for at least a year after withdrawal.
   We show that, for some consumers, part of this behavior may be due to
   the desire to invest in the property market when housing returns are
   high.

   reduce the expected costs of coordination failure among creditors.
   Furthermore, our results indicate a dynamic component missing from

AB Although reference dependence plays a central role in explaining
   behavior, little is known about the way that reference points are
   selected. This paper identifies empirically which reference point people
   use in decision under risk. We assume a comprehensive
   reference-dependent model that nests the main reference-dependent
   theories, including prospect theory, and that allows for isolating the
   reference point rule from other behavioral parameters. Our experiment
   involved high stakes with payoffs up to a week's salary. We used an
   optimal design to select the choices in the experiment and Bayesian
   hierarchical modeling for estimation. The most common reference points
   were the status quo and a security level (the maximum of the minimal
   outcomes of the prospects in a choice). We found little support for the
   use of expectations-based reference points.

AB This study investigates a potential mechanism to promote coordination.
   With theoretical guidance using a belief-based learning model, we
   conduct a multiperiod, binary-choice, and weakest-link laboratory
   coordination experiment to study the effect of gradualism-increasing the
   required levels (stakes) of contributions slowly over time rather than
   requiring a high level of contribution immediately-on group coordination
   performance. We randomly assign subjects to three treatments: starting
   and continuing at a high stake, starting at a low stake but jumping to a
   high stake after a few periods, and starting at a low stake while
   gradually increasing the stakes over time (the Gradualism treatment). We
   find that relative to the other two treatments, groups coordinate most
   successfully at high stakes in the Gradualism treatment. We also find
   evidence that supports the belief-based learning model. These findings
   point to a simple mechanism for promoting successful voluntary
   coordination.

AB We study a mechanism design problem in which an indivisible good is
   auctioned to multiple bidders for each of whom it has a private value
   that is unknown to the seller and the other bidders. The agents perceive
   the ensemble of all bidder values as a random vector governed by an
   ambiguous probability distribution, which belongs to a commonly known
   ambiguity set. The seller aims to design a revenue-maximizing mechanism
   that is not only immunized against the ambiguity of the bidder values,
   but also against the uncertainty about the bidders' attitude toward
   ambiguity. We argue that the seller achieves this goal by maximizing the
   worst-case expected revenue across all value distributions in the
   ambiguity set and by positing that the bidders have Knightian
   preferences. For ambiguity sets containing all distributions supported
   on a hypercube, we show that the Vickrey auction is the unique mechanism
   that is optimal, efficient, and Pareto robustly optimal. If the bidders'
   values are additionally known to be independent, then the revenue of the
   (unknown) optimal mechanism does not exceed that of a second-price
   auction with only one additional bidder. For ambiguity sets under which
   the bidders' values are dependent and characterized through moment
   bounds, on the other hand, we provide a new class of randomized
   mechanisms, the highest-bidder lotteries, whose revenues cannot be
   matched by any second-price auction with a constant number of additional
   bidders. Moreover, we show that the optimal highest-bidder lottery is a
   2-approximation of the (unknown) optimal mechanism, whereas the best
   second-price auction fails to provide any constant-factor approximation
   guarantee.

AB Specifying a proper input distribution is often a challenging task in
   simulation modeling. In practice, there may be multiple plausible
   distributions that can fit the input data reasonably well, especially
   when the data volume is not large. In this paper, we consider the
   problem of selecting the best from a finite set of simulated
   alternatives, in the presence of such input uncertainty. We model such
   uncertainty by an ambiguity set consisting of a finite number of
   plausible input distributions and aim to select the alternative with the
   best worst-case mean performance over the ambiguity set. We refer to
   this problem as robust selection of the best (RSB). To solve the RSB
   problem, we develop a two-stage selection procedure and a sequential
   selection procedure; we then prove that both procedures can achieve at
   least a user-specified probability of correct selection under mild
   conditions. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to investigate
   the computational efficiency of the two procedures. Finally, we apply
   the RSB approach to study a queueing system's staffing problem using
   synthetic data and an appointment-scheduling problem using real data
   from a large hospital in China. We find that the RSB approach can
   generate decisions significantly better than other widely used
   approaches.

AB Economically motivated adulteration (EMA) is a serious threat to public
   health. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to examine farms'
   strategic adulteration behavior and the resulting EMA risk in farming
   supply chains. We study both "preemptive EMA," in which farms engage in
   adulteration to decrease the likelihood of producing low-quality output,
   and "reactive EMA," in which adulteration is done to increase the
   perceived quality of the output. We fully characterize the farms'
   equilibrium adulteration behavior in both types of EMA and analyze how
   quality uncertainty, supply chain dispersion, traceability, and testing
   sensitivity (in detecting adulteration) jointly impact the equilibrium
   adulteration behavior. We determine when greater supply chain dispersion
   leads to a higher EMA risk and how this result depends on traceability
   and testing sensitivity. Furthermore, we caution that investing in
   quality without also enhancing testing capabilities may inadvertently
   increase EMA risk. Our results highlight the limitations of only relying
   on end-product inspection to deter EMA. We leverage our analyses to
   offer tangible insights that can help companies and regulators to more
   proactively address EMA risk in food products.

AB This paper studies an emerging business model of line-sitting in which
   customers seeking service can hire others (line-sitters) to wait in line
   on behalf of them. We develop a queueing-game-theoretic model that
   captures the interaction among customers, the line-sitting firm, and the
   service provider to examine the impact of line-sitting on the service
   provider's revenue and customer welfare. We also contrast line-sitting
   with the well-known priority purchasing scheme, as both allow customers
   to pay extra to skip the wait. Our main results are as follows. First,
   we find that both accommodating line-sitting and selling priority can
   bring in extra revenue for the service provider, although by different
   means-selling priority increases revenue mainly by allowing the service
   provider to practice price discrimination that extracts more customer
   surplus, whereas line-sitting does so through demand expansion,
   attracting customers who would not otherwise join. Second, the priority
   purchasing scheme tends to make the customer population worse off,
   whereas line-sitting can be a win-win proposition for both the service
   provider and the customers. Nevertheless, having the additional option
   of hiring line-sitters does not always benefit customers as a whole
   because the demand expansion effect also induces negative congestion
   externalities. Finally, despite the fact that the service provider
   collects the priority payment as revenue but not the line-sitting
   payment, which accrues to the third-party line-sitting firm, we
   demonstrate that, somewhat surprisingly, accommodating line-sitting can
   raise more revenue for the service provider than directly selling
   priority.

AB Service systems are often stochastic and preplanned by appointments, yet
   implementations of their appointment systems are prevalently
   deterministic. At the planning stage of healthcare services, for
   example, customer punctuality and service durations are often assumed
   equal their means-and this gap, between planned and reality, motivated
   our research. Specifically, we consider appointment scheduling and
   sequencing under a time-varying number of servers, in a data-rich
   environment where service durations and punctuality are uncertain. Our
   data-driven approach, based on infinite-server queues, yields tractable
   and scalable solutions that accommodate hundreds of jobs and servers. We
   successfully test our approach against near-optimal algorithms (which
   exist for merely single-servers). This entails the development of a
   data-driven robust optimization approach with novel uncertainty sets. To
   test for practical performance, we leverage a unique data set from a
   cancer center that combines real-time locations, electronic health
   records, and appointments log. Focusing on one of the center's infusion
   units (roughly 90 daily appointments, 25+ infusion chairs), we reduce
   cost (waiting plus overtime) on the order of 15%-40% consistently, under
   a wide range of experimental setups.

AB Market thickness is a key parameter that can make or break a platform's
   business model. Thicker markets can offer more opportunities for
   participants to meet and higher chances that a potential match exists.
   However, they can also be vulnerable to potential search frictions. In
   this paper, using data from an online peer-to-peer holiday property
   rental platform, we aim to identify and measure the causal impact of
   market thickness on matching rates. In particular, we exploit an
   exogenous shock to market size caused by a one-time migration of
   listings from other platforms, which gives rise to a quasiexperimental
   design. We find that increased market thickness actually leads to lower
   matching rates. Keeping search technology and other factors constant,
   doubling market size leads to a 15.4% reduction in traveler confirmation
   rate and a 15.9% reduction in host occupancy rate. As a result, the
   platform lost 5.6% of potential matches because of the increased market
   size. We attribute the effect to increased search friction: travelers'
   search intensity increases by 18.3% when market size doubles. This
   effect is especially prominent when the matching needs to take place
   within a limited time. Our results offer insights for future empirical
   and theoretical research on matching markets. They also highlight that
   is important for platform owners to watch out for increased search
   frictions as markets grow and invest in search technologies to
   facilitate more efficient search.

AB Essential resources, like electricity and water, can experience rapidly
   changing demand or supply while the other side of the market is
   unchanged. Short-run price variation could efficiently allocate
   resources at these critical times but only if consumers exhibit
   short-run demand elasticity. The question for firms in these markets has
   always been how to enable this response. Randomized control trials are
   increasingly used to test dynamic pricing and technologies that can
   assist in response by providing information and/or automated response.
   However, the trials typically do not randomize short-run prices. This
   paper illustrates how demand from a randomly assigned control group can
   be used to test the effectiveness of different technologies in
   increasing short-term price elasticity. To do so, we use a nonparametric
   control function approach that eliminates the bias inherent in
   estimating short-term price response using only household random
   assignment. We find that only automation technology leads to the
   short-term price elasticity needed to justify real-time pricing.

   allocation decisions are mandatorily disclosed, namely, the members of
   the U.S. Congress. As such, we overcome important methodological issues
   facing previous work in this area. We find that politicians with similar
   beliefs hold similar portfolios and that more liberal members engage in
   more socially responsible investing (SRI), even within political
   parties. Politicians disproportionately favor the SRI categories that
   reflect their favorite issues, while salience plays an important role in
   activating their ideologically based preferences for SRI. In addition,
   more ideological investors are less likely to engage in quid pro quo
   behavior. We conclude that ideology is a pervasive psychological factor

   and disentangle, in a theoretically consistent way, the jump and

   models using the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 100 Index and American options.
   Empirically disentangling the contribution of the jumps from the

   90% of the iVaR on average. Our back-testing results indicate that the

   prevent them from having sufficient personal influence to persuade other
   professionals to cooperate. We find that high-expertise managers make
   two types of bonus decisions: (1) keep a smaller share of the bonus pool
   than what they are entitled to retain and (2) allocate the remainder to
   subordinates more evenly after adjusting for the underlying
   heterogeneity in their productivity. We also find evidence that
   high-expertise managers whose bonus decisions reflect their support for
   cooperation have higher department performance than all other managers.

AB The economics and management literature provides theoretical support for
   both leader and laggard firms to earn higher future operating returns.
   However, prior empirical research lacks a generalizable proxy to capture
   leader versus laggard behavior, thus limiting prior findings to specific
   contexts. This study utilizes a combination of firm-specific and
   industry life cycle identification to categorize leaders and laggards
   and validates the designation against constructs established in prior
   literature. Additionally, we examine each strategy's effect on future
   performance, finding that, in general, laggards earn greater operating
   returns. Laggards gain their advantage through product
   differentiation-specifically, through marketing/advertising
   expenditures. Leaders are, on average, unable to convert their first
   movers' advantage into sustainable future profitability once we control
   for other determinants of profitability. The leader/laggard
   classification using financial statement information has useful
   applications in analysis, forecasting, and valuation.

AB Entrepreneurs increasingly use reward-based crowdfunding to finance
   innovation projects through a large number of customer investments. The
   existing academic literature has predominantly studied factors that
   drive crowd investments and whether crowdfunding predicts market
   success. However, we argue that the involvement of customers goes beyond
   the provision of capital. As investors, customers enter into a
   principal-agent relationship with entrepreneurs. Thus, entrepreneurs are
   often faced with a crowd of customer investors who try to influence
   product development. We show that entrepreneurs can benefit from this
   influence, because customer investors provide some of the support
   usually received from institutional investors. Greater involvement from
   customer investors thus increases funding success. This holds when we
   control for creator ability and project quality. The effect is driven by
   customers' influence on product development and the reduction in agency
   costs for prospective customers. We also link the involvement of
   customer investors during crowdfunding to the crowdsourcing literature
   and show that its positive effect is augmented by the elicitation of
   external information through distant search.

AB Commitment products can remedy self-control problems. However, imperfect
   knowledge about their preferences may (discontinuously) lead individuals
   to select into incentive-incompatible commitments, which reduce their
   welfare. I conducted a field experiment in which low-income individuals
   were randomly offered a new installment-savings commitment account.
   Individuals chose a personalized savings plan and a default penalty
   themselves. A majority appears to choose a harmful contract: While the
   average effect on bank savings is large, 55% of clients default and
   incur monetary losses. A possible explanation is that the chosen
   penalties were too low (the commitment was too weak) to overcome
   clients' self-control problems. Measures of sophisticated hyperbolic
   discounting correlate negatively with take-up and default, and
   positively with penalty choices. This finding is consistent with
   theoretical predictions that partial sophisticates adopt weak
   commitments and then default, whereas full sophisticates are more
   cautious about committing, but better able to choose
   incentive-compatible contracts.

AB Accelerators aim to help nascent companies reach successful outcomes by
   providing capital, enabling industry connections, and increasing
   exposure to investors. Critically, however, accelerators also provide
   informative signals to founders about the probability of success.
   Founders use this information to decide whether to continue or shut
   down. To better understand these issues, I provide a model of
   accelerator participation and performance and then test empirical
   predictions from the model using a novel data set of approximately 900
   accelerator companies across 13 accelerators and 900 matched
   non-accelerator companies. I find that, through accelerator feedback
   effects, accelerator companies close down earlier and more often, raise
   less money conditional on closing, and appear to be more efficient
   investments compared with non-accelerator companies. Additional analysis
   using a separate sample of rejected accelerator applicants further
   supports these findings. These results suggest that accelerators help
   resolve uncertainty around company quality sooner, allowing founders to
   make funding and exit decisions accordingly.

AB A classical approach to collecting and elaborating information to make
   entrepreneurial decisions combines search heuristics, such as trial and
   error, effectuation, and confirmatory search. This paper develops a
   framework for exploring the implications of a more scientific approach
   to entrepreneurial decision making. The panel sample of our randomized
   control trial includes 116 Italian startups and 16 data points over a
   period of about one year. Both the treatment and control groups receive
   10 sessions of general training on how to obtain feedback from the
   market and gauge the feasibility of their idea. We teach the treated
   startups to develop frameworks for predicting the performance of their
   idea and conduct rigorous tests of their hypotheses, very much as
   scientists do in their research. We let the firms in the control group
   instead follow their intuitions about how to assess their idea, which
   has typically produced fairly standard search heuristics. We find that
   entrepreneurs who behave like scientists perform better, are more likely
   to pivot to a different idea, and are not more likely to drop out than
   the control group in the early stages of the startup. These results are
   consistent with the main prediction of our theory: a scientific approach
   improves precision-it reduces the odds of pursuing projects with false
   positive returns and increases the odds of pursuing projects with false
   negative returns.

   investigate how activities that can enhance a user's reputation vary
   before and after the user finds a new job. We contrast this
   reputation-generating activity with activities that do not improve a
   user's reputation. After finding a new job, users contribute 23.7% less
   in reputation-generating activity; by contrast, they reduce their
   non-reputation-generating activity by only 7.4%. These findings suggest
   that users contribute to Stack Overflow in part because they perceive
   such contributions as a way to improve future employment prospects. We
   provide direct evidence against alternative explanations such as integer

AB The ongoing shortage of organs for transplantation has generated an
   expanding literature on efficient and equitable allocation of the
   donated cadaveric organs. By contrast, organ donation has been little
   explored. In this paper, we develop a parsimonious model of organ
   donation to analyze the welfare consequences of introducing the
   donor-priority rule, which grants registered organ donors priority in
   receiving organs should they need transplants in the future. We model an
   individual's decision to join the donor registry, which entails a
   trade-off between abundance of supply, exclusivity of priority, and cost
   of donating (e.g., psychological burden). Assuming heterogeneity in the
   cost of donating only, we find the introduction of the donor-priority
   rule leads to improved social welfare. By incorporating heterogeneity in
   the likelihood of requiring an organ transplant and in organ quality, we
   show that, in contrast to the literature, introducing the donor-priority
   rule can lower social welfare because of unbalanced incentives across
   different types of individuals. In view of the potentially undesirable
   social-welfare consequences, we consider a freeze-period remedy, under
   which an individual is not entitled to a higher queueing priority until
   after having been on the organ-donor registry for a specified period of
   time. We show this additional market friction helps rebalance the
   incentive structure, and in conjunction with the donor-priority rule,
   can guarantee an increase in social welfare by boosting organ supply
   without compromising organ quality or inducing excessively high costs of
   donating.

   demand classes. The resources are flexible in that each type of resource
   can serve more than one demand class. In this paper, we focus on a

   design, which was proposed by Jordan and Graves [Jordan WC, Graves SC
   (1995) Principles on the benefits of manufacturing process flexibility.
   Management Sci. 41(4):577-594.] and has been an important concept in the
   design of sparse flexible processes. We study the long-chain design in
   an online stochastic environment in which the requests are drawn
   repeatedly and independently from a nonstationary probability
   distribution over the different demand classes. Also, the decision on
   how to address each request must be made immediately upon its arrival.
   We show the effectiveness of the long-chain design in mitigating
   supply-demand mismatch under a simple myopic online allocation policy.
   In particular, we provide an upper bound on the expected total number of
   lost sales that is irrespective of how large the market size is.

AB Despite the prevalence and significance of walk-ins in healthcare, we
   know relatively little about how to plan and manage the daily operations
   of a healthcare facility that accepts both scheduled and walk-in
   patients. In this paper, we take a data-analytics approach and develop
   an optimization model to determine the optimal appointment schedule in
   the presence of potential walk-ins. Our model is the first known
   approach that can jointly handle general walk-in processes and
   heterogeneous, time-dependent no-show behaviors. We demonstrate that,
   with walk-ins, the optimal schedules are fundamentally different from
   those without. Our numerical study reveals that walk-ins introduce a new
   source of uncertainties to the system and cannot be viewed as a simple
   solution to compensate for patient no-shows. Scheduling, however, is an
   effective way to counter some of the negative impact from uncertain
   patient behaviors. Using data from practice, we predict a significant
   cost reduction (42%-73% on average) if the providers were to switch from
   current practice (which tends to overlook walk-ins in planning) to our
   proposed schedules. Although our work is motivated by healthcare, our
   models and insights can also be applied to general appointment-based

AB Assortment optimization is an important problem that arises in many
   practical applications such as retailing and online advertising. The
   fundamental goal is to select a subset of items to offer from a universe
   of substitutable items to maximize expected revenue when customers
   exhibit a random substitution behavior captured by a choice model. We
   study assortment optimization under the Markov chain choice model in the
   presence of capacity constraints that arise naturally in many
   applications. The Markov chain choice model considers item substitutions
   as transitions in a Markov chain and provides a good approximation for a
   large class of random utility models, thereby addressing the challenging
   problem of model selection in choice modeling. In this paper, we present
   constant factor approximation algorithms for the cardinality- and
   capacity-constrained assortment-optimization problem under the Markov
   chain model. We show that this problem is APX-hard even when all item
   prices are uniform, meaning that, unless P= NP, it is not possible to
   obtain an approximation better than a particular constant. Our
   algorithmic approach is based on a new externality adjustment paradigm
   that exactly captures the externality of adding an item to a given
   assortment on the remaining set of items, thereby allowing us to
   linearize a nonlinear, nonsubmodular, and nonmonotone revenue function
   and to design an iterative algorithm that iteratively builds up a
   provably good assortment.

AB We address the problem of designing appointment scheduling strategies in
   a stochastic environment accounting for patient no-shows,
   nonpunctuality, general stochastic service times, and unscheduled
   emergency walk-ins. A good appointment schedule seeks to help outpatient
   clinics to utilize their resources efficiently while containing
   patients' waiting times. The task of identifying an optimal schedule is
   modeled as a nonlinear integer program, where the objective function is
   the outcome of stochastic analysis in transient state. We maintain the
   discrete nature of the appointment scheduling problem by considering
   arrival epochs with discrete supports. By looking at discrete-time
   snapshots of the random evolution of a single-server queueing model, we
   characterize probabilistically the system's workload over time as a
   function of an appointment schedule, and we derive recursive expressions
   for the performance measures of interest. Subsequently, we unfold
   discrete convexity properties of the optimization problem. We prove that
   under general conditions the objective function is supermodular and
   componentwise convex. Under assumptions on patient punctuality, we prove
   that the optimal scheduling strategy minimizes a multimodular function,
   a property which guarantees that a locally optimal schedule is also
   globally optimal. The size of the local neighborhood, however, grows
   exponentially with the dimension of the problem. To the best of our
   knowledge, this study is the first to develop and implement an algorithm
   for minimizing locally a multimodular function over nonnegative integer
   vectors via submodular set-function minimization over ring families, a

AB We analyze a general equilibrium model in which financial institutions
   generate endogenous systemic risk Banks optimally select correlated
   investments and thereby expose themselves to fire sale risk so as to
   sharpen their incentives. Systemic risk is therefore a natural
   consequence of banks' fundamental role as delegated monitors. Our model
   sheds light on recent and historical trends in measured systemic risk.
   Technological innovations and government-directed lending can cause
   surges in systemic risk. Strict capital requirements and well-designed
   government-asset purchase programs can combat systemic risk.

AB We study effect of superstition and conspicuous spending motives on
   housing demand and price in Singapore. We find that buyers pay less for
   homes with unlucky addresses and more for homes with lucky addresses.
   There were fewer housing transactions on inauspicious days of the lunar
   calendar when people are advised to avoid making major economic
   decisions. This suggests that superstitious belief still affects
   economic activities. The demand for lucky addresses is also weaker on
   these inauspicious days, suggesting that superstitious belief indeed
   affects the demand for lucky addresses. Moreover, the price premium for
   a lucky address is significantly higher for apartments of larger size or
   on top floors. Because these two housing features can signal wealth and
   are highly visible, the larger price premium suggests that conspicuous
   spending motives also play a significant role in the Singapore housing
   market. We also find that informed buyers, even with less superstitious
   or conspicuous spending motives, might still pay price premiums for
   lucky addresses. In contrast, uninformed buyers are unlikely to pay a
   premium for these addresses.

AB Gender quotas are frequently proposed to address persistent gender
   imbalances in managerial roles. However, it is unclear how quotas for
   female managers affect organizations and whether quotas improve or
   damage relationships between managers and their subordinates. We conduct
   a representative survey to study opinions on quotas for female managers
   and, based upon the survey, design a novel set of experiments to
   investigate how quotas influence wage setting and effort provision. Our
   findings reveal that both opinions about gender quotas and workplace
   behavior crucially depend on the workplace environment. In our survey,
   we observe that approval for gender quotas is low if women are not
   disadvantaged in the manager-selection process, regardless of whether
   there are gender differences in performance. Complementing this
   evidence, we observe in our experiments that quotas lead to lower effort
   levels and lower wages in such environments. By contrast, in
   environments in which women are disadvantaged in the selection process,
   we observe a higher approval of quotas as well as higher effort levels
   and higher wages. These findings are consistent with the concept of
   meritocracy and suggest that it is important to evaluate the perception
   of gender disadvantages in the workplace environment before implementing
   quotas.

AB In asset return predictability, realized returns and future expected
   returns tend to move in opposite directions. This generates a tension
   between tax- and market-timing incentives. In this study, a portfolio
   choice problem in the presence of both return predictability and capital
   gains tax is examined. We characterize various features of the optimal
   trading strategy, and demonstrate that the optimal strategy helps
   mitigate the tension between market- and tax-timing. The calibrated
   model suggests that return predictability can significantly increase
   both the utility loss due to capital gains tax and the value of
   deferring capital gains realization. Overall, our results suggest that
   the nature of the asset return process can have important implications
   for the welfare effects of capital gains tax.

AB We demonstrate that lottery markets can exhibit the "hot-hand"
   phenomenon, in which past winning numbers tend to have a greater share
   of the betting proportion in future draws even though past and future
   events are independent. This is surprising as previous works have
   instead documented the presence of an opposite effect, the "gambler's
   fallacy" in the U.S. lottery market. The current literature also
   suggests that the gambler's fallacy prevails when random numbers are
   generated by mechanical devices, such as in lottery games. We use two
   sets of naturally occurring data to show that both the gambler's fallacy
   and the hot-hand fallacy can exist in different types of lottery games.
   We then run online experimental studies that mimic lottery games with
   one, two, or three winning numbers. Our experimental results show that
   the number of winning prizes impacts behavior. In particular, whereas a
   single-prize game leads to a strong presence of the gambler's fallacy,
   we observe a significant increase in hot-hand behavior in multiple-prize
   games with two or three winning numbers.

AB Dark pools offer price improvement over displayed quotes, but
   nondisplayed liquidity implies execution uncertainty. Because investor
   limit orders also provide price improvement with execution risk, dark
   pools offer a natural substitute. In a model of informed trading in a
   market with a displayed limit order book and a dark pool that offers
   price improvement, higher valuation investors sort into order types with
   lower execution risk, generating an "immediacy hierarchy." Dark pool
   price improvement predicts the order in the hierarchy: a price
   improvement closer to (farther from) the midquote positions dark orders
   below (above) limit orders, which improves (worsens) market quality and
   welfare. A dark pool that is operated by the limit order book is welfare
   improving, and welfare reduces with an independently operated pool.
   Because active and passive order flow migrate to the dark pool where
   price impact occurs only post-trade, price efficiency worsens with any
   positive level of dark trading.

AB This paper examines how customer sentiment expressed through social
   media influences institutional investors' investment decisions and firm
   value. We use psychology theory to classify the emotional content of
   social media-based word of mouth, which we refer to as ESWOM. We examine
   whether ESWOM influences institutional investors' stockholdings
   differentially based on investor type and if institutional investors'
   stockholdings mediate the relation between ESWOM and firm value. We
   identify eight types of ESWOM by linguistically interpreting web
   scrapings of millions of social media posts on 38 corporate brands for
   the 2007-2015 period. We find differential effects of ESWOM on
   stockholdings of institutional investors. Dedicated and quasi-index
   institutional investors increase their stockholdings in response to
   increases in positive ESWOM such as joy and trust. Transient investors
   decrease their stockholdings in response to increases in negative ESWOM
   such as anger, disgust, and fear. Competitive intensity and intangible
   asset intensity influence these results. Path analysis indicates that
   ESWOM influences firm abnormal stock returns and idiosyncratic risk both
   directly and indirectly through. its effects on institutional investors'
   stockholdings. These findings support our hypothesis that investors'
   responses to customer sentiment vary based on whether they follow
   long-term or short-term investment strategies. Our research highlights
   the importance of understanding the heterogeneous preferences of
   institutional investors and their use of social media information for
   decision making.

AB Using retail chain data, we study the effects of a tournament incentive

   plans could motivate employees to perform both at a high level, based on
   objective criteria, and in accordance with company values, considered
   via managerial discretion. However, such plans could be
   counterproductive if enough participants (especially those who do not
   win) perceive that subjectivity (introduced via discretion) adds
   unfairness. We show that, on average, the tournament incentive plan was
   associated with improved store sales. We also find that such plans can
   be more beneficial for geographically distant participants, where the
   potential for improving alignment is greater. Lastly, we find some
   evidence that participants' resource constraints (potentially affecting
   unfairness concerns) can impact outcomes under the plan.

AB We investigate how firms use information technology (IT) implementation
   to mitigate an anomaly in capital markets: investors underreacting to
   new public information. The theory of information uncertainty (IU)
   suggests that the anomaly is amplified with IU; that is, with ambiguity
   in information about firm value. We theorize that a firm's IT in
   general- and enterprise systems (ES) in particular-can mitigate IU, thus
   reducing the NJ-induced underreaction anomaly. Based on a
   difference-in-differences analysis of a sample of 572 ES
   implementations, our main finding is that ES implementation does reduce
   NJ-induced underreaction anomaly. This is achieved through a reduction
   in the firm's fundamentals volatility and an improvement in information
   quality. We also find that firms with greater capability are better
   positioned to realize the anomaly-reducing benefits of ES implementation
   and that ES's anomaly-reducing effect is most pronounced when high
   levels of both functional and operational ES modules are implemented. We
   obtain remarkably consistent results when using alternate empirical
   design, samples, and measures of news. Such IT impacts are economically
   highly consequential because they improve capital market efficiency.

   manipulating information protected under U.S. laws, and submit job
   applications on their behalf to more than 4,000 employers. We estimate
   employer search activity and bias in interview callbacks. We find
   evidence of employers searching online for the candidates. At the
   national level, we find no significant difference in the callback rates
   for a Muslim versus a Christian candidate, or for a gay versus a
   straight candidate. However, employers in Republican areas exhibit
   significant bias against the Muslim candidate relative to the Christian
   candidate. This bias is significantly larger than the bias in Democratic
   areas. The results on callback bias are robust to using state- and

AB We combine ideas from machine learning (ML) and operations research and
   management science (OR/MS) in developing a framework, along with
   specific methods, for using data to prescribe optimal decisions in OR/MS
   problems. In a departure from other work on data-driven optimization, we
   consider data consisting, not only of observations of quantities with
   direct effect on costs/revenues, such as demand or returns, but also
   predominantly of observations of associated auxiliary quantities. The
   main problem of interest is a conditional stochastic optimization
   problem, given imperfect observations, where the joint probability
   distributions that specify the problem are unknown. We demonstrate how
   our proposed methods are generally applicable to a wide range of
   decision problems and prove that they are computationally tractable and
   asymptotically optimal under mild conditions, even when data are not
   independent and identically distributed and for censored observations.
   We extend these to the case in which some decision variables, such as
   price, may affect uncertainty and their causal effects are unknown. We
   develop the coefficient of prescriptiveness P to measure the
   prescriptive content of data and the efficacy of a policy from an
   operations perspective. We demonstrate our approach in an inventory
   management problem faced by the distribution arm of a large media
   company, shipping 1 billion units yearly. We leverage both internal data
   and public data harvested from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Google to
   prescribe operational decisions that outperform baseline measures.
   Specifically, the data we collect, leveraged by our methods, account for
   an 88% improvement as measured by our coefficient of prescriptiveness.

AB Firms typically use query-based search to help consumers find
   information/products on their websites. We consider the problem of
   optimally ranking a set of results shown in response to a query. We
   propose a personalized ranking mechanism based on a user's search and
   click history. Our machine-learning framework consists of three modules:
   (a) feature generation, (b) normalized discounted cumulative gain-based
   Lambda-MART algorithm, and (c) feature selection wrapper. We deploy our
   framework on large-scale data from a leading search engine using Amazon
   EC2 servers and present results from a series of counterfactual
   analyses. We find that personalization improves clicks to the top
   position by 3.5% and reduces the average error in rank of a click by
   9.43% over the baseline. Personalization based on short-term history or
   within-session behavior is shown to be less valuable than long-term or
   across-session personalization. We find that there is significant
   heterogeneity in returns to personalization as a function of user
   history and query type. The quality of personalized results increases
   monotonically with the length of a user's history. Queries can be
   classified based on user intent as transactional, informational, or
   navigational, and the former two benefit more from personalization. We
   also find that returns to personalization are negatively correlated with
   a query's past average performance. Finally, we demonstrate the
   scalability of our framework and derive the set of optimal features that
   maximizes accuracy while minimizing computing time.

   explore ways to reduce such discrimination using online reputation
   systems. We conducted four randomized field experiments among 1,801
   hosts on Airbnb by creating fictitious guest accounts and sending
   accommodation requests to them. We find that requests from guests with
   African American-sounding names are 19.2 percentage points less likely
   to be accepted than those with white-sounding names. However, a positive
   review posted on a guest's page significantly reduces discrimination:
   when guest accounts receive a positive review, the acceptance rates of
   guest accounts with white- and African American-sounding names are
   statistically indistinguishable. We further show that a nonpositive
   review and a blank review without any content can also help attenuate
   discrimination, but self-claimed information on tidiness and
   friendliness cannot reduce discrimination, which indicates the
   importance of encouraging credible peer-generated reviews. Our results
   offer direct and clear guidance for sharing-economy platforms to reduce

   about. For products that base on a similar technology, it is plausible
   that consumers use the information signals of one product's
   technological efficiency to help them update their belief about another
   product's technological efficiency within the same product category. As
   a result, a late entrant could benefit from the information spillover
   generated by an early entrant. We apply our framework to the statin
   market in Canada, where drugs rely on a similar mechanism to reduce the
   cholesterol level. In our model, patients/doctors can observe a statin's
   efficacy in reducing the cholesterol level, but they are uncertain about
   how effectively it can convert its cholesterol-reducing ability to
   reducing heart disease risks. Our estimation results show that the
   combination of correlated learning and informative and persuasive
   detailing explain the success of the two late entrants in the statin
   market: Lipitor and Crestor.

AB Building on incomplete contract theory, I investigate whether the
   likelihood of renegotiating financial covenants is affected by the
   debt-contracting value of borrowers' accounting numbers. The
   debt-contracting value captures the inherent ability of accounting
   numbers to predict credit quality. Using a large sample of private
   credit agreements, I hypothesize and find that a higher debt-contracting
   value gives rise to smaller ex post measurement errors in accounting
   numbers used in covenants, and thus borrowers and lenders are less
   likely to renegotiate financial covenants. This effect is stronger when
   the financial covenant intensity is higher. Consistent with the notion
   that renegotiation improves contracting efficiency by eliminating errors
   in financial covenants, I show that the distance of the covenant
   variable to its new contractual threshold better predicts a borrower's
   creditworthiness than does the distance to the original threshold absent
   the renegotiation.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between waiting time and
   subsequent purchase decisions. The prior literature assumes that
   purchase decisions are independent from the waiting time. By contrast,
   we find that when people spend a longer time waiting in a line, they
   tend to consume more. We identify mental accounting for sunk costs as
   the underlying mechanism that drives this behavior; a larger purchase
   allows customers to offset the long wait suffered. Finally, we explore
   the effect of managerial practices commonly employed by firms to improve
   customers' waiting experience. We find that although these practices
   indeed result in improved customer experience, they can actually result
   in lower consumption at the individual level.

AB Every firm has a business model, which is the collection of strategic
   decisions that determine how the firm generates a sustainable enterprise
   through the creation of enough value (its supply model) and the
   extraction of a sufficient portion of that value (its revenue model).
   Innovative business models-for example, fast fashion (e.g., Zara),
   e-tailing (e.g., Amazon), and ride-sharing (e.g., Uber)-are capable of
   offering new products and services that generate considerable consumer
   utility and transform industries. This paper develops a research
   framework for understanding business models and how business models have
   evolved over time. Links are made to the existing literature (primarily
   in pricing and operations), and simple models are developed to unify and
   clarify existing research findings. Through this framework, it is
   possible (i) to identify the few design decisions that explain the
   success of these diverse firms with otherwise seemingly disparate
   models, and (ii) to speculate on potential future business-model
   innovations.
