AB The authors empirically study the relationships between pre- and
   post-promotion dips in weekly store data and Universal Product Code
   (UPC), category, and store trading-area customer characteristics.
   Drawing on recent advances in econometric modeling, they estimate 39,441
   pre- and postpromotion dip elasticities in 83 stores in ten product
   categories. They relate these elasticities to 24 characteristics, such
   as UPC price and market share, category budget share and storability,
   and store trading-area demographics. The authors find that UPC,
   category, and store trading-area customer characteristics all explain
   significant variation in the elasticities. For example, both pre- and
   postpromotion dips are stronger for high-priced, frequently promoted,
   mature, high-market-share UPCs. They find that postpromotion dips are
   not significantly different for private labels but are more prominent
   for UPCs with less predictable promotion patterns. They also find that
   stores with trading areas that consist of older customers who live in
   larger households and own cars are particularly prone to postpromotion
   dips. The findings potentially deepen the understanding of stockpiling
   and deceleration and blend two trends in promotion response research: an
   increased focus on pre- and postpromotion effects and a greater emphasis
   on examination of cross-sectional differences in promotion response.

AB The authors focus on estimating a latent-class choice model with
   consumer response segments when only store-level aggregate data are
   available. Most of the proposed methodologies in the marketing
   literature require household panel data, which can be difficult to
   obtain. There is a growing stream of work in marketing and in empirical
   industrial organization that estimates segmentation structure with
   aggregate data. This article is a careful attempt to understand the
   extent to which disaggregate structure in the form of a latent-class
   model can be recovered from aggregate data. The authors show that under
   specific assumptions and when the household-level model is correctly
   specified, most of a latent-class segmentation structure is identifiable
   even if only store-level aggregate data are available. Therefore, the
   store data-based estimates for the latent-class model are consistent. In
   other words, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the estimates goes to
   zero with infinite sample size. To assess how well latent-class
   structure can be estimated from store data sets of sample sizes that are
   comparable to those in real life, the authors simulate more than 60,000
   store data sets and compute the consequent model estimates and their
   estimation errors. The results show that the MAD of the latent-class
   estimates diminishes much more slowly with store data than with
   household data. Moreover, the rate is so slow that obtaining estimates
   with reasonably small MADs often requires unreasonably large sample
   sizes. The authors' simulations offer guidance on conditions that favor
   obtaining more accurate estimates from store-level data.

AB Respondents in a conjoint experiment sometimes are presented with
   successive partial product profiles. First, the authors model how
   respondents infer missing levels of product attributes in a partial
   conjoint profile by developing a learning-based imputation model that
   nests several extant models. The advantage of this approach over
   previous research is that it infers missing levels of an attribute not
   only from prior levels of the same attribute but also from prior levels
   of other attributes, especially ones that match the attribute levels of
   the current product profile. Second, the authors provide an empirical
   demonstration of their approach and test whether learning in conjoint
   studies occurs; to what extent; and in what manner it affects responses,
   partworths, and the relative importance of attributes. They show that
   the relative importance of attribute partworths can shift when subjects
   evaluate partial profiles, which suggests that consumers may construct
   rather than retrieve partworths and are sensitive to the order in which
   the profiles are presented. Finally, the results show that consumers'
   imputation processes can be influenced by manipulating their prior
   information about a product category. This research is of both
   theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, this research sheds
   light on how customers integrate different sources of information in
   evaluating products with incomplete attribute information; practically,
   it highlights the potential pitfalls of imputing missing attribute
   levels using simple rules and develops a better behavioral model for
   describing and predicting customers' ratings for partial conjoint
   profiles.

AB This research examines the perseverance of identity-based judgments by
   exploring the effectiveness of various corrective procedures that are
   intended to neutralize identity effects on judgment. The authors explore
   these effects in a series of studies that involve different kinds of
   identities (e.g., parent, teenager, businessperson, environmentalist)
   linked to different objects and issues (e.g., Internet censorship,
   pollution credits, electronic books). Moreover, they test the
   effectiveness of various corrective procedures, including feature-based
   analysis, counterfactual reasoning, counteridentification, and social
   influence. The authors find that identity-driven thinking leads to
   judgment that resists change, that is, a procedural bias or "sticky
   prior" in favor of an initial identity-based judgment. The findings
   attest to both the power of identity and the efficacy of analytic and
   nonanalytic corrective techniques.

AB In this article, the authors use an economic model to show that it may
   be optimal to lower the retail price during a coupon event when marginal
   consumers have moderate hassle costs of coupon redemption. Results from
   the model offer predictions on the relationships among coupon
   redemptions, shelf price, and coupon face value. The authors test these
   predictions on a large data set of hundreds of coupon events across six
   packaged goods categories. The data show that when a small coupon face
   value is offered, the shelf price is likely to be reduced. They also
   find that coupon efficiency increases when there is a lower retail
   price. The results are of interest to managers planning a promotion
   calendar and deciding whether to coordinate price promotions with coupon
   events, and they contribute to economic theory. When a firm moves from
   uniform pricing (e.g., no coupons) to second-degree price discrimination
   (e.g., coupons), all consumers may face a lower price. This finding has
   public policy implications because second-degree price discrimination
   may increase the welfare of every consumer.

AB This article extends research on evaluation differences in response
   modes to situations in which the no-choice option is available. Prior
   research on choice deferral has presented the no-choice option as just
   another response option (i.e., an unconditional brand-choice response
   mode), which has its primary focus on the selection decision. However,
   consumers in many marketplace situations may consider the buy/no-buy
   decision before the selection decision (i.e., a buy/no-buy response
   mode). This article examines the differences in evaluation processes and
   choice deferral for the two response modes. The authors' theoretical
   account suggests that an initial focus on the buy/no-buy decision
   activates greater use of alternative-based evaluations, thus making
   purchase deferral more sensitive to the valence of shared features and
   category reference information than in the unconditional brand-choice
   mode. The authors provide process evidence for their account and
   consider limiting conditions.

AB Chain-link frameworks such as the service-profit chain (SPC) are much
   discussed as a means to link customer profits to operational resources
   under the influence of vendor managers, though empirical testing to date
   has been limited primarily to consumer services settings. In this
   article, the authors adapt the SPC framework to accommodate
   characteristics of business markets, specifically the complex
   decision-making unit, strategic supplier selection, and resource
   allocation at the individual customer level. They also extend the SPC
   framework to allow for a richer description of the complex linkages
   between vendor effort and account profitability, namely, nonlinear
   linkages and differential responsiveness occasioned by customer-specific
   factors such as competitive context. Controlling for such factors
   illuminates, to some degree, why similar levels of customer management
   effort and/or performance can yield quite different customer
   profitability outcomes. The authors present an application that
   demonstrates how adaptation and extension of the SPC to business markets
   can provide vendors with (1) insights into the process that culminates
   in individual customer profitability and (2) useful guidelines for
   adapting their customer management efforts at the individual account
   level with an aim to improve account profitability. The results show the
   importance of accounting for decreasing returns to customer management
   effort at a given account, and they reinforce the notion of customer
   delight.

AB The authors develop a sales model that can be used to assess
   cross-category price effects that are specific to individual items
   (stockkeeping units) from store-level sales data. Previous
   cross-category studies have typically assumed that the cross-category
   effects are the same across brands or items because the potential number
   of price effects to be estimated is large. The authors address this
   problem by decomposing the variability of cross-category price effects
   into two components: variability across items and across stores. They
   capture the variability across items by representing the item-level
   parameters as draws from distributions with category-level means. They
   account for variability across stores through a random-effects factor
   structure that represents the variation of within- and between-category
   price effects separately. The model is calibrated on weekly store sales
   data of items in three orange juice subcategories (refrigerated, frozen,
   and shelf-stable). The authors study competition between national brands
   and private labels across the subcategories, for which their model lends
   itself well. The results show asymmetrical price competition not only
   within but also across subcategories: the cross-subcategory impact of
   national brands on store brands appears to be substantially greater than
   that of store brands on national brands. In addition, the model supports
   the implementation of price zones at a more granular level than the
   current practice.

   researchers have examined the effects of exposure to prices for the same
   product, the same brand, or products in the same category. This research
   explores the effect of incidental prices on the consumer's willingness

   offered, or paid for unrelated products or goods that neither sellers
   nor buyers regard as relevant to the price of an item that they are
   engaged in selling or buying. More specifically, the authors examine how
   prices for products that buyers encounter unintentionally can serve as
   anchors, thus affecting willingness to pay for the product that they
   intend to buy. The findings have important implications for auction
   houses and online vendors as well as for conventional retailers.

AB Sales response models are widely used as the basis for optimizing the
   marketing mix. Response models condition on the observed marketing-mix
   variables and focus on the specification of the distribution of observed
   sales given marketing-mix activities. The models usually fail to
   recognize that the levels of the marketing-mix variables are often
   chosen with at least partial knowledge of the response parameters in the
   conditional model. This means that contrary to standard assumptions, the
   marginal distribution of the marketing-mix variables is not independent
   of response parameters. The authors expand on the standard conditional
   model to include a model for the determination of the marketing-mix
   variables. They apply this modeling approach to the problem of gauging
   the effectiveness of sales calls (details) to induce greater prescribing
   of drugs by individual physicians. They do not assume a priori that
   details are set optimally, but instead they infer the extent to which
   sales force managers have knowledge of responsiveness, and they use this
   knowledge to set the level of sales force contact. The authors find that
   their modeling approach improves the precision of the physician-specific
   response parameters significantly. They also find that physicians are
   not detailed optimally; high-volume physicians are detailed to a greater
   extent than low-volume physicians without regard to responsiveness to
   detailing. It appears that unresponsive but high-volume physicians are
   detailed the most. Finally, the authors illustrate how their approach
   provides a general framework.

AB Products that require extensive and complex information flows among
   suppliers, intermediary vendors, and customers often pose particular
   challenges to the vertical marketing system. Using social network
   theory, the authors investigate buyers' preferences for specific
   patterns of relationships among buyers, intermediary vendors, and
   suppliers of complex products. Using a conjoint experiment with actual
   and prospective buyers of integrated computer networks and services, the
   authors find that beyond their dyadic interaction with a vendor, buyers
   take into account the buyer-vendor-supplier triad. Specifically, buyers
   value sequences of selective strong ties as well as sequences of more
   numerous weak ties. This is consistent with theoretical propositions
   that strong ties facilitate the mobilization of support and the transfer
   of complex knowledge, whereas nonoverlapping weak ties facilitate the
   gathering of intelligence and the monitoring of new developments. The
   authors find only mixed evidence that buyers value direct access to
   suppliers when strong ties exist between the vendor and suppliers, as
   predicted by the third-party sanctioning argument in social network
   theory. In addition, they find that interaction intensity and valence do
   not always have the same effects, thus providing criterion validation to
   the bidimensional nature of tie strength that has been documented in
   previous research.

AB Social needs play an important role in the purchase of conspicuous
   goods. In this article, the authors extend traditional economic models
   to accommodate social needs, such as desire for uniqueness and
   conformism, and examine their implications for pricing conspicuous
   goods. First, in the context of a duopoly, the authors identify the
   conditions under which the desire for uniqueness can increase demand
   among some consumers as the price of a product increases. Second, the
   authors show that though the desire for uniqueness leads to higher
   prices and firm profits, a desire for conformity leads to lower prices
   and profits. Third, the authors find that consumers purchase
   high-quality products not because of their desire for uniqueness but
   despite it. Finally, marketers of conspicuous goods may find it
   beneficial not to emphasize the functional differences among their
   products when the need for uniqueness is high. In a laboratory test, the
   authors find support for the claim that demand for a product among
   consumers who desire uniqueness may increase as its price increases.

AB People want to have fun, and they are more likely to have fun if the
   situation allows them to justify it. This research studies how people's
   need for justifying hedonic consumption drives two choice patterns that
   are observed in typical purchase contexts. First, relative preferences
   between hedonic and utilitarian alternatives can reverse, depending on
   how the immediate purchase situation presents itself. A hedonic
   alternative tends to be rated more highly than a comparable utilitarian
   alternative when each is presented singly, but the utilitarian
   alternative tends to be chosen over the hedonic alternative when the two
   are presented jointly. Second, people have preferences for expending
   different combinations of time (effort) and money for acquiring hedonic
   versus utilitarian items. They are willing to pay more in time for
   hedonic goods and more in money for utilitarian goods. The author
   explores the topic through a combination of four experiments and field
   studies.

AB Because most conjoint studies are conducted in hypothetical situations
   with no consumption consequences for the participants, the extent to
   which the studies are able to uncover "true" consumer preference
   structures is questionable. Experimental economics literature, with its
   emphasis on incentive alignment and hypothetical bias, suggests that
   more realistic incentive-aligned studies result in stronger
   out-of-sample predictive performance of actual purchase behaviors and
   provide better estimates of consumer preference structures than do
   hypothetical studies. To test this hypothesis, the authors design an
   experiment with conventional (hypothetical) conditions and parallel
   incentive-aligned counterparts. Using Chinese dinner specials as the
   context, the authors conduct a field experiment in a Chinese restaurant
   during dinnertime. The results provide strong evidence in favor of
   incentive-aligned choice conjoint analysis, in that incentive-aligned
   choice conjoint outperforms hypothetical choice conjoint in
   out-of-sample predictions. To determine the robustness of the results,
   the authors conduct a second study that uses snacks as the context and
   considers only the choice treatments. This study confirms the results by
   providing strong evidence in favor of incentive-aligned choice analysis
   in out-of-sample predictions. The results provide a strong motivation
   for conjoint practitioners to consider conducting studies in realistic
   settings using incentive structures that require participants to "live
   with" their decisions.

AB The authors construct a model of the local ketchup market in a Texas
   city that accounts for household, manufacturer, and retailer decisions.
   That is, the model develops both demand and supply sides of the market.
   The authors model the demand side through a latent utility framework
   that allows for a no-purchase option. Accounting for both sides of the
   market enables the authors to check for any endogeneity problems on the
   demand side. They model the supply side through the profit-maximizing
   decisions of the manufacturers and a multiproduct retailer. Accounting
   for both the retailer and the manufacturer decisions enables the authors
   to evaluate the degree of manufacturer competition,
   retailer-manufacturer interactions, and retailer product-category
   pricing. Given the model assumptions and the market being studied, the
   authors find that not accounting for demand endogeneity can create bias
   in the estimation, the retailer seems to price below the static
   profit-maximizing prices for two of the three brands, and the inferred
   marginal wholesale prices are below the equilibrium uniform wholesale
   prices for two brands. The authors discuss the results with regard to
   channel bargaining, quantity discounts, and retailer category pricing.

AB Drawing from need, motivation, and social exchange theories, this study
   conceptualizes and empirically examines the differential curvilinear
   effects of multiple determinants of loyalty intentions, including
   transactional satisfaction, trust, and value for relational exchanges.
   The authors conceptualize trust as a "motivator," satisfaction as a
   "hygiene," and value as a "bivalent" factor in consumer loyalty
   mechanisms. Using consumer data on relational exchanges in two different
   service contexts-retail clothing and nonbusiness airline travel-and
   accounting for different sources of error-namely, measurement, common
   method, and response style-the authors empirically investigate the
   hypothesized mechanisms. The data support the motivator, or the
   enhancing role of trust, and the hygiene, or the maintaining role of
   satisfaction, on loyalty intentions in both contexts. Although the
   authors also obtain consistent results for the influence of value, its
   role is aligned with a hygiene mechanism, not a bivalent mechanism. The
   authors contribute to the study of loyalty antecedents by (1)
   theoretically proposing the nature and shape of the influence of
   different loyalty determinants, (2) considering the simultaneous and
   differential effects of multiple determinants, and (3) drawing
   implications from the results for theory and managerial practice.

AB Multipurpose shopping is a prominent and relevant feature of shopping
   behavior. However, no methodology is available to assess empirically how
   the demand for multipurpose shopping depends on retail agglomeration or,
   in general, the characteristics of retail supply, such as the numbers
   and types of stores in a shopping center or the number of categories in
   a supermarket. The authors propose a nested-logit model that captures
   retail agglomeration effects on consumer choice of shopping trip purpose
   (what to buy) and destination (where to buy). The authors estimate
   parameters representing trip purpose-adjustment and between-store
   attraction effects on shopping trip data collected from a sample of 1704
   households in The Netherlands. Both effects are significant for each of
   the three categories for which the model is estimated. This is
   consistent with the idea of agglomeration effects. The findings suggest
   that agglomeration helps attract not only multipurpose but also
   single-purpose trips. A comparison of multi- and single-purpose trip
   model predictions shows that single-purpose models underpredict the
   number of trips to larger shopping centers.

   relative to gain (i.e., loss aversion). Loss aversion can explain the
   St. Petersburg paradox without requiring concave utility, it has the
   correct psychological foundation, it is theoretically useful, and it is
   a parsimonious principle that can explain many puzzles. A few open
   questions are whether loss aversion is a stable feature of preference,
   whether it is an expression of fear, and what are its properties.

AB In defining limits to loss aversion, Novemsky and Kahneman (2005) offer
   important new data and a needed summary of appropriate ways to think
   about loss aversion. In this comment to Novemsky and Kahneman's article,
   the authors consider the new empirical results that involve
   probabilistic buying and selling, suggesting caution in generalizing the
   results to nonprobabilistic commerce. The authors expand Novemsky and
   Kahneman's summary by exploring two critical constructs that help define
   the boundaries of loss aversion: emotional attachment and cognitive
   perspective. Emotional attachment alters loss aversion by moderating the
   degree to which parting with an item involves a loss, whereas shifts in
   cognitive perspective explain why items typically viewed as a loss are
   given more or less weight. The goal is to use these constructs to
   characterize more specifically contexts in which losses loom larger than
   gains and to suggest specific ways that research into loss aversion
   could evolve.

AB The importance of pricing decisions for firms has fueled an extensive
   stream of research on price elasticities. In an influential
   meta-analytical study, Tellis (1988) summarized price elasticity
   research findings until 1986. However, empirical generalizations on
   price elasticity require modifications because of (1) changes in market
   characteristics (i.e., characteristics of brands, product categories,
   and economic conditions) and (2) changes in the research methodology
   used to assess price elasticities. Therefore, the authors present a
   meta-analysis of price elasticity with new empirical generalizations on
   its determinants. Across a set of 1851 price elasticities based on 81
   studies, the average price elasticity is -2.62. A salient finding is
   that over the past four decades, sales elasticities have significantly
   increased in magnitude, whereas share and choice elasticities have
   remained fairly constant. The authors find that accommodating price
   endogeneity has a strong (magnitude-increasing) impact on price
   elasticities. A striking null result is that accounting for
   heterogeneity does not affect elasticities significantly. The authors
   also present an analysis that explains the difference between their
   findings and Tellis's findings, and they indicate which new price
   elasticity studies are most desirable.

   of the sampled food, a finding that is contrary to what industry experts
   predict. The authors propose a dual-process model of somatosensory
   experiences to account for the findings. In line with the model, the
   findings suggest that the ultimate pleasure that a consumer derives from
   the taste of a food sample depends on two components, an informational
   component and an affective component. Furthermore, the findings suggest

   (informational component) on subsequent choice.

   distinguish an attribute-level model, in which the unit of analysis is
   the market share for an alternative created by aggregation (e.g.,
   Colgate toothpaste), from a truly disaggregate SKU-level model, and they
   establish an analytical relationship between parameters that they obtain
   from the two models. The authors show that SKU-level parameters can be
   recovered by calculation from estimated attribute-level parameters,
   circumventing the need for direct estimation of the more complex
   SKU-level model. They calibrate the store data market share model using
   98 weeks of data for ten brands and 168 SKUs of toothpaste. Rather than
   estimate 168 preference parameters (when there is an "outside"
   alternative in addition to the 168 "inside" ones), it is only necessary
   to estimate ten brand-preference parameters from which the 168
   parameters can be computed, as long as share and marketing-mix data are
   available at the SKU level. Covariate effects, such as marketing-mix
   response parameters, can be recovered in a similar fashion. Holdout
   tests demonstrate superior predictive performance, and the authors
   discuss implications for the derivation of elasticities for new SKU
   introductions.

   extension's success versus failure on customer evaluation of brand
   counterextensions. A counterextension is a brand extension that is
   launched into Category A by Brand 2 that belongs to Category B in a
   reciprocal direction to a launch of a previous extension into Category B
   by Brand 1 that belongs to Category A. The results from five studies
   show that customers evaluate a counterextension more favorably when the
   preceding extension is a success rather than a failure. Furthermore, the
   evaluation of the counterextension is superior if it is launched by a
   major brand, especially if the previous successful extension was also
   launched by a major brand. Finally, a successful extension indirectly
   dilutes a brand and results in a greater loss in choice share to a
   counterextension than does a failed extension. The key findings
   generalize to a sequence of extensions across more than one

   conceptualization that the intrinsic utility for a brand is a function

   The premise is that household preferences for attributes that are common
   across categories are likely to be correlated. The model that the
   authors develop projects the unobserved preferences for attributes to a
   lower dimensional space of unobserved factors. The factors are
   interpretable as household "traits" that transcend categories, and they
   can be used to predict preferences for attributes in new categories. The
   authors apply the proposed model to household panel data for three
   closely related snack categories and for two less-related food
   categories. The authors find strong correlations in preferences for
   product attributes such as brand names and low fat or fat free. This
   study demonstrates that these high correlations in product attribute
   preferences across categories are useful in targeting activities in

   compared with homogeneous designs.

AB Increasingly, firms allow consumers to mass customize their products. In
   this study, the authors investigate consumers' evaluations of different
   mass customization configurations when they are asked to mass customize
   a product. For example, mass customization configurations may differ in
   the number of modules that can be mass customized. In the context of
   mass customization of personal computers, the authors find that mass
   customization configuration affects the product utility that consumers
   can achieve in mass customization as well as their perception of mass
   customization complexity. In turn, product utility and complexity affect
   the utility that consumers derive from using a certain mass
   customization configuration. More specifically, product utility has a
   positive effect and complexity has a negative effect on mass
   customization utility. The effect of complexity is direct as well as
   indirect because complexity also lowers product utility. The authors
   also find that consumers with high levels of product expertise consider
   mass customization configurations less complex than do consumers with
   low levels of product expertise and that for more-expert consumers,
   complexity has a less-negative impact on product utility. The study has
   important managerial implications for how companies can design their
   mass customization configuration to increase utility and decrease
   complexity.

AB Models of distribution channels have defined retailer and manufacturer
   pricing decision variables in different ways, such as absolute retail
   price or absolute retail margin and absolute manufacturer price or
   absolute manufacturer margin. This article examines whether this choice
   of definition affects the equilibrium outcomes from such models. It
   shows that the equilibrium outcomes do not change with these definitions
   if manufacturers are modeled as Stackelberg pricing leaders to their
   retailer. However, if manufacturers are modeled as Bertrand-Nash
   competitors to their retailer or as Stackelberg pricing followers to
   their retailer, the equilibrium outcomes change depending on how the
   retailer's pricing decision variables are defined. Moreover, if in these
   two cases manufacturers and retailer are allowed to define their own
   pricing decision variables, then (1) manufacturers are indifferent about
   choosing among absolute prices, absolute margins, and percentage
   margins, but (2) the retailer chooses percentage margins. These results
   have implications for both theoretical and empirical models of price
   competition in distribution channels.

AB Customers have predictable life cycles. As a result of these life
   cycles, firms that sell multiple products or services frequently observe
   that, in general, certain items are purchased before others. This
   predictable phenomenon provides opportunities for firms to cross-sell
   additional products and services to existing customers. This article
   presents a structural multivariate probit model to investigate how
   customer demand for multiple products evolves over time and its
   implications for the sequential acquisition patterns of naturally
   ordered products. The authors investigate customer purchase patterns for
   products that are marketed by a large midwestern bank. Among the
   substantive findings are that women and older customers are more
   sensitive to their overall satisfaction with the bank than are men and
   younger customers when determining whether to purchase additional
   financial services, and households whose head has a greater level of
   education or is male move more quickly along the financial maturity
   continuum than do households whose head has less education or is female.

AB In the usual multinomial choice model, consumers choose to use "actual
   value" information; that is, utilities are continuous functions of
   product attributes (e.g., choices depend on actual magnitudes of price
   differences). The authors propose an alternative model in which
   consumers use only "ordered value" information; that is, utilities are
   functions only of the relative orderings of the attributes' values
   across alternatives (e.g., choices depend only on the price ordering and
   not on actual prices). The ordered value model is attractive because it
   fits well with psychological evidence that consumers often favor
   decision mechanisms that are cognitively less demanding. Using a
   supermarket shopper panel data set, the authors evaluate four models in
   which (1) all consumers use actual values; (2) all consumers use ordered
   values; (3) some consumers use actual values all the time, and some
   consumers use ordered values all the time; and (4) all consumers use
   both actual values and ordered values but with different propensities.
   In the analysis, the ordered value model finds stronger support than the
   actual value model: Model 1 outperforms Model 2; in the two hybrid
   choice models (Models 3 and 4), ordered value processing is more
   prevalent than actual value processing. These results suggest that
   consumers in some product categories engage more heavily in ordered
   value processing than in actual value processing.

AB Attribute information is not always readily available to consumers. This
   is especially true for ethical attributes, such as labor practices,
   environmental friendliness, and so forth. Intuitively, it might be
   expected that consumers who would use an attribute in their decision
   making should seek attribute information, especially if it is easily
   obtainable. In three studies, the authors measure discrepancies between
   requests for available ethical attribute information and actual use of
   the same attribute in a conjoint task. In both between-subjects and
   within-subjects designs, the authors show that consumers (1)
   underrequest ethical attribute information and (2) are especially likely
   to show request/use inconsistency if they care about the underlying
   ethical issue. Negative emotions, especially the avoidance of anger,
   appear to drive this willful ignorance. These results add to the growing
   literature on avoidance mechanisms and consumer decision making and may
   shed light on when ethical attributes do (and do not) play a role in
   actual purchase behavior.

AB The authors investigate the changing role of marketing communication
   over the life cycle of a new product category. They postulate two
   effects of marketing communication on consumers' choices: an "indirect
   effect" through reduction of uncertainty about product quality and a
   "direct effect" (i.e., more is better). The authors expect that the
   indirect effect is relatively larger in the early, postlaunch stages.
   They develop a structural model of demand that allows for such temporal
   differences in the roles of marketing communication. They use a random
   coefficients discrete choice model with a Bayesian learning process to
   model physician learning about new drugs and market-level data for the
   prescription antihistamines category. They find that marketing
   communication has a primarily indirect effect 6-14 months after
   introduction but that the direct effect subsequently dominates. The
   results suggest that firms should follow a pattern of heavier
   communication at the introduction phase followed by lower levels.

AB In this article, the authors examine cross-cultural variations in how
   people discount the future. Specifically, they predict that people from
   Western cultures are relatively less patient and therefore discount the
   future to a greater degree than do people from Eastern cultures, and
   thus Westerners value immediate consumption relatively more.
   Furthermore, on the basis of regulatory focus theory, the authors
   predict that when Easterners are faced with the threat of a delay in
   receiving a product (i.e., a prevention loss), they are more impatient,
   whereas when Westerners are faced with the threat of not being able to
   enjoy a product early (i.e., a promotion loss), their impatience
   increases. This enhanced impatience manifests in preference for
   expedited consumption of a product purchased online in two studies. In
   both studies, the authors used a priming methodology on "bicultural"
   Singaporean participants; the results support the predictions. In the
   second study, they also found evidence in support of the process-based
   explanation for the interaction between culture and message framing.

AB To attract potential customers, retailers often advertise low prices
   with appeals such as "Prices start at $49" or "One week in the Caribbean
   from $449:'' These appeals are deliberately vague in the sense that they
   give little information about the product to which the prices refer. The
   author offers an explanation of how such advertisements can construct a
   credible price image even with this vagueness. When. retailers must
   incur costs in the process of selling a product, advertising low prices
   to lure potential consumers can backfire. This is because attracting too
   many consumers who are less likely to purchase the retailer's
   higher-priced products on the basis of vague promises imposes unwanted
   selling costs but yields little extra revenue. Therefore, a store with a
   relatively high selling cost will be dissuaded from attempting to use
   such a strategy. The author shows analytically that such advertising can
   be credible only when there is a substantial difference in retailers'
   costs or when the selling cost is high.

   the most promising options are at the beginning of the list, even
   seemingly advantageous factors (e.g., lower search cost, greater

   quality by (1) lowering the average quality of considered options and
   (2) lowering customers' selectivity in focusing attention on the more

   Study 3 shows that greater accuracy motivation in combination with lower

AB The exclusion of firm-specific considerations in the standard
   (economizing calculus) approach to buyer-supplier ties makes the large
   variations in the types of contracts used within the same industry
   unexplainable. This article tests Ghosh and John's (1999) strategizing
   calculus model that purports to close this gap. The core organizing
   principle of this model is a three-way fit among firm resources,
   investments, and governance that yields the highest net receipts. From
   this principle, the authors derive predictions and test them using data
   from 193 original equipment manufacturers that engage independent
   component suppliers. The data show that investments must be aligned with
   more complete contract terms (e.g., fixed prices, "hard" designs) to
   yield cost reduction outcomes for all firms. However, investments must
   be aligned with more incomplete contracts (e.g., cost-plus prices,
   "soft" designs) to yield end-product enhancement outcomes, but only for
   firms with relatively small downstream market margins. Firms with larger
   downstream market margins find that the previous alignment reduces
   end-product enhancements. These results are robust to checks for common
   method bias and alternative estimation procedures. The authors discuss
   practical guidelines for the desired tightness of supplier contract
   terms from the three-way fit principle.

AB This article introduces a framework to help researchers understand the
   mechanisms underlying product returns. The framework draws on research
   in consumer choice, consumer memory, and attitude stability to predict
   how the process that consumers go through at a predecisional stage
   affects their postpurchase behavior. The likelihood of product returns
   is considered contingent on the amount and nature of cognitive responses
   generated during the choice process. In Study 1, the authors focus on
   the impact of the nature of cognitive responses and show that the
   generation of responses of a different nature while choosing directly
   affects the likelihood of choice reversal. The comparative versus
   noncomparative nature of thoughts generated influences their
   diagnosticity and, accordingly, their impact on product returns when
   consumers are exposed to disconfirming information. In Study 2, the
   authors draw on the inoculation theory to manipulate the number of
   prechoice thoughts. They find that when faced with disconfirming
   information favoring a new brand, inoculated consumers who are presented
   with choice alternatives sequentially are less likely to return a brand
   than consumers who are exposed solely to positive information about the
   chosen brand at a prepurchase stage.

AB The marketing literature has addressed the issues of heterogeneity and
   endogeneity when estimating a choice model with household-level panel
   data. When using these data at the stockkeeping unit or the Universal
   Product Code level, choices for each item in each of the time periods
   under consideration cannot be observed. Without such information, it is
   difficult to control for item- and time period-specific unmeasured
   characteristics because there is no information on alternatives during
   those periods in which they are not purchased by any of the panelists.
   In general, when a product category has many alternatives, each with
   fairly small shares, the household sample may not contain sufficient
   choices for each alternative, thus negatively affecting the ability to
   control for endogeneity with household data. In contrast, because
   aggregate store-level data (for those stores in which the panel makes
   purchases) are the aggregation of purchases by all households visiting
   the stores, the data contain the time period-specific item-level
   information required to account for endogeneity as long as each item has
   some sales in each time period. Given the relative merits of household
   data to estimate the distribution of heterogeneity and store-level data
   to address the endogeneity problem, the authors propose an integrated
   estimation procedure that uses the information in both sources. They
   provide empirical results from their model using data on the fabric
   softener market. They extend their approach to situations in which there
   is variation in purchase quantities that households choose.

AB The authors demonstrate that marketing actions, such as pricing, can
   alter the actual efficacy of products to which they are applied. These
   placebo effects stem from activation of expectancies about the efficacy
   of the product, a process that appears not to be conscious. In three
   experiments, the authors show that consumers who pay a discounted price
   for a product (e.g., an energy drink thought to increase mental acuity)
   may derive less actual benefit from consuming this product (e.g., they
   are able to solve fewer puzzles) than consumers who purchase and consume
   the exact same product but pay its regular price. The studies
   consistently support the role of expectancies in mediating this placebo
   effect. The authors conclude with a discussion of theoretical,
   managerial, and public policy implications of the findings.

AB The authors present a new model that links the well-known RFM (recency,
   frequency, and monetary value) paradigm with customer lifetime value
   (CLV). Although previous researchers have made a conceptual link, none
   has presented a formal model with a well-grounded behavioral "story."
   Key to this analysis is the notion of "iso-value" curves, which enable
   the grouping of individual customers who have different purchasing
   histories but similar future valuations. Iso-value curves make it easy
   to visualize the interactions and trade-offs among the RFM measures and
   CLV. The stochastic model is based on the Pareto/NBD framework to
   capture the flow of transactions over time and a gamma-gamma submodel
   for spend per transaction. The authors conduct several holdout tests to
   demonstrate the validity of the model's underlying components and then
   use it to estimate the total CLV for a cohort of new customers of the
   online music site CDNOW. Finally, the authors discuss broader issues and
   opportunities in the application of this model in actual practice.

AB As technology advances, it becomes more feasible to load products with a
   large number of features, each of which individually might be perceived
   as useful. However, too many features can make a product overwhelming
   for consumers and difficult to use. Three studies examine how consumers
   balance their desires for capability and usability when they evaluate
   products and how these desires shift over time. Because consumers give
   more weight to capability and less weight to usability before use than
   after use, they tend to choose overly complex products that do not
   maximize their satisfaction when they use them, resulting in "feature
   fatigue" An analytical model based on these results provides additional
   insights into the feature fatigue effect. This model shows that choosing
   the number of features that maximizes initial choice results in the
   inclusion of too many features, potentially decreasing customer lifetime
   value. As the emphasis on future sales increases, the optimal number of
   features decreases. The results suggest that firms should consider
   having a larger number of more specialized products, each with a limited
   number of features, rather than loading all possible features into one
   product.

AB Loyalty programs lead to a natural split of a firm's customer base into
   members and nonmembers. To manage both groups effectively, it is
   essential to know how marketing activities, such as promotions, affect
   both groups' contributions to revenues. The authors model each group's
   contribution as the number of daily buyers times their average
   expenditures. The model also includes the number of nonbuyers because
   they may return as customers. Moreover, nonbuyers may influence the
   expenditures of other customers through crowding effects, and they use
   personnel time. Model application to two years of daily data from six
   clothing stores reveals that the number of nonmembers who buy is much
   more responsive to price discounts than the number of members who buy.
   Thus, the decomposition of the promotional revenue bump is strongly
   moderated by the percentage price discount and the communication mode:
   direct mail to members only and door-to-door flyers to members and
   nonmembers.

AB This research examines the dynamic process of inference updating. The
   authors present a framework that delineates two mechanisms that guide
   the updating of personality trait inferences about brands. The results
   of three experiments show that chronics (those for whom the trait is
   accessible) update their initial inferences on the basis of the trait
   implications of new information. Notably, nonchronics (those for whom
   the trait is not accessible) also update their initial inferences, but
   they do so on the basis of the evaluative implications of new
   information. The framework adds to the inference-making literature by
   uncovering two distinct paths of inference updating and by emphasizing
   the moderating role of trait accessibility. The findings have direct
   implications for marketers attempting to understand the construction of
   brand personality, and they emphasize the constantly evolving nature of
   brand perceptions and the notion that both the consumer and the marketer
   have important roles to play in this process.

AB The authors develop a general parametric modeling framework for bidding
   behavior in Internet auctions. Toward this end, they incorporate four
   key components of the bidding process under their framework: whether
   people bid on an auction, (if so) who bids, when they bid, and how much
   they bid over the entire sequence of bids in an auction. This integrated
   framework is based on a single, latent, time-varying construct of
   consumer willingness to bid, which bidders have and update for a
   particular auction item over the course of the auction duration. Using a
   database of notebook auctions from one of the largest Internet auction
   sites in Korea, the authors demonstrate that this general (yet
   parsimonious) model captures the key behavioral aspects of bidding
   behavior. Furthermore, the authors provide a valuable tool for managers
   at auction sites to conduct their customer relationship management
   efforts, which require them to evaluate the "goodness" of the listed
   auction items (whether people bid) and the goodness of the potential
   bidders (who bids, when they bid, and how much they bid).

AB The authors propose two generalizations of conjunctive and disjunctive
   screening rules. First, they relax the requirement that an acceptable
   alternative must be satisfactory on one criterion (disjunctive) or on
   all criteria (conjunctive). Second, they relax the assumption that
   consumers make deterministic judgments when evaluating alternatives.
   They combine the two generalizations into a probabilistic
   subset-conjunctive rule, which allows consumers to use any number or
   subset of decision criteria when screening alternatives and permits them
   to be uncertain about the acceptability of attribute levels. These two
   features allow for a screening process that is uncertain and more
   flexible than the deterministic conjunctive and disjunctive rules
   currently described in the literature. The authors describe a
   latent-class method for the estimation of the subset-conjunctive rules
   and the attribute-level consideration probabilities using either
   consideration or choice data. Applications using both types of data
   suggest that the proposed models predict as well as linear models do;
   can make different predictions of consideration, choice, and market
   shares; and provide insights into consumer decision processes that are
   different from those obtained with linear models.

AB Three studies examine the influence of brand-elicited affect on
   consumers' evaluations of brand extensions. When a brand spontaneously
   elicits affective reactions, consumers appear to form an initial
   impression of the brand's new extension based on these reactions. The
   affect that they experience for other reasons and attribute to the brand
   can influence this impression as well. Their later evaluations of the
   extension are then based on this impression. This is true regardless of
   the similarity between the extension and the core brand. These results
   contrast with evidence that affect influences brand extension
   evaluations through its mediating impact on perceptions of
   core-extension similarity. This latter influence occurs only when
   consumers are explicitly asked to estimate the extension's similarity to
   the core before they evaluate it.

AB The authors study business-to-business manufacturers' simultaneous usage
   of vertically integrated (direct) and third-party (indirect) channels of
   distribution to serve one geographical market (possibly comprising
   several market segments) with the same product line. Most theoretical
   approaches to vertical integration of the distribution function pose the
   classic question of whether to forward integrate or use independent
   entities. Having concurrent channels means doing both. This phenomenon
   is poorly understood, even though it has been growing rapidly. The
   authors argue that under certain circumstances, it is impossible for
   manufacturers to prevent channel types from competing with each other,
   either because both channel types contact the same customer or because
   the customer sets them in competition against each other. The authors
   argue that when these situations are frequent or more consequential for
   the parties involved, firms reduce their usage of concurrent channels to
   prevent severe channel conflict. The authors posit five such
   circumstances. Using original data from prominent manufacturers
   operating in competitive markets worldwide, they model usage of both
   types of channels to cover one geography with the same products. They
   find substantial support for their model. Furthermore, in a subset of
   firms that use both channel types in the same market, they model the
   degree to which direct and indirect channels compete destructively
   against each other when contacting the same customers. The authors find
   that suppliers reduce such behavior by incurring costs to differentiate
   each channel's offerings, setting out "rules of engagement," and
   compensating both channel types when either one makes a sale.

AB Retailers typically engage in some form of price discrimination to
   increase profitability. In this article, the authors compare the impact
   on retailer profitability of two price discrimination mechanisms:
   quantity discounts based on package size (second-degree price
   discrimination) and store-level pricing or micromarketing (third-degree
   price discrimination). Whereas the latter has been well addressed in the
   marketing literature, there is limited empirical research on the use of
   quantity discounts for price discrimination. Using store-level sales
   data, the authors estimate a structural demand model, accounting for
   parameter heterogeneity and price endogeneity. They combine the
   parameter estimates with a model of retailer pricing to conduct optimal
   pricing and profitability simulations under several scenarios, ranging
   from constraining the retailer not to engage in any form of price
   discrimination to the least restrictive scenario of setting nonlinear
   price schedules specific to each store. The pricing simulations enable
   the decomposition of profitability as a result of the different forms of
   price discrimination. Profits are greatest when retailers combine
   second- and third-degree price discrimination. The authors find that the
   ability to engage in second-degree price discrimination contributes more
   to retailer profitability than does third-degree price discrimination.

AB Regulatory fit occurs when the manner of peoples' engagement in an
   activity sustains their current goal orientation or concerns with that
   activity. It is proposed that regulatory fit changes the significance of
   consumers' reactions to something, including the perceived monetary
   value of a choice they have made or the persuasiveness of a message they
   have received. When there is a fit, people engage more strongly in and
   "feel right" -about what they are doing, and subsequent evaluative
   reactions (positive or negative) can be intensified by this fit
   experience. The fit experience is shown to influence the strength of
   value experiences independent of hedonic experiences. The authors
   discuss how the fit effect on value is distinct from other factors that
   affect value, such as relevancy, matching, hedonic mood, and arousal.
   Using prior research on this topic, this article summarizes the current
   state of knowledge about how fit influences value and offers new ideas
   for further research.

   regulatory fit. First, they focus on how regulatory orientation is
   sustained. The authors argue that there are two distinct approaches that
   bring about the "just-right feeling": (1) a process-based approach that
   involves the interaction between regulatory orientation and
   decision-making processes and (2) an outcome-based approach that
   involves the interaction between regulatory orientation and the framed
   outcomes offered. Second, the authors discuss possible boundary
   conditions of regulatory fit effects, highlighting the apparent
   paradoxical role of involvement. They suggest that the antecedents that
   give rise to regulatory fit (e.g., lowered motivation) can differ from
   its consequences (e.g., increased motivation). Third, the authors
   discuss broader implications of regulatory fit, proposing three possible
   mechanisms by which regulatory fit can lead to improved physical health
   and discussing the degree to which the just-right feeling plays a role
   in goal-sustaining experiences related to subjective well-being (e.g.,

AB The authors examine how consumers' regulatory focus affects their
   information search behavior and decision-making process. The results
   show that uninvolved research participants rely on their regulatory
   focus as a filter to process information selectively. Participants paid
   more attention to and based their product evaluation on product
   information that is relevant to their regulatory concerns, but only when
   they were not motivated to process information. This regulatory fit
   effect on evaluation seems to be driven by the perceptual salience of
   fit versus nonfit information and is more consistent with heuristic than
   with systematic processing of information.

AB The goal-gradient hypothesis denotes the classic finding from
   behaviorism that animals expend more effort as they approach a reward.
   Building on this hypothesis, the authors generate new propositions for
   the human psychology of rewards. They test these propositions using
   field experiments, secondary customer data, paper-and-pencil problems,
   and Tobit and logit models. The key findings indicate that (1)
   participants in a real cafe reward program purchase coffee more
   frequently the closer they are to earning a free coffee; (2) Internet
   users who rate songs in return for reward certificates visit the rating
   Web site more often, rate more songs per visit, and persist longer in
   the rating effort as they approach the reward goal; (3) the illusion of
   progress toward the goal induces purchase acceleration (e.g., customers
   who receive a 12-stamp coffee card with 2 preexisting "bonus" stamps
   complete the 10 required purchases faster than customers who receive a
   "regular" 10-stamp card); and (4) a stronger tendency to accelerate
   toward the goal predicts greater retention and faster reengagement in
   the program. The conceptualization and empirical findings are captured
   by a parsimonious goal-distance model, in which effort investment is a
   function of the proportion of original distance remaining to the goal.
   In addition, using statistical and experimental controls, the authors
   rule out alternative explanations for the observed goal gradients. They
   discuss the theoretical significance of their findings and the
   managerial implications for incentive systems, promotions, and customer
   retention.

   consumers' discount rates. Consumers exhibit more discounting (e.g.,
   they demand more money to delay income) when delay intervals are
   described by extents of time than when delay intervals are described by
   dates. This pattern holds in various contexts, including gains and
   losses, and is robust to response-mode changes. Findings further
   indicate that this effect may arise because, compared with date

AB The generic data fusion problem is to make inferences about the joint
   distribution of two sets of variables without any direct observations of
   the joint distribution. Instead, information is available only for each
   set separately along with some other set of common variables. The
   standard approach to data fusion creates a fused data set with the
   variables of interest and the common variables. This article develops an
   approach that directly estimates the joint distribution of just the
   variables of interest. For the case of either discrete or continuous
   variables, the approach yields a solution that can be implemented with
   standard statistical models and software. In typical marketing
   applications, the common variables are psychographic or demographic
   variables, and the variables to be fused involve media viewing and
   product purchase. For this example, the approach directly estimates the
   joint distribution of media viewing and product purchase without
   including the common variables. This is the object required for
   marketing decisions. In marketing applications, fusion of discrete
   variables is required. The authors develop a method for relaxing the
   assumption of conditional independence for this case. They illustrate
   their approach with product-purchase and media-viewing data from a large
   survey of British consumers.

AB Manufacturers of consumer products often complain of lower profits in
   light of the growing channel dominance of retailers such as Wal-Mart,
   Home Depot, and other "power retailers". The authors argue that this
   complaint might not be valid. In an analytical model of competing
   manufacturers and competing multiproduct retailers, the authors show
   that manufacturers may actually experience increased profits when a
   retailer gains an exogenous cost advantage over its rival retailer.
   Potential channel efficiencies exist when retailing costs are reduced.
   The authors illustrate that channel transactions based on bilateral
   bargaining capture these efficiencies by transferring market share to
   the more efficient retailer, thus increasing channel profits. In a
   bargaining relationship between a manufacturer and a retailer, the
   manufacturer realizes some of these enhanced efficiencies. The authors
   discuss the managerial implications for pricing in channels.

AB This article focuses on whether banner advertising affects purchasing
   patterns on the Internet. Using a behavioral database that consists of
   customer purchases at a Web site along with individual advertising
   exposure, the authors measure the impact of banner advertising on
   current customers' probabilities of repurchase, while accounting for
   duration dependence. The authors model the probability of a current
   customer making a purchase in any given week (since the last purchase)
   with a survival model that uses a flexible, piecewise exponential hazard
   function. The advertising covariates are purely advertising variables
   and advertising/individual browsing variables. The model is cast in a
   hierarchical Bayesian framework, which enables the authors to obtain
   individual advertising response parameters. The results show that the
   number of exposures, number of Web sites, and number of pages all have a
   positive effect on repeat purchase probabilities, whereas the number of
   unique creatives has a negative effect. Returns from targeting are the
   highest for the number of advertising exposures. The findings also add
   to the general advertising literature by showing that advertising
   affects the purchase behavior of current (versus new) customers.

AB This article examines the role of customers' self-determination, defined
   as a person's perception of joining a firm on his or her own initiative
   versus being induced to join, in influencing relational outcomes for
   firms. In the first two studies, the author finds evidence of more
   relational behaviors (Studies 1 and 2) and higher motivation levels
   regarding purchase (Study 2) among self-determined (versus
   firm-determined) customers. This article also examines how customers'
   self-determination interacts with two types of relational marketing
   programs: reminder coupons, which consumers view as relatively more
   controlling, and relational rewards, which they view as relatively more
   informative of their value to the firm. The results reveal that sending
   a stylized reminder coupon to encourage repeat purchase has negative
   effects (Study 3) and that automatic enrollment in a relational rewards
   program has positive effects on relational behaviors of self-determined
   customers (Study 4). Firm-determined customers are less influenced by
   rewards in both cases. These findings question the effectiveness of
   aggressive acquisition and reminder marketing programs in cultivating
   customer relationships, provide a straightforward way to identify
   attractive relational candidates in consumer settings, and suggest
   methods by which to (and how not to) market to self-determined
   consumers.

AB Household life cycle has been widely used as a determinant of consumer
   behavior and a basis for market segmentation. However, there is
   considerable disagreement about how life stages should be defined and
   how households progress through these stages. Existing studies use a
   priori definitions, which are tested on a cross-sectional survey of
   households collected at a single point in time and thus cannot reveal
   the real dynamics of the household life cycle. The Panel Study of Income
   Dynamics provides longitudinal data on household composition in the
   United States for a period of 34 years; the authors use this to identify
   empirically the most typical stages and paths that U.S. households have
   followed since 1968. They develop a hidden Markov model in which the
   stages of the household life cycle are taken as latent, unobservable
   states that are uncovered from the manifest household demographic
   profiles over the 34 years, assuming that households evolve through
   these latent stages following a first-order Markov process. The authors
   apply their results to classify members of another panel (Consumer
   Expenditure Survey) into life stages, which enables them to study the
   impact of the household life cycle on households' budgetary allocations,
   providing a comprehensive analysis of lifestyles (through expenditure
   patterns) over the household life cycle.

AB Slotting allowances are lump-sum payments by manufacturers to retailers
   for stocking new products. The economic rationale for slotting
   allowances is controversial. Supporters argue that slotting allowances
   are efficiency enhancing; critics argue that they are anticompetitive.
   However, there is no empirical research on this issue because of the
   difficulty in obtaining data about these transactions. Using data on all
   new products that were offered to one retailer for a period of nine
   months, the authors empirically investigate support for the alternative
   rationales for slotting allowances. The analysis indicates that, in
   general, there is more support for the efficiency theories than for the
   anticompetitive theories. The authors find that slotting allowances (1)
   efficiently allocate scarce retail shelf space, (2) help balance the
   risk of new product failure between manufacturers and retailers, (3)
   help manufacturers signal private information about potential success of
   new products, and (4) widen retail distribution for manufacturers by
   mitigating retail competition. The authors find little support for the
   anticompetitive rationales in the data. The empirical support for the
   efficiency rationales suggests that the Federal Trade Commission was
   correct in being circumspect about banning slotting allowances outright.

AB This research examines vertically differentiated retailers' incentives
   to offer price-matching guarantees. It suggests that offering and not
   offering a price-matching guarantee are both signals of a retailer's
   service-price profile, a way of branding the retailer to uninformed
   consumers. The signals are made credible and costless by the presence of
   informed consumers. The authors show that when the service
   differentiation is large enough, only low-service retailers offer
   price-matching guarantees. Data from a sample of Canadian retail chains
   support this prediction. In addition, larger retail chains are more
   likely to offer price-matching guarantees than smaller chains, and
   competition has an interactive effect with service. As the intensity of
   competition a chain faces increases, lower-service retailers are even
   more likely to use a guarantee, and higher-service retailers are less
   likely to do so, suggesting that price-matching guarantees are
   competitive tools, not collusive tools, as the literature has often
   implied.

   some established industries, little is known about how use of the
   Internet lowers prices. The authors address this issue for the
   automobile retailing industry with matched survey and transaction data
   on 1500 car purchases in California. They show that the Internet lowers
   prices for two distinct reasons: First, the Internet informs consumers
   about dealers' invoice prices. Second, the referral process of online
   buying services helps consumers obtain lower prices. The combined
   information and referral price effects are -1.5%, or 22% of dealers'
   average gross vehicle profit. The authors also find that the benefits of
   gathering information differ by consumer type. Buyers who have a high
   disutility of bargaining but who have collected information on the
   specific car they eventually purchase pay 1.5% less than they otherwise
   would. In contrast, buyers who like the bargaining process do not

   the number of previous visits. The authors use a random effects model to
   determine the impact of these factors on site duration and the number of

   heterogeneity that arise from differences among people, Web sites, and
   visit occasions to the same Web site by the same person. The model is
   fit using one month of user-centric panel data, and it encompasses the
   50 most popular sites in a market. The results show that, in general,
   older people and women visit Web sites for a longer period. Some
   surprising results are revealed in an examination of interactions
   between these demographic and site characteristic variables. For
   example, sites with higher levels of advertising usually result in lower
   visit duration, but this is not the case for older people. The model
   also yields insights into the relative importance of different sources

   dominates over individual-level and Web site-specific heterogeneity.

   values. The second part of the research involves empirical analyses of
   customer-level data from a newspaper and an online grocer. In both data

   The differences observed in predictive accuracy across submissions could
   change the profitability of a churn management campaign by hundreds of

   very little decrease in performance if they are used to predict churn

   researchers use a variety of modeling "approaches," characterized by
   variables such as estimation technique, variable selection procedure,
   number of variables included, and time allocated to steps in the

AB A common assumption underlying the analysis of consumers' choices among
   optional tariffs is that consumers choose the tariff that maximizes
   their surplus and, thus, the tariff that leads to the lowest billing
   rate for a given amount of usage. Yet there is evidence that many users
   prefer a flat rate even though their billing rate would be lower with a
   pay-per-use tariff (flat-rate bias), and some users prefer a pay-per-use
   tariff even though they would save money with a flat rate (pay-per-use
   bias). The authors conduct four empirical analyses based on three
   different data sets. They show that the flat-rate bias is more important
   and has a greater regularity and time persistence than the pay-per-use
   bias. They classify potential causes of the flat-rate bias as "insurance
   effect," "taxi meter effect;" "convenience effect," and "overestimation
   effect" and show that the insurance, the taxi meter, and the
   overestimation effects lead to a flat-rate bias. They provide evidence
   that underestimation of usage is a major cause of the pay-per-use bias.
   They show that the flat-rate bias does not significantly increase
   customer churn and thus results in a short- and long-term profit
   increase. In contrast, the pay-per-use bias largely increases churn so
   that in the long run, the additional short-term profit is offset by
   higher churn.

AB Compared with other markets, those with competing technological

   This article examines how standards competition affects consumer
   behavior, an issue that has been relatively neglected by previous
   research in this area. The results show that consumers depend on
   different types of information in their adoption decisions and respond
   differently to advertising. Specifically, the authors find that
   standards competition motivates consumers to pay more attention to
   information that is comparative in nature. Thus, information about the
   relative (absolute) performance of a product has a stronger (weaker)
   impact on a product's share in markets with standards competition (Study
   1). Standards competition also moderates the effectiveness of different
   advertising formats: It strengthens the effect of comparative
   advertisements but weakens the effect of noncomparative advertisements
   (Study 2). As a result, two commonly observed drawbacks of comparative
   advertisements-negative attitude toward the ad and source
   confusion-disappear in the presence of standards competition (Study 2),
   and comparative advertisements even induce greater confidence in the
   advertised brand (Study 3). Finally, in the presence of standards
   competition, the superiority of comparative advertisements is stronger
   when the advertised brand has a disadvantage in terms of brand
   familiarity than when it has an advantage (Study 3). This research takes
   a step toward a better understanding of these important but
   underexplored issues and provides managerial insights for firms that
   launch new products in markets with competing standards.

AB This research presents a feature-based statistical model and
   subsequently explores the degree to which similarity perceptions between
   two advertisements can be decomposed and explained by a
   "weighted-and-summed" distance measure, computed on the advertisements'
   executional elements, after controlling for familiarity and viewers'
   attitudinal responses toward the advertisements. Furthermore, the
   authors obtain empirical findings in two major areas: First, variation
   in similarity ratings can be explained by the advertisements' features,
   a finding of potential importance for advertisement construction.
   Second, some, but not all, executional elements that have been shown (in
   the literature) to drive. recall and persuasion are effective at driving
   perceptions of similarity. This is of practical importance because
   managers want their advertisements not only to be liked and remembered
   but also (possibly) to be perceived as similar (or dissimilar) to those
   for other products. In particular, an understanding of which items drive
   which constructs (recall and persuasion, or similarity) can contribute
   to a more effective overall marketing strategy.

AB Most choices in the real world follow other choices or judgments. The
   authors show that a prior choice, which activates and boosts a positive
   self-concept, subsequently licenses the choice of a more self-indulgent
   option. The authors propose that licensing can operate by committing to
   a virtuous act in a preceding choice, which reduces negative
   self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries.
   Five studies demonstrate the proposed licensing effect of a prior
   commitment to a virtuous act on subsequent choice. Consistent with the
   authors' theory, the preference for an indulgent option diminishes if
   the licensing task is attributed to an external motivation. The authors
   also report a mediation analysis in support of their theoretical
   explanation that the licensing effect operates by providing a temporary

   review consensus and cumulative word of mouth, on the strength of the

   both at the release phase across movies and over the postrelease phase
   for any movie. Notably, they hypothesize and show that sequels and

   office revenues. This is an important finding because though most firms
   use multiple signals for their products, empirical work on the
   interaction of two or more signals is rare. This study offers several

AB Marketing is an applied science that tries to explain and influence how
   firms and consumers behave in markets. Marketing models are usually
   applications of standard economic theories, which rely on strong
   assumptions of rationality of consumers and firms. Behavioral economics
   explores the implications of the limits of rationality, with the goal of
   making economic theories more plausible by explaining and predicting
   behavior more accurately while maintaining formal power. This article
   reviews six behavioral economics models that are useful to marketing.
   Three models generalize standard preference structures to allow for
   sensitivity to reference points and loss aversion, social preferences
   toward outcomes of others, and preference for instant gratification. The
   other three models generalize the concept of game-theoretic equilibrium,
   allowing decision makers to make mistakes, encounter limits on the depth
   of strategic thinking, and equilibrate by learning from feedback. The
   authors also discuss a specific marketing application for each of these
   six models. The goal of this article is to encourage marketing
   researchers to apply these models. Doing so will raise technical
   challenges for modelers and will require thoughtful input from
   psychologists who study consumer behavior. Consequently, such models
   could create a common language both for modelers who prize formality and
   for psychologists who prize realism.

AB The author comments on the article by Ho, Lim, and Camerer (2006), which
   showcases the potential of the new behavioral economics approach to
   marketing with six theoretical "case studies' " Each case study
   describes a new model of consumer behavior or competitive marketing
   interactions. The author raises two general questions about such models.
   The first question is whether behavioral economics is, in reality, a new
   form of theoretical psychology, competing with existing psychological
   models and theories and subject to the same vulnerability to evidence as
   applies to psychological theory. The author argues that behavioral
   economists are ambivalent about this point, sometimes claiming
   psychological realism or plausibility as a necessary modeling
   requirement and other times introducing assumptions for modeling
   convenience. The second question is whether the impact of behavioral
   economics on marketing will be experienced more strongly through the
   development of new quantitative models or through the exploration of
   qualitative lessons stimulated by behavioral violations of rationality.
   It is argued that behavioral economics not only contributes new modeling
   instruments but, through its documentation of rationality violations or
   "anomalies,'' can provide a rich source of intuitions and insights into
   consumer psychology as well.

AB Because many hedonic stimuli (e.g., movies, vacations, food) are often
   consumed in the company of other people, it is important to know how
   social influence affects the enjoyment of shared experiences.
   Extrapolation from informational and normative influences suggests that
   enjoyment is enhanced when others offer positive opinions and diminished
   when they offer negative opinions about shared stimuli. In this article,
   the authors propose an alternative model. Building on the need to belong
   and the need for accuracy, the authors predict that enjoyment from
   sharing stimuli depends on consumers' perceived interpersonal agreements
   about the shared stimuli, such that congruence of opinions enhances and
   incongruence of opinions diminishes the enjoyment of the shared
   experience. The results from three experiments support the authors'
   predictions and indicate that under some circumstances, social influence
   can operate in opposite directions on judgments of shared stimuli and on
   the enjoyment of sharing them.

AB Preference heterogeneity is a major research stream in marketing aimed
   at quantifying and understanding the diversity of demand for product
   attributes and attribute levels. In experimental settings, in which
   consumers are presented with simple descriptions of product offerings,
   continuous distributions of heterogeneity, such as the multivariate
   normal, provide a useful representation of preference. However, in more
   complex cases in which respondents have value for only a few of the
   benefits associated with an offering or cognitive constraints that
   result in selective attention to a subset of the information available,
   continuous distributions of heterogeneity do not reflect the possibility
   that a subset of the variables has nonzero effect sizes for different
   respondents. Identifying Which attributes are used in a brand choice
   decision is closely related to the statistical procedure of variable
   selection. This article extends variable selection methods to
   accommodate heterogeneity across consumers and data contexts, conditions
   frequently encountered in marketing studies. The authors apply the
   methods to a discrete-choice conjoint study in which data are collected
   in both full-profile and partial-profile formats.

AB In an effort to advance measurement analysis in marketing research, the
   authors propose three extensions of the current scale development
   paradigm. First, the authors focus attention on the trait-state
   distinction and present a model that separates stable sources of
   substantive variation in a construct from transient sources. Second, the
   authors develop a classification of measurement error that distinguishes
   six types of error on the basis of (1) whether the error is stable or
   transient and (2) whether the error affects individual items, subsets of
   items, or all items in a scale. They also show how these errors can be
   modeled using a factor-analytic specification. Third, the authors argue
   that marketing researchers should make the means of scale items an
   explicit component of measurement analysis and should test for the
   invariance of item loadings and intercepts as a prerequisite for
   meaningful comparisons of scale means across samples and over time. To
   illustrate the benefits of the proposed procedure, the authors present
   an extended application of the model to the constructs of brand loyalty
   and deal proneness.

AB The authors put forth a sales response model to explain the differences
   in immediate and dynamic effects of promotional prices and regular
   prices on sales. The model consists of a vector autoregression that is
   rewritten in error correction format, which allows the authors to
   disentangle the immediate effects from the dynamic effects. In a second
   level of the model, the immediate price elasticities, the cumulative
   promotional price elasticity, and the long-term regular price elasticity
   are correlated with various brand-specific and. category-specific
   characteristics. The model is applied to seven years of data on weekly
   sales of 100 different brands in 25 product categories. The authors find
   many significant moderating effects on the elasticity of price
   promotions. Brands in categories that are characterized by high price
   differentiation and that constitute a lower share of budget are less
   sensitive to price discounts. Deep price discounts increase the
   immediate price sensitivity of customers. The authors also find
   significant effects for the cumulative elasticity. The immediate effect
   of a regular price change is often close to zero. The long-term effect
   of such a regular price decrease usually amounts to an increase in
   sales. This is especially true in categories that are characterized by a
   large price dispersion and frequent price promotions and for hedonic,
   nonperishable products.

AB Retail pricing data combine multiple decisions (e.g., regular pricing
   and discounting) that are possibly made by multiple decision makers
   (e.g., retailers and manufacturers). For example, temporary price,
   reductions (high-frequency price changes) can be used to price
   discriminate in the short run, whereas regular price adjustments
   (low-frequency price changes) might reflect changes in long-term costs
   or demand. Time disaggregation cannot disentangle these factors, because
   frequency aggregation exists even when data are analyzed at the lowest
   possible level of temporal aggregation. Because little is known about
   the nature of pricing interactions across various planning cycles, this
   article develops several empirical generalizations about the role of
   periodicity in pricing. Using week-store stockkeeping-unit-level price
   data in 35 grocery categories, the authors find that (1) cross-brand
   correlation in prices occurs at multiple planning horizons, and the
   planning horizon of the predominant interaction does. not typically
   coincide with the sampling rate of the data; (2) aggregating pricing
   interactions across frequencies obscures distinct and different
   interactions; (3) pricing interactions are related to category- and
   brand-specific factors, such as mean interpurchase times; (4) regular
   price changes explain most of the variation in prices; and (5)
   periodicity can affect inferences about the nature of competition within
   a category. The authors conclude by discussing several practical
   marketing applications for which marketing decisions across frequencies
   have relevance.

AB The ability to convert inputs into outputs is a critical determinant of
   success in many fields of endeavor. In this research the authors study
   the ability of firms to convert ideas into products, that is, their
   conversion ability. Specifically, they address the question, Why are
   some firms better at conversion than others? In contrast to much of the
   existing literature, the authors propose that a strong focus on speed
   and on generating many ideas may actually hurt firms by lowering their
   conversion ability. The authors test their arguments on data between
   1960 and 2001 from a cross national sample of pharmaceutical firms. They
   find that firms vary widely in their ability to convert promising drug
   ideas into launched drugs. Firms with the highest conversion ability are
   those that (1) focus on a moderate number of ideas, in areas of
   importance, and in areas in which they have expertise and (2) deliberate
   for a moderate length of time on promising ideas.

AB The purpose of this article is to quantify the net unit and net profit
   impact of promotions for a retailer and to understand the key correlates
   of this impact. Using data on all promotions offered in 2003 by CVS, a
   leading U.S. drug retailer, the authors (1) quantify the gross
   promotional lift; (2) decompose this into switching, stockpiling, and
   incremental lift for the retailer; (3) estimate the extent to which
   promotion affects sales of other product categories in the store to
   compute the net unit impact of the promotion; (4) account for
   promotional and nonpromotional margins and manufacturer funding to
   compute the net profit impact of the promotion; and (5) examine how
   promotion, brand, category, and store characteristics influence the net
   impact. The authors find that approximately 45% of the gross lift is
   incremental for CVS, and there is also a significant, positive halo
   effect on sales of other categories. However, on average, the net profit
   impact of promotions is negative because CVS's promotional margin is
   often substantially less than regular margin. In the authors' analysis
   of the correlates of net impact, they find that many promotion and brand
   characteristics have opposing associations with net unit and net profit
   impact. Deep, featured promotions on high "consumer-pull" brands
   generate high net unit impact, but they significantly reduce CVS's
   promotional margin, resulting in lower net profit impact. Therefore, the
   retailer must make some difficult trade-offs between revenue and profit
   objectives in promotion decisions.

AB In a collaborative study with a major Dutch retailer, the authors assess
   the short- and long-term effects of a 25% item reduction on-category
   sales. On an aggregate level, a major assortment reduction can lead to
   substantive short-term category sales losses but only a weak negative
   long-term category sales effect. Short-term category sales losses are
   caused mainly by fewer category purchases by former buyers of delisted
   detergent items. However, the results also show that the assortment
   reduction attracts new category buyers. These new buyers partially
   offset the sales losses among former buyers of the delisted items. The
   collection of supplemental process data on assortment perceptions and
   actual search time in the test stores before and after the assortment
   reduction provides evidence that delisting results in an increase in
   perceived search efficiency and a decrease in actual search time.

AB The marketing and sales functions in many firms are often at odds
   despite their common goal of increasing revenue and profit. The finger
   pointing goes both ways: Marketing complains of poor lead follow-up by
   sales, and in turn, sales grumbles about the quality of leads generated
   by marketing. This disconnect can be damaging; high lead volumes
   generated through effective marketing campaigns could actually hurt
   downstream sales because of wasted effort on poorly qualified leads
   and/or delays in sales follow-up resulting from limited sales force
   capacity. To examine the revenue and profit implications of coordinated
   communications efforts at the marketing-sales interface, the authors
   develop a three-stage model that captures the effects of sequential
   marketing/sales communications on lead generation, appointment
   conversion, and sales closure. The results, which are based on a
   collaborative effort with a large home improvement retailer, suggest a
   complex interplay among marketing efforts (multiple media that generate
   leads), delays in follow-up (time lag between inquiry and sales force
   contact), and sales efficiencies (appointment and sales conversion). The
   findings underscore the impact of multimedia spending on the timing and
   effectiveness of subsequent communications, implying that improved
   internal collaboration between marketing and sales can offer significant
   upside potential for the firm. Finally, the authors develop a managerial
   decision support tool to simulate the impact of varying communications
   budgets, timing, and allocation on the marketing and sales planning
   system.

AB Retailers face considerable risk in introducing new products because of
   high failure rates. Given the proliferation of new products juxtaposed
   against finite shelf space, retail buyers are confronted with a choice
   problem. To enhance understanding of this issue, the authors examine the
   role of buyer-salesperson and firm-firm relationships using data
   collected in the context of actual new product selection by retail
   buyers at two large grocery retailers in the United States. The findings
   indicate that buyer-salesperson and firm-firm relationships have a
   greater influence on new product acceptance when a new product's
   attractiveness is modest than when the new product is very unattractive
   or very attractive. At modest levels of product attractiveness, the
   likelihood of new product acceptance can increase by as much as 60% when
   the buyer has a strong relationship with the salesperson. The study
   provides insights into the complex interplay of marketing relationships
   and product attractiveness in retail buyers' selection of new products.

AB The extant retail category pricing optimization literature concentrates
   on grocery retailing. In contrast, this article focuses on the problem
   of determining profit-improving store-level prices of failure-related
   "hard-part" product categories at a U.S. specialty automotive part
   retailer with 3400 stores. There are some key institutional differences
   between automotive hard-part and grocery retailing: No syndicated data
   are available for hard parts; each subclass of a hard-part category
   contains variants that are ordered by quality (typically "Good:''
   "Better," "Best;''); there is intra-but no intersubclass competition;
   market shares of variants and their prices are not positively correlated
   within a subclass; a consumer enters the market only infrequently; and
   at a purchase occasion, a consumer buys one and only one variant within
   a subclass and one and only one unit of that variant. Using two years of
   weekly sales histories from 800 stores, the authors develop store-level
   demand models for 23 subclasses of a hard part and employ these with
   available product cost data to set prices of variants of each subclass
   at each store that increase profit. The authors test the
   model-recommended prices for 10 subclasses in a field experiment
   involving 500 stores, leading to a projection of an annual increase of
   more than $610,000 in the retailer's profit from these 10 subclasses if
   the new prices are applied at all stores. The empirical analysis also
   yields new insights into asymmetric price competition across quality
   variants and deviations of actual from optimal prices that run counter
   to previous grocery retailing-based findings.

AB In this era of increasing obesity and increasing threats of legislation

   pointedly asked how "low-fat" nutrition claims may influence food
   consumption. The authors develop and test a framework that contends that
   low-fat nutrition labels increase food intake by (1) increasing
   perceptions of the appropriate serving size and (2) decreasing
   consumption guilt. Three studies show that low-fat labels lead all
   consumers-particularly those who are overweight-to overeat snack foods.
   Furthermore, salient objective serving-size information (e.g., "Contains
   2 Servings") reduces overeating among guilt-prone, normal-weight
   consumers but not among overweight consumers. With consumer welfare and
   corporate profitability in mind, the authors suggest win-win packaging

   three experiments show greater decline in consumers' discount rates with
   time horizon (i.e., greater present bias) when they defer than when they
   expedite consumption. These results are robust to using monetary and
   nonmonetary outcomes, as well as to different time horizons (months,

AB Marketers and academics have long been interested in understanding what
   drives impulsive behavior and have focused on what causes a person to
   indulge. The three experiments reported in this article examine reasons
   that underlie urges that strengthen over time and cause people to
   overindulge from a goal-theoretic view of impulsiveness. The authors
   demonstrate that impulsivity is characterized by generalized reward
   sensitivity and by an activation of chronic goals to seek pleasure in
   various domains (Experiment 1). Furthermore, through a moment-to-moment
   tracking of desires, the authors demonstrate that such chronic goals,
   particularly in conjunction with temporarily primed goals, provide the
   momentum for impulsive people to override their self-control goals,
   leading to a strengthening of desires over time (Experiment 2). In turn,
   this causes impulsive people to behave even more impulsively when their
   activated hedonic goals are not satiated (Experiment 3). The findings
   suggest that contextual cues have powerful influences on impulsive
   behavior over time when acting in conjunction with chronic hedonic
   goals. The results have public policy implications for behaviors such as
   binge drinking and unrestrained eating.

AB Several studies show that information used to screen alternatives
   becomes less important than information acquired later in the search
   process simply because it was used to screen. Experiment 1 shows that
   the tendency to deemphasize prescreening information leads to
   systematically different choices for decision makers who screen
   alternatives compared with decision makers who do not screen
   alternatives. Additional studies show that screening encourages decision
   makers to shift their emphasis from prescreening information to
   postscreening information (Experiment 2). Prescreening information is
   deemphasized because of the categorization that occurs when people
   create a consideration set of retained alternatives (Experiments 3 and
   4). Together, the results show that a brand's strength of consideration
   (i.e., how highly an option ranks on screening criteria) may have little
   influence on the likelihood of it being chosen in a postscreening choice
   process.

AB Casual observation suggests that firms use contrasting practices and
   procedures when offering customized products to individual customers.
   Some firms take a "hands-off" approach and let customers self-select
   their desired product. In contrast, other firms are proactively involved
   in designing customized solutions to individual customer needs. The
   authors call the former "low vendor customization control" and the
   latter "high vendor customization control." Despite the strategic
   importance of customization, no research has shed light on the rationale
   for using these contrasting approaches to customization and their
   normative consequences. The authors develop a conceptual model that
   contends that the appropriate level of vendor control over the
   customization decision is a function of technology and knowledge
   considerations. They use data on 304 procurement arrangements for
   customized products to test their hypotheses and to explore the
   normative ramifications for three key measures of performance: closeness
   of the delivered product to customer needs, delivery performance, and
   the vendor's operating profits. The results show that contracting
   parties choose the level of vendor control over customization in a
   strategic and discriminating way to enhance the benefits from
   customization for both parties. The authors discuss implications for
   both theory and practice.

AB In this article, the author proposes and applies an empirical two-stage
   choice model to Internet clickstream data that captures observed choices
   for two choice stages: products viewed and products purchased. The model
   allows for interdependences between choices within a stage as well as
   the use of varying decision rules in each stage. The author accommodates
   heterogeneity in preferences and in decision rules. The proposed model
   uses observed choices to infer both attribute preference ratings and
   criterion attributes. The results show empirically, in a field setting,
   that the product attributes evaluated in Stage 1 differ from those
   evaluated in Stage 2. Consistent with existing theory, consumers tend to
   use simpler decision rules based on a subset of attribute information in
   earlier stages. The author also finds some preliminary evidence that
   attributes such as price and size tend to be considered in only one of
   the two stages, whereas ingredient attributes tend to be considered in
   both stages. From a managerial perspective, the identification of
   criterion attributes, coupled with the preference parameters estimated
   by the model, can assist with the targeting and positioning of
   promotional strategies.

   salespeople to test alternative models of antecedents and consequences
   of adaptive selling behavior (ASB) and customer orientation (CO). A
   random-effects meta-analysis yields average values for 28 different

   Controlling for salesperson gender and selling experience, structural
   equation modeling indicates that ASB increases self-rated,
   manager-rated, and objective measures of performance, whereas CO
   increases only self-rated performance. Both ASB and CO increase job
   satisfaction. Tests of reciprocal relationships indicate that ASB
   increases CO and job satisfaction increases performance rather than vice
   versa. Selling experience increases performance but not job
   satisfaction, and saleswomen rate their performance and satisfaction
   slightly higher than salesmen do. The magnitudes of the relationships
   indicate that ASB and selling experience have greater effects than CO
   and gender on salesperson performance.

   concept and relevance of a "national brand." Across time, the authors
   find that the geographic differences in market shares for national
   brands are persistent and thus are attributed to "long-term" outcomes.
   The objective of this article is to open a discussion on these
   surprising stylized findings related to geography in the food and

   consumer packaged goods data contain rich information about long-term

AB Using data from 50 U.S. markets, Bronnenberg, Dhar, and Dube (2007)
   observe that geographic variation is the predominant source of variation
   in national brand market shares. The authors of this comment extend this
   surprising and previously undocumented result in several respects.
   First, they replicate this basic finding in France and find that it is
   robust to time and region aggregation and data duration. Second, because
   of regional variation in chain locations and the limited research on the
   relative effect of chains on market shares, they link chain effects to
   market shares in France. The authors find that (1) chain effects explain
   more variation in market share than either time or region effects and
   (2) the addition of chain effects attenuates region-specific effects.
   Thus, chain structure is both another source of regional variation in
   demand and an important consideration in its own right. Finally, by
   coupling brand-time effects with longer data, the authors note that
   brand-time effects are larger than brand-region effects in France. This
   result suggests the importance of long-term effects in marketing and the
   need to collect longer durations of data to explain variation in market
   shares.

   markets, which are feasible methods for evaluating pricing and

   this article, the authors show how the framework of structural modeling

   also show how to assess the economic value of each channel to each firm
   and to its customers. They apply such policy simulations to the personal

   through various channels using multiple products. The analysis
   quantifies the profit impact on firms and the welfare impact on
   consumers of many proposed channel actions and provides an economic
   rationale for different actions observed in this marketplace, such as
   decisions to add or drop marketing channels. The authors also simulate
   the effects of the Hewlett-Packard-Compaq merger but go beyond a
   standard merger analysis by evaluating the effects of various potential

AB Theoretical work on the pricing of information reveals that competition
   between independent information sellers can result in prices that are
   negatively related to the quality or reliability of the information. The
   theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low
   quality), independent products become complements, and competition can
   increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the
   theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental
   market based on a business simulation. Information products are market
   forecasts that are available from different competing information
   sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated
   marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and
   buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit
   (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to
   one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and
   low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information
   products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both
   buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The
   results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After
   some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly
   different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly
   higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover,
   with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher
   than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers.

AB Corporate acquisitions are strategic actions that loom large in the
   minds of many senior managers. Despite decades of study, little
   systematic research exists on a central question: Why do the
   acquisitions of some firms perform better than those of others? The work
   that has examined this question has mostly focused on deal-specific
   variables (i.e., how the acquisitions are conducted). In this article,
   the authors highlight a firm-specific, marketing-driven variable-namely,
   product capital-that affects acquisition performance and predicts which
   firms are better positioned to acquire in the first place. The authors
   also present a mechanism by which product capital affects
   performance-namely, through acquirers' superior selection and deployment
   of targets' innovation potential. This article shows that firms with
   high product capital (i.e., those with greater product development and
   support assets) make smarter acquisition decisions. Such firms are
   better at selecting targets with innovation potential and then deploying
   this potential to gain competitive advantage. The performance
   consequences of this superiority in the selection and deployment of
   target firms manifest in the long-term financial rewards to the
   acquiring firm. The results of an analysis of acquisitions in the
   pharmaceutical industry across seven countries and over 11 years
   (1992-2002) provide empirical support for the arguments.

   However, the impact of these competitor alliances on financial

   both survey and archival data, the authors conduct two studies that
   reveal that the intensity of a firm's alliances with its competitors has
   a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) influence on return on equity. In
   addition, the authors find that a firm's competitor orientation, as
   embodied in its strategies and objectives, can strengthen or weaken this
   curvilinear effect. Overall, these findings indicate that both
   competition and cooperation have dark sides that a firm must carefully

AB Calorie underestimation is often alleged to contribute to obesity. By
   developing a psychophysical model of meal size estimation, the authors
   show that the association between body mass and calorie underestimation
   found in health science research is a spurious consequence of the
   tendency of high-body-mass people to choose-and thus estimate-larger
   meals. In four studies involving consumers and dieticians, the authors
   find that the calorie estimations of high- and low-body-mass people
   follow the same compressive power function; that is, they exhibit the
   same diminishing sensitivity to meal size changes as the size of the
   meal increases. The authors also find that using a piecemeal
   decomposition improves calorie estimation and leads people to choose
   smaller, but equally satisfying, fast-food meals. The findings that
   biases in calorie estimation are caused by meal size and not body size
   have important implications for allegations against the food industry
   and for the clinical treatment of obesity.

AB The consequences of illness have two crucial types of stakes: for the
   self and for the family. Therefore, this research examines the
   effectiveness of health messages that present consequences for the self
   or for the family, focusing specifically on the dual role of emotions in
   serving these stakes as a provider of resources and information. The
   authors theorize that (1) the valence dimension of discrete emotions
   influences resources, thus fostering or hindering the processing of
   aversive health information, whereas (2) the self-/other-relatedness
   dimension of discrete emotions provides information that interacts with
   the focal referent in the message (self or family) to determine
   compatibility. In Experiments 1-3, the authors demonstrate that when
   people are primed with a positive emotion (e.g., happiness,
   peacefulness), the compatibility between the referent and the discrete
   emotion fosters the processing of health information. When the primed
   emotion is negative (e.g., sadness, agitation), however, compatibility
   hinders processing of the message. In Experiment 4, the authors track
   emotions before and after exposure to a health message to demonstrate
   that the observed effect occurs because of an increase in the negative
   emotional state in compatible situations when people process
   disease-related information. The authors conclude by discussing the
   implications of the findings for increasing the effectiveness of health.

   negatively affects people's responses to subsequent advertising from
   both the same source and second-party sources. This negative bias
   operates through a process of defensive stereotyping, in which the
   initial deception induces negative beliefs about advertising and
   marketing in general, thus undermining the credibility of further
   advertising.

AB Several influential streams of research in marketing, psychology, and
   economics conclude that when an offer a seller makes to a buyer is held
   fixed, the buyer will be repelled if he or she learns that some other
   group of buyers is getting a better price for the same benefits or
   receiving more benefits for the same price. Prior work has attributed
   this repulsion to perceptions that the offer is inequitable, that it
   fits others better, or that it suggests that the core product is of low
   value. In six experiments, the authors show conditions under which
   exactly the opposite can occur; that is, consumers judge the same offer
   to be more attractive when a seller offers a better price or more
   benefits to another group than when the seller treats everyone equally.

AB Since the emergence of neoclassical economics, individual decision
   making has been viewed largely from an outcome-maximizing perspective.
   Building on previous work, the authors suggest that when people make
   payment decisions, they consider not only their preferences for
   different alternatives but also guiding principles and behavioral rules.
   The authors describe and test two characteristics pertaining to one
   specific rule that dictates that consumers should not pay for delays,
   even if they are beneficial: rule invocation and rule override. The
   results show that money can function as the invoking cue for this rule,
   that the reliance on this rule can undermine utility maximization, and
   that this rule may be used as a first response to the decision problem
   but can be overridden. The article concludes with a discussion of more
   general applications of such rules, which may explain some of the
   seemingly systematic inconsistencies in the ways consumers behave.

AB Evidence reveals that many customers who state that they are satisfied
   with a service provider nevertheless defect. In this article, the
   authors focus on identifying which customers are vulnerable to defection
   despite their stated high levels of satisfaction. Building on the
   recently developed Judgment Uncertainty and Magnitude Parameters (JUMP)
   model, the authors decompose customers' stated satisfaction into two
   related but independent facets-satisfaction level and satisfaction
   strength-and then examine the role of satisfaction strength in the
   translation of satisfaction into loyalty. Using data from an ongoing
   customer satisfaction tracking study being conducted by a large
   U.S.-based service organization, Study 1 examines the role of
   satisfaction strength in shaping the satisfaction-loyalty link in a
   business-to-business setting. Study 2, a conceptual replication in a
   business-to-consumer context, examines the hypothesized relationships in
   a service failure/recovery situation. The studies strongly demonstrate
   that satisfaction strength plays a central role in the translation of
   stated satisfaction into loyalty. A key finding is that though
   satisfaction translates into loyalty when satisfaction is strongly held
   (i.e., low uncertainty), the translation is significantly lowered, on
   average, by approximately 60% when the same satisfaction is more weakly
   held (i.e., high uncertainty). The studies also indicate that prior
   relationship aspects (length of relationship, volume of business, and
   favorability of prior experiences) result in even greater vulnerability.

AB Customers' expectations are key determinants of their consumption
   experiences, satisfaction, and loyalty. The authors examine alternative
   theoretical predictions about the impact of stating expectations before
   purchase on postpurchase perceptions of the shopping experience and the
   firm. In particular, the authors suggest that asking customers to
   articulate their expectations can backfire and lead to lower
   postpurchase evaluations of the shopping and consumption experience. A
   series of field experiments indicate that compared with a control group,
   stating prepurchase expectations leads customers to focus on negative
   aspects of the shopping experience and perceive the same performance
   more negatively. The tendency for consumers to rate their shopping
   experiences less favorably after stating prepurchase expectations is
   inconsistent with confirmation bias as well as assimilation, contrast,
   and positivity effects. The final study contrasts the impact of stating
   expectations about the next store shopping experience with the impact of
   evaluating the store's past performance. The results show that though
   (prepurchase) expectations are indistinguishable from evaluations of the
   store's past performance, the former leads to lower postpurchase than
   prepurchase evaluations, whereas the latter tends to generate higher
   postpurchase evaluations. The article concludes with a discussion of the
   theoretical and practical implications of this research.

   loyalty vested specifically in his or her salesperson. They find that
   only salesperson-owned loyalty, a newly identified construct, directly
   affects the more tangible seller financial outcomes of sales growth and
   selling effectiveness, whereas both salesperson-owned loyalty and
   loyalty to the selling firm increase the customer's willingness to pay a
   price premium. A longitudinal study verifies that the positive effect of
   salesperson-owned loyalty on sales growth persists over time. However,
   because salesperson-owned loyalty simultaneously increases the seller's
   risk of losing business if the salesperson defects to a competitor,
   managers need to manage Effectively the benefit-risk trade-off.
   Increasing relationship-enhancing activities and value received by the
   customer builds both salesperson-owned loyalty and loyalty to the

   activities is moderated by selling-firm consistency and by the selling
   firm's and salesperson's loyalty-capturing strategies.

AB Drawing from the literature on buyers' uncertainty in preference and

   proposition that a consumer's reservation price for a product is more
   meaningfully and accurately represented as a range than as a single
   point. Given this conceptualization, they propose an approach for
   incentive-compatible elicitation of a consumer's reservation price range
   (ICERANGE) that builds on Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (1964)
   point-of-purchase method. Two empirical applications of the approach
   provide an assessment of its practicality and its predictive performance
   relative to current methodologies for reservation price elicitation. The
   results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms
   the benchmark approaches in terms of predictive validity and yields
   valuable incremental information about uncertainty in product valuation.

AB Marketing activities frequently involve personalizing product offers to
   consumers' individually measured preferences. Because preferences are
   often ill-defined, responses to customized offers may depend on how easy
   it is for consumers to identify the preferences they stated in the
   measurement task. A series of experiments shows that the likelihood of
   choosing a personalized recommendation that matches measured preferences
   most closely is greater with measurement tasks that allow consumers to
   identify their stated preferences more easily (i.e., transparent tasks).
   However, this difference in choice likelihood due to task transparency
   is observed only for novices (versus experts), and making the
   identification of stated preferences more difficult eliminates the
   effect by decreasing the choice likelihood following more (versus less)
   transparent tasks. The author identifies consumers' understanding of
   their own preferences as the mechanism underlying the task transparency
   effect. The findings provide evidence that consumers must be able to ''
   see through '' or understand the construction of their preferences to
   maximize utility.

AB This article explores how consumers' self-regulation affects the
   likelihood of purchases of new and really new products. A mall-intercept
   field study shows that consumers with a chronic disposition to be
   promotion focused own more new high-technology goods and newly launched
   repeat-purchase items than prevention-focused consumers. There is no
   difference in ownership of products that have been available for many
   years. Two laboratory experiments further investigate these findings. In
   Study 2, the authors manipulate regulatory focus and find that when
   risks associated with a really new product are not specified to
   consumers, promotion-focused consumers state higher purchase intentions
   than prevention-focused consumers. However, when the judgmental context
   makes the risks salient, prevention- and promotion-focused participants
   are equally unlikely to purchase the product. Study 3 demonstrates that
   consumers' self-regulation is unrelated to purchase intentions for
   products that are not portrayed as new. Mediation analyses in both
   laboratory Studies show that the effect of regulatory focus on purchase
   intentions for new products is due to concerns about the performance of
   the new technology, which are more pronounced among prevention-focused
   consumers. Finally, the authors discuss managerial implications.

AB This article examines the influence of the presence of others on
   advertising memory. The authors take an intrapsychic perspective on
   social desirability and propose that the presence of others-in the
   absence of direct interaction-leads to the automatic activation of a
   concern with the impression others are forming. They find that words
   applicable to social desirability are accessed faster when respondents
   are in the presence of another person than when they are alone. Across
   three experiments, semantic (but not perceptual) memory for words and
   advertisements applicable to social desirability is greater than that
   for neutral cues after respondents are exposed to these in the actual or
   imagined presence of others than when they are alone. Respondents'
   chronic impression management tendencies (self-monitoring) moderate the
   effects, suggesting that the effects are, at least in part, determined
   by motivational factors. This novel theoretical framework provides
   direct implications for advertisers and marketing researchers who rely

   effect may be the redundancy in the cognitive processes used to generate

AB The authors model how to measure consumer willingness to pay (WTP) using
   an English, or ascending first-price, auction based on two general
   bidding premises: No bidder bids more than his or her WTP, and no bidder
   allows a rival bidder to win at a price that he or she is willing to
   beat. In other words, the authors propose a '' no-regret '' rule in
   bidding. They impose no other restrictive assumptions on '' maximands ''
   or the bidders' behaviors in a competitive auction context. The authors
   model WTP as having two components: a pure product feature component and
   one based on the auction market environment. The latter includes bidder
   experience, seller reputation, and measures for competition among
   bidders and items. The proposed model is general enough to include a ''
   buy-it-now '' (equivalent to a posted price) auction mechanism. The
   authors use data on notebook auctions from one of the largest Internet
   auction sites in Korea. They find that most product characteristics
   matter in the expected ways. There are two additional primary findings:
   First, WTP declines as more similar items are concurrently listed with
   the focal item; there is an additional effect if these similar items
   also belong to the same brand. Therefore, market thickness matters for
   consumer WTR Second, more extensive site surfing and bidding histories
   lead to lower WTP, implying that search costs and experience matter in
   bidding. As specific substantive benefits, the authors demonstrate how
   sellers can calculate changes in WTP and, thus, the expected revenue as
   the number of concurrently available similar items varies.

AB Firms sometimes create negative initial impressions on potential
   customers and then face the problem of determining how to change these
   initial impressions. The marketing literature offers little guidance on
   how to do this, and the psychology literature suggests that negative
   initial impressions are much more resistant to change than positive
   initial impressions. The authors contrast the efficacy of comparative
   and noncomparative new information about a target brand when the initial
   impression of the brand is positive or negative. A body of extant
   research shows that positive initial impressions change more in the face
   of comparative information than when the same information is
   noncomparative and does not mention a competitor. The authors replicate
   this effect for positive initial impressions but deduce and show that
   the opposite is true for negative initial impressions. Thus, the authors

AB The authors propose that consumer choices are often systematically
   influenced by preference fluency (i.e., the subjective feeling that
   forming a preference for a specific option is easy or difficult). Four
   studies manipulate the fluency of preference formation by presenting
   descriptions in an easy- or difficult-to- read font (Study 1) or by
   asking participants to think of few versus many reasons for their choice
   (Studies 2-4). As the authors predict, subjective experiences of
   difficulty increase choice deferral (Studies 1 and 2) and the selection
   of a compromise option (Studies 3 and 4), unless consumers are induced
   to attribute the experience to an unrelated cause. Unlike studies of
   decision conflict, these effects are obtained without changing the
   attributes of the alternatives, the composition of the choice sets, or
   the reference points. The authors discuss the,theoretical and practical
   implications of the results.

   research, the authors examine why consumers participate in creative
   activities and under what conditions these experiences are the most
   enjoyable. A qualitative study explores the diverse motivations for
   undertaking creative tasks and identifies the role of constraints in
   such endeavors. Then, the authors conduct two experimental studies to
   understand the importance of constraints (e.g., instructional guidance,
   target outcomes) in facilitating a balance between perceived competence
   and autonomy for consumers involved in a creative task. When consumers
   engage in creative activities with a sense of both autonomy and
   competence, they enjoy the experience more. The authors discuss
   implications for managers and provide opportunities for further
   research.

AB Shopping momentum occurs when an initial purchase provides a
   psychological impulse that enhances the purchase of a second, unrelated
   product. The authors propose that the most promising theoretical
   mechanism for shopping momentum comes from Gollwitzer's (1990) theory of
   implementation and deliberation mind-sets. Under this theory, shopping
   momentum occurs because the initial purchase moves the consumer from a
   deliberative to an implemental mind-set, thus driving subsequent
   purchases. After demonstrating the main shopping momentum effect, the
   authors support the mind-set theory by (1) demonstrating how an initial
   purchase induces implemental orientation and (2) by illustrating that an
   implementation mind-set leads to greater purchase. The authors then
   explore the boundaries of this effect by demonstrating how shopping
   momentum can be interrupted. Finally, they discuss alternative
   theoretical accounts for the results and explore consequences for
   marketing managers.

AB Research on choice over time has found that people tend to focus on
   concrete aspects of near-future events and abstract aspects of
   distantfuture events. Furthermore, a focus on concrete aspects heightens
   the feasibility- related components, whereas a focus on abstract aspects
   heightens the desirability-related components, which can lead to
   preference inconsistency over time. In this research, the authors
   integrate research on choice over time with mental simulation. They
   propose and show that counter to people's natural tendencies, outcome
   simulation for near-future events and process simulation for
   distant-future events lead to preference consistency over time. The
   results also suggest that outcome timing moderates the effectiveness of

AB This article examines the effects of monitoring on interfirm
   relationships. Whereas some research suggests that monitoring can serve
   as a control mechanism that reduces exchange partner opportunism, there
   is also evidence showing that monitoring can actually promote such
   behavior. The authors propose that the actual effect of monitoring
   depends on (1) the form of monitoring used (output versus behavior) and
   (2) the context in which monitoring takes place. With regard to the form
   of monitoring, the results from a longitudinal field study of
   buyer-supplier relationships show that output monitoring decreases
   partner opportunism, as transaction cost and agency theory predict,
   whereas behavior monitoring, which is a more obtrusive form of control,
   increases partner opportunism. With regard to the context, the authors
   find that informal relationship elements in the form of microlevel
   social contracts serve as buffers that both enhance the effects of
   output monitoring and permit behavior monitoring to suppress opportunism
   in the first place.

AB The authors propose an empirical procedure to investigate the pricing
   behavior of manufacturers and retailers in the presence of

   equilibriums that would arise in the presence of state dependence, the
   authors systematically evaluate whether boundedly rational firms indeed
   look ahead when they set prices and, if so, to what extent. They
   illustrate the procedure using household-level scanner-panel data on
   breakfast cereals and replicate the substantive results using data on
   ketchup. The authors find that (1) omission of state dependence in
   demand biases inference of firm behavior (i.e., tacit collusion is
   erroneously inferred when firms are competitive); (2) observed retail
   prices are consistent with a pricing model in which both manufacturers
   and retailers are forward looking (i.e., they incorporate the effects of
   their current prices on their future profits), but firms have short time
   horizons when setting prices (i.e., they look ahead by only one period,
   suggesting that firms are boundedly rational in their dynamic pricing
   behavior); and (3) even a myopic pricing model of firms that accounts
   for state dependence in demand is a reasonable approximation of the
   observed prices in the market.

AB Promotion-induced consumer stockpiling has a negative impact on
   manufacturers because it moves forward in time brand sales that would
   have occurred later at full margin. However, the resultant increase in
   consumer inventory has two potential benefits: increased category
   consumption and preemptive brand switches (the additional inventory of
   the promoted brand preempts the consumer's purchase of a competing brand
   in the future). Furthermore, there is a potential impact on repeat
   purchases of the stockpiled brand after the promotion. In this article,
   the authors present a model and simulation-based method to measure the
   benefits and costs of stockpiling and assess their relative magnitudes.
   They find that the benefits are substantial, but consumption appears to
   be the most important, followed by preemptive switching and then an
   increase in repeat purchases. These benefits easily offset the negative
   aspect of consumer stockpiling-namely, purchase acceleration by loyal
   customers who would have bought the brand at regular price at a later
   date.

AB New product preannouncements are strategic signals that firms direct at
   their customers, competitors, channel members, and investors. They have
   been touted as effective means of deterring competitor entry, informing
   potential customers, and even tipping the balance of technological
   standard battles in favor of the preannouncing firms. However,
   preannouncements also carry the risks of unwanted competitive reaction
   and the negative consequences of undelivered promises. From a
   shareholder value standpoint, do the benefits outweigh the risks of
   preannouncing? To address this question, the authors build on agency and
   signaling theories to develop hypotheses about the effects of
   preannouncements on shareholder value, and they empirically test these
   hypotheses on a sample of software and hardware new product
   preannouncements. The findings indicate that the financial returns from
   preannouncements are significantly positive in the long run. The authors
   show that preannouncements generate positive short-term abnormal returns
   only for firms that offer specific information about the preannounced
   product. They also show that firms earn positive long-term abnormal
   returns after a preannouncement if they continue to update the market on
   the progress of the new product. Both the short-term and the long-term
   returns are further magnified if the reliability of the preannouncement
   (i.e., the credibility of the preannouncing firm) is high. The findings
   offer executives of preannouncing firms clear guidelines on how to
   manage communications in the market to extract financial value from new
   product preannouncements.

   decision of whether to lease or buy it. They estimate the model on a
   data set of new car purchases from the entry-luxury segment of the U.S.
   automobile market. A key finding is that consumers are myopic and prefer
   contracts with lower payment streams even when they have higher total
   costs. The authors also find that consumers are more likely to lease
   than to finance cars with higher maintenance costs because this provides
   them with the option to return the car before maintenance costs become

AB This study addresses a problem commonly encountered by marketers who
   attempt to assess the impact of their sales promotions-namely, the lack
   of data on competitive marketing activity. In most industries, competing
   firms may have competitive sales data from syndicated services or trade
   organizations, but they seldom have access to data on competitive
   promotions at the customer level. Promotion response models in the
   literature either have ignored competitive promotions, focusing instead
   on the focal firm's promotions and sales response, or have considered
   the ideal situation in which the analyst has access to full information
   about each firm's sales and promotion activity. The authors propose a
   random coefficients hidden Markov promotion response model, which takes
   the competitor's unobserved promotion level as a latent variable driven
   by a Markov process to be estimated simultaneously with the promotion
   response model. This enables the authors to estimate cross-promotion
   effects by imputing the level of competitive promotions. The authors
   test the proposed model on synthetic data through a Monte Carlo
   experiment. Then, they apply and test the model to actual prescription
   and sampling data from two main competing pharmaceutical firms in the
   same therapeutic category. The two tests show that compared with several
   benchmark models, the proposed random coefficients hidden Markov model
   successfully imputes unobserved competitive promotions and, accordingly,
   reduces biases in the own- and cross-promotion parameters. Furthermore,
   the proposed model provides better predictive validity than the
   benchmark models.

AB Hedging offsets the risk of an existing stake by counterbalancing it
   with a new stake-for example, complementing a bet on the race favorite
   with another bet on a promising upstart. In three experiments, the
   authors find that rather than assessing the hedge as a whole, people
   tend to react to the hedging outcome by focusing on either the original
   stake or the new one. The authors show that the hedger's focus is linked
   to a psychological motivation of whether to pursue safety and security
   by minimizing losses, known as a "prevention orientation," or to pursue
   growth and advancement by maximizing gains, known as a "promotion
   orientation, " When the context is gambling, prevention-oriented people
   fixate on what happens to the status quo stake, whereas
   promotion-oriented people attend to the new stake (Experiment 1). The
   same conclusion emerges from a stock-investing context (Experiments 2a
   and 2b). Moreover, because selective attention to status quo and change
   is the mechanism at work, the authors find that a choice between options
   characterized as maintaining the status quo elicits greater
   discrimination among prevention-oriented than promotion-oriented people;
   similarly, a choice between options characterized as initiating change
   elicits greater discrimination among promotion-oriented than
   prevention-oriented people (Experiment 3). These effects drive

AB In many services (e.g., the wireless service industry), consumers choose
   a service plan according to their expected consumption. In such
   situations, consumers experience two forms of uncertainty. First, they
   may be uncertain about the quality of their service provider and can
   learn about it after repeated use of the service. Second, they. may be
   uncertain about their own usage of minutes and learn about it after
   observing their actual consumption. The authors propose a model to
   capture this dual learning process while accounting for the nonlinearity
   of the pricing scheme used in wireless services. The results show that
   both quality learning and quantity learning are important. The authors
   conduct several policy experiments to capture the effects of consumer
   learning, pricing, and service quality on customer lifetime value (CLV).
   They find that consumer learning can result in a win-win situation for
   both consumers and firm; consumers leave less minutes on the table, and
   the firm experiences an increase in overall CLV. For example, the
   authors find that there is a 35% increase (approximately $75) in overall
   CLV with consumer learning than without. The key driver of this result
   is the change in the retention rate with and without learning.

AB When retailers make product assortment changes by eliminating certain
   stockkeeping units (SKUs), how does this affect sales of individual
   brands? This is the main question the authors address in this article.
   Using data from an online retailer that implemented a permanent
   systemwide SKU reduction (SR) program, the authors investigate how the
   program affected various components of purchase behavior for individual
   brands. They find substantial variations in the SR effects across
   brands, categories, and consumers. They explore possible drivers for
   these differences and find that higher-market-share, higher-priced, and
   more frequently promoted brands tend to gain share and that reduction in
   the number of sizes, reduction in the number of SKUs, and change in SKU
   share in the category are important in affecting change in a brand's
   purchase share after the SR. They also find that SRs lead to an increase
   in category purchase incidence and quantity for highly statedependent
   consumers and frequent buyers but a decrease in category purchase and
   quantity for mildly state-dependent consumers and infrequent buyers. In
   addition, SRs tend to cause more changes in brand choice probabilities
   among consumers of lower state dependence and higher price and promotion
   sensitivity. These findings are of importance both to retailers wanting
   to make product assortment changes and to manufacturers affected by

   optimally (i.e., the technology for the CDI). In contrast, this article
   focuses on marketing strategy issues that the intermediary faces, given
   the availability of the technology to implement such services.
   Specifically, the authors develop an empirical framework to evaluate the
   optimal customer (exclusive/nonexclusive), product (quality or accuracy
   of the 1:1 customization), and pricing strategy for a CDI. They
   illustrate the framework for one type of CDI-a 1:1 coupon service firm
   that caters to grocery manufacturers-using household purchase history
   data from the ketchup market. The authors find that selling on a
   nonexclusive basis using the maximum available purchase history data is
   the most profitable strategy for the CDI in the particular market. They
   also evaluate the potential impact of retailers entering the 1:1 coupon
   service business. Because 1:1 marketing can increase the retailer's
   profits from goods sold, it is optimal for the retailer to undercut the
   prices of a pure-play CDI that offers 1:1 coupon services.

AB This study addresses significant challenges that practitioners face when
   using customer lifetime value (CLV) for customer selection. First, the
   authors propose a Bayesian decision theory-based customer selection
   framework that accommodates the uncertainty inherent in predicting
   customer behavior. They develop a joint model of purchase timing and
   quantity that is amenable for selecting customers using CLV. Second, the
   authors compare performance of the proposed customer selection framework
   (1) with the current customer selection procedure in the collaborating
   firm and (2) with different customer-level cost allocation rules that
   are necessary for computing CLV. The study finds that given a budget
   constraint, customers selected by means of a Bayesian decision
   theory-based framework (i.e., using the maximized expected CLV of a
   customer and the corresponding optimal marketing costs as an estimate of
   future costs) provide the highest profits. The study provides guidelines
   for implementation and illustrates how the proposed customer selection
   framework can aid managers in enhancing marketing productivity and
   estimating return on marketing actions.

AB This article provides an integrated utility-maximizing framework for
   households' multicategory purchase incidence, brand choice, and purchase
   quantity decisions. On a store visit, households maximize utility across
   several categories subject to an overall budget constraint. Then, they
   choose to purchase a subset of categories, in which they select a
   specific brand and an associated quantity level. Under their assumptions
   for the stochastic terms in the specification, the authors obtain
   closed-form expressions for the household demands, the marginal and
   joint purchase incidence, and the brand choice probabilities along with
   conditional purchase quantities. The authors show that the modeling
   framework accounts for both coincidence and complementarity/
   substitutability across categories. In addition, it accounts for
   unobserved heterogeneity in the estimation. Thus, the three key features
   of multicategory models proposed in the literature are all reflected in
   the framework. The authors provide an empirical application of the
   methodology using four categories from the Stanford market basket
   data-laundry detergent, fabric softener, toilette tissue, and paper
   towel. The results indicate that, in general, cross-category effects, as
   measured by the cross-category price elasticities between brands in the
   categories, are small, and they arise mostly through consumers' joint
   purchase incidence decisions rather than at the purchase quantity
   decision conditional on brand choice. This finding indicates that the
   effects of coincidence are larger than the effects of complementarity in
   these data.

AB In this article, the authors propose a Bayesian method for estimating
   disaggregate choice models using aggregate data. Compared with existing
   methods, the advantage of the proposed method is that it allows for the
   analysis of microlevel consumer dynamic behavior, such as the impact of
   purchase history on current brand choice, when only aggregate-level data
   are available. The essence of this approach is to simulate latent choice
   data that are consistent with the observed aggregate data. When the
   augmented choice data are made available in each iteration of the Markov
   chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the dynamics of consumer buying behavior
   can be explicitly modeled. The authors first demonstrate the validity of
   the method with a series of simulations and then apply the method to an
   actual store-level data set of consumer purchases of refrigerated orange
   juice. The authors find a significant amount of dynamics in consumer
   buying behavior. The proposed method is useful for managers to
   understand better the consumer purchase dynamics and brand price
   competition when they have access to aggregate data only.

   retailers conditional on their geographic locations. Although market
   demand for gasoline is not observed, the authors are able to infer the
   effects of such demand from stations' locations and pricing decisions
   using available data on local market-level demographics. Using the
   proposed location model, which is based on the assumption of social
   welfare maximization by a policy planner, the authors find that local
   potential gasoline demand depends positively on the local demographic
   characteristics of the neighborhood. Using the proposed pricing model,
   which is based on the assumption of Bertrand competition between retail
   chains, the authors find that retail margins for gasoline are
   approximately 21%. The authors also find that consumers are willing to
   travel up to a mile for a savings of $.03 per liter. Using the estimates
   of the proposed econometric model, the authors answer policy questions
   pertaining to a recent merger between two firms in the industry.
   Answering these questions has important policy implications for both
   gasoline firms and policy makers in Singapore.

AB Marketing investments are designed to change consumer behavior in ways
   that help goods compete in the marketplace. Previous research has
   focused on using elasticity decompositions to measure how these
   investments affect either consumer decision making or competing goods.
   On the one hand, decision-based decompositions attribute the growth in
   own-good demand to changes in the consumers' decision-making processes.
   On the other hand, unit-based and share-based decompositions attribute
   the same growth to either rivalrous or nonrivalrous sources. The
   objective of this article is to provide a clear and accurate method that
   simultaneously attributes the growth in own-good demand to changes in
   (1) consumers' decisions, (2) competitive demand, and (3) competitive
   market share. The author accomplishes this by settling some confusion
   about what the decision- and share-based decompositions mean, by
   discussing how each of the decompositions are related to the others, and
   by discussing the research questions that each of the decompositions can
   answer. From a managerial perspective, the author discusses how this
   method can be used to simplify and clarify the data needed for decision
   making.

AB Bundle promotions-the practice of granting consumers a discount when
   they buy a certain number of units from a designated range of
   stockkeeping units-have gained popularity among manufacturers and
   retailers. In this research, the authors investigate the purchase
   effects of bundle promotions for a category of packaged goods. Contrary
   to intuition, they find that promotional bundles are far more effective
   at inducing switching than at boosting category sales. The strong
   switching effects result from two mechanisms: (1) Stockkeeping units
   that are part of a bundle promotion appear to reinforce each other's
   choice probability, and (2) the bundle discount tends to attract
   consumers even if they do not buy enough to qualify for the price
   reduction. The weak category effects follow from the notion that the
   purchase quantity requirement is often too stringent to make consumers
   buy earlier and/or more in the category. The authors develop incidence,
   quantity, and choice models that incorporate the intricate bundle
   mechanisms, and they use simulations to contrast the sales impact of
   bundle and traditional per-unit promotions. On the 'basis of the model
   estimates, they present managerial implications and tentative guidelines
   for optimal bundle design.

   occurs when the extensions are complementary (e.g., a digital camera and
   a digital photo printer) but is not evident when they belong to the same
   category (two models of digital cameras) or to unrelated categories (a
   digital camera and a snowboard). In addition, the effect is restricted
   to extension products that are introduced by the same manufacturer.
   Finally, it occurs only among participants who are promotion focused and
   therefore are disposed to consider the benefits of owning the extensions
   rather than the disadvantages of doing so. These and other results

   than promotion-focused people. When message cues make manipulative
   intent highly salient or when manipulative intent is not salient, brand
   evaluations do not differ across regulatory foci. In addition,
   externally priming suspicion of manipulative intent makes

   predictions are confirmed. Furthermore, an analysis of the intensities
   of these specific emotions reveals the following additional insights:
   (1) Under conditions in which the options in a choice set meet or exceed
   both functional and hedonic cutoffs, consumers attach greater importance
   to the hedonic attribute, and (2) whereas the functionally superior
   option is preferred in choice tasks, the hedonically superior one is
   preferred in willingness-to-pay tasks.

   or conceptually related cues. The findings highlight the impact of
   frequent-in addition to recent-priming in shaping product evaluation and
   choice: More frequent exposure to perceptually or conceptually related
   cues increases product accessibility and makes the product easier to

   evaluation and choice, which are found to vary directly with the

   differentiation as having incremental information content, but they

   accommodate heterogeneous customer responses to a large number of

   indicate that (1) Web purchasing is associated with lower subsequent
   purchase volumes than when buying from other outlets; (2) marketing

AB Many firms use decision tools called "automatic recommendation systems"
   that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify
   products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products
   to the customer's attention. Much of the research in the literature
   today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of
   purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author
   posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase
   probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to
   the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the
   role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying
   behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a
   recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer
   behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's
   recommendation actions. The model is expressed in econometric terms so
   that it can be estimated with available data. The author studies these
   ideas using purchase data from a real e-commerce firm and compares the
   performance of the proposed main model with the performance of benchmark
   models. The author shows that the main model is better than benchmark
   models on key measures.

   structure. At the same time, consumers may exhibit reinforcing behavior
   (i.e., high repeating) on some attributes and derived varied behavior
   (i.e., high switching) on other attributes. This calls for the extension
   of current stockkeeping unit choice models to consider attribute-level
   feedback effects. The authors develop such a model using an internal
   market structure analysis approach. This provides the benefit of
   attribute-level competitive maps and estimates of attribute-level
   reinforcing behavior versus derived varied behavior. The authors

AB Extreme response style (ERS) is an important threat to the validity of
   survey-based marketing research. In this article, the authors present a
   new item response theory-based model for measuring ERS. This model
   contributes to the ERS literature in two ways. First, the method
   improves on existing procedures by allowing different items to be
   differentially useful for measuring ERS and by accommodating the
   possibility that an item's usefulness differs across groups (e.g.,
   countries). Second, the model integrates an advanced item response
   theory measurement model with a structural hierarchical model for
   studying antecedents of ERS. The authors simultaneously estimate a
   person's ERS score and individual- and group-level (country) drivers of
   ERS. Through simulations, they show that the new method improves on
   traditional procedures. They further apply the model to a large data set
   consisting of 12,506 consumers from 26 countries on four continents. The
   findings show that the model extensions are necessary to model the data
   adequately. Finally, they report substantive results about the effects
   of socio-demographic and national-cultural variables on ERS.

AB Data collected through multi-item Likert scales that contain reversed
   items often exhibit problems, such as unexpected factor structures and
   diminished scale reliabilities. These problems arise when respondents
   select responses on the same side of the scale neutral point for both
   reversed and nonreversed items, a phenomenon the authors call
   "misresponse." Across four experiments and an exploratory study using
   published data, the authors find that misresponse to reversed Likert
   items averaged approximately 20%, twice the level identified as
   problematic in previous simulation studies. Counter to prevailing
   thought, the patterns of misresponse and response latency across
   manipulated items could not be attributed to respondent inattention or
   acquiescence. Instead, the pattern supports an item verification
   difficulty explanation, which holds that task complexity, and thus
   misresponse and response latency, increases with the number of cognitive
   operations required for a respondent to compare a scale item with his or
   her belief. The observed results are well explained by the constituent
   comparison model.

AB A field study conducted in Shanghai identified a robust inconsistency
   between real estate developers' desired sales pattern (selling all
   apartments in a building at similar rates) and the actual sales pattern
   (selling good apartments faster). The authors explain this inconsistency
   using Tversky, Sattath, and Slovic's (1988) prominence principle,
   according to which buyers, who were in a choice mode, weighed the
   desirability of floors more heavily than developers, who were in a
   matching mode when setting prices. This explanation is corroborated by
   controlled experiments involving potential home buyers and professional
   real estate price setters. The research relates an intriguing anomaly
   originally found in paper-and-pencil surveys to a real-world issue in
   one of the world's most active markets. These findings also have
   implications for issues beyond real estate markets.

AB Preference consistency implies that people have learned their
   willingness to trade off attributes. The authors argue that this is not
   necessarily the case. Instead, they show that when people learn
   preferences in context (e.g., through repeated choices made from a
   trinary choice set that includes an asymmetrically dominated decoy),
   they learn a context-specific choice heuristic (e.g., they always choose
   the asymmetrically dominating option), which leads to less consistent
   preferences across contexts. In contrast, repeated choices from sets
   containing only two options impel people to learn their subjective
   attribute weights, yielding preferences that are consistent across
   contexts. The difference between choice construction and preference
   construction is of importance to marketing managers because repeat
   purchase is typically interpreted as a signal of customer preference.
   The authors show that this "preference" might just be a learned solution
   to the choice problem and that as soon as the competitive context
   changes (even in a normatively meaningless way), so will consumers'
   preferences.

AB When consumers decide to upgrade to a new or better product, they often
   trade in their currently owned or used product for the new one. The
   authors examine whether such trade-in behavior, in which consumers must
   negotiate the price for both the new and the used product, affects their
   willingness-to-pay price for the new good. Drawing on research on mental
   accounting, the authors reason that when-consumers engage in a
   transaction involving a trade-in (i.e., when they act as both buyer and
   seller simultaneously), they place more importance on getting a good
   value for the used product than on getting a good price for the new
   product. As a result, such consumers exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay
   price for the new product than consumers who just buy the new product
   alone. The results from a series of laboratory experiments provide
   systematic support for this hypothesis. Finally, the authors lend
   external validity to their results by confirming the hypothesis using
   real-world transaction data from the automobile market.

AB Consumers often purchase multiple items from a product category on a
   single shopping trip. In doing so, they must frequently choose among
   items that are grouped in assortments, such as those offered by a
   particular store or brand. This article examines how the number of
   to-be-purchased items influences consumer choice among assortments. It
   is argued that when consumers are uncertain about their preferences,
   they are more likely to prefer an assortment for which the number of
   available options matches the desired purchase quantity. This prediction
   is based on the notion that a match between the size of an assortment
   and the number of to-be-purchased items enables consumers to simplify
   the selection process by eliminating the need to trade off the benefits
   and costs of individual choice alternatives-a strategy referred to as
   the "quantity-matching heuristic." The theoretical predictions are
   supported by data from five empirical studies that offer converging
   evidence for the role of purchase-quantity goals in assortment choice
   and identify moderating factors and boundary conditions.

AB Consumers often use both objective and subjective criteria to evaluate a
   product. For example, power tool users may evaluate a power tool on the
   basis of not only its objective attributes, such as price and switch
   type, but also its subjective characteristics, such as ease of use and
   feel of the tool. This research emphasizes incorporating subjective
   characteristics in new product design. The authors propose a model in
   which consumers' purchase intentions can be affected by both the
   objective attributes and the subjective characteristics. This model has
   the form of a hierarchical Bayesian structural equation model, in which
   the subjective characteristics are treated as latent constructs. The
   authors also propose a Bayesian forecasting procedure in which the
   estimated relationships are used to improve the out-of-sample
   prediction. They illustrate the proposed approach in two empirical
   studies. The results indicate that by collecting additional information
   about consumers' perceptions of the subjective characteristics, the
   proposed model provides the product designer with a better understanding
   and a more accurate prediction of consumers' product preferences than
   the traditional conjoint models.

AB Multipart pricing is commonly used by service providers such as car
   rentals, prescription drug plans, health maintenance organizations, and
   wireless telephony. The general structure of these pricing schemes is a
   fixed access fee, which sometimes entitles users to a certain level of
   product use; a variable fee for additional use; and still another fee
   for add-on features that are priced individually and/or as bundles. The
   authors propose a method using conjoint analysis for multipart pricing.
   The method reflects the two-way dependence between prices and
   consumption and incorporates consumers' uncertainty about their use of a
   service. The proposed method estimates both choice probabilities and
   usage levels for each consumer as functions of the product features and
   the different price components. The authors then use these estimates to
   evaluate the expected revenues and profits of alternative plans and
   pricing schemes. They illustrate this method using data from a conjoint
   study of cell phone services. They compare the results with those
   obtained from using several competing models. Finally, they use the
   proposed procedure to identify the optimal set of features in a base
   plan and the pricing of optional features for a provider of cell phone
   services.

AB Competitive advertising interference can occur when viewers of
   advertising for a focal brand are also exposed to advertising messages
   for competing brands within a short period (e.g., one week for
   television advertising). Although competitive advertising interference
   has been shown to reduce advertising recall and recognition and brand
   evaluation measures, no studies have examined its impact on brand sales.
   In this research, the authors use a market response model of sales for
   two grocery categories for a large grocery chain in the Chicago area to
   study the extent to which competitive advertising interference
   influences sales. The model enables the authors to capture the "pure"
   own-brand advertising elasticities that would arise if there were no
   competitive interference. The results show that competitive interference
   effects on sales are strong. When one or more competing brands advertise
   in the same week as the focal brand, the advertising elasticity
   diminishes for the focal brand. The decrease depends on the number of
   competing brands advertising in a particular week and their total
   advertising volume. The authors find that having one more competitor
   advertise is often more harmful to a focal brand's advertising
   effectiveness than if the current number of advertising brands increase
   their total advertising volume.

AB Price promotions are pervasive in grocery markets. A household can
   respond to price promotions by effectively cherry-picking through (1)
   spatial price search across stores and (2) temporal price search across
   time. However, extant research has analyzed these two dimensions of
   price search only separately and therefore underestimates both the
   consumer response to price promotions and the impact of promotions on
   retail profit. In this article, the authors introduce an integrated
   analysis of spatial and temporal price search. They seek answers to
   three questions: First, what are the predictors of household decisions
   to perform either spatial or temporal price search? Second, how
   effective are the temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal price search
   strategies in obtaining lower prices? and Third, what is the impact of
   alternative price search strategies on retailer profit? The authors use
   a unique data collection approach that combines household surveys with
   observed purchase data to address these questions. Their key results are
   as follows: Geography (the spatial configuration of store and household
   locations) and opportunity costs are useful predictors of a household's
   price search pattern. Households that claim to search spatiotemporally
   avail approximately three-quarters of the available savings on average.
   Households that search only temporally save about the same as those that
   search only spatially. The negative effect of cherry-picking on retailer
   profits is not as high as is typically believed.

   authors test two rival sociological perspectives regarding the influence
   of customer trust in the broader context. One perspective proposes that
   trust in the context replaces trust in individual firms and their
   representatives. This view suggests that firm/representative trust is
   not always critical, especially for customers with high trust in the
   context. An alternative perspective is that trust in the context fosters
   and legitimates trust in firms and their representatives. This view
   implies that firm/ representative trust is a necessary mediator of the
   influence of trust in the context. The authors test predictions based on
   both perspectives, using empirical results from two studies implemented
   in two countries. The results from both studies support the proposition
   that trust in firms and their representatives is a necessary mediator of
   trust in the broader context.

AB Marketing academics and practitioners frequently employ cross-sectional

   increasing concern about the validity of this approach. These validity
   concerns center on reducing common method variance bias and enhancing
   causal inferences. Longitudinal data collection is commonly offered as a
   solution to these problems. In this article, the authors conceptually
   examine the role of longitudinal surveys in addressing these validity
   concerns. Then, they provide an illustrative comparison of the validity
   of cross-sectional versus longitudinal surveys using two data sets and a
   Monte Carlo simulation. The conceptualization and findings suggest that
   under certain conditions, the results from cross-sectional data exhibit
   validity comparable to the results obtained from longitudinal data. This

   The authors propose a general clusterwise bilinear spatial model that

   space, and preference/utility vectors per market segment; that is, the
   model performs segmentation and positioning simultaneously After a
   review of related methodological research in the marketing,
   psychometrics, and classification literature streams, the authors
   present the technical details of the proposed two-way clusterwise
   bilinear spatial model. They develop an efficient alternating least
   squares procedure that estimates conditional globally optimum estimates
   of the model parameters within each iteration through analytic
   closed-form expressions. The authors present various model options. They
   provide a conceptual and empirical comparison with latent-class
   multidimensional scaling. They use an illustration of the new bilinear
   multidimensional scaling methodology with an actual commercial study

   buying/consideration intentions for small sport-utility vehicles. The

AB Although managers often hope to obtain long-term benefits with temporary
   marketing actions, academic studies imply that their chances are slim.
   Extant research has implicitly assumed that the brand itself carries no
   influence over whether marketing promotions have the power to lift sales
   permanently. Using panel data for seven years from 100 brands across
   seven product categories, the authors employ a two-stage approach in
   which long-term promotional effectiveness is first estimated with
   persistence modeling and then these effectiveness estimates are related
   to brand equity and new product introductions. By examining a broad
   range of brands in each category, the authors find that positive sales
   evolution from promotional efforts is fairly common, especially for
   small brands. Moreover, the authors find that both permanent and
   cumulative sales effects from marketing promotions are greater for
   brands with higher equity and more product introductions, whereas brands
   with low equity gain greater benefits from product introductions. These
   results offer new research and managerial insights into the presence and
   conditions for persistent benefits from marketing promotions.

AB Drawing on theories of new product adoption and intertemporal choice,
   the authors show in cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations
   (Study 1) that when adoption is in the distant future, people are more
   concerned about performance- and symbolic-benefit uncertainties. In
   contrast, in the near future, the concerns are more about switching- and
   affective-cost uncertainties. In Studies 2 and 2a, using theories of
   mental simulation, the authors show that in the distant-future adoption
   scenario, communication strategies that promote outcome simulations are
   more effective in reducing performance uncertainty, bolstering positive
   feelings, and enhancing behavioral intentions. In contrast, in the
   near-future adoption scenario, communication strategies that promote
   process simulations are better at reducing switching cost and affective
   uncertainties, assuaging anxiety, and increasing behavioral intentions.
   The authors also find positive effects of these communication strategies

   account for temporal distance to adoption.

AB A brand's stretchability is an important avenue for growth and new
   product introductions. This research examines the role of an
   individual-difference variable (self-construal) in enhancing a brand's
   stretchability potential. It is postulated that an interdependent
   self-construal leads to a superior ability to uncover relationships
   among stimuli (e.g., an extension and its parent brand) and thus is
   likely to enhance the perceived fit of an extension and the likelihood
   of its acceptance. However, these beneficial effects are likely to
   emerge only under conditions in which the interdependent consumer is
   motivated to elaborate extensively on the extension information. Five
   experiments test the underlying mechanism, its implications for
   different levels of brand stretch (varying from close to far), and the
   marketing strategy implications of the proposed theoretical framework.

AB This article describes several field and laboratory experiments that
   investigate an identity congruency effect on donations. Experiment 1 is
   a field experiment showing that consumers give more money to a public
   radio station if they are told that a previous donor who shares their
   identity also made a large contribution. This effect is more likely to
   occur when consumers have high collective-identity esteem (measured in
   Experiment 2a) and when attention is focused on others (manipulated in
   Experiment 2b). The authors measure these two moderators simultaneously
   and observe and replicate a three-way interaction. Again, the identity
   congruency effect is the strongest when consumers have high
   collective-identity esteem and when attention is focused on others
   (Experiment 3a and Experiment 3b). These results provide a novel
   understanding of the causes of the identity congruency effect on
   donations. The authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and
   substantive implications of these findings.

AB People have a tendency to sell stocks more quickly if their value has
   increased since the time they were purchased than if their value has
   decreased during this period. This "disposition effect" can sometimes
   have negative financial consequences. Based on an analysis of
   transaction data in a simulated trading environment, Study 1 provides
   evidence of the disposition effect in a newly emerging Internet-based
   stock trading ("e-trading") situation. Three laboratory studies then
   examine the mechanisms that underlie the effect. The magnitude of the
   disposition effect is unaffected by experimental manipulations of the
   subjective likelihood of future gains or losses. However, it is
   eliminated by inducing participants to define gains and losses in
   similar subjective units. Furthermore, the effect depends on whether
   participants make selling decisions on their own stocks or serve as an
   agent for someone else. Thus, the disposition effect is largely a result
   of differences in the subjective value that participants attach to
   possible gains and losses rather than of differences in their beliefs
   that these outcomes will occur. The authors discuss theoretical and
   managerial implications of the findings.

AB Large firms implement brand portfolio promotions (BPPs) that promote
   multiple brands to targeted consumers at discrete times. Such programs
   possess unique properties that require a novel model to assess their
   effectiveness. The authors propose a model that captures the magnitude
   and shape of the BPP effect for each brand in the portfolio, accounts
   for diminishing returns of brand exposure, and incorporates the
   inter-temporal effect of BPPs. The model is shown to be general enough
   to apply to any discrete promotion in which the carryover effect
   duration is unknown. The authors present several model-based metrics
   that allow for an objective comparison of a BPP's return on investment
   with that of other forms of promotion. The results suggest that a BPP,
   when contrasted with feature, leads to higher sales lift per household
   for some of the brands. The authors develop an optimal exposure
   allocation procedure based on the proposed model that informs (1) which
   assortments of brands to promote across multiple BPPs and (2) the
   exposure level for each brand.

   (e.g., a flavored beverage) that is high in incentive value (i.e.,
   tastes good) not only enhances subsequent consumption of other similar
   consumption cues (e.g., Pepsi) but also prompts people to seek anything
   rewarding (e.g., chocolate, a massage). The authors propose that this
   phenomenon, which they term "reverse alliesthesia," occurs as a result
   of the activation of a general motivational state by cues that are high
   in incentive value. They test this proposition by showing that the
   effect is (1) attenuated if the activated motivational state is satiated
   before the subsequent consumption task and (2) stronger for people who
   are high rather than low on the behavioral activation system scale.
   Finally, the authors extend their core findings to nongustatory cues by
   showing that (un)pleasant odors can also lead to an increase (decrease)
   in subsequent reward-seeking behaviors.

   issue capability is moderated by gender, depending on the compatibility
   between the goal orientation of the decision maker and the nature of the
   decision task. For decisions that are mainly driven by achievement of
   gains (e.g., investment decisions), men's risk-taking propensity is more
   influenced by their levels of issue capability than women's because the
   nature of the decision task is consistent with men's agentic orientation
   focused on the self. Conversely, for decisions that are mainly driven by
   avoidance of losses (e.g., insurance decisions), women's risk taking is
   more sensitive to issue capability than men's because the nature of such
   decisions is consistent with women's communion orientation. The authors
   analyze the betting data from the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! game
   show (Study 1). The results show that gender moderates the effect of
   issue capability on the actual betting behavior in Jeopardy! In Study 2,
   the authors test the underlying mechanism through mediation analyses of
   the focus of attention. In Study 3, the authors manipulate the task
   nature and demonstrate that men's risk taking is more sensitive to issue
   capability in investment decisions, whereas women's risk taking is more
   sensitive to issue capability in insurance decisions.

AB Marketing managers and consumers who use the Web as a source of
   information often use input from strangers to make decisions or gain
   knowledge. The authors propose that in such contexts, the information
   provider's current and past behaviors, relative to those of other
   information providers, influence who the information seeker believes
   provides a valuable response and how valuable he or she judges the
   provider's information to be. The authors track information queries,
   information provider responses, and objective valuation of these
   responses by information seekers in a Web forum, in which responses to
   information queries come from multiple information providers with whom
   the information seeker has not met face-to-face and has had no prior
   interaction. Among other results, the authors show that a provider's
   response speed, the extent to which the provider's previous responses
   within the focal domain have been positively evaluated by others, and
   the breadth of the provider's previous responses across different
   domains of knowledge affect objective judgments of information value.
   Importantly, these effects are moderated by the information seeker's
   goal orientation. The information provider's experience in responding to
   questions in different domains of knowledge increases judgments of
   information value for information seekers with a decision-making
   orientation, whereas the information provider's reputation for providing
   valuable contributions within the focal domain increases judgments of
   information value for information seekers with a learning orientation.

   that is, as the number of intervening attribute levels increases, the
   derived importance weight of an attribute increases. The authors use
   three studies to show that attentional processes contribute to the
   number-of-levels effect. When there is an inequality in the number of
   levels across attributes, a given profile may include levels of one
   attribute that are relatively more novel than levels of the accompanying
   attributes. A process of attentional contrast directs attention toward
   the relatively novel attribute levels within each profile. Increased
   attention toward these attribute levels results in a larger derived
   importance weight for the attributes defined on those levels.

AB Firms often use a pricing strategy in which the total price of a product
   and/or service is partitioned into two or more mandatory components.
   Whereas previous research has compared partitioned with non-partitioned
   pricing, this article examines how partitioning the total price
   differently across the components affects consumer preferences. In four
   studies, the authors show that consumers' reactions to price
   partitioning are moderated by the perceived consumption benefit of the
   components. Specifically, consumers are more sensitive to the price of
   components that provide low consumption benefits than to the price of
   components that provide relatively high consumption benefits.
   Consequently, when evaluating different partitions of the same total
   price, consumers prefer partitions in which the price of the low-benefit
   component is lower and the price of the high-benefit component is
   higher.

AB Three studies demonstrate that the framing of redemption windows as
   expansive or restrictive, with the actual length of the window held
   constant, influences consumers' evaluations of sales promotions. When
   feasibility concerns are highlighted (i.e., an implemental mind-set),
   consumers prefer the expansive ("anytime") to the restrictive ("only")
   frame. However, consumers in a deliberative mind-set prefer the
   restrictive (only) frame to the expansive (anytime) frame. Study 1
   reveals that whereas the former consumers attend more to their ability
   to redeem the offer, the latter are influenced more by the precision of
   the offer. Study 2 highlights the mediating role of these inferences on
   consumers' likelihood of taking advantage of the offer. Study 3

AB The authors develop a new method to assess how changes in the intensity
   of mature distribution networks-specifically, those in the U.S.
   automotive industry-might affect consumer choice. They capture
   distribution intensity by car make (e.g., Honda, Toyota) at the
   disaggregate level using the exact geographic locations of individual
   buyers and new car dealers. They develop three buyer-centric measures
   for the intensity level of each competing make from this information:
   (1) dealer accessibility (the buyer's distance to the nearest outlet for
   each make), (2) dealer concentration (the extent to which multiple
   dealers for each make are located near a given buyer), and (3) dealer
   spread (the dispersion of the multiple dealers for each make relative to
   the buyer's location). The authors propose a logit choice model,
   estimated with Bayesian methods, to study the association of these
   measures with new car choices. They apply the model to buyer records in
   the midsize premium sedan category, drawn from an anonymous sample
   provided by the Power Information Network. All three buyer-centric
   measures of intensity were significantly related to new car choice.
   Buyers were more likely to select cars whose dealer networks had shorter
   distances to the closest outlet (accessibility), more dealers within a
   given radius from the buyer (concentration), and locations that skewed
   toward the buyer (spread). Based on the modeling results, the market
   share elasticity of distribution intensity averages approximately .6
   across the new car models included in the study. The approach should
   help firms evaluate the potential effects of expanding or contracting
   distribution networks for mature products.

AB In this article, the authors offer a methodology to decompose the
   effects of price promotions into brand switching, stockpiling, and
   change in consumption by explicitly allowing for consumer heterogeneity
   in brand preferences and consumption needs. They develop a dynamic
   structural model of a household that decides when, what, and how much to
   buy, as well as how much to consume, to maximize its expected utility
   over an infinite horizon. By making certain simplifying assumptions, the
   authors reduce the dimensionality of the problem. They estimate the
   proposed model using household purchase data in the canned tuna and
   paper towels categories. The results from the model offer insights into
   the decomposition of promotional effects into its components. This could
   help managers make inferences about which brand's sales are more
   responsive to stockpiling or increase in consumption expansion and how
   temporary price cuts affect future sales. Contrary to previous
   literature, the authors find that brand switching is not the dominant
   force for the increase in sales. They show that brand-loyal consumers
   respond to a price promotion mainly by stockpiling for future
   consumption, whereas brand switchers do not stockpile at all. The
   authors also find that heavy users stockpile more, whereas light users
   mainly increase consumption when there is a price promotion.

AB Although retail price wars have received much business press and some
   research attention, it is unclear how they affect consumer purchase
   behavior. This article studies an unprecedented price war in Dutch
   grocery retailing that started in fall 2003, initiated by the market
   leader to halt its sliding market share. The authors investigate the
   short- and long-term effects of the price war on store visits, on
   spending, and on the sensitivity of these decisions to weekly prices and
   price image. They use a unique data set with consumer hand-scan and
   perceptual data for a national panel of 1821 households, covering two
   years before and two years after the price war started. Although the
   price war initially entailed more shopping around and increased
   spending, spending per visit ultimately dropped because consumers
   redistributed their purchases across stores. The price war made
   consumers more sensitive to weekly prices and price image, which helped
   both the chain that showed an improvement in price image (the price war
   initiator) and the chains that already had a favorable price image (hard
   discounters). The price war initiator managed to halt the slide in its
   market share, and its stock price improved. The losers were the rival
   mid-level and high-end chains. Unlike the initiator, their price image
   did not improve, and they suffered from increased price image
   sensitivity. The authors provide managerial implications for firms that
   are (or about to be) involved in a price war.

   a giant player's foreign entry on incumbents operating in that region.
   They use Wal-Mart's entry into the United Kingdom, through its
   acquisition of Asda, as the empirical context. Drawing on the marketing,
   strategy, and finance literature streams, the authors develop hypotheses
   as to why some incumbents are negatively affected whereas others
   actually may benefit from the entry of a giant competitor. Their measure
   of performance impact is the change in shareholder value around the
   announcement date, which has recently been recognized as an important
   metric to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing actions. The authors
   find strong support for the conceptual model, which distinguishes
   between the seriousness of the threat to the incumbents and their
   capacity to withstand the threat. The authors validate their findings
   using three alternative measures of company performance: percentage
   growth in the incumbent retailer's sales, earnings before interest and
   taxes, and return on assets between 1998 (the year before the Asda
   takeover) and 2002 (three years after the takeover). The authors discuss
   various managerial implications of their results. By acting proactively,
   incumbents can mitigate the negative performance consequences, while
   maximally benefiting from the positive implications of a giant
   competitor's entry.

AB Major League Baseball and other professional sports leagues have long
   been concerned with competitive imbalances caused by differences in
   local revenues. The fear is that in the absence of salary caps or other
   regulatory mechanisms, smaller-market teams will be unable to remain
   competitive. This research uses a structural dynamic programming model
   to analyze ownership's payroll investment decisions. This model
   estimates the relationship between optimal payrolls and local-market
   populations and the influence of long-term customer equity dynamics on
   payroll investments. In addition, the author analyzes the impact of a
   recent policy intervention that implemented revenue transfers from
   highlocal-revenue markets to low-local-revenue markets. The statistical
   results indicate that market population has a significant impact on the
   value of a team's payroll investments. For example, optimal payrolls
   double as the population increases from 2.5 million to 7.5 million.
   Furthermore, rather than improving competitive balance, the adoption of
   revenue sharing has decreased the incentives for small-market teams to
   remain competitive. The author uses the estimation results to evaluate
   alternative approaches to managing competitive balance. Specifically,
   the results suggest that basing revenue-sharing payments on local-market
   population and (higher) attendance rates reduces payroll dispersion.

AB The authors model (1) the impact of the supplier's relationship
   propensity before the auction on the supplier's bidding aggressiveness
   in the auction (in terms of the number of bids it submits, the rate at
   which the bids are submitted, and the price concessions offered) and (2)
   the impact of bidding behaviors in the auction on the buyer-supplier
   relationship after auction through longitudinal survey data from 12
   online reverse auctions across various product categories. The results
   suggest that incumbency, many bidders, and a willingness to make
   specific investments lead to less aggressive bidding, whereas the total
   number of bids from competing suppliers increases aggressiveness. In
   turn, aggressive bidding behavior reduces suppliers' disposition toward
   developing a relationship with the buyer and sours incumbent
   satisfaction with the relationship. Finally, auctions that are longer in
   duration can improve the relationship but may risk bidding competition.
   Collectively, the results suggest that pricing and relationships are
   intertwined and traded off against each other in complex ways and that
   the auction does not operate in isolation of key organizational
   variables.

AB The authors propose a new incentive-aligned upgrading method for
   eliciting attribute preferences in complex products, which combines the
   merits of a self-explicated approach and conjoint analysis. The
   upgrading method first endows a participant with a product profile and
   then allows him or her to upgrade it, one attribute at a time, to a more
   desirable product configuration. During the process, the participant
   states his or her willingness to pay for each potential upgrade he or
   she is interested in, and a BDM (Becker-DeGroot-Marschak) procedure
   ensures that it is in the best interest of the participant to state
   truthfully his or her willingness to pay. Each participant receives the
   upgraded product at the end of the study. The authors empirically
   implement this procedure in a Web-based study with digital cameras. This
   procedure significantly improves predictive performance over the
   benchmark (self -explicated) approach.

AB A firm planning market entry can attempt to develop a product that is
   either similar to the incumbent's existing offering (imitation) or
   entirely novel (innovation). The authors establish that when the
   incumbent is more aggressive in research and development (R&D), this
   negatively affects the entrant's marginal return on R&D. Thus, if
   greater profits produce a strong (weak) desire for the incumbent to
   increase its R&D level, the entrant will respond by sharply decreasing
   (increasing) its R&D level. As a result, the incumbent's likelihood of
   retaining the lead position will exhibit an inverse U-shaped pattern as
   a function of monopoly and duopoly profits. The authors then examine the
   impact of uncertainty about the rewards from new products and allow
   firms to conduct market research to resolve the uncertainty. They
   characterize the conditions for the entrant's innovation versus
   imitation decision to reveal information about future rewards to the
   incumbent. When duopoly profits are uncertain and can be either high
   (upside potential) or low (downside potential), the entry strategy will
   be revealing if the upside potential is attractive enough relative to
   monopoly profits. In contrast, when innovation has uncertain commercial
   potential (i.e., either valued or not valued by consumers), the entry
   strategy will be revealing if duopoly profits are unattractive relative
   to monopoly profits. In these cases, the entrant's innovation-imitation
   decision is driven by market research; this allows the incumbent to
   forgo market research and infer the true state of demand from the type
   of entry strategy it observes.

AB Computer and Web-based interviewing tools have made response times
   ubiquitous in marketing research. Practitioners use these data as an
   indicator of data quality, and academics use them as an indicator of
   latent processes related to memory, attributes, and decision making. The
   authors investigate a Poisson race model with choice and response times
   as dependent variables. The model facilitates inference about
   respondents' preferences for choice alternatives, their diligence in
   providing responses, and the accessibility of attitudes and the speed of
   thinking. Thus, the model distinguishes between respondents who are
   quick to think and those who are quick to react but do so without much
   thought. Empirically, the authors find support for the endogenous nature
   of response times and demonstrate that models that treat response times
   as exogenous variables may result in misleading inferences.

AB Companies are conducting more and longer surveys than ever before.
   Massive questionnaires are pervasive in marketing practice. As an
   alternative to the heuristic methods that are currently used to split
   questionnaires, this study develops a methodology to design the split
   questionnaire in a way that minimizes information loss. Using estimates
   from a first wave or pilot study, the authors apply the modified Fedorov
   algorithm using the Kullback-Leibler distance as a design criterion to
   find the optimal splits. Their design criterion is based on a general
   mixed data model that accommodates continuous, rank-ordered, and
   discrete measurement scales. The optimal construction of the split
   questionnaire design is easy and fast. The authors use Markov chain
   Monte Carlo procedures to impute missing values that result from the
   design. They generate split questionnaire designs by selecting either
   entire blocks of questions (between-block design) or sets of questions
   in each block (within-block design). They compare the efficiency of
   split questionnaires generated with the proposed method with multiple
   matrix sampling designs, incomplete block designs, and a heuristic
   procedure, using synthetic and empirical Web survey data. The authors
   illustrate in a field study that as a result of reduced respondent
   burden, the quality of data using split questionnaire designs improves.

   models on the basis of household panel data. As the authors show both

   observations can bias price elasticities, even in cases in which the
   data are generated by a multinomial logit model. The authors show that
   art appropriate choice of a model form (i.e., specification) is
   influenced by the incidence of "missingness" and the mechanism presumed
   to be causing a brand to have no purchases in a given store/week. The

AB The authors demonstrate that partitioning an aggregate quantity of a
   resource (e.g., food, money) into smaller units reduces the consumed
   quantity or the rate of consumption of that resource. Partitions draw
   attention to the consumption decision by introducing a small transaction
   cost; that is, they provide more decision-making opportunities so that
   prudent consumers can control consumption. Thus, people are better able
   to constrain consumption when resources associated with a desirable
   activity (which they are trying to control) are partitioned rather than
   when they are aggregated. This effect of partitioning is demonstrated
   for the consumption of chocolates (Study 1) and gambles (Study 2). In
   Study 3, process measures reveal that partitioning increases recall
   accuracy and decision times. Importantly, the effect of partitioning
   diminishes when consumers are not trying to regulate consumption
   (Studies 1 and 3). Finally, Study 4 explores how habituation may
   decrease the amount of attention that partitions draw to consumption. In
   this context, partitions control consumption to a greater extent when
   the nature of partitions changes frequently.

AB The self-control literature is premised on the notion of myopia
   (short-sightedness or present-biased preferences) and assumes that
   choosing vices generates regret. An alternative perspective suggests
   that consumers often suffer from a reverse self-control problem-namely,
   excessive farsightedness and overcontrol, or "hyperopia." This research
   examines whether consumers can foresee the detrimental long-term
   consequences of hyperopia. Five studies demonstrate that anticipating
   long-term regret relaxes self-control and motivates consumers to
   counteract their righteousness. Consumers are more likely to select
   indulgences and luxuries when they judge the longer-term regrets of
   others, anticipate their own regret in the distant future, and reflect
   on their regret regarding an actual decision made in the more distant
   past. The article concludes with two field experiments that examine the
   effect of anticipatory regret on real consumer purchases at a shopping
   mail and during Thanksgiving. These experiments demonstrate that
   anticipating long-term regret leads consumers to buy pleasurable
   products rather than practical necessities and to spend more on
   shopping. The implications for marketers and consumers are discussed.

AB This research examines the impact of attractiveness on consumers during

   attractive social influence in the context of touching and contamination
   of store products by investigating how consumers respond when they see
   attractive others touching the same products they want to purchase. In
   doing so, it provides the first experimental evidence of a positive
   contagion effect in either the marketing or the psychology literature.
   Across three field experiments using an actual retail shopping
   environment, the authors find that product evaluations are higher when
   consumers perceive a product as having been physically touched by a
   highly attractive other. Moreover, they identify sex as a critical
   moderating variable in the realization of this positive contagion
   effect; the contact source and observing consumer must be of the
   opposite sex for positive contagion to occur. Finally, in contrast to
   previous work, the authors demonstrate that these effects are driven by
   a physical model of contagion.

AB In many markets, there is likely to be correlation both across periods
   in terms of the choices of one consumer and across consumers in terms of
   their choices in each period. The former is caused by consumer
   heterogeneity, and the latter may be the result of demand common shocks
   across consumers. Furthermore, if firms partially observe these common
   shocks, their market decisions may end up being endogenous and
   correlated with the common shocks. Because researchers cannot typically
   fully observe consumer heterogeneity and the common shocks, the
   estimation method must account for the endogeneity of firms' decisions.
   In this article, the authors present a test for endogeneity under
   unobserved consumer heterogeneity and common shocks, which is based on a
   quasi-likelihood estimation method, to estimate the model parameters
   consistently when endogenous firm behavior, unobserved heterogeneity,
   and common shocks are present. The test examines the differences in
   general method of moments coefficient estimates of a model with and
   without instrumenting for the explanatory variables. The authors show
   theoretically that in their estimation method, unobserved heterogeneity
   does not affect the consistency of the parameter estimates, but if it is
   not accounted for, endogeneity may bias the results. They present
   estimation results from simulated and scanner panel data.

   the use of individual-level Bayesian methods for studying this problem

   consistent with the aggregate data. The authors analyze various
   marketing scenarios that differ in terms of their assumptions about
   consumer choices, coupon availability, and coupon redemption. They

   then show that exposure to uniqueness arrays (e.g., one circle among six

AB This research reports on a cognitive neuroscientific examination of
   whether trade-off aversion explains the attraction effect. The principal
   study involves the neuroimaging of participants engaging in choice tasks
   while their cerebral activity is recorded. The authors examine whether
   the presence of a third (normatively irrelevant) alternative yields
   relatively less activation in areas of the brain associated with
   negative emotion than the activation during choice tasks involving two
   equally (un)attractive options. The results support the claim that
   trade-off choice sets are associated with relatively greater negative
   emotion. The authors discuss the implications of the research for
   marketing theory and methodology, as well as for managerial practice in
   the corporate and public policy arenas.

   episodes and conceptualize the underlying processes. Consistent with
   previous research, consumers expect more negative and less positive
   feelings when they indulge without a reason than when they indulge with
   a reason (Study 1) or when they indulge as a consolation for poor
   performance than when they indulge as a reward for high effort (Study
   2). However, episodic reports pertaining to the last indulgence episode
   show no influence of having versus not having a reason (Study 1), nor do
   concurrent reports show a difference between indulging as a consolation
   and indulging as a reward (Study 2). When asked how they "usually" feel
   when indulging with versus without a reason (Study 3), consumers' global
   memories are consistent with their expectations rather than with their
   actual experiences. These findings have implications for the conditions
   under which consumers learn from experience.

   theorize and find that people's use of holistic cognition, as prompted
   by an interdependent self-view, produces an assimilation effect. Product
   evaluations are assimilated with associations with the table surface.
   However, people who rely on analytic processing, as prompted by an
   independent self-view, elicit a contrast effect in which evaluations are
   negatively related to such associations.

AB In this research, the authors examine the impact of imagination-focused
   visualization on the evaluation of really new products (RNPs)-that is,
   products that provide novel benefits but involve high learning costs.
   They compare imagination-focused visualization with memory-focused
   visualization and demonstrate that an imaginative focus leads to higher
   evaluations of an RNP but has no effect on the evaluation of
   incrementally new products, which involve continuous innovations that
   are easier to understand. They find that the underlying mechanism for
   this effect is imagination's impact on the perceived value of new
   benefits rather than on the learning costs. Furthermore, they show that
   the advantage of an imaginative focus is not simply due to the increased
   focus on product benefits, because imagination still leads to higher
   product evaluation than memory-focused visualization, even if
   participants in both conditions are asked to think about product
   benefits exclusively. Finally, an explicit focus on learning costs while
   using an imaginative approach draws attention away from product benefits
   and attenuates the advantage of imagination on product evaluation.

AB This research suggests that consumers' approach/avoidance tendencies
   depend on their implicit theories about the world around them. Entity
   theorists believe in the immutability of the world, and thus they are
   not influenced by whether a persuasive message is framed in terms of
   approach or avoidance. In contrast, incremental theorists believe that
   the world is mutable, and thus they are influenced by the message frame.
   This proposition is supported in two studies that feature advertising
   messages. The mechanism underlying these effects differs as a function
   of implicit theory orientation. Entity theorists' focus on the outcome
   and incremental theorists' reliance on the process form the basis for
   the observed findings. A third study reveals that when a consumer's
   implicit theory is violated, these findings are reversed. The authors
   discuss theoretical and managerial implications.

AB Mental accounting posits that people track their expenditures using
   cognitive categories or "mental accounts." The authors propose that this
   cognitive process can be complemented by an approach that examines how
   feelings about a sum of money, or the money's "affective tag" influence
   its consumption. When people receive money under negative circumstances,
   this tag can include a negative affect component, which people aim to
   reduce by engaging in strategic consumption. The authors investigate two
   such strategies, laundering and hedonic avoidance, and demonstrate their
   effect on consumption of windfalls. The authors find that people avoid
   spending their negatively tagged money on hedonic expenditures and
   prefer to make utilitarian or virtuous expenditures to reduce, or
   "launder," their negative feelings about the windfall. The authors call
   this tagging process and strategic consumption "emotional accounting."

AB Consumers' judgments of the magnitude of numerical differences are
   influenced by the ease of mental computations. The results from a set of
   experiments show that ease of computation can affect judgments of the
   magnitude of price differences, discount magnitudes, and brand choices.
   Participants seem to believe that it is easier to judge the size of a
   larger difference than that of a smaller difference. In the absence of
   appropriate corrective steps, this naive belief can lead to systematic
   biases in judgments. For example, when presented with two pairs of
   numbers, participants incorrectly judged the magnitude of the difference
   to be smaller for pairs with difficult computations (e.g., 4.97 - 3.96,
   an arithmetic difference of 1.01) than for pairs with easy computations
   (e.g., 5.00 - 4.00, an arithmetic difference of 1.00). The effect does
   not manifest when judgments do not entail mental computations or when
   participants are made aware that the ease or difficulty is caused by
   computational complexity. Furthermore, this effect is mitigated when
   participants' prior experience is manipulated in a learning phase of the
   experiment. The results have implications for buyers and sellers and for
   understanding the role of metacognitive experiences in numerical
   judgments.

   in relation to the self, with consumers varying in their tendency to
   include important brands as part of their self-concepts. The authors
   develop an eight-item scale to measure BESC and demonstrate that it
   captures a consumer's general engagement with brands. This scale
   successfully predicts consumers' differential attention to, memory of,
   and preference for their favorite brands. Brand engagement in
   self-concept is also related to differential brand loyalty, with
   high-BESC consumers being less price and time sensitive regarding their
   favorite brands than low-BESC consumers. The authors discuss the

   map the dynamic competitive interactions among the firms sending the
   mailings. The authors investigate the impact of direct mailings on the
   revenues of each firm and its competitors over time. The model accounts
   for endogeneity of the mailing decision and for unobserved heterogeneity
   across households. The model is considered in a charitable giving
   setting, in which households often receive many direct mailings of
   different charities within a short period and competition is strong. The
   authors construct a unique database by merging the databases of three
   large charity organizations in the Netherlands. This results in
   household-level data on the direct mailings households received from and
   their donations to each of the three charities. The results show that a
   charity's own mailings are short-term substitutes; that is, an extra
   mailing cannibalizes the revenues of subsequent mailings. Furthermore,
   competitive charitable direct mailings tend to be short-term
   complements; that is, the direct mailings increase the total pie that is
   divided among the charities. In the long run, these effects die out. The
   results are also interpreted from a behavioral perspective.

AB Researchers disagree about the critical drivers of success in and
   efficiency of high-tech markets. On the one hand, some researchers
   assert that high-tech markets are efficient with best-quality brands
   being dominant. On the other hand, many scholars suspect that network
   effects lead to perverse markets in which the dominant brands do not
   have the best quality. The authors develop scenarios about the relative
   importance of these effects and the efficiency of markets. Empirical
   analysis of historical data on 19 categories shows that though both
   quality and network effects affect market share flows, in general
   markets are efficient. In particular, market share leadership changes
   often, switches in share leadership closely follow switches in quality
   leadership, and the best-quality brands, not the ones that are first to
   enter, dominate the market. Network effects enhance the positive effect
   of quality.

AB Many of the products introduced during the past two decades have been
   services rather than goods. An important influence on the growth and
   long-term profits of these services is customer attrition, which can
   occur at the category level (disadoption) or between firms (churn).
   However, the literature has rarely modeled how services penetrate a
   market and has not evaluated the effect of attrition on growth. The
   authors combine diffusion modeling with a customer relationship approach
   to investigate the influence of attrition on growth in service markets.
   In particular, the authors model the effects of disadoption and churn on
   evolution of a category and on growth of individual firms in a
   competitive environment. The authors show how neglecting disadoption can
   bias parameter estimation and, especially, market potential. They also
   derive an expression for the customer equity of a growing service firm
   and apply it to valuation of firms operating in competitive industries.
   The results for six of seven firms in four service categories are
   remarkably close to stock market valuations, an indicator for the role
   of customer equity in valuations of growing service firms.

   convenience, prices, and feature advertising, on consumers' grocery
   store choice decisions. Extending recent research on store choice, they
   add assortments as a predictor, specify a general structure for
   heterogeneity, and estimate store choice and category needs models
   simultaneously. Using household-level market basket data, the authors
   find that, in general, assortments are more important than retail prices
   in store choice decisions. They find that the number of brands offered
   in retail assortments has a positive effect on store choice for most
   households, while the number of stockkeeping units per brand, sizes per
   brand, and proportion of stockkeeping units that are unique to the store
   (a proxy for presence of private labels) have a negative effect on store
   choice for most households. They also find more heterogeneity in
   response to assortment than to either convenience or price. Therefore,
   optimal assortments depend on the particular preferences of a retailer's
   shoppers. Finally, the authors find a correlation in household-level
   responses to assortment and travel distance (r = .43), which suggests
   that the less important an assortment is to a consumer's store choices,
   the more the consumer values convenience, and vice versa.

   are more profitable in online stores than in offline stores, while the
   opposite holds for competitive promotions; (3) the incremental payoff of

   promotions is small in general, especially in offline stores; (4) for
   categories that are promotion sensitive, individual-level customized
   promotions can lead to a meaningful profit increase over segment- and
   mass market-level customized promotions in online stores; and (5) low
   redemption rates are a major impediment to the success of customized

   full-information Bayesian methods. The results suggest that accounting
   for firm strategic behavior improves profitability by 14%-23% compared
   with segment-level targeting. In addition, ignoring firm strategic
   behavior underestimates the benefit of individual-level targeting
   significantly. The authors provide reasons for this finding. They also
   carry out several robustness checks to test the validity of the modeling
   assumptions.

AB Across four studies, including one involving an actual monetary
   decision, the authors demonstrate that forming a product consideration
   set by excluding versus including alternatives induces consumers to
   place more weight on ethical attributes, such as company labor practices
   and animal testing. This nonnormative difference reflects a
   compatibility between exclusion and ethics, and it holds regardless of
   attribute framing or consumer emotion. The authors also find that
   consumers judge others' behavior more negatively for excluding ethical
   products than for including ethical products. These results have
   implications for the marketing of ethical products, both specifically
   (e.g., it is important to encourage exclusion modes) and generally
   (e.g., the failure to consider ethical products may reflect seemingly
   minor contextual issues guiding the decision process and not consumer
   disinterest in ethical issues).

AB This research demonstrates that consumers' desire for counterfeit luxury
   brands hinges on the social motivations (i.e., to express themselves
   and/or to fit in) underlying their luxury brand preferences. In
   particular, the authors show that both consumers' preferences for a
   counterfeit brand and the subsequent negative change in their
   preferences for the real brand are greater when their luxury brand
   attitudes serve a social-adjustive rather than a value-expressive
   function. In addition, consumers' moral beliefs about counterfeit
   consumption affect their counterfeit brand preferences only when their
   luxury brand attitudes serve a value-expressive function. Finally, the
   authors demonstrate that the social functions served by consumers'
   luxury brand attitudes can be influenced by elements of the marketing
   mix (e.g., product design, advertising), thus enabling marketers to curb
   the demand for counterfeit brands through specific marketing-mix
   actions.

AB In this article, the authors consider the problem of outlet pricing and
   location in the context of unobserved spatial demand. The analysis
   constitutes a scenario in which capacity-constrained firms set prices
   conditional on their location, demand, and costs. This enables firms to
   develop maps of latent demand patterns across the market in which they
   compete. The analysis further suggests locations for additional outlets
   and the resultant equilibrium effect on profits and prices. Using
   Bayesian spatial statistics, the authors apply their model to seven
   years of data on apartment location and prices in Roanoke, Va. They find
   that spatial covariation in demand is material in outlet choice; the 95%
   spatial decay in demand extends 3.6 miles in a region that measures
   slightly more than 9.5 miles. They also find that capacity constraints
   can cost complexes upward of $100 per apartment. As they predict, price
   elasticities and costs are biased downward when spatial covariance in
   demand is ignored. Costs are biased upward when capacity constraints are
   ignored. Using the analysis to suggest locations for entry, the authors
   find that properly accounting for spatial effects and capacity
   constraints leads to an entry recommendation that improves profitability
   by 66% over a model that ignores these effects.

   that field independents are more likely to extract and integrate
   episodic information to form overall brand beliefs, while field
   dependents tend to store more detailed, episodic information in memory
   and are less likely to generalize information across product categories.
   The authors further propose that this effect is moderated by level of

   people evaluate marketing communications. The results from five studies

AB People are frequently faced with making a new choice decision after a
   preferred option becomes unavailable. Prior research on the attraction
   effect has demonstrated how the introduction of an option into a choice
   set increases the share of one of the original options. The authors
   examine the related but previously unaddressed issue of whether the
   unexpected exit of an option from a choice set returns the choice shares
   of the original options to the status quo. In a series of experiments,
   they observe that when an option turns out to be unselectable following
   a choice problem in which it was selectable, the choice shares of the
   remaining options are predictably different from those of a choice
   problem in which the option was unselectable from the start. They also
   observe that this attraction effect due to the disappearance of a decoy
   is likely a consequence of changes in the importance of decision
   criteria. They conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and
   managerial implications of the research.

AB Although choices can occur after careful deliberation, many everyday
   choices are usually effortless and are guided by intuitive thinking.
   This research examines the implications of the interplay between these
   two types of decision processes for context effects in choice by
   exploring the consequences of the depletion of executive resources in a
   prior, unrelated task. Building on a substantial body of psychological
   literature that points to a single underlying resource used for
   self-regulation and executive control, this article demonstrates that
   resource depletion has a systematic influence on choice in context.
   Specifically, resource depletion enhances the role of intuitive
   reasoning by impairing deliberate, careful processing. In five
   experiments, the authors find that resource depletion increases the
   share of reference-dependent choices, decreases the compromise effect,
   and magnifies the attraction effect. The results shed light on the
   mechanisms underlying context effects in choice and suggest that the
   scope of the depleted resource is not constrained to self-regulation
   activities but rather extends to choice in general.

AB Sales contests are short-term incentives that managers use to raise
   sales effort. The extant marketing theory predicts that the optimal
   prize structure should have two characteristics: (1) The number of
   prizewinners should be greater than one, and (2) prize values should be
   unique and rank ordered. However, this theory has not been empirically
   examined. This article presents two empirical studies that examine
   whether the prize structure of a sales contest affects sales
   performance. In each study, the authors investigate the incremental
   effects of introducing multiple prizewinners and unique rank-ordered
   prizes into a sales contest. The first study consists of two laboratory
   experiments in which participants make decisions that closely reflect
   the decision trade-offs in the theoretical model of sales contests. The
   second study consists of two field economic experiments in which trained
   salespeople sell fundraising sponsorships to companies. The results
   across the experiments are remarkably consistent: The number of
   prizewinners in a sales contest should indeed be greater than one.
   However, introducing rank-ordered prizes into contests with multiple
   prizewinners does not boost sales effort and revenues.

AB Anecdotal evidence indicates that in a gambling environment, consumers
   may end up betting more than they had initially planned. The authors
   assess this phenomenon in a series of three experiments, in which people
   are exposed to sequential and fair gambles in a two-stage process
   (planned and actual bets). The results show that in the planning phase,
   people behave conservatively, betting on average less after an
   anticipated loss and the same amount after an anticipated gain. However,
   after experiencing an actual loss in the first gamble, people bet in a
   subsequent gamble significantly more than they had initially planned,
   whereas on average, there were no observable differences from the plan
   after an actual gain. The reason for such asymmetry is due in part to
   people's tendency to underestimate, at the planning phase of the gamble,
   the impact of negative emotions in betting decisions during the actual
   phase of the gamble.

AB How do arousal-inducing contexts, such as frightening or romantic
   television programs, influence the effectiveness of basic persuasion
   heuristics? Three theoretical models make different predictions: (1) A
   general arousal model predicts that arousal should increase the
   effectiveness of heuristics, (2) an affective valence model predicts
   that effectiveness should depend on whether the context elicits positive
   or negative affect, and (3) an evolutionary model predicts that
   persuasiveness should depend on both the specific emotion elicited and
   the content of the particular heuristic. Three experiments examine how
   fear-inducing versus romantic contexts influence the effectiveness of
   two widely used heuristics-social proof (e.g., "most popular") and
   scarcity (e.g., "limited edition"). The results support the predictions
   from an evolutionary model, showing that fear can lead scarcity appeals
   to be counterpersuasive and that romantic desire can lead social proof
   appeals to be counterpersuasive. The findings highlight how an
   evolutionary theoretical approach can lead to novel theoretical and
   practical marketing insights.

AB An important decision that retailers make involves selecting the number
   of items constituting their assortments. A key issue in making these
   decisions is the role of assortment size in determining consumers'
   choice of a retailer. The authors address this issue by investigating
   how consumer choice among retailers offering various-sized assortments
   is influenced by the attractiveness of the options constituting these
   assortments. The data show that consumer preference for retailers
   offering larger assortments tends to decrease as the attractiveness of
   the options in their assortments increases and can even lead to a
   reversal of preferences in favor of retailers offering smaller
   assortments. This research further presents evidence that the
   relationship between assortment size and option attractiveness is
   concave, such that the marginal impact of assortment size on choice
   decreases as the attractiveness of the options increases. Data from
   eight empirical studies offer converging evidence in support of the
   theoretical predictions.

AB Advertisements often stimulate consumers to imagine themselves in a
   situation in which they would personally benefit from using the product
   being advertised. However, when an advertisement is intended to induce
   consumers to benefit someone else (e.g., to donate money for relief of
   disaster victims), stimulating them to imagine themselves in the
   situation confronting the beneficiary can sometimes conflict with the
   image they form of themselves as a potential helper. This conflict in
   imagined perspective can decrease the advertisement's effectiveness.
   Five studies confirm this hypothesis. When participants took the
   perspective of the beneficiary at the time they read an appeal for help,
   characteristics of the appeal that increased the ease with which they
   could imagine the situation from this perspective (e.g., a picture of
   the victim) had a positive effect on both their urge to help and the
   amount of money they donated. However, when they had an a priori
   disposition to take the perspective of a potential donor at the time
   they read the appeal, these same characteristics decreased the appeal's
   effectiveness.

AB The conventional wisdom in economic theory holds that switching costs
   make markets less competitive. This article challenges this claim. The
   authors formulate an empirically realistic model of dynamic price
   competition that allows for differentiated products and imperfect
   lock-in. They calibrate this model with data from frequently purchased
   packaged goods markets. These data are ideal in the sense that they have
   the necessary variation to identify switching costs separately from
   consumer heterogeneity. Equally important, consumers exhibit inertia in
   their brand choices, a form of psychological switching cost. This makes
   the results applicable to the broad range of products that are
   distinctly identified (i.e., branded) rather than just to products for
   which there is a product adoption cost or explicit switching fee. In the
   simulations, prices are as much as 18% lower with than without switching
   costs. More important, equilibrium prices do not increase even in the
   presence of switching costs that are of the same order of magnitude as
   product price.

AB This article examines competition among Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target
   using two distinct but related approaches. The authors first develop and
   estimate a discrete game in which each chain's store presence and format
   decisions in local markets depend on the decisions of its competitors
   and market characteristics. This analysis is extended to evaluate the
   determinants of store revenues for each chain in local markets as a
   function of market characteristics, including the presence of competing
   firms. These regressions use the results of the initial model to correct
   for the endogeneity of observed market structures. The results from both
   exercises illustrate several important asymmetries across the firms.
   Kmart and Wal-Mart prefer similar markets, but Wal-Mart's competitive
   position is dominant enough to prevent Kmart's operation in otherwise
   attractive markets. In contrast, Target prefers substantially different
   market characteristics. In total, the results support a view of the
   industry as one in which Wal-Mart is dominant, Target serves more of a
   niche role, and Kmart struggles to find its footing.

AB Drawing on the accessibility-diagnosticity framework and previous
   literature on branding and order of entry, the authors hypothesize that
   perception spillovers can also occur across directly competing products
   that do not share a common brand name. The authors suggest two
   mechanisms (prior perception spillover and dynamic perception spillover)
   and one moderating variable (product/brand similarity). To test for
   spillovers across competing brands, the authors develop a structural
   Bayesian learning model and estimate it using prescription choice and
   marketing communication data from a panel of physicians. From their
   model results, the authors find evidence of prior and dynamic perception
   spillovers across competing brands only when brands are sufficiently
   similar. In contrast, they find no evidence of spillover effects across
   brands that are highly dissimilar. Finally, several policy experiments
   illustrate the strength and significance of competitive spillovers for
   product diffusion, and from the results, the authors derive strategic
   implications for order-of-entry effects and the entry of "me-too"
   products.

AB The analysis of customer value in direct marketing typically combines
   customer timing and quantity data into a single statistic that is used
   to compute lifetime values, rank-order customers for differential
   action, and identify prospects for cross-selling. However, current
   models assume that purchase timing and quantity decisions are
   independently realized (i.e., uncorrelated) over time given
   individual-level parameters. In this article, the authors show that
   customer value calculations can be severely biased in these models when
   timing and quantity are dependently related. The authors propose
   alternative models that lead to substantial gains in profitability in
   two direct-marketing data sets. The results indicate that the commonly
   held assumption of independence leads to an over-valuation of customer
   value.

AB The authors study brand loyalties for durable goods using automobile
   survey data that are peculiarly censored and track only elapsed times
   since transitions but not the transition times themselves. This
   censoring problem is typical of commercially available durable goods
   survey data. However, little attention has been paid to such "last-move"
   data in the statistics or marketing literature on the analysis of
   transition times. The authors propose a multistate, continuous-time,
   nonstationary Markov model with a parsimonious brand loyalty structure
   and also propose an estimation approach to recover the parameters of the
   proposed model using the automobile survey data. The proposed model fits
   observed brand choice outcomes even better than a model with a fully
   unrestricted (and, therefore, highly parameterized) transition
   structure. The authors also obtain several substantive findings. For
   example, Chrysler is significantly "weaker" than General Motors and Ford
   insofar as it has the lowest brand loyalty during the study period. The
   authors illustrate the managerial implications by predicting
   time-varying market shares of brands in periods subsequent to the period
   of analysis.

AB Recent studies in marketing have consistently shown that all customers
   are not equally profitable. In the credit card business, all customers
   are not equally risky. When a customer misses one payment on a credit
   card bill, a signal is sent to the credit card company. It is important
   for the card issuer to interpret the signal and to identify whether the
   customer is a low-risk one, who will eventually pay back the debt and
   contribute to the card issuer's profits by paying interest on the
   overdue balance, or a high-risk one, who will not pay back the debt. The
   issuer can then customize its policies to deal with these different
   consumer types. This article develops a dynamic model for debt repayment
   behavior of new customers in the credit card market that makes it
   possible to differentiate between low-risk, delinquent customers and
   high-risk customers. The authors apply the model to a data set of new
   consumers' monthly spending and repayment records.

AB Consumers often make complex choices involving complementary categories,
   such as cell phones and service plans. In the fast-growing high-tech and
   entertainment industries, products from complementary categories are
   often incompatible with one another. This research shows that when
   choosing a pair of such complementary products, a consumer is likely to
   use a two-stage decision strategy: screening by one category first to
   narrow down the number of pairs for further evaluation in the second
   stage. In the presence of incompatibility, screening by one category
   rather than by the other may lead to different choice outcomes. The
   authors develop a behavioral theory-driven choice model that accounts
   for both preference heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity of
   decision strategies to examine the extent to which consumers engage in
   category-based screening. Analysis of data from a 2 x 2 conjoint choice
   experiment reveals that consumers tend to screen a category that has
   higher intracategory differentiation and is congruent with their
   decision goals. The authors further suggest possible marketing actions a
   firm can take to promote the use of a specific decision strategy that
   leads consumers to choose its product.

AB The authors propose a simulated maximum likelihood estimation method for
   the random coefficient logit model using aggregate data, accounting for
   heterogeneity and endogeneity. The method allows for two sources of
   randomness in observed market shares: unobserved product characteristics
   and sampling error. Because of the latter, the method is suitable when
   sample sizes underlying the shares are finite. In contrast, Berry,
   Levinsohn and Pakes's commonly used approach assumes that observed
   shares have no sampling error. The method can be viewed as a
   generalization of Villas-Boas and Winer's approach and is closely
   related to Petrin and Train's "control function" approach. The authors
   show that the proposed method provides unbiased and efficient estimates
   of demand parameters. They also obtain endogeneity test statistics as a
   by-product, including the direction of endogeneity bias. The model can
   be extended to incorporate Markov regime-switching dynamics in
   parameters and is open to other extensions based on maximum likelihood.
   The benefits of the proposed approach are achieved by assuming normality
   of the unobserved demand attributes, an assumption that imposes
   constraints on the types of pricing behaviors that are accommodated.
   However, the authors find in simulations that demand estimates are
   fairly robust to violations of these assumptions.

AB Consumers often make decisions about outcomes and events that occur over
   time. This research examines consumers' sensitivity to the prospective
   duration relevant to their decisions and the implications of such
   sensitivity for intertemporal trade-offs, especially the degree of
   present bias (i.e., hyperbolic discounting). The authors show that
   participants' subjective perceptions of prospective duration are not
   sufficiently sensitive to changes in objective duration and are
   nonlinear and concave in objective time, consistent with psychophysical
   principles. More important, this lack of sensitivity can explain
   hyperbolic discounting. The results replicate standard hyperbolic
   discounting effects with respect to objective time but show a relatively
   constant rate of discounting with respect to subjective time
   perceptions. The results are replicated between subjects (Experiment 1)
   and within subjects (Experiments 2), with multiple time horizons and
   multiple descriptors, and with different measurement orders.
   Furthermore, the authors show that when duration is primed, subjective
   time perception is altered (Experiment 4) and hyperbolic discounting is
   reduced (Experiment 3).

AB This article reports three experiments that examine how communication
   types (informational, relational, and coercive messages) and mutual
   trustworthiness reputations influence sequential bargaining between an
   uncertain manufacturer and an informed distributor in a marketing
   channel. In Experiment 1, bargainers use informational and relational
   messages to establish a positive social tenor in the interaction.
   Compared with when bargainers communicate only through offers and
   counteroffers, explicit communication produces quicker and more
   efficient agreements. The effects are stronger when manufacturer
   uncertainty is relatively high. In Experiment 2, mutual reputations of
   high (versus low) trustworthiness also produce quicker and more
   efficient agreements. In both studies, the larger extracted surplus
   increases manufacturer profits without affecting distributor profits.
   However, contrary to economic intuition, the gains from communication
   accrue asymmetrically to the uninformed manufacturer. Experiment 3 shows
   the effects of communication type are contingent on the prevailing level
   (high or low) of trustworthiness reputations in the dyad. Compared with
   no communication, relational messages elicit the most positive
   (negative) outcomes when trustworthiness reputations are high (low).
   Informational messages have a smaller but positive impact on bargaining
   outcomes in both trustworthiness conditions and appear to build trust.

AB Marketing scholars have proposed that service employees play a primary
   role in delivering service quality. However, the question of how to
   motivate service employees to enhance service production has received
   little research attention. The authors address this gap by advocating a
   control mechanism first discussed in the economics literature-buyer
   monitoring. The authors focus on a pervasive form of buyer monitoring,
   voluntary tipping, and examine the effectiveness of this control
   mechanism as a means for improving service in two contexts: leisure
   cruises and restaurant dining. Despite a substantial interdisciplinary
   literature reporting a weak relationship between customers' perceptions
   of service and their tipping behavior, the results show that a policy of
   voluntary tipping has positive effects on the motivation and behavior of
   service workers and on customers' perceptions of the service those
   workers provide. These findings call attention to buyer monitoring as
   both a topic for academic research and a practical mechanism for
   motivating service employees. The findings also call into question
   trends away from tipping in service contexts, such as the cruise
   industry, and suggest that many service businesses for which tipping is
   not viable can benefit from alternative forms of buyer monitoring.

   quasi-experimental design developed over 16 months, they control for
   unobserved heterogeneity among guests and treatments across hotels and
   develop Bayesian posterior estimates of the varying program effect for
   each hotel. The results contribute to theory and practice. First, they
   provide new insights into how service guarantee programs operate in the
   field. Specifically, the guarantee was more effective at hotels with a
   better prior service history and an easier-to-serve guest population,
   which is consistent with signaling arguments but does not comport with
   the incentive argument that guarantees actually improve service quality.
   Second, the results offer managers better decision rules. Specifically,
   the authors devise program continuation rules that are sensitive to both
   observed and unobserved differences across sites. In addition, they
   devise policies to reward hotels that exceed site-specific expectations.
   By controlling for observed and unobserved differences across sites, the
   authors show that these policies potentially reward even hotels with
   negative net program effects, which is useful in reducing the
   organizational stigma of failure. Finally, the authors identify sites
   that should be targeted for future program rollout by computing the odds

AB Branded components are becoming increasingly popular in industrial
   markets; yet extant research provides limited understanding of the use
   of such arrangements in the real world. The authors use the governance
   lens of transaction cost economics to propose that leveraging the
   vendor's brand reputation and safeguarding the vendor's customization
   investments are key motivators for choosing branded component contracts.
   Data on 191 contracts from three engineering-intensive industry sectors
   provide support to the authors' hypotheses. The authors find that firms
   are more likely to choose branded component contracts when the
   supplier's brand name adds significant differentiation (leveraging) and
   when the component supplier has made significant component customization
   investments (safeguarding). This safeguarding motivation is relevant
   even to suppliers with modest brand reputation. The authors also
   investigate the normative consequences of these contracting decisions
   and find significant adverse outcomes from choosing the "wrong" contract
   form. Furthermore, they find that these outcomes are asymmetric in
   nature. In particular, choosing a "white box" contract when the theory
   argues for a branded component contract leads to more adverse outcomes
   than choosing a branded component contract when the theory predicts a
   "white box" contract. Finally, the authors draw key conclusions for
   theory and managerial practice.

   that firms with a higher estimated probability of strategic thinking
   were more likely to have survived through April 2007. The estimation
   results show considerable heterogeneity in the degree to which firms

   key media: magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. They show that
   advertising is considerably more sensitive to business-cycle
   fluctuations than the economy as a whole. Advertising behaves less
   cyclically in countries high in long-term orientation and power
   distance, but it is more cyclical in countries high in uncertainty
   avoidance. Furthermore, advertising is more sensitive to the business
   cycle in countries characterized by significant stock market pressure
   and few foreign-owned multinational corporations. The authors provide
   initial evidence on the long-term social and managerial losses incurred
   when companies tie ad spending too tightly to business cycles. Countries
   in which advertising behaves more cyclically exhibit slower growth of
   the advertising industry. Moreover, private-label growth is higher in
   countries characterized by more cyclical advertising spending, implying

   novel data set of penetration data for eight high-tech products across
   55 countries. It shows how foreign clout, the susceptibility to foreign
   influences, and intercountry distances affect global spillover patterns.
   The authors find that foreign takeoffs, but not foreign introductions,
   accelerate a focal country's time to takeoff. The larger the country,
   the higher its economic wealth, and the more it exports, the more clout
   it has in the global spillover process. In contrast, the poorer the
   country, the more tourists it receives, and the higher its population
   density, the more susceptible it is to global spillover effects.
   Cross-country spillover effects are stronger the closer the countries
   are to one another, both geographically and economically, but not
   necessarily in terms of culture. The model the authors develop also
   quantifies the spillover between each country pair, allowing it to be

AB There is much evidence that the presence of a feature advertisement can
   increase the sales and market share of the featured product. However,
   little is known about how feature ad characteristics (e.g., size, color,
   and location of the advertisement) affect the sales outcomes and how the
   effects take place. Prior research has predicted that feature
   advertisements lead to behavioral outcomes through their effect on
   consumers' attention. Building on this idea, the authors propose a
   Bayesian statistical model to study how feature ad characteristics
   affect sales of the featured products and the mediating role of
   attention in these relationships. They use data from eye-tracking tests
   of feature advertisements, aggregated and matched with sales data at the
   level of the feature advertisement. Their approach accounts for
   endogeneity in the key variables involved and overcomes limitations of
   standard mediation analyses. They show that the gaze duration on a
   feature advertisement affects sales of the featured product beyond the
   mere presence of the advertisement and that a standard mediation
   analysis that does not accommodate endogeneity produces biased estimates
   of the effects of feature ad characteristics on sales. Their proposed
   methodology is widely applicable to mediation analyses. The findings
   imply that attention data collected in lab tests can help marketers
   compare the relative sales outcomes of different feature ad designs and
   improve the effectiveness and efficiency of feature adverting decisions.

AB To construct a price judgment, consumers compare a focal price with one
   or more reference prices. However, reference price operationalizations
   in the brand choice literature use single-point summary measures that
   cannot account for several distributional effects. To account for
   effects beyond the first moment of the reference price distribution, the
   authors specify price judgments in models of brand choice in accordance
   with range-frequency theory. The findings indicate that range-frequency
   price judgments provide a more complete specification of reference price
   effects and become more important with an increase in the second and
   third moments of a reference price distribution. The data also indicate
   that range effects are stronger for coupon users and frequency effects
   are stronger for consumers exposed to a trend of prices. The results
   have several implications for choice modeling, pricing theory, and
   pricing strategy.

AB This article examines whether customer satisfaction is associated with
   key metrics from corporate bond markets-namely, credit ratings and cost
   of debt financing. The authors draw on theory in marketing and finance
   to predict how customer satisfaction should be associated with both
   measures. To test the hypotheses, they employ the American Customer
   Satisfaction Index (ACSI) database of more than 150 publicly traded
   firms during the period from 1994 to 2004. The empirical work controls
   for factors that are known to influence the bond market, such as firm
   profitability and risk, as well as potential unobservable factors. The
   findings indicate that firms with lower customer satisfaction exhibit
   lower credit ratings and higher debt costs-financial consequences of
   customer satisfaction not previously observed. The results also suggest
   that the association between ACSI and cost of debt is attenuated by the
   inherent level of risk faced by the firm.

AB The authors show that location of the product image on a package facade
   influences consumers' perceptions of the visual heaviness of the product
   and evaluations of the package. The "heavier"("lighter") locations are
   on the bottom (top), right (left), and bottom-right (top-left) of the
   package. For products for which heaviness is considered a positive
   attribute, packages with the product image placed at heavy locations are
   preferred, whereas for products for which heaviness is considered a
   negative attribute, packages using light locations are preferred.
   Furthermore, in the former category (e.g., snacks), a salient health
   goal, as opposed to a neutral goal, weakens the preference for packages
   using heavy locations, though this moderating effect of goal is weaker
   for healthful snacks than for regular snacks. Store shelf context is a
   boundary condition, such that the location effects on perceived product
   heaviness and package evaluation appear in a contrasting context but
   disappear in an assimilating context. Moreover, perceived product
   heaviness mediates (1) the location effect on package evaluation and (2)
   the moderating role of store shelf context (i.e., mediated moderation).

AB Understanding consumer response to product supersizing and downsizing is
   important for policy makers, consumer researchers, and marketers. In
   three laboratory experiments and two field studies, the authors find
   that changes in size appear smaller when packages and portions change in
   all three spatial dimensions-height, width, and length-than when they
   change in only one dimension. Specifically, they show that size
   estimations follow an inelastic power function of the actual size of the
   product, especially when all three spatial dimensions change
   simultaneously. As a result, consumers are more likely to supersize
   their orders when products change in one dimension and are more likely
   to downsize their orders when products change in three dimensions. When
   changing dosage, consumers pour more product into and out of conical
   containers (e.g., martini cocktail glasses, in which volume changes in
   three dimensions) than cylindrical containers (e.g., highball glasses,
   in which volume changes in one dimension). Finally, consumers expect
   (and marketers offer) steeper quantity discounts when products are
   supersized in three dimensions than when they are supersized in one
   dimension, regardless of whether size information is present.

AB Self-customization is the process by which consumers seek to customize
   offerings to their own preferences. In this article, the authors propose
   that differences in self-customization procedures potentially influence
   (1) the product configuration favored, (2) the degree of decision
   difficulty in product customization, (3) the degree of satisfaction with
   the customized option, and (4) the degree of willingness to purchase.
   The authors examine these propositions in a series of studies that allow
   self-customization through the use of either a by-attribute or a
   by-alternative method. They show that consumers tend to choose an
   intermediate (compromise) option significantly more often when they
   customize a product using the by-attribute method than when using the
   by-alternative method. In addition, the by-attribute customization
   procedure leads to a lower level of experienced difficulty, greater
   satisfaction, and higher willingness to purchase the customized option
   than the by-alternative method. Finally, the decrease in experienced
   difficulty in the by-attribute customization method is not solely due to
   the reduction in information consideration but also due to less explicit
   trade-offs among competing characteristics. These results can aid
   marketing managers in designing mass-customization procedures.

   factor that moderates these effects. The results from four studies show

   elaboration are less susceptible to various contextual and presentation
   biases and are more likely to make consistent investment choices.
   Furthermore, the authors find that encouraging predecision elaboration

AB Advertisements for charities often display photographs of the people
   they help to evoke the kind of sympathy that engenders giving. This
   article examines how the expression of emotion on a victim's face
   affects both sympathy and giving. Building on theories of emotional
   contagion and sympathy, the authors propose that (1) people "catch" the
   emotions displayed on a victim's face and (2) they are particularly
   sympathetic and likely to donate when they see sad expressions versus
   happy or neutral expressions. Consistent with emotional contagion,
   participants felt sadder when viewing a sad-faced victim, and their own
   sadness mediated the effect of emotion expression on sympathy. Contagion
   effects are automatic and noninferential, but they are diminished by
   deliberative thought. The authors discuss the implications of using
   subtle emotional expressions on charitable and other marketing appeals.

   product prices, the currently preferred product is called the "benefits
   leader." This article proposes that consumers who switch to a cheaper
   product after learning prices retain a trace of preference for the
   benefits leader. Retention of the benefits leader is evidenced by the
   distortion of new information to favor the benefits leader and by
   greater-than-normative reversion to it. The authors also find that
   reversion does not occur when the initially leading product (that
   consumers switch from) is based on a cost savings. This suggests that
   though consumers retain cognitive elements associated with benefits
   leaders, they do not retain similar elements associated with leaders

AB This study shows that one of the most intriguing findings on political
   participation-that the participation rate is higher in close
   elections-is due to the omission of variables, namely, the marketing
   activities. This relationship between closeness and participation is
   intriguing because (1) it implies that people participate in elections
   because their vote might be decisive, but (2) such an incentive to vote
   is unreasonable. This study presents a theoretical model that suggests
   that closeness does not affect the turnout rate directly but rather
   through the marketing activities of the parties. In other words, in
   equilibrium, close elections attract higher marketing spending, which in
   turn increases turnout. The author uses data on the 1996-2004
   presidential elections in the United States to examine the model and its
   implications. Using structural (and nonstructural) estimation, the
   author finds that the data support the model and its implications.
   Furthermore, the effect of marketing on turnout is dramatic. For
   example, if the marketing activity were canceled in the 2004 elections,
   the number of voters would have decreased by 15 million.

AB Marketers often analyze multinomial choice from a set of branded
   products to learn about demand. Given a set of brands to study, the
   authors analyze three reasons why choices from strict subsets of the
   brands can contain more statistical information about demand than
   choices from all the brands in the study: First, making choices from
   smaller subsets is easier, so it is possible to use more choice tasks
   when the choice data come from a choice-based conjoint survey. Second,
   choices from subsets of brands better identify and more accurately
   estimate the covariance structure of unobserved utility shocks
   associated with brands. Third, subsets automatically balance the brand
   shares when some of the brands are less popular than others. The authors
   demonstrate these three benefits of subsets using a mixture of
   analytical results and numerical simulations and provide implications
   for the design of choice-based conjoint analyses. They find that the
   optimal subset size depends on the model, the number of brands in the
   study, and the designer's resource constraint. In addition to showing
   that subsets can be beneficial, this article provides a simulation
   methodology that helps designers pick the best subset size for their

   investigate the impact of priors for the covariance of parameter
   heterogeneity when the predictor variables are qualitative. Estimates of

   propose an effects prior that treats all effects symmetrically Third,
   the authors consider willingness to pay These ratio estimators magnify
   uncertainty in the price coefficients and can give unreasonable values
   for price-insensitive consumers. The authors show that estimation of
   willingness to pay can be greatly improved by restricting the parameters

AB Endogeneity arises for numerous reasons in models of consumer choice. It
   leads to inconsistency with standard estimation methods that maintain
   independence between the model's error and the included variables. The
   authors describe a control function approach for handling endogeneity in
   choice models. Observed variables and economic theory are used to derive
   controls for the dependence between the endogenous variable and the
   demand error. The theory points to the relationships that contain
   information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pricing
   equation and the advertising equation. The authors' approach is an
   alternative to Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1995) product-market
   controls for unobserved quality. The authors apply both methods to
   examine households' choices among television options, including basic
   and premium cable packages, in which unobserved attributes, such as
   quality of programming, are expected to be correlated with price.
   Without correcting for endogeneity, aggregate demand is estimated to be
   upward-sloping, suggesting that omitted attributes are positively
   correlated with demand. Both the control function method and the
   product-market controls method produce downward-sloping demand estimates
   that are similar.

AB Predicting aggregate consumer spending is vitally important to marketing
   planning, yet traditional economic theory holds that predicting changes
   in aggregate consumer spending is not possible. Previous attempts to
   predict consumer spending growth using standard macroeconomic predictor
   variables have met with little success. The authors show that the lagged
   change in customer satisfaction, which contributes to future demand, has
   a significant impact on spending growth. However, this impact is
   moderated by increases in consumers' debt service ratio, a key budget
   constraint that affects consumers' ability to spend. Using an asymmetric
   growth model, more than 23% of the variation in the one-quarter-ahead
   spending growth is explained, which represents a notable improvement
   over prior specifications.

AB Suppliers in business-to-business settings are increasingly building a
   portfolio of multiple types of ties with individual customers. For
   example, in addition to supplying goods and services, a supplier may
   have a research-and-development alliance and a marketing alliance with a
   customer. This study investigates the effect of multiple types of ties
   with a customer on a supplier's performance with the customer. The
   findings from panel data on supplier-customer relationships suggest that
   an increase in the number of different types of ties with a customer
   results in an increase in supplier sales to the customer and a decrease
   in sales volatility to that customer. The effect of a change in
   relationship multiplexity (i.e., number of different types of ties) on
   the change in sales becomes weaker and its effect on the change in sales
   volatility becomes stronger as the competitive intensity in the
   customer's industry increases. The results also indicate that the effect
   of a change in the number of different types of ties on the change in
   sales volatility becomes stronger when the intangibles intensity in a
   customer's industry increases. The results are robust to alternative
   measures, alternative estimators, heteroskedasticity, and endogeneity,
   among other methodological concerns. These findings have clear
   implications for managing multiple types of ties with a customer and
   indicate that relationship multiplexity is a valuable nonfinancial
   metric.

AB How do vertical product line extensions influence a retailer's price
   image? Conventional wisdom suggests that adding an upscale or downscale
   item to a product line has a directionally consistent impact on price
   image, such that upscale extensions increase price image and downscale
   extensions decrease price image. In contrast, this research argues that
   vertical extensions can have the opposite effect, such that upscale
   extensions can decrease rather than increase price image, and vice versa
   for downscale extensions. The authors further propose that the impact of
   vertical extensions on price image is a function of consumer goals and,
   in particular, whether consumers have the intent of browsing or buying.
   The authors test these predictions in a series of five empirical studies
   that offer converging evidence in support of the proposed theory.

AB The authors propose a new model to capture unobserved consideration from
   discrete choice data. This approach allows for unobserved dependence in
   consideration among brands, easily copes with many brands, and
   accommodates different effects of the marketing mix on consideration and
   choice as well as unobserved consumer heterogeneity in both processes.
   An important goal of this study is to establish the validity of the
   existing practice to infer consideration sets from observed choices in
   panel data. The authors show with experimental data that underlying
   consideration sets can be reliably retrieved from choice data alone and
   that consideration is positively affected by display and shelf space.
   Next, the model is applied to Information Resources Inc. panel data. The
   findings suggest that promotion effects are larger when they are
   included in the consideration stage of the two-stage model than in a
   single-stage model. The authors also find that consideration covaries
   across brands and that this covariation is mainly driven by unobserved
   consumer heterogeneity. Finally, the authors show the implications of
   the model for promotion planning relative to a more standard model of
   choice.

AB For Internet retailers, demand propagation varies not only through time
   but also over space. The authors develop a Bayesian spatiotemporal model
   to study two imitation effects in the evolution of demand at an Internet
   retailer. Building on previous literature, the authors allow imitation
   behavior to be reflected both in geographic proximity and in demographic
   similarity. As these imitation effects can be time varying, the authors
   specify their dynamics using a "polynomial smoother" embedded within the
   Bayesian framework. They apply the model to new buyers at Netgrocer.
   corn and calibrate it on 45 months of data that span all 1459 zip codes
   in Pennsylvania. The authors find that the proximity effect is
   especially strong in the early phases of demand evolution, whereas the
   similarity effect becomes more important with time. Over time, new
   buyers are increasingly likely to emerge from new zip codes beyond the
   "core set" of zip codes that produce the early new buyers, and spatial
   concentration declines. The authors explore the managerial implications
   stemming from these findings through a hypothetical "seeding"
   experiment. They also discuss other implications for Internet retailing
   practice.

AB Conventional wisdom in marketing holds that (1) retailer forward buying
   is a consequence of manufacturer trade promotions and (2) stockpiling
   units helps the retailer but hurts the manufacturer. This article
   provides a deeper understanding of forward buying by analyzing it within
   the context of manufacturer trade promotions, competition, and demand
   uncertainty. The authors find that regardless of whether the
   manufacturer offers a trade promotion, allowing the retailer to forward
   buy and hold inventory for the future can, under certain conditions, be
   beneficial for both parties. Disallowing forward buying by the retailer
   may lead the manufacturer to lower merchandising requirements and change
   the depth of the promotion. In competitive environments, there are
   situations in which retailers engage in forward buying because of
   competitive pressures in a prisoner's-dilemma situation. Finally, when
   the authors consider the case of uncertain demand, they find further
   evidence of strategic forward buying. In particular, the authors find
   cases in which the retailer orders a quantity that is higher than what
   it expects to sell in even the most optimistic demand scenario.

AB The authors analyze primary demand effects of marketing efforts directed
   at the physician (detailing and professional journal advertising) versus
   marketing efforts directed at the patient (direct-to-consumer
   advertising). The analysis covers 86 categories, or approximately 85% of
   the U.S. pharmaceutical market, during the 2001-2005 period. Primary
   demand effects are rather small, in contrast with the estimated sales
   effects for individual brands. By using a new brand-level method to
   estimate primary demand effects with aggregate data, the authors show
   that the small effects are due to intense competitive interactions
   during the observation period but not necessarily to low primary demand
   responsiveness. In contrast with previous studies, the authors also find
   that detailing is more effective in driving primary demand than
   direct-to-consumer advertising. A category sales model cannot provide
   such insights. In addition, a category sales model likely produces
   biased predictions about period-by-period changes in primary demand. The
   suggested brand-level method does not suffer from these limitations.

AB This research uses a dual attitudes perspective to offer new insights
   into flattery and its consequences. The authors show that even when
   flattery by marketing agents is accompanied by an obvious ulterior
   motive that leads targets to discount the proffered compliments, the
   initial favorable reaction (the implicit attitude) continues to coexist
   with the discounted evaluation (the explicit attitude). Furthermore, the
   implicit attitude has more influential consequences than the explicit
   attitude, highlighting the possible subtle impact of flattery even when
   a person has consciously corrected for it. The authors also clarify the
   underlying process by showing how and why the discrepancy between the
   implicit and explicit attitudes induced by flattery may be reduced.
   Collectively, the findings from this investigation provide implications
   for both flattery research and the dual attitudes literature.

AB Educational placements increasingly appear to replace public service
   announcements as a means of communication, but their efficacy seems
   questionable because they contain mixed messages. Two experiments,
   conducted with 2850 adolescents, test versions of a real television
   program with an antismoking educational placement against a control
   program. Typical antismoking programs contain three indirectly competing
   messages: Smokers are attractive and prevalent but also worthy of
   disapproval. Experiment 1 tests several program versions with these
   three messages and reveals that the disapproval message dominates and
   elicits negative smoker thoughts and beliefs, despite the otherwise
   potent smoker attractiveness message. Experiment 2 indicates
   corresponding effects for intent but shows that adding a directly
   competitive smoker approval message nullifies this effect. Furthermore,
   Experiment 2 tests an educational epilogue designed to reinforce the
   disapproval message, but this message instead induces boomerang effects
   among smokers. That is, among smokers, an educational placement is
   counterattitudinal, so when the epilogue discloses the placement and
   evokes persuasion knowledge, smokers generate more positive smoker
   beliefs and intentions. These findings contribute to research regarding
   competing referent messages, disclosures, and persuasion knowledge.

AB In many product categories, consumer tastes are diverse, and firms use

   This article proposes a model of informative advertising that allows for
   diverse consumer tastes and multiple competing firms. Using this
   framework, the authors analyze how diversity in consumers' tastes,
   informative advertising, and improvements in advertising technology may
   influence prices. First, informative advertising can lead to lower
   prices if consumer valuations are high. However, if consumer valuations
   are low, informative advertising can lead to higher prices. Second, when
   consumer valuations are high, price increases with greater diversity in
   tastes, though this result reverses if consumer valuations are low.
   Third, improvements in advertising technology lead to higher levels of
   advertising when consumer valuation is high, but the opposite effect can
   occur when consumer valuation is low. The authors relate these
   theoretical findings to previous empirical literature on advertising.

AB Respondents can vary strongly in the way they use rating scales.
   Specifically, respondents can exhibit a variety of response styles,
   which threatens the validity of the responses. The purpose of this
   article is to investigate how response style and content of the items
   affect rating scale responses. The authors develop a novel model that
   accounts for different types of response styles, content of items, and
   background characteristics of respondents. By imposing a bilinear
   parameter structure on a multinomial logit model, the authors
   graphically distinguish the effects on the response behavior of the
   characteristics of a respondent and the content of an item. The authors
   combine this approach with finite mixture modeling, yielding two
   segmentations of the respondents: one for response style and one for
   item content. They apply this latent-class bilinear multinomial logit
   model to the well-known List of Values in a cross-national context. The
   results show large differences in the opinions and the response styles
   of respondents and reveal previously unknown response styles. Some
   response styles appear to be valid communication styles, whereas other
   response styles often concur with inconsistent opinions of the items and
   seem to be response bias.

AB Are persistent marketing effects most likely to appear right after the
   introduction of a product? The authors give an affirmative answer to
   this question by developing a model that explicitly reports how
   persistent and transient marketing effects evolve over time. The
   proposed model provides managers with a valuable tool to evaluate their
   allocation of marketing expenditures over time. An application of the
   model to many pharmaceutical products, estimated through (exact initial)
   Kalman filtering, indicates that both persistent and transient effects
   occur predominantly immediately after a brand's introduction.
   Subsequently, the size of the effects declines. The authors
   theoretically and empirically compare their methodology with methodology
   based on unit root testing and demonstrate that the need for unit root
   tests creates difficulties in applying conventional persistence
   modeling. The authors recommend that marketing models should either
   accommodate persistent effects that change over time or be applied to
   mature brands or limited time windows only.

AB Social commerce is an emerging trend in which sellers are connected in

   This article examines the economic value implications of a social
   network between sellers in a large online social commerce marketplace.
   In this marketplace, each seller creates his or her own shop, and
   network ties between sellers are directed hyperlinks between their
   shops. Three questions are addressed: (1) Does allowing sellers to
   connect to each other create value (i.e., increase sales)? (2) What are
   the mechanisms through which this value is created? and (3) How is this
   value distributed across sellers in the network and how does the
   position of a seller in the network (e.g., its centrality) influence how
   much he or she benefits or suffers from the network? The authors find
   that (1) allowing sellers to connect generates considerable economic
   value, (2) the network's value lies primarily in making shops more
   accessible to customers browsing the marketplace (the network creates a
   "virtual shopping mall"), and (3) the sellers who benefit the most from
   the network are not necessarily those who are central to the network but
   rather those whose accessibility is most enhanced by the network.

AB When a multichannel retailer opens its first retail store in a state,
   the firm is obligated to collect sales taxes on all Internet and catalog
   orders shipped to that state. This article assesses how opening a store
   affects Internet and catalog demand. The authors analyze purchase
   behavior among customers who live far from the retail store but must now
   pay sales taxes on catalog and Internet purchases. A comparable group of
   customers in a neighboring state serves as a control. The results show
   that Internet sales decrease significantly, but catalog sales are
   unaffected. Further investigation indicates that the difference in these
   outcomes is partly attributable to the ease with which customers can
   search for lower prices at competing retailers. The authors extend the
   analysis to a panel of multichannel firms and show that retailers that
   earn a large proportion of their revenue from direct channels avoid
   opening a first store in high-tax states. They conclude that current
   U.S. sales taxes laws have significant effects on both customer and firm

   theorists") or that it cannot increase over time ("fixed theorists") are
   less likely to engage in such behaviors. Field experiments conducted
   with parents demonstrate that limited-malleable theorists take their
   children less frequently to fast-food restaurants, give their children
   unhealthful snacks less often, and prefer educational to entertaining
   television programs for them. Similar patterns are observed when
   nonparent adults make gift choices for children or while babysitting.
   The authors obtain these effects with lay theories both measured and
   manipulated and after they control for demographic and psychological
   characteristics, including own self-control. These results contribute to
   the literature on self-control, parenting, and consumer socialization.

AB This research examines how death-related media contexts affect
   consumers' preferences for domestic and foreign brands. Four lab and
   field studies demonstrate that death-related media contexts affect
   subsequent brand evaluations in distinct ways, which have not yet been
   documented in the extant literature on media context. First,
   death-related media contexts shift consumers' preferences in favor of
   domestic brands by enhancing consumers' patriotism. Second, the
   death-related media context effect appears only with a temporal delay
   between the media context and the brand evaluation. Even after a 24-hour
   delay, the effect still takes place as long as consumers have not been
   given an opportunity to attenuate death-induced anxiety. Finally, the
   authors show that foreign brands can counter the negative effects of a
   death-related media context by making a prodomestic advertising claim.

AB Five studies examine how the two distinct emotional states of shame and
   guilt influence the effectiveness of messages that highlight socially
   undesirable consequences of alcohol consumption. Appeals that frame
   others as observing versus suffering the negative consequences of binge
   drinking differentially activate shame and guilt. Given these emotional
   consequences of message framing, the authors examine the interaction
   between incidental shame or guilt and message framing on drinking
   intentions and behavior. Compatible appeals (i.e., appeals that elicit
   the same emotion as being incidentally experienced by the consumer) are
   less effective in influencing behavioral intentions and beverage
   consumption because of a process in which consumers discount the notion
   that they may cause the negative consequences outlined in the message.
   Such defensive processing of compatible messages is driven by a desire
   to reduce the existing negative emotion.

AB Consumers desire products that provide meaningful experiences.
   Therefore, a marketer's success often depends on familiarizing consumers
   with the unique experience a product offers. Marketers recognize the
   value in communicating about a product experience through analogy, but
   little research has investigated if and why these analogies are
   persuasive. By comparing a product to a familiar but disparate
   experience, an analogy has the power to focus consumers on the
   evaluative, emotional, and multisensory information associated with the
   product experience. This focus on subjective product experience enables
   the identification of base preference (i.e., a consumer's liking for the
   comparison experience) as an important moderator of analogical
   persuasiveness. In addition, the emotional knowledge transfer
   perspective applied in this research contributes to a better
   understanding of the role of emotional knowledge and experienced emotion
   in analogical thinking.

   Consumers with extensive prior knowledge of a category evaluate the

   presentation involves a high level of construal rather than a low level

AB Recent research challenges the idea that greater choice is always
   desirable, showing that larger assortments can increase choice deferral
   and switching. The current research demonstrates that even when
   consumers make a purchase, the same item may generate lower satisfaction
   when chosen from a larger rather than a smaller assortment. The authors
   explain this effect in terms of an expectation-disconfirmation
   mechanism. When assortments are small, consumers have low expectations
   about their ability to match their preferences. As assortment sizes
   increase, so do consumers' expectations of the degree of preference
   match they can achieve. Subsequently, consumers may experience greater
   negative expectation disconfirmation or less positive expectation
   disconfirmation when a chosen item comes from a larger rather than a
   smaller set. Either less positive or more negative disconfirmation leads
   to lower choice satisfaction. The results from three studies support
   this expectation-based process and establish this mechanism in addition
   to alternative explanations, such as choice overload.

   in greater satisfaction with the choice by examining the impact of

   along unique dimensions are nonalignable. The results of three studies
   demonstrate greater search among nonalignable than among alignable
   options. Satisfaction initially increases but then declines with further
   search among nonalignable options. Although choice difficulty influences
   search and satisfaction, the primary mechanism driving the inverted

AB The majority of brand extensions reportedly fail, suggesting the need
   for methodologies that allow for better strategic prediction of
   categories into which a brand should extend or license. Prior literature
   suggests that brand extensions are likely to be more successful if a
   brand extends into another category into which its existing brand
   associations and imagery "fit" better and if the extending brand is
   "atypical" (if it possesses associations and imagery that are broad and
   abstract rather than tied too closely to the brand's original product
   category). The authors develop a methodology in this study to estimate
   brand and category personality structures, using a Bayesian factor model
   that separates the two by means of brand-level and category-level random
   effects. This methodology leads to measures of a brand's fit and
   atypicality. The authors illustrate and validate the model on two
   nationally representative data sets on brand personalities in three
   categories (jeans, magazines, and cars) and investigate the brand
   extension and licensing implications of the results obtained with the
   model.

AB Attitudes differ in terms of the functions they serve: Whereas attitudes
   toward some products may serve a utilitarian purpose of helping
   consumers maximize rewards, attitudes toward other products may
   symbolize or express consumers' values. This article shows that branding
   alters the associations between products and attitude functions.
   Specifically, product categories that are generally associated with
   utilitarian attitudes are associated with less utilitarian, more
   symbolic attitudes when branded, whereas product categories that are
   generally associated with symbolic attitudes are associated with more
   utilitarian, less symbolic attitudes when branded. Branding also has
   important implications for persuasion and for the "function-matching"
   advantage: Although utilitarian appeals are most persuasive for
   "utilitarian" products (and symbolic appeals are most persuasive for
   "symbolic" products) at the category level, this article shows that this
   pattern does not emerge at the brand level, in part because attitude
   functions change with branding.

AB The authors review the implicit association test (IAT), its use in
   marketing, and the methodology and validity issues that surround it.
   They focus on a validity problem that has not been investigated
   previously, namely, the impact of cognitive inertia on IAT effects.
   Cognitive inertia refers to the difficulty in switching from one
   categorization rule to another, which causes IAT effects to depend on
   the order of administration of the two IAT blocks. In Study 1, the
   authors observe an IAT effect when the compatible block precedes the
   incompatible block but not when it follows the incompatible block. In
   Studies 2 and 3, the IAT effect changes its sign when the order of the
   blocks reverses. Cognitive inertia distorts individual IAT scores and
   diminishes the correlations between IAT scores and predictor variables
   when the block order is counterbalanced between subjects. Study 4 shows
   that counterbalancing the block order repeatedly within subjects can
   eliminate cognitive inertia effects on the individual level. The authors
   conclude that researchers should either interpret IAT scores at the
   aggregate level or, if individual IAT scores are of interest,
   counterbalance the block order repeatedly within subjects.

AB Advertising recognition tests use advertisements as visual retrieval
   cues; they require consumers to report which advertisements they
   remember having seen earlier and whether they noticed the advertised
   brand and read most of the text at the time. Using a heterogeneous
   randomly stopped sum model, the authors establish the relationship
   between consumers' actual attention to print advertisements, as measured
   through eye tracking, and subsequent ad recognition measures. They find
   that ad recognition measures are systematically biased because consumers
   infer prior attention from the ad layout and their familiarity with the
   brands in the advertisements. Such biases undermine the validity of
   recognition tests for advertising practice and theory development. The
   authors quantify the positive and negative diagnostic value of ad
   recognition for prior attention and demonstrate how these diagnostic
   values can be used to develop bias-adjusted recognition (BAR) scores
   that more accurately reflect prior attention. Finally, the authors show
   that differences in the scores from ad recognition tests based on

AB The authors introduce the concept of consumer options and empirically
   validate it in the context of event ticket pricing. They demonstrate
   that consumer options can protect consumers from the downside related to
   uncertain outcomes and enhance seller profits by enabling superior
   market segmentation and increasing consumer willingness to pay. The
   authors examine the newly proposed ticket pricing mechanism in sports
   markets, in which there is uncertainty about the teams that will play in
   a final event (e.g., the National Collegiate Athletic Association Final
   Four basketball tournament). Fans who want to attend the game after
   knowing which teams will play are often disappointed because tickets
   typically sell out in advance. The authors propose that a fan can buy an
   option on a ticket before this uncertainty is resolved. Later, he or she
   can decide whether to exercise the option. The authors present a simple
   analytical model of consumer options in this setting. Then, they
   empirically demonstrate that profits under option pricing can exceed
   those from (1) advance selling and (2) pricing after uncertainty is
   resolved. The analysis and findings of this article lay a foundation for

AB Firms frequently compete across multiple segments. Such multimarket
   contact has been shown to deter aggressive competition, leading to
   "mutual forbearance." Empirical support for this phenomenon derives
   mainly from studies on the direct effects of multimarket contact on a
   firm's decision variables. The analysis in this article extends the
   existing literature by empirically considering both the direct effects
   of multimarket contact (i.e., how it affects a firm's decision
   variables) and its strategic effects (i.e., how it affects a firm's
   reactions to its competitors' decision variables). The authors study the
   pricing and new product introduction decisions of firms in the personal
   computer industry. Consistent with prior research, the authors find that
   firms mutually forbear in price and new product introductions. More
   important, the authors find strong strategic effects that are
   asymmetric; namely, firms respond to competitive attacks by introducing
   new products but do not use price as a retaliatory weapon. Thus, firms
   isolate any competitive retaliation to only a single marketing variable.
   The results offer a deeper understanding of the influence of multimarket

AB Nintendo lost its dominant position in the video game industry during
   the console war between its Nintendo 64 and Sony's Play Station.
   However, Nintendo could have made several different strategic decisions
   to change the outcome. This article develops a structural model and
   investigates these alternative strategies through policy simulations. In
   particular, the author provides a framework to study firms' optimal
   pricing strategies under network effects, consumer heterogeneity, and
   oligopolistic competition. Consumer heterogeneity provides an incentive
   for a durable goods manufacturer to price skim, while network effects
   lead to an opposite motive for penetration pricing. The proposed
   framework incorporates these two competing motives under oligopolistic
   competition. The author estimates a demand system that allows for
   indirect network effects and consumer heterogeneity and then numerically
   solves for the Markov perfect equilibrium in firms' dynamic pricing
   game. Policy simulations indicate that Nintendo could have won the
   console war either with 10% more games or with a "head start" of one
   million units in installed base at the time of the Play Station
   introduction.

AB Before a new product launch, marketers need to infer how demand will
   respond to various levels of marketing-mix variables to set an
   appropriate marketing plan. A critical challenge in estimating
   marketing-mix responsiveness from historical data is that the observed
   decisions were affected by private information possessed by managers
   about the heterogeneous effects of marketing-mix variables on sales. The
   authors refer to this as the "slope endogeneity" problem. Such
   endogeneity differs from the "intercept endogeneity" problem, which has
   been widely acknowledged in the literature. To correct for the slope
   endogeneity bias, the authors develop a conceptually simple control
   function approach that is amenable to multiple endogenous variables and
   marketing-mix carryover effects. The method is applied to forecasting
   advertising responsiveness in the U.S. DVD market. The results suggest
   that advertising responsiveness varies substantially across DVD titles
   and that estimated marketing-mix elasticities would be biased if the
   slope endogeneity problem were ignored. This analysis also yields
   findings of substantive interest to researchers and managers involved in
   entertainment marketing.

   regarding team-level leadership empowerment behaviors (LEBs) and team

   difficult with other previously developed modeling approaches. The
   authors apply the proposed model to a context of family members'
   television viewing and simultaneously model whether the television is
   on, which type of program is playing, and which family members are
   watching. The proposed model makes it possible to estimate the
   individual's intrinsic preference and the extrinsic preference from a
   joint consumption with other members. In turn, these estimates enable
   the authors to test several alternative group decision-making heuristics
   that may operate in those joint consumption occasions and to conduct
   managerially useful counterfactual simulations.

   that predict which products consumers select for their consideration
   sets. Drawing on qualitative research, the authors propose
   disjunctions-of-conjunctions (DOC) decision rules that generalize
   well-studied decision models, such as disjunctive, conjunctive,
   lexicographic, and subset conjunctive rules. They propose two
   machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They
   observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for
   both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods
   with both machine-learning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on
   five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation
   data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the
   ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit
   rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which
   consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles. The
   article closes with an illustration of how DOC-based rules can affect
   managerial decisions.

AB This research investigates how the valuation of delayed consumption of
   hedonic products, such as concerts and chocolate, varies with the
   passage of time between choice and consumption. The authors find that
   when consumers make their own choices, they exhibit increases in
   evaluations of delayed consumption, but only if the interval between
   choice and consumption is relatively short. The effect attenuates over
   longer periods, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between
   evaluations and time. In contrast, when somebody else chooses the same
   option for the consumer, evaluations decrease with the passage of time.
   These effects depend on the extent of intrinsic motivation toward the
   object of consumption and occur only for consummatory consumption that
   is of inherent interest. Moreover, anticipatory increases in evaluations
   before consumption have ironic negative effects on postconsumption
   evaluations. The authors discuss implications and directions for further
   research.

AB The results of five experiments reveal that when sampling a series of
   experiential products (e.g., beverages, music), consumers prefer the
   product sampled second in a series of two desirable products but
   relatively prefer the product sampled first in a series of two
   undesirable products. The underlying process for both outcomes is a
   recency effect, such that there is better recall for the most recently
   sampled experiential product. The recency effect observed for
   experiential products reverses to a primacy effect when sampling
   nonexperiential products (e.g., scissors). The authors also demonstrate
   that the placement of an undesirable experiential product in conjunction
   with two desirable experiential products can exaggerate preference for
   the later-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is
   sampled first) or result in preference for the earlier-sampled desirable
   product (when the undesirable product is sampled between the two
   desirable products). However, the preference for the earlier-sampled
   desirable product holds only if there is no time delay between the
   sampling of the products or between the sampling and the choice

AB This research explores how regulatory depletion affects consumers'
   responses to advertising. Initial forays into this area suggest that the
   depletion of self-regulatory resources is irrelevant when advertisement
   arguments are strong or consumers are highly motivated to process. In
   contrast to these conclusions, the authors contend that depletion has
   important but previously hidden effects in such contexts. That is,
   although attitudes are equivalent in valence and extremity, consumers
   are more certain of their attitudes when they form them under conditions
   of depletion than nondepletion. The authors propose that this effect
   occurs because feeling depleted induces the perception of having engaged
   in thorough information processing. As a consequence of greater attitude
   certainty, depleted consumers' attitudes exert greater influence on
   their purchase behavior. Three experiments, using different products and
   ad exposure times, confirm these hypotheses. Experiment 3 demonstrates
   the potential to vary consumers' naive beliefs about the relationship
   between depletion and thoroughness of processing, and this variation
   moderates the effect of depletion on attitude certainty. The authors
   discuss the theoretical contributions and implications for marketing.

   brand. Across two experimental studies and one field study, the authors
   examine how sales promotions may affect the size and composition of the
   overall shopping basket. The authors show that the framing of the
   savings message on sales promotions (e.g., "Save $x" versus "Get $x
   Off"), the expiration date restriction cue (immediate versus future
   expiration), and the familiarity of brands (well-known versus less
   familiar) are independent primes of regulatory focus. Furthermore, such
   cues, when compatible with one another or with a prior regulatory focus,
   lead to more unrelated purchases in the store. The authors discuss the
   findings in the context of theory on regulatory relevance and mind-sets,
   and they posit managerial implications for the design of sales
   promotions and store positioning.

   and thus harm high-uniqueness consumers (pilot study). As a result,
   high- (versus low-) uniqueness consumers are less willing to generate
   positive WOM for publicly consumed products that they own. However, high
   uniqueness does not decrease willingness to generate WOM for privately
   consumed products (Study 1). Study 2 demonstrates that for publicly
   consumed products, WOM that includes positive recommendations is more
   persuasive than WOM that only contains product details. Consequently,
   the effect of uniqueness is more pronounced for WOM recommendations than
   for WOM that only provides details (Study 3). Study 4 confirms that
   high- (versus low-) uniqueness consumers are less willing to recommend a
   public product to others but are equally willing to discuss product

   and the impact of these reactions on the retailers' sales. They compile
   a unique data set that consists of incumbent supermarkets, drugstores,
   and mass merchandisers in the vicinity of seven Wal-Mart entries, as
   well as control stores not exposed to the entries. The data set includes
   weekly store movement data for 46 product categories before and after
   each entry and allows the authors to measure reactions and sales
   outcomes using a before-and-after-with-control-group analysis. They find
   that, overall, incumbents suffer significant sales losses as a result of
   a Wal-Mart entry, but there is substantial variation across retail
   formats, stores, and categories both in incumbent reactions and in their
   sales outcomes. Moreover, they find that a retailer's sales outcomes are
   significantly affected by its reactions, and the relationship between
   reactions and sales outcomes varies across retail formats. These
   findings provide valuable insights into how retailers in different
   formats can adjust their marketing mix to mitigate the impact of a

   empirically the stock market's inability to properly value marketing and
   innovation activity in the face of the potential for myopic management.
   The author assesses the total financial consequences of myopic
   management (the practice of cutting marketing and
   research-and-development spending to inflate earnings) and finds that
   myopia has a long-term net negative impact on firm value. Myopic
   management is contrasted with accounting accruals-based earnings
   inflation, and the author shows that the real activities (i.e., myopic
   management), and not the accounting numbers manipulation, have the
   greater negative impact on future financial performance. These results
   are consistent across alternative abnormal return measures and
   alternative benchmarks. The author argues that shareholders, managers,
   and marketing researchers can play a role in limiting myopic management
   practices.

AB It is widely recognized that business growth and shareholder value are
   engineered on the basis of investments aimed at acquiring and retaining
   customers. Along with this premise, however, the literature reveals a
   growing recognition that the manner in which important customer-based
   outcomes are constructed in the short term has vital implications for
   long-term firm performance. Adopting the view that customer satisfaction
   is a stochastic marketplace asset, the authors advance a mean-variance
   perspective that enables them to test two conjectures: (1) Objective
   service quality and advertising affect not only the level of customer
   satisfaction but also the heterogeneity in customer satisfaction, and
   (2) shareholder value is shaped by the interplay of satisfaction level
   and heterogeneity, through their impact on retention sales, acquisition
   sales, and servicing costs. The authors test these conjectures using
   secondary data from diverse sources that describe the dynamics in the
   U.S. airlines industry during a nine-year period (1997-2005). The
   results, derived from estimating structural models that account for the
   impact of several meaningful control variables, provide strong support
   for both conjectures. Importantly, the findings indicate that the return
   on satisfaction to shareholder value decreases by almost 70% in going
   from low to high satisfaction heterogeneity; at the same time,
   increasing levels of satisfaction heterogeneity serves to reduce the
   volatility in shareholder value.

AB Managers use numerical data as the basis for many decisions. This
   research investigates how data on prior advertising expenditures and
   sales outcomes are used in budget allocation decisions and attempts to
   answer three important questions about data-based inferences. First, do
   biases exist that are strong enough to lead to seriously suboptimal
   decisions? Second, do graphical data displays, real-world experience, or
   explicit training reduce any observed biases? Third, are the observed
   biases well explained by a relatively small set of natural heuristics
   that managers use when making data-based allocation decisions? The
   results suggest answers of yes, no, and yes, respectively. The authors
   identify three broad classes of heuristics: difference-based (which
   assess causation by comparing adjacent changes in expenditures to
   changes in sales), trend-based (which assess causation by comparing
   overall trends in expenditures and sales), and exemplar-based (which
   emulate the allocation pattern of the observations with the highest
   sales). All three heuristics create biases in some situations. Overall,
   exemplar-based heuristics were used most frequently and induced the
   greatest biasing of the three (sometimes allocating the most to an
   advertising medium that was uncorrelated with sales). Difference-based
   heuristics were used less frequently but generated the most extreme
   allocations. Trend-based heuristics were used the least.

AB The success of Internet social networking sites depends on the number
   and activity levels of their user members. Although users typically have
   numerous connections to other site members (i.e., "friends"), only a
   fraction of those so-called friends may actually influence a member's
   site usage. Because the influence of potentially hundreds of friends
   needs to be evaluated for each user, inferring precisely who is
   influential-and, therefore, of managerial interest for advertising
   targeting and retention efforts-is difficult. The authors develop an
   approach to determine which users have significant effects on the
   activities of others using the longitudinal records of members' log-in
   activity. They propose a nonstandard form of Bayesian shrinkage
   implemented in a Poisson regression. Instead of shrinking across
   panelists, strength is pooled across variables within the model for each
   user. The approach identifies the specific users who most influence
   others' activity and does so considerably better than simpler
   alternatives. For the social networking site data, the authors find
   that, on average, approximately one-fifth of a user's friends actually
   influence his or her activity level on the site.

AB The authors find that exposure to different types of categories or
   assortments in a task creates a mind-set that changes how consumers
   process information in subsequent tasks. That is, these mind-sets have a
   spillover effect that alters consumers' decision making in a variety of
   subsequent and unrelated tasks, from basic cognitive behaviors (e.g.,
   grouping) and consumer decisions (e.g., new product adoptions) to more
   general decision-making strategies (e.g., susceptibility to heuristics).
   Consumers previously exposed to broad assortments or categorizations
   base their decisions on fewer pieces of information, typically those
   made salient by the environment. In contrast, consumers previously
   exposed to narrow assortments or categorizations employ multiple pieces
   of information, both salient and nonsalient, without exerting any extra
   effort. Consequently, prior exposure to broad versus narrow

AB Demonstrations of marketing effectiveness currently proceed along two
   parallel tracks: Quantitative researchers model the direct sales effects
   of the marketing mix, and advertising and branding experts trace
   customer mind-set metrics (e.g., awareness, affect). The authors merge
   the two tracks and analyze the added explanatory value of including
   customer mind-set metrics in a sales response model that already
   accounts for short- and long-term effects of advertising, price,
   distribution, and promotion. Vector autoregressive modeling of the
   metrics for more than 60 brands of four consumer goods shows that
   advertising awareness, brand consideration, and brand liking account for
   almost one-third of explained sales variance. Competitive and own
   mind-set metrics make a similar contribution. Wear-in times reveal that
   mind-set metrics can be used as advance warning signals that allow
   enough time for managerial action before market performance itself is
   affected. Specific marketing actions affect specific mind-set metrics,
   with the strongest overall impact for distribution. The findings suggest
   that modelers should include mind-set metrics in sales response models

AB Conjoint analysis has become a widely accepted tool for preference
   measurement in marketing research, though its applicability and
   performance strongly depend on the complexity of the product or service.
   Therefore, self-explicated approaches are still frequently used because
   of their simple design, which facilitates preference elicitation when
   large numbers of attributes need to be considered. However, the direct
   measurement of preferences, or rather utilities, has been criticized as
   being imprecise in many cases. Against this background, the authors
   present a compositional consumer preference measurement approach based
   on paired comparisons, otherwise known as PC PM. The trade-off character
   of paired comparisons ensures that the stated judgments are more
   intuitive than traditional self-explicated preference statements. In
   contrast to the latter, PCPM accounts for response errors and thus
   allows for the elicitation of more precise preferences. The authors
   benchmark PCPM against adaptive conjoint analysis and computer-assisted
   self-explication of multiattributed preferences to demonstrate its
   relative validity and predictive accuracy in two empirical studies using
   complex, high-involvement products. They find that PCPM yields better
   results than the benchmark approaches with respect to interview length,

   approaches in terms of parameter recovery under different experimental
   conditions of sample size, data distribution, and model specification.
   In this study, model specification is the only meaningful condition in
   differentiating the performance of the three approaches in parameter
   recovery. Specifically, when the model is correctly specified,
   covariance structure analysis tends to recover parameters better than
   the other two approaches. Conversely, when the model is misspecified,
   generalized structured component analysis tends to recover parameters
   better. Finally, partial least squares exhibits inferior performance in
   parameter recovery compared with the other approaches. In particular,
   this tendency is salient when the model involves cross-loadings. Thus,
   generalized structured component analysis may be a good alternative to
   partial least squares for structural equation modeling and is
   recommended over covariance structure analysis unless correct model
   specification is ensured.

AB This article examines a silver lining of standing in line: Consumers
   infer that products are more valuable when others are behind them.
   Specifically, the value of a product increases as more people line up
   behind a person (Study 1) and when others are present (versus absent)
   behind a person in line (Study 2). Value increases further when
   directing consumers' attention to the presence of others behind
   them-that is, when they look backward versus forward (Study 3) and when
   the queue structure emphasizes the last person to join rather than the
   person being served (Study 4). This effect of people in line behind them
   is associated with increased expenditures by queuing consumers (Study
   5).

AB Consumers often resolve trade-offs in a particular order. For example,
   when making flavor and size decisions, consumers might first decide
   which flavors to choose and then decide which sizes of those flavors to
   choose. This research examines the effect of decision order on purchase
   quantity decisions. The authors build on prior work on decision
   difficulty and conflict to show that consumers choose more overall, and
   more variety, when they consider a less replaceable attribute in an
   earlier, rather than a later, stage in the purchase decision. For
   example, consumers choose a greater quantity when flavor (or brand)
   decisions precede, rather than follow, size decisions. The authors find
   that the degree of attribute replaceability also moderates the effect of
   decision order on quantity chosen. Furthermore, marketers can influence
   the amount chosen by altering the organization of the shelf display.
   Finally, the authors find that when consumers explicitly consider the
   possibility of deferring their decisions, the effect of decision order
   declines.

AB How do consumers evaluate combinations of items representing conflicting
   goals? In this research, the authors examine how consumers form value
   judgments of combinations of options representing health and indulgence
   goals, focusing on how people estimate the calorie content of such
   options. The authors show that when evaluating combinations of healthy
   (virtue) and indulgent (vice) options, consumers tend to systematically
   underestimate the combined calorie content, such that they end up
   averaging rather than adding the calories contained in the vice and the
   virtue. The authors attribute this bias to the qualitative nature of
   people's information processing, which stems from their tendency to
   categorize food items according to a good/bad dichotomy into virtues and
   vices. The authors document this averaging bias in a series of four
   empirical studies that investigate the underlying mechanism and identify

AB In a store-within-a-store arrangement, retailers essentially rent out
   retail space to manufacturers and give them complete autonomy over
   retail decisions, such as pricing and in-store service. This intriguing
   retailing format appears in an increasing number of large department
   stores worldwide. The authors use a theoretical model to investigate the
   economic incentives a retailer faces when deciding on this arrangement.
   The retailer's trade-off is between channel efficiency and interbrand
   competition, moderated by returns to in-store service and increased
   store traffic. The retailer cannot credibly commit to the retail prices
   and service levels that the manufacturers effect in an integrated
   channel, so it decides instead to allow them to set up stores within its
   store. Thus, the stores-within-a-store phenomenon emerges when a
   powerful retailer, ironically, gives manufacturers autonomy in its
   retail space. An extension of the model to the case of competing
   retailers shows that the store-within-a-store arrangement can moderate
   interstore competition.

AB Given the importance of new products, firms may be prone to overmanage
   sales personnel by using behavior-based control systems that dictate the
   performance of particular activities related to the introduction. Such
   controls may be especially tempting given the findings that favorable
   salesperson product perceptions actually yield less effort on the new
   product, and behavior-based controls can offset this tendency. However,
   using longitudinal data from a sample of 226 salespeople, along with
   external ratings from customers and archival measures of effort and
   sales performance, the authors demonstrate that such a strategy is
   shortsighted. Behavior-based controls constrain a salesperson's ability
   to appropriately allocate effort across his or her customer base,
   negatively affecting customer product perceptions and, ultimately, new
   product sales. In contrast, outcome-based control systems enable
   salespeople to work smarter, and their corresponding effort on behalf of
   the new product has a more positive effect on customer product
   perceptions and new product sales.

AB When managers are designing a contest to motivate effort by salespeople,
   service employees, franchisees, or product development teams, a key
   question is, What should the optimal proportion of winners and losers
   be? Prevailing marketing theory predicts that the proportion of winners
   in a contest should always be lower than the proportion of losers. Not
   only has this theory not been empirically tested, but it is also based
   on the assumption that contestants care solely about the value of the
   prizes they receive. This self-interested assumption has been
   increasingly challenged in marketing and economics. This article uses a
   behavioral economics model to formalize the idea that if contestants
   also care about their contest outcomes relative to other contestants,
   changing the proportion of winners in a contest can alter the reference
   points contestants use to make these social comparisons. Consequently, a
   contest with a higher proportion of winners than losers can yield
   greater effort than one with fewer winners than losers if the degree of
   social loss aversion in the contestants is sufficiently strong. Two
   incentive-aligned experiments show that this prediction can be valid in
   situations with public announcements of contest outcomes.

AB Three-tiered private-label (PL) portfolio strategies (low-quality tier:
   economy PLs, mid-quality tier: standard PLs, and top-quality tier:
   premium PLs) are gaining interest around the world. Drawing on the
   context-effects literature, the authors postulate how the introduction
   of economy and premium PLs may affect the choice of mainstream-quality
   and premium-quality national brands (NBs) and the choice of the
   retailer's existing PL offering. The authors use the natural experiment
   offered by Asda's and Sainsbury's introduction of economy and premium PL
   tiers in the corn flakes and canned soup categories in the United
   Kingdom to test their framework. Using brand choice models that
   accommodate context (compromise, similarity, and attraction) effects,
   the authors find that both economy and premium PLs cannibalize incumbent
   PLs. Economy PL introductions benefit mainstream-quality NBs because
   these NBs become a compromise or middle option in terms of quality in
   the retailer's assortment. The effects of premium PL introductions on
   premium-quality NBs are mixed: Their share improves in two of four cases
   but decreases in the other two cases.

AB Despite multiple calls for the integration of time into behavioral
   intent measurement, surprisingly little academic research has examined
   timed intent measures directly. In two empirical studies, the authors
   estimate individual-level cumulative adoption likelihood curves curves
   calibrated on self-reported adoption likelihoods for cumulative time
   intervals across a fixed horizon of 478 managerial decision makers,
   self-predicting whether and when they will adopt a relevant technology.
   A hierarchical Bayes formulation allows for a heterogeneous account of
   the individual-level adoption likelihood curves as a function of time
   and common antecedents of technology adoption. A third study generalizes
   these results among 354 consumer decision makers and, using behavioral
   data collected during a two-year longitudinal study involving a
   subsample of 143 consumer decision makers, provides empirical evidence
   for the accuracy of cumulative adoption likelihood curves for predicting
   whether and when a technology is adopted. Cumulative adoption likelihood
   curves outperform two single-intent measures as well as two widely
   validated intent models in predicting individual-level adoption for a
   fixed period of two years. The results hold great promise for further
   research on using and optimizing cumulative timed intent measures across
   a variety of application domains.

AB This article focuses on the measurement of the overall importance of
   brands for consumer decision making-that is, brand relevance in
   category, or BRiC-across multiple categories and countries. Although
   brand equity measures for specific brands have attracted a large body of
   literature, the questions of how important brands are within an entire
   product category and the extent to which BRIG differs across categories
   and countries have been neglected. The authors introduce the concept of
   BRIG (a category-level measure, not a brand-level measure). They develop
   a conceptual framework to measure BRiC and the drivers of BRIG, test the
   framework empirically with a sample of more than 5700 consumers, and
   show how the construct varies across 20 product categories and five
   countries (France, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United
   States). The results suggest a high validity of the proposed BRiC
   measure and show substantial differences between categories and
   countries. A replication study two-and-a-half years later confirms the
   psychometric properties of the suggested scale and shows remarkable
   stability of the findings. The findings have important implications for
   the management of brand investments.

   in an objective, ratio-scaled measure of sales output (e.g., dollar or
   unit purchases) to the corresponding percentage change in an objective,
   ratio-scaled measure of personal selling input (e.g., dollar
   expenditures). The authors conduct a meta-analysis of 506 personal
   selling elasticity estimates drawn from analyses of 88 empirical data
   sets across 75 previous articles. They find a mean estimate of
   current-period personal selling elasticity of .34. They also find that
   elasticity estimates are higher for early life-cycle-stage offerings,
   higher from studies set in Europe than from those set in the United
   States, and smaller in more recent years. In addition, elasticity
   estimates are affected significantly by analysts' use of relative rather
   than absolute sales output measures, by cross-sectional rather than
   panel data, by omission of promotions, by lagged effects, by marketing
   interaction effects, and by the neglect of endogeneity in model
   estimation. The method bias-corrected mean personal selling elasticity
   is approximately .31. The authors discuss the implications of their
   results for sales managers and researchers.

   techniques, little work has focused on trait-based approaches that
   specify which consumers are the "right" ones to use in the new product

   authors propose that the right consumers to use possess what they call
   an "emergent nature," defined as the unique capability to imagine or

   in the mainstream marketplace. The authors draw on research on
   personality theory and information-processing styles to support their
   conceptualization and develop and validate a highly reliable scale to
   measure emergent nature (Study 1). In subsequent multipart studies, they
   show in both group (Studies 2a-2c) and individual (Studies 3a and 3b)
   settings across two distinct product categories that consumers high in
   emergent nature are able to develop product concepts that mainstream
   consumers find significantly more appealing and useful than concepts

AB Few studies have considered the relative role of the integrated
   marketing mix (advertising, price promotion, product, and place) on the
   long-term performance of mature brands, instead emphasizing advertising
   and price promotion. Thus, little guidance is available to firms
   regarding the relative efficacy of their various marketing expenditures
   over the long run. To investigate this issue, the authors apply a
   multivariate dynamic linear transfer function model to five years of
   advertising and scanner data for 25 product categories and 70 brands in
   France. The findings indicate that the total (short-term plus long-term)
   sales elasticity is 1.37 for product and .74 for distribution.
   Conversely, the total elasticities for advertising and discounting are
   only .13 and .04, respectively. This result stands in marked contrast to
   the previous emphasis in the literature on price promotions and
   advertising. The authors further find that the long-term effects of
   discounting are one-third the magnitude of the short-term effects. The
   ratio is reversed from other aspects of the mix (in which long-term
   effects exceed four times the short-term effects), underscoring the
   strategic role of these tools in brand sales.

AB Analysts fitting a hierarchical Bayesian model must specify the
   distribution of heterogeneity. There are several distributions to choose
   from, including the multivariate normal, mixture of normals, Dirichlet
   processes priors, and so forth. Although significant progress has been
   made, estimating the models and obtaining measures for model selection
   remain ongoing areas of research for more flexible distributions of
   heterogeneity. As a result, the multivariate normal remains the default
   choice for many researchers and software packages. This article proposes
   model-checking statistics that signal the adequacy of the multivariate
   normal assumption for the distribution of heterogeneity; these methods
   do not require the analyst to fit alternative models. The authors use
   posterior predictive model checking to determine whether a discrepancy
   exists between the individual-level parameters and those implied by the
   assumed distribution of heterogeneity. In simulated and real data sets,
   the results show that these statistics are useful for identifying when
   the multivariate normal distribution is adequate, when there is a
   departure in the tails of the distribution, and when a multimodal
   distribution of heterogeneity may be more appropriate.

AB Six studies show that subtle contextual cues that increase customers'
   self-awareness can be used to influence their satisfaction with service
   providers (while holding the objective service delivery constant).
   Self-awareness cues tend to increase customers' satisfaction when the
   outcome of a service interaction is unfavorable, but they tend to
   decrease customers' satisfaction when the outcome of the interaction is
   favorable. This is because higher self-awareness increases customers'
   tendency to attribute outcomes to themselves rather than to the
   provider. Self-awareness can even influence satisfaction with service
   interactions that occurred far in the past. The authors demonstrate
   these effects across a variety of lab and field settings with different
   simulated retail experiences and with different real-life service
   interactions, including college courses, meals taken at a university
   cafeteria, and items purchased at an actual clothing store. The results
   further show that attempts to shape customers' satisfaction by means of
   self-awareness are more likely to be effective when there is substantial

AB The tendency to procrastinate applies not only to aversive tasks but
   also to positive experiences with immediate benefits. The authors
   propose that models of time discounting can explain this behavior, and
   they test these predictions with field data and experiments. A multicity
   study shows that people with unlimited time windows delay visiting
   desirable landmarks; however, procrastination is reduced when the window
   of opportunity is constrained. Similarly, people procrastinate in
   redeeming gift certificates and gift cards with long deadlines more than
   those with short deadlines, resulting in overall lower redemption rates.
   These results run counter to participants' predictions and typical
   models of impulsive behavior.

AB The authors propose that power distance belief (PDB) (i.e., accepting
   and expecting power disparity) influences impulsive buying beyond other
   related cultural dimensions, such as individualism collectivism. This
   research supports an associative account that links PDB and impulsive
   buying as a manifestation of self-control, such that those with high PDB
   display less impulsive buying. Furthermore, this effect manifests for
   vice products but not for virtue products. The authors also find that
   restraint from temptations can occur automatically for people who have
   repeated practice (i.e., chronically high PDBs). Taken together, these
   results imply that products should be differentially positioned as vice
   or virtue products in accordance with consumers' PDBs.

AB This article proposes that merely considering outcomes associated with a
   positive approach emotion (e.g., happiness) can regulate negative
   emotions that evoke an approach orientation (e.g., sadness, anger). In
   contrast, outcomes associated with a positive avoidance emotion (e.g.,
   calmness) best regulate negative emotions that evoke an avoidance
   orientation (e.g., anxiety, embarrassment). Although such
   orientation-matched (versus mismatched) positive outcomes might not
   address the problem that caused the negative emotion, they automatically
   signal a reduced need for affect regulation specific to the evoked
   orientation. Thus, orientation matching results in emotional benefit,
   increases preferences toward matched outcomes, and frees resources for
   subsequent tasks.

AB Researchers have long been interested in understanding cognitive
   processing differences across consumer judgments and choices. Although
   it represents a focal outcome in much research, less attention has
   focused on the "choice-like" response of behavioral intentions. This
   research compares processing differences in the formulation of judgments
   of attractiveness and intentions. On the basis of the premise that
   different goals underlie these responses, the authors hypothesize that
   alternative reference points result from differential reference point
   diagnosticity. The authors test this prediction in the domain of price
   attractiveness and purchase intentions ratings. Study 1 provides
   evidence that endpoints of the range of alternative prices are more
   predictive of ratings of price attractiveness than of purchase
   intentions, while price rank and distribution mean are more predictive
   of purchase intentions ratings than of price attractiveness ratings.
   Study 2 replicates this effect using a different methodology. Finally,
   Study 3 provides a test of the external validity of these findings in a
   multicue setting.

AB The authors analyze a multimillion dollar, three-year field study
   sponsored by five firms to assess whether enabling skipping of
   advertisements using digital video recorders (DVRs) affects consumers'
   shopping behavior for advertised and private label goods. A large sample
   of households received an offer for a free DVR and service, and close to
   20% accepted. Each household's shopping history is observed for 48
   consumer packaged goods categories during the 13 months before and the
   26 months after the DVR offer. The authors fail to reject the null
   hypothesis of no DVR treatment effect on household spending on
   advertised branded or private label goods, either one or two years after
   the DVRs are shipped. The predicted DVR effect is tightly centered
   around 0, suggesting that the data have sufficient power to identify a
   true null effect. Using advertising exposure information for seven of
   the brands in the study, the authors offer suggestive evidences that ad
   skipping occurs for a relatively small fraction of the total television
   content viewed. The authors also discuss other potential explanations
   for the lack of a DVR effect.

AB The growing sales of private labels (PLs) pose significant challenges
   for national brands (NBs) around the world. A major question is whether
   consumers continue to be willing to pay a price premium for NBs over
   PLs. Using consumer survey data from 22,623 respondents from 23
   countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas across, on average, 63
   consumer packaged goods categories per country, this article studies how
   marketing and manufacturing factors affect the price premium a consumer
   is willing to pay for an NB over a PL. These effects are mediated by
   consumer perceptions of the quality of NBs in relation to PLs. Although
   the results do not bode well for NBs in the sense that willingness to
   pay decreases as PLs mature, the authors offer several managerial
   recommendations to counter this trend. In countries in which PLs are
   more mature, the route to success is to go back to manufacturing basics.
   In PL development countries, there is a stronger role for marketing to
   enhance the willingness to pay for NBs.

AB More than 200 studies suggest that metacognitive difficulty reduces the
   liking of an object. In contrast to those findings, the authors
   demonstrate that the effects of metacognitive experiences on evaluation
   are sensitive to the consumption domain. In the domain of everyday
   goods, metacognitive difficulty reduces the attractiveness of a product
   by making it appear unfamiliar. However, in the context of
   special-occasion products, for which consumers valued exclusivity,
   metacognitive difficulty increased the attractiveness of a product by
   making it appear unique or uncommon. The authors reconcile their
   findings with prior research by positing that the effect of
   metacognitive experiences on evaluation depends on the naive theory
   people associate with product consumption. Four studies demonstrate the
   proposed effect and test for the role of lay theories in the
   interpretation of metacognitive experiences. The authors conclude with a

AB Marketers are increasingly offering bundles that combine cross-category,

   which framing a discount as saving on certain items of cross-category
   bundles is more effective for increasing bundle purchased. Three
   experiments show that the purchase of a cross-category bundle is more
   likely when the discount is framed as savings on the relatively hedonic
   component rather than as savings on the utilitarian component or on the
   total bundle. The authors explain the findings based on the notion that
   a discount provides a justification that increased the likelihood of
   hedonic purchases but has little impact on utilitarian consumption. The

AB Producers of consumer packaged goods often offer several package sizes
   of the same product and charge a lower unit price for a larger size. In
   this article, the author investigate the "quantity-discount effect," or
   the phenomenon that consumers derive transaction utility from the unit
   price difference between a small and a large package size of the same
   product. The authors propose a modeling framework composed of a
   demand-side model and a supply-side model. The empirical results suggest
   that quantity-discount-induced gains or losses have a significant impact
   on consumer buying behavior. The authors also find a substantial amount
   of structural heterogeneity; that is, some consumers perceive quantity
   discounts as gains, whereas others perceive quantity discount as losses.
   Conversely, the supply-side analysis suggests that manufacturers in the
   empirical application do not consider quantity-discount effects when
   setting prices. Through a series of policy experiments, the authors show
   that by accounting for quantity-discount-dependent consumer preferences,
   manufacturers can design more effective nonlinear pricing schemes and
   obtain greater profits.

AB Consumers' impulsive choices have traditionally been attributed either

   or to individual personality traits. In this article, the authors find
   that type of food consumed can also influence impulsive choice.
   Specifically, food that enhances the levels of the neurotransmitter
   serotonin can reduce impulsive choice. to test the hypotheses on the
   influence of serotonin on postconsumption impulsive choice, the authors
   collected data on the eve of Thanksgiving. The occasion of Thanksgiving
   dinner provides a naturalistic setting in which people consume a
   trytophan-rich meal (tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin). the
   authors replicate these findings and obtain converging evidence in a lab

   refers to a person's disposition toward experiencing a preferred level

   in the laboratory and the field collectively demonstrate that consumers
   feel greater enjoyment and enhanced liking for the marketer when there
   is a close match between their emotional receptivity and the level of
   emotional intensity displayed by the marketer. In the third study, the
   authors show that consumers' emotional receptivity can be temporarily
   increased or decreased using advertisements that depict more or less
   expressive social interaction, respectively. The findings are similar to
   those observed in the first two studies. In addition, a preliminary

AB This research develops a taxonomy of alphanumeric brand names (ABs)
   based on the alignment between the brand names and their links to
   products and attributes. Five empirical studies reveal that ABs have
   systematic effects on consumers' product choices, moderated by
   consumers' need for cognition, the availability of product attribute
   information, and the taxonomic category of the AB. In an identical
   choice set, the choice share of a product option whose brand name takes
   a higher versus lower numeric portion (e.g., X-200 versus X-100)
   increases, and it is preferred more even when it is objectively inferior
   to other choice alternatives. Consumers with low need for cognition use
   "the higher, the better" heuristic to select options labeled with ABs
   and choose brands with higher numeric portions. Consumers with high need
   for cognition process ABs more systematically and make inferences about
   attribute values based on brand-name attributed correlations. The effect
   of ABs on consumer preferences are prevalent for most technical
   products, even when consumers do not know the product category or

AB Although store closures have become a common feature in grocery
   retailers' strategic decisions, knowledge about their implications
   remains minimal. In this article, the authors study how closure of a
   particular store affects the chain sales of a multioutlet retailer
   operating multiple formats. The authors show that the chain sales losses
   from a closure vary widely across outlets (ranging from less than 30% to
   more than 80% of the closed outlet's revenue) and depend not only on the
   closed store's format and distance to competitors but also on the
   profile of its clientele and type of shopping trip. The authors offer a
   methodology for predicting the magnitude of these losses for specific
   store closures that outperforms models calibrated on observed "regular"
   shopping patterns. This approach offers guidance to retailers in
   deciding whether a particular store closure is beneficial to the chain
   or, if the objectives is to prune an overly dense network, which of a
   set of local outlets is the best candidate for closure.

   satisfaction for analyst stock recommendation. Using a large-scale
   longitudinal data set, the authors find that positive changes in

   lower dispersions in those recommendations for the firm. These effects
   are stronger when product market competition is high and financial
   market uncertainty is large. In addition, analyst recommendation at
   least partially mediate the effects of changes in satisfaction on firm
   abnormal return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Analyst
   recommendations represent a mechanism through which customer

   reason to listen and follow. Overall, this research reveals the impact

AB Prior research on attention shifts to advertisements as focused
   primarily on demonstrating how perceptual features can shift attention
   to advertisements. In this article, the authors demonstrate that certain
   semantic characteristics of nonfocal advertising elements may similarly
   attract attention when consumers are focused on a primary task elsewhere
   in the visual field. I three experiments, the authors investigate how
   orienting attention responses to highly emotional advertising elements
   influence ad and brand awareness in cluttered environments.
   Specifically, they demonstrate that preattentive processing of the
   semantic informatin in nonfocal ad headlines can elicit orienting
   attention responses that result in predictable increased in ad and brand
   awareness.

AB Recent discussions in academic literature and the business press often
   paint an unflattering picture of the contributions of chief marketing
   officers (CMOs) to the financial value of their firms. Some even suggest
   that CMOs, despite being the marketing leaders in firms, have little or
   no effect on firm performance. However, formal empirical research on the
   impact of CMOs on financial performance is scarce. This article presents
   conceptual arguments and empirical evidence about this controversial
   issue. The authors suggest that CMOs are far from irrelevant to the
   financial performance of firms. However, the impact of CMOs on financial
   performance is highly contingent on the managerial discretion available
   to them. focusing on the role of customer power in limiting the
   managerial discretion available to CMOs, this study identifies
   individual and firm-specific conditions in which CMOs contribute more or
   less to firm valued. Analysed of abnormal stock returns associated with
   the appointment of CMOs provide support for the hypothesized effect of
   customer power and managerial discretion.

AB When consumers carry multiple debts, how do they decide which debt to
   repay first? Normatively, consumers should repay the debt with the
   highest interest rate most quickly. However, because people tend to
   break complicated tasks into more manageable parts, and because losses
   are most distressing when segregated, the authors hypothesize that
   people will pay off the smallest loan first to reduce the total number
   of outstanding loans and achieve a sense of tangible progress toward
   debt repayment. To experimentally examine how consumers manage multiple
   debts, the authors develop an incentive-compatible debt management game,
   in which participants are saddled with multiple debts and need to decide
   how to repay them over time. Consistent with the hypothesis, four
   experiments reveal evidence of debt account aversion: Participants
   consistently pay off small debts first, even though the larger debts
   have higher interest rates. The authors also find that restricting
   participants' ability to completely pay off small debts, and focusing
   their attention on the amount of interest each debt has accumulated,
   helps them reduce overall debt more quickly.

AB Repayment decisions how much of the loan to repay and when to make the
   payments directly influence consumer debt levels. The authors examine
   how minimum required payment policy and loan information disclosed to
   consumers influence repayment decisions. They find that while presenting
   minimum required payment information has a negative impact on repayment
   decisions, increasing the minimum required level has a positive effect
   on repayment for most consumers. Experimental evidence from U.S.
   consumers shows that consumers' propensity to pay the minimum required
   each month moderates these effects; U.K. credit card field data indicate
   that borrowers' credit limit and balance due also moderate these
   effects. However, increasing the minimum level is unlikely to completely
   eliminate the negative effect of presenting minimum payment information.
   In addition, disclosing supplemental information, such as future
   interest cost and time needed to repay the loan, does not reduce the
   negative effects of including minimum payment information and has no
   substantial positive effect on repayments. This research offers new
   insights into the debt repayment process and has implications for
   consumers, lenders, and public policy.

AB Many people fail to save what they will need for retirement. Research on
   excessive discounting of the future suggests that removing the lure of
   immediate rewards by precommitting to decisions or elaborating the value
   of future rewards both can make decisions more future oriented. The
   authors explore a third and complementary route, one that deals not with
   present and future rewards but with present and future selves. In line
   with research that shows that people may fail, because of a lack of
   belief or imagination, to identify with their future selves, the authors
   propose that allowing people to interact with age-progressed renderings
   of themselves will cause them to allocate more resources to the future.
   In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer
   renderings of their future selves using immersive virtual reality
   hardware and interactive decision aids. In all cases, those who
   interacted with their virtual future selves exhibited an increased
   tendency to accept later monetary rewards over immediate ones.

AB This research examines how identity claims constructed in narratives by
   borrowers influence lender decisions about unsecured personal loans.
   Specifically, do the number of identity claims and their content
   influence lending decisions, and can they predict the longer-term
   performance of funded loans? Using data from the peer-to-peer lending
   website Prosper.com, the authors find that unverifiable information
   affects lending decisions above and beyond the influence of objective,
   verifiable information. As the number of identity claims in narratives
   increases, so does loan funding, whereas loan performance suffers,
   because these borrowers are less likely to pay back the loan. In
   addition, identity content plays an important role. Identities focused
   on being trustworthy or successful are associated with increased loan
   funding but ironically are less predictive of loan performance than
   other identities (i.e., moral and economic hardship). Thus, some
   identity claims aim to mislead lenders, whereas others provide true
   representations of borrowers.

AB The number of individual investors who trade stocks online has

   researchers have paid little attention to how emotions influence
   individual investors' stock-trading decisions. In a series of three
   experiments, the authors investigate the impact of incidental fear on
   the decision to sell in a stock market simulation. The results show that
   fearful (vs. control) participants sell their stock earlier (Experiments
   1-3). This effect, however, is contingent on particular features of the
   market. Fear leads to early sell-off when partipant believe the value of
   the stock is peer generated but not when they believe the value of the
   stock is computer generated (Experiment 2). Early sell-off as a result
   of incidental fear also occurs when participants believe their risk
   attitude is common in the market but not when they believe their risk
   attitude is unique (Experiment 3). Social projection that is, people's
   tendency to rely on their current state of mind to estimate other
   people's actions-explains the phenomenon.

AB Many important and complex consumer decisions rely on the advice of
   trusted professional experts. Many experts, however, such as doctors,
   financial advisers, and accountants, may be prone to conflicts of
   interest. As such, consumers may seek a second opinion. A series of
   studies investigate consumers' reluctance to seek additional advice in
   the context of having an ongoing relationship with one expert service
   provider. The authors find evidence in health care claims that long-term
   relationships contribute to more expensive, but not necessarily better,
   treatment. In addition, a series of experiments show that people
   recognize when they could benefit from a second opinion but are more
   reluctant to do so when thinking about their own providers rather than
   someone else's. Further studies test a relationship maintenance
   hypothesis and show that consumers' reluctance to seek second opinions
   is partially driven by their motivation to preserve relationship
   harmony, even when it is at their own personal expense and well-being.
   Taken together, these results provide important insight into the
   potential limitations and consequences of long-standing relationships
   between consumers and experts.

AB Investors' previous experiences with a stock affect their willingness to
   repurchase that stock. Using detailed trade data from two brokers, the
   authors document that investors are reluctant to repurchase stocks
   previously sold for a loss and stocks that have risen in price
   subsequent to a prior sale. The authors propose that this behavior
   reflects investors' emotional reactions to trading and their attempts to
   distance themselves from negative emotions (e.g., disappointment,
   regret). Investors are disappointed when they sell a stock for a loss
   and regret having ever purchased the stock; these negative emotions
   deter investors from later repurchasing stocks they sold for a loss.
   Having sold a stock, investors are disappointed if the stock continues
   to rise and regret having sold the stock in the first place; these
   negative emotions deter investors from repurchasing stocks that go up
   since being sold. Thus, investors engage in reinforcement learning by
   repurchasing stocks whose previous purchase resulted in positive
   emotions and avoiding stocks whose previous purchase resulted in
   negative emotions.

AB Recent financial liberalization in emerging economies has led to the

   literacy and insurance education module communicating the need for
   personal financial management and the usefulness of formal hedging of
   agricultural production risks was offered to randomly selected farmers
   in Gujarat, India. The authors evaluate the effect of the financial
   literacy training and three marketing treatments using a randomized
   controlled trial. Financial education has a positive and significant
   effect on rainfall insurance adoption, increasing take-up from 8% to
   16%. Only one marketing intervention, the money-back guarantee, has a
   consistent and large effect on farmers' purchase decisions. This
   guarantee, comparable to a price reduction of approximately 40%,
   increases demand by seven percentage points.

AB People systematically underestimate exponential growth. This article
   illustrates this phenomenon, its implications, and some potential
   interventions in the context of saving for retirement, where savings
   grow exponentially over long periods of time. Experiment 1 shows that a
   majority of participants expect savings over 40 years to grow linearly
   rather than exponentially, leading them to grossly underestimate their
   account balance at retirement. Experiment 2 demonstrates that this
   misunderstanding leads to underestimates of the cost of waiting to save,
   which makes putting off saving more attractive than it should be.
   Finally, Experiments 3-5 show that highlighting the exponential growth
   of savings motivates both college students and employees to save more
   for retirement. Making clear to employees the exponential growth of
   savings before they make crucial decisions about how much to save may be
   a simple and effective means of increasing retirement savings.

AB Tax collection is critical for the proper functioning of society.
   However, many people strongly dislike paying taxes. Although this
   distaste could be rational on economic grounds, the authors show that
   this attitude extends beyond simply disliking the costs incurred and
   affects behavior in counternormative ways. They demonstrate the
   phenomenon of tax aversion: a desire to avoid taxes per se that exceeds
   the rational economic motivation to avoid a monetary cost. Across five
   experiments, the authors provide evidence that people have a stronger
   preference to avoid tax-related costs than to avoid equal-sized (or
   larger) monetary costs unrelated to taxes. Tax aversion affects consumer
   preferences in a variety of domains, including standard store purchases,
   financial investments, and job selection. Furthermore, this tendency is
   most prevalent among people who identify with political parties that
   generally favor less taxation. Finally, encouraging participants who
   identify with "antitax" parties to consider positive uses of their tax
   payments mitigates tax aversion. This article concludes with a
   discussion of the implications of these results for consumer behavior
   research and tax policies.

   significant contagion effects in 33 to 40 of the 67 sample products. The
   empirical evidence of contagion in the diffusion of many CPGs has
   important implications because most new product trial models for CPGs
   have assumed a priori that there is no contagion in the diffusion of
   these products. Moreover, the individual-level simultaneous analysis of
   the diffusion of 67 newly introduced CPGs provides useful insights into
   the unobservable network of influences among consumers. Such analysis
   allows a vendor to identify the most influential early adopters among
   its customers, who could help diffuse a new product more effectively in

AB As service centers become crucial corporate assets for increasing
   customer relationships and profits, it is imperative to understand
   customer reactions to service allocations. Using customer call history
   from a DSL service, the authors empirically investigate how customers'
   onshore and offshore experiences affect service duration and customer
   retention. They formulate service channel allocation decisions as
   solutions to a dynamic programming problem in which the firm learns
   about heterogeneous customer preferences, balances short-term service
   costs with long-term customer retention, and optimally matches customers
   with their preferred centers to maximize long-term profit. They
   demonstrate through simulations that learning enables a firm to make
   more customized allocations and that acting on long-term customer
   responses prompts the firm to make proactive decisions that prevent
   customers from leaving. As a result, the firm can improve customer
   retention and profit. The proposed framework also mirrors the recent
   trend of companies seeking solutions that transform customer information
   into customized and dynamic marketing decisions to improve long-term
   profit.

AB Trade-in transactions typically involve an exchange of an old, used
   version for a new or newer version of the product. When consumers trade
   in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying
   the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a
   commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high
   price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for
   the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always
   prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they
   disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the
   sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the
   prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that
   identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is
   reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically
   equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio
   of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is
   low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is
   reversed. They observe support for the predictions that emerge from the
   model in laboratory experiments.

AB This study compares the performance of four commonly used approaches to
   measure consumers' willingness to pay with real purchase data (REAL):
   the open-ended (OE) question format; choice-based conjoint (CBC)
   analysis; Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (BDM) incentive-compatible
   mechanism; and incentive-aligned choice-based conjoint (ICBC) analysis.
   With this five-in-one approach, the authors test the relative strengths
   of the four measurement methods, using REAL as the benchmark, on the
   basis of statistical criteria and decision-relevant metrics. The results
   indicate that the BDM and ICBC approaches can pass statistical and
   decision-oriented tests. The authors find that respondents are more
   price sensitive in incentive-aligned settings than in
   non-incentive-aligned settings and the REAL setting. Furthermore, they
   find a large number of "none" choices under ICBC than under hypothetical
   conjoint analysis. This study uncovers an intriguing possibility: Even
   when the OE format and CBC analysis generate hypothetical bias, they may
   still lead to the right demand curves and right pricing decisions.

   5471 online auctions for car seats ending before, during, and after the
   information was considered valid, this article shows that (1) consumers
   responded to the new information and, more surprisingly, (2) they
   promptly ceased to do so when it was retracted. Because of the random
   nature of the flawed ratings, this first finding demonstrates that
   expert advice has a causal effect on consumer demand. The second finding

AB The authors propose a new method to visualize browsing behavior in
   so-called product search maps. Manufacturers can use these maps to
   understand how consumers search for competing products before choice,
   including how information acquisition and product search are organized
   along brands, product attributes, and price-related search strategies.
   The product search maps also inform manufacturers about the competitive
   structure in the industry and the contents of consumer consideration
   sets. The proposed method defines a product search network, consisting
   of the products and links that designate whether a product is searched
   conditional on searching other products. The authors model this network
   using a stochastic, hierarchical, and asymmetric multidimensional
   scaling framework and decompose the product locations as well as the
   product-level influences using product attributes. The advantages of the
   approach are twofold. First, the authors simultaneously visualize the
   positions of products and the direction of consumer search over products
   in a perceptual map of search proximity. Second, they explain the
   formation of the map using observed product attributes. The authors
   empirically apply their approach to consumer search of digital
   camcorders at Amazon.com and provide several managerial implications.

   how consumers form price expectations and how these expectations
   influence their sequential search behavior and prices in the market.
   They derive a perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium and show that whereas
   higher current period prices induce search, consumers who observe higher
   historical prices form higher price expectations, become more
   pessimistic, and search less. Furthermore, the authors show that when
   prices increase as a result of an increase in marginal costs, consumers
   respond by searching more, which then leads to higher prices and instant
   price adjustment. In contrast, because consumer search activities
   decline when prices fall, sellers may respond by lowering their prices
   just enough to dampen consumers' search tendencies when costs decrease.
   The authors test their theoretical model and its implications and find

AB In Internet paid search advertising, marketers pay for search engines to
   serve text advertisements in response to keyword searches that are
   generic (e.g., "hotels") or branded (e.g., "Hilton Hotels"). Although
   stand-alone metrics usually show that generic keywords have higher
   apparent costs to the advertiser than branded keywords, generic search
   may create a spillover effect on subsequent branded search. Building on
   the Nerlove-Arrow advertising framework, the authors propose a dynamic
   linear model to capture the potential spillover from generic to branded
   paid search. In the model, generic search advertisements serve to expose
   users to information about the brand's ability to meet their needs,
   raising awareness that the brand is relevant to the search. In turn,
   this can induce additional future search activity for keywords that
   include the brand name. Using a Bayesian estimation approach, the
   authors apply the model to data from a paid search campaign for a major
   lodging chain. The results show that generic search activity positively
   affects future branded search activity through awareness of relevance.
   However, branded search does not affect generic search, demonstrating
   that the spillover is asymmetric. The findings have implications for
   understanding search behavior on the Internet and the management of paid
   search advertising.

   sets. They incorporate incentives into the tested formats that prompt
   respondents to state noncompensatory, compensatory, or mixed rules for
   agents who will select a product for the respondents. In a mobile phone
   study, two validation tasks prompt respondents to indicate which of 32
   mobile phones they would consider from a fractional design of features
   and levels. The authors find that UDE predicts consideration sets
   better, across both profiles and respondents, than a structured
   direct-elicitation method. It predicts comparably to established
   incentive-aligned compensatory, noncompensatory, and mixed
   decompositional methods. In a more complex automotive study,
   noncompensatory decomposition is not feasible and additive-utility
   decomposition is strained, but UDE scales well. The authors align
   incentives for all methods using prize indemnity insurance to award a

AB Product line design for consumer durables often relies on close
   coordination between marketing and engineering domains. Product lines
   that evolve as optimal from marketers' perspective may not be optimal
   from an engineering viewpoint, and vice versa. Although extant research
   has proposed sophisticated techniques to handle problems that
   characterize each individual domain, the majority of these developments
   have not addressed the interdependent issues across marketing and
   engineering. The author presents a product line optimization method that
   enables managers to simultaneously consider factors deemed important
   from both marketing and engineering domains. One major advantage of this
   method is that it takes into account the strategic reactions from the
   incumbent manufacturers and the retailer in the design of the product
   line. The author demonstrates in a simulation study that this method is
   applicable to problems with a reasonably large scale. Using data
   collected in a power tool development project undertaken by a major U.S.
   manufacturer, the study illustrates that the proposed method leads to a
   more profitable product line than alternative approaches that consider
   requirements from these two domains separately.

AB The authors propose a Web-based adaptive self-explicated approach for

   number (ten or more) of attributes. The proposed approach overcomes some
   of the limitations of previous self-explicated approaches. The authors
   develop a computer-based self-explicated approach that breaks down the
   attribute importance question into a ranking of attributes followed by a
   sequence of constant-sum paired comparison questions. In the proposed
   approach, the questions are chosen adaptively for each respondent to
   maximize the information elicited from each paired comparison question.
   Unlike the traditional self-explicated approach, the proposed approach
   provides standard errors for attribute importance. In two studies
   involving digital cameras and laptop computers described on 12 and 14
   attributes, respectively, the authors find that the ability to correctly
   predict validation choices of the proposed adaptive approach is
   substantially and significantly greater than that of adaptive conjoint
   analysis, the fast polyhedral method, and the traditional
   self-explicated approach. In addition, the adaptive self-explicated

   consumers prefer bonus packs to price discounts. The authors propose
   that this preference does not hold for vice food, because consumers
   cannot generate good justifications for buying such food when a bonus
   pack is offered because this would mean consuming more of the vice.
   However, a price discount on a vice food can be justified because it
   acts as a guilt-mitigating mechanism. For virtue foods, the absence of
   both anticipated postconsumption guilt and the resultant need to justify
   leads consumers to prefer a bonus pack to a price discount. The authors

   exposed to online advertising, this gap narrows to 3%. There are similar
   effects for four changes in local offline alcohol advertising
   restrictions when advertising effectiveness is observed both before and
   after the change. The effect of online advertising is disproportionately
   high for new products and for products with low awareness in places that

   (OL). Although information technologies are creating increasing
   opportunities for firms to facilitate and manage these two types of
   social interaction, to date, researchers have encountered difficulty in
   disentangling their competing effects and have provided limited insights
   into how these two social influences might differ from and interact with
   each other. Using a unique natural experimental setting resulting from
   information policy shifts at the online seller Amazon.com, the authors
   design three longitudinal, quasi-experimental field studies to examine
   three issues regarding the two types of social interaction: (1) their
   differential impact on product sales, (2) their lifetime effects, and
   (3) their interaction effects. An intriguing finding is that while
   negative WOM is more influential than positive WOM, positive OL
   information significantly increases sales, but negative OL information
   has no effect. This suggests that reporting consumer purchase statistics
   can help mass-market products without hurting niche products. The
   results also reveal that the sales impact of OL increases with WOM
   volume.

   such uncertainty on consumer behavior, assuming that consumers are
   uncertain about the mean product quality level and learn about product
   quality through the signals contained in use experience and the
   product-harm crisis and also that consumers are uncertain about the
   precision of the signals in conveying product quality and update their
   perception of this precision over time. They estimate this model using a
   scanner panel data set that includes consumer purchase history before,
   during, and after a product-harm crisis that affected Kraft Foods
   Australia's peanut butter division in June 1996. The proposed model fits
   the data better than the standard consumer learning model, which assumes
   consumers are uncertain about product quality level but the precision of
   information in conveying product quality is known. This study also
   provides insights into consumers' behavioral choice responses to a
   product-harm crisis. Finally, the authors conduct counterfactual
   experiments based on the estimation results and provide insights to
   managers on crisis management.

AB In an increasingly globalized marketplace, it is common for marketing
   researchers to collect data from respondents who are not native speakers
   of the language in which the questions are formulated. Examples include
   online customer ratings and internal marketing initiatives in
   multinational corporations. This raises the issue of whether providing
   responses on rating scales in a person's native versus second language
   exerts a systematic influence on the responses obtained. This article
   documents the anchor contraction effect (ACE), the systematic tendency
   to report more intense emotions when answering questions using rating
   scales in a nonnative language than in the native language. Nine studies
   (1) establish ACE, test the underlying process, and rule out alternative
   explanations; (2) examine the generalizability of ACE across a range of
   situations, measures, and response scale formats; and (3) explore
   managerially relevant and easily implementable corrective techniques.

AB Although much research has found that "birds of a feather flock
   together," the authors suggest that opposites tend to attract when it
   comes to certain spending tendencies; that is, tightwads, who generally
   spend less than they would ideally like to spend, and spendthrifts, who
   generally spend more than they would ideally like to spend, tend to
   marry each other, consistent with the notion that people are attracted
   to mates who possess characteristics dissimilar to those they deplore in
   themselves. Despite this complementary attraction, tightwad spendthrift
   differences within a marriage predict conflict over finances, which in
   turn predicts diminished marital well-being. These relationships persist
   when controlling for important financial outcomes (household-level
   savings and credit card debt). These findings underscore the importance
   of studying the relationships among money, consumption, and happiness at
   an interpersonal level.

AB Decisions often involve trade-offs between a more normative option and a
   less normative but more tempting one. The authors propose that the
   intrapersonal conflict that is evoked by choices involving incompatible
   goals can be resolved through scope-insensitive justifications. The
   authors describe one such mechanism, the "mere token" effect, a new
   phenomenon in decision making. They demonstrate that adding a certain
   and immediate mere token amount to both options increases choices of the
   later-larger option in intertemporal choice and of the riskier-larger
   option in risky choice. The authors find this effect to be scope
   insensitive, such that the size of the token amount does not moderate
   the effect. They show that intrapersonal choice conflict underlies the
   mere token effect and that reducing the degree of conflict by increasing
   the psychological distance to the choice outcomes debiases the effect.
   Moreover, they show that the mere token effect is enhanced when (1)
   opposing goals in choice are made salient and (2) the choice options
   represent a starker contrast that generates greater conflict. The
   authors empirically rule out alternative explanations, including
   diminishing marginal utility, normative and descriptive utility-based
   models, liquidity constraints, and naive diversification. They discuss
   the direct implications of the mere token effect for the marketing of
   financial services and, more generally, for consumer preference toward
   bundles and multiattribute products.

AB Are you type A or type B? An optimist or a pessimist? Intuitive or
   analytical? Consumers are motivated to learn about the self, but they
   may not always accept what they learn. This article explores how the
   desire for self-discovery leads people to seek but not necessarily
   accept the feedback they receive and the implications this has for
   consumption behavior. Specifically, this article examines the case of
   consumers who value being unconstrained: people with independent
   self-construals and those who have high levels of reactance motivation.
   The authors argue that these people often view self-knowledge as a
   constraint on the self and subsequently reject it even when the
   self-knowledge has neutral or positive implications for self-esteem.
   Results across five studies demonstrate that independents and high
   reactants feel constrained by self-knowledge, and this causes them to
   reject and make consumption choices inconsistent with it even as they
   actively seek to learn about themselves. In contrast, interdependents
   and low reactants do not feel constrained by self-knowledge, and
   consequently, they accept and incorporate it into their consumption
   decisions.

AB A great deal of research in consumer decision making and social
   cognition has explored consumers' attempts to simplify choices by
   bolstering their tentative choice candidate and/or denigrating the other
   alternatives. The current research investigates a diametrically opposed
   process, whereby consumers complicate their decisions. The authors
   demonstrate that to complicate their choices, consumers increase choice
   conflict by overweighting small disadvantages of superior alternatives,
   converging overall evaluations of alternatives, reversing preference
   ordering, and even choosing less preferred alternatives. Furthermore,
   the results from five studies support a unifying theoretical framework:
   the effort compatibility principle. Specifically, the authors argue that
   consumers strive for compatibility between the effort they anticipate
   and the effort that they actually exert. When a decision seems more
   difficult than initially expected, a simplifying process ensues.
   However, when the decision seems easier to resolve than anticipated
   (e.g., when consumers face an important yet easy choice), consumers
   artificially increase their effort.

AB Consumers often like fluently processed stimuli. The authors find that

   number through common addition (e.g., 1 + 1 through 10 + 10) and common
   multiplication (2 x 2 through 10 x 10) problems (Study 1). Common
   addition and multiplication problems (arithmetic), or their operands,
   can be used to prime a number and increase its fluency (Study 3). The
   benefits of arithmetic and operand primes are limited to single primes
   (i.e., more primes are not necessarily better) (Study 5). Number fluency
   is relevant to creating numeric brand names (Study 2), enhancing the

AB Demand uncertainty and supply rigidity often create inventory shortages.
   Inventory shortages can have adverse consequences on both short- and
   long-term customer behaviors. Using data from an online grocer, this
   study has the following three main objectives: First, the authors
   empirically investigate the true nature of shortage costs by examining
   how stockouts and fulfillment rates affect customer's purchase behavior
   in both the short and long run. Second, the authors study how consumers'
   reactions to inventory shortages differ across customer segments. They
   use these observations to illustrate how the seller might benefit from
   prioritizing fulfillment policies according to customer traits. Third,
   the authors study how the impact of inventory shortages varies across
   product categories. Using these insights, the authors discuss how the
   seller should allocate limited resources to improve order fulfillment
   across these categories. Overall, the authors find that stockout rates
   have a dramatic but nonlinear impact on the seller's profitability. This
   suggests that the firm can achieve many of the benefits of improving
   fulfillment rates through small decreases in stockout rates. They also
   find significant differences in how different types of customers respond
   to stockouts and that prioritizing inventory according to transaction
   history measures and basket contents can lead to large increases in
   contribution while only requiring moderate reductions in stockout rates.

   account of both asymmetries in the impact of price anchors across
   product categories and contingencies in the occurrence of these
   asymmetries. Four studies show the deliberate consideration of price
   anchors that can play a key role in whether the effect of the anchors
   will generalize across product categories. Specifically, an explicit
   comparison of a product to a price anchor increases the accessibility of
   features that represent a product available at this price. In turn,
   these thoughts influence the price that consumers are willing to pay for
   these products. In the absence of this deliberation, however, anchors
   influence both related and unrelated products, provided no other
   cognitive activity occurs in the interim.

AB Consumers' attraction to a product can often be based on the subjective
   reactions that they imagine they would have if they personally used it.
   Three experiments examine the effects of self-focused attention on the
   use of this criterion and the conditions in which it is applied. When
   features of the judgment (social or nonsocial) context are similar to
   those of the situation in which the products are normally used,
   self-focused attention increases participants' disposition to imagine
   themselves using the products they evaluate, and in turn, these
   imaginings increase both their evaluations of these products and their
   likelihood of choosing these products as a gift for taking part in the
   experiment. The effects occur when features of the judgment context are
   manipulated both by incidental background music and by the presence of
   others in the situation at hand. However, when either self-focused
   attention is low or features of the judgment context are dissimilar to
   those in which the products are normally used, these effects are not

AB Using the self-regulatory strength model and prior research on
   self-esteem threats, the authors predict and show that delegating
   decisions to surrogates (e.g., financial advisors, physicians) depletes
   consumers' limited self-regulatory resources more than making the same
   decisions independently, thus impairing their subsequent ability to
   exercise self-control. This is the case even though decision delegation
   actually requires less decision-making effort than independent decision
   making (Study 1). However, the resource-depleting effect of decision
   delegation vanishes when consumers have an opportunity to affirm their
   belief in free will (Study 2). Moreover, when people remember a past
   decision that they delegated, their self-control is impaired more than
   when they remember a decision made independently (Studies 3 and 4). The
   authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical
   implications of these findings.

AB This article discusses the diffusion process in an online social network
   given the individual connections between members. The authors model the
   adoption decision of individuals as a binary choice affected by three
   factors: (1) the local network structure formed by already adopted
   neighbors, (2) the average characteristics of adopted neighbors
   (influencers), and (3) the characteristics of the potential adopters.
   Focusing on the first factor, the authors find two marked effects.
   First, an individual who is connected to many adopters has a greater
   adoption probability (degree effect). Second, the density of connections
   in a group of already adopted consumers has a strong positive effect on
   the adoption of individuals connected to this group (clustering effect).
   The article also records significant effects for influencer and adopter
   characteristics. For adopters, specifically, the authors find that
   position in the entire network and some demographic variables are good
   predictors of adoption. Similarly, in the case of already adopted
   individuals, average demographics and global network position can
   predict their influential power on their neighbors. An interesting
   counterintuitive finding is that the average influential power of
   individuals decreases with the total number of their contacts. These
   results have practical implications for viral marketing, a context in
   which a variety of technology platforms are increasingly considering
   leveraging their consumers' revealed connection patterns. The model
   performs particularly well in predicting the next set of adopters.

AB Research has shown that consumer online product ratings reflect both the

   ratings. In this article, the authors measure the impact of social
   dynamics in the ratings environment on both subsequent rating behavior
   and product sales. First, they model the arrival of product ratings and
   separate the effects of social influences from the underlying (or
   baseline) ratings behavior. Second, the authors model product sales as a
   function of posted product ratings while decomposing ratings into a
   baseline rating, the contribution of social influence, and idiosyncratic
   error. This enables them to quantify the sales impact of observed social
   dynamics. The authors consider both the direct effects on sales and the
   indirect effects that result from the influence of dynamics on future
   ratings (and thus future sales). The results show that although ratings
   behavior is significantly influenced by previously posted ratings and
   can directly improve sales, the effects are relatively short lived once
   indirect effects are considered.

   direct-to-consumer brand advertising elasticities estimated in 56
   studies published between 1960 and 2008. The study finds several new
   empirical generalizations about advertising elasticity. The most
   important are as follows: The average short-term advertising elasticity
   is .12, which is substantially lower than the prior meta-analytic mean
   of .22; there has been a decline in the advertising elasticity over
   time; and advertising elasticity is higher (1) for durable goods than
   nondurable goods, (2) in the early stage than the mature stage of the
   life cycle, (3) for yearly data than quarterly data, and (4) when
   advertising is measured in gross rating points than monetary terms. The
   mean long-term advertising elasticity is .24, which is much lower than
   the implied mean in the prior meta-analysis (.41). Many of the results
   for short-term elasticity hold for long-term elasticity, with some
   notable exceptions. The authors discuss the implications of these

AB Six studies examine the influence of positive affect on self-control in
   intertemporal choice (consumers' willingness to wait for desired
   rewards) and the cognitive processes underlying this effect. Two studies
   measure participants' levels of thinking in two different ways, showing
   that positive affect can promote forward-looking, high-level thinking.
   Two studies using a delay-of-gratification paradigm demonstrate this
   forward-looking thinking and show it to be a mindful process.
   Participants in positive (vs. neutral) affect were more likely to choose
   a larger mail-in rebate over a smaller instant rebate when the reward
   differences were moderate (but not when they were small). Two studies
   demonstrate the impact of positive affect on intertemporal preference in
   another way, showing that participants in positive affect do not
   discount the value of delayed outcomes as much as people in neutral
   affect do (decreased present bias). Together, the results indicate that
   positive affect promotes cognitive flexibility and fosters a higher
   level of thinking and a more future-oriented time perspective, without
   obscuring practical considerations and other needed detail, including
   context and opportunity costs, when evaluating intertemporal options.

AB Breast cancer communications that make women's gender identity salient
   can trigger defense mechanisms and thereby interfere with key objectives
   of breast cancer campaigns. In a series of experiments, the authors
   demonstrate that increased gender identity salience lowered women's
   perceived vulnerability to breast cancer (Experiments 1a, 3a, and 3b),
   reduced their donations to ovarian cancer research (Experiment 1b), made
   breast cancer advertisements more difficult to process (Experiment 2a),
   and decreased ad memory (Experiment 2b). These results are contrary to
   the predictions of several prominent theoretical perspectives and a
   convenience sample of practitioners. The reduction in perceived
   vulnerability to breast cancer following gender identity primes can be
   eliminated by self-affirmation (Experiment 3a) and fear voicing
   (Experiment 3b), corroborating the hypothesis that these effects are
   driven by unconscious defense mechanisms.

AB Across three studies, this research elucidates when loss- versus
   gain-framed messages are most effective in influencing consumer
   recycling by examining the moderating role of whether a more concrete or
   abstract mind-set is activated. First, in a field study, the authors
   demonstrate that loss frames are more efficacious when paired with
   low-level, concrete mind-sets, whereas gain frames are more effective
   when paired with high-level, abstract mind-sets. This is an important,
   substantive finding that persisted over a significant time span. In
   addition, in two additional laboratory studies, they find further
   evidence for this matching hypothesis, in which a pairing of loss-
   (gain-) framed messages that activates more concrete (abstract)
   mind-sets leads to enhanced processing fluency, increased efficacy, and,
   as a result, more positive recycling intentions. The findings have
   implications for marketers, consumers, and society as a whole.

AB This article examines the interplay of social and temporal distance on
   consumers' responses to others' recommendations. Drawing on research on
   psychological distance and the "fit" literature, the authors hypothesize
   that others' recommendations are more persuasive when the construal
   levels associated with both social distance and temporal distance are
   congruent. Specifically, the authors first demonstrate a time-contingent
   effect of recommendation: Others' recommendations lead to a greater
   preference shift when people make decisions for distant-future
   consumption than for near-future consumption (Studies 1 and 2). Second,
   contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that close others do
   not always have a greater impact than distant others. Instead,
   recommendations from close others are more influential in shifting
   near-future preferences than those from distant others, whereas
   recommendations from distant others are more influential than those from
   close others in shifting distant-future preferences (Study 3). The
   authors demonstrate that others' recommendations are perceived to be
   more relevant as the underlying mechanism when there is a match of
   construal levels between the social and temporal distance. Research and
   managerial implications are discussed.

AB Identifying winning new product concepts can be a challenging process
   that requires insight into private consumer preferences. To measure
   consumer preferences for new product concepts, the authors apply a
   "securities trading of concepts," or STOC, approach, in which new
   product concepts are traded as financial securities. The authors apply
   this method because market prices are known to efficiently collect and
   aggregate private information regarding the economic value of goods,
   services, and firms, particularly when trading financial securities.
   This research compares the STOC approach against stated-choice,
   conjoint, constant-sum, and longitudinal revealed-preference data. The
   authors also place STOC in the context of previous research on
   prediction markets and experimental economics. Across multiple product
   categories, the authors test whether STOC (1) is more cost efficient
   than other methods, (2) passes validity tests, (3) measures expectations
   of others, and (4) reveals individual preferences, not just those of the
   crowd. The results show that traders exhibit a self-preference bias when
   trading. Ultimately, STOC offers two key advantages over traditional
   market research methods: cost efficiency and scalability. For new
   product development teams deciding how to invest resources, this
   scalability may be especially important in the Web 2.0 world.

AB The authors present a Bayesian simultaneous choice factor model that
   measures consumers' willingness to pay for brand-image associations.
   Previous research has found that general brand effects influence a
   brand's scores on specific image dimensions. To investigate the value of
   general versus specific brand image, the authors specify a higher-order
   factor model in which a set of correlated factor scores arise from a
   general brand factor and a set of orthogonal residual scores that
   measure the specific dimensions of brand image. The general brand factor
   is consistent with the concept of a halo effect, which theory ascribes
   to either an overall evaluative effect or errors in cognition. The
   authors apply the model to stated preference data on branded midsized
   sedans accompanied by data on consumer brand-image associations. The
   authors find that there is substantial value for the specific dimensions
   of brand image, but only after controlling for the general brand effect
   with the higher-order factor decomposition.

AB Previous research has shown that consumers frequently choose products
   with too many features that they later find difficult to use. In this
   research, the authors show that this seemingly suboptimal behavior may
   actually confer benefits when factoring in the social context of
   consumption. The results demonstrate that choosing products with more
   capabilities (i.e., feature-rich products) provides social utility
   beyond inferences of wealth, signaling consumers' technological skills
   and openness to new experiences and that consumers' beliefs about the
   social utility of feature-rich products are predictive of their choices
   of such 1 products. Furthermore, the authors examine when impression
   management concerns increase consumers' likelihood of choosing
   feature-rich products. They find that public choices in which
   participants display their preferences to others encourage
   feature-seeking behavior but that the anticipation of having to use a
   product in front of others provides an incentive to avoid additional
   features.

AB This article studies how to endogenously assess the value of a
   "superior" advertising position in the price competition and examines
   the resulting location competition outcomes and price dispersion
   patterns. The authors consider a game-theoretic model in which firms
   compete for advertising positions and then compete in price for
   customers in a product market. Firms differ in their competence, and
   positions are differentiated in their prominence, which reflects
   consumers' online search behavior. They find that when endogenously
   evaluated within the product market competition, a prominent advertising
   position might not always be desirable for a firm with competitive
   advantage, even if it is cost-free. The profitability of a prominent
   advertising position depends on the trade-off between the extra demand
   from winning the position and the higher equilibrium prices when the
   weaker competitor wins it. Furthermore, the authors show that the
   bidding outcome might not align with the relative competitive strength,
   and an advantaged firm might not be able to win the prominent position
   even when it values that position. They derive two-dimensional
   equilibrium price dispersion with the realized prices at the same
   position varying and the expected prices differing across different
   positions. They find that the expected price in the prominent position
   might not always be higher, implying that an expensive location does not
   necessarily lead to expensive products.

AB Both customer and innovation assets are important to firm performance.
   Prior research has mostly examined these assets at the firm level and
   has not distinguished between the effects of asset depth relative to
   competitors and asset breadth across different segments. Using
   configuration theory and the resource-based view of the firm, the
   authors propose that how these assets interact to influence performance
   depends on both depth and breadth because these features reflect whether
   the assets are likely to create and/or appropriate value when deployed.
   Empirical results from two studies one using secondary data and another
   using primary data from a survey of senior managers indicate that
   performance is highest when firms employ configurations using deep
   customer and broad innovation assets or deep innovation and broad
   customer assets. In contrast, firm performance variability decreases in
   the presence of deep deep and broad broad asset configurations. The
   effect of configuration strategies on firm performance also is typically
   greater in dynamic than in stable environments.

   market governance and hierarchical governance exist (i.e., the employees
   of one channel member work on a full-time basis at an exchange partner's
   facilities, performing functions that the exchange partner traditionally
   performs). Building on the transaction cost analysis and governance
   value analysis literature streams, the authors examine ongoing

   apparel market of South Korea using multisource, reciprocally matched
   data in which a manufacturer's directly employed sales force is deployed
   at department store retailers as the sole frontline employees for their
   brand. The authors find that brand reputation, downstream market
   uncertainty, and sales force performance ambiguity influence
   manufacturer control over sales operations and manufacturer flexibility
   with retailers in unique ways. The authors discuss implications of this
   work for theory and practice.

AB Consumers increasingly inform one another about marketplace offerings in
   online review forums. The authors demonstrate that when given no
   information about a reviewer (i.e., when the reviewer's identity is
   ambiguous), consumers use an accessibility-based egocentric anchor to
   infer that ambiguous reviewers have similar tastes to their own, leading
   consumers to be (1) similarly persuaded by reviews written by ambiguous
   and similar reviewers and (2) more persuaded by reviews written by
   ambiguous reviewers than by reviews written by dissimilar reviewers. The
   authors demonstrate that this effect holds in a single-offering,
   single-reviewer context. The authors also show that when consumers are
   exposed to multiple offerings with multiple reviewers, there may be a
   slight "cost" to ambiguity as opposed to similarity but that ambiguity
   remains much more persuasive than dissimilarity. Finally, the authors
   demonstrate that the effects of egocentric anchoring on persuasion can
   be moderated, first, by making other-related thoughts accessible and,
   second, by providing external cues about potential reviewer
   heterogeneity. These findings have important implications for both the
   management and monitoring of consumer-to-consumer online communication.

AB Consumers choosing flat-rate contracts tend to have insufficient usage
   to warrant the cost, particularly for new products. We propose and
   estimate a Bayesian learning model of tariff and usage choice that
   explains this flat-rate bias without relying on behavioral misjudgments
   or tariff-specific preferences. For new products, consumers are
   uncertain about both their utility relative to the population mean and
   the mean itself. We show that this latter uncertainty inflates prior
   variances, which leads consumers to weight their private signals more
   heavily when updating beliefs. Posteriors are unbiased across products.
   For a given product, however, the unknown mean yields a "winner's
   curse": Consumers with high posteriors tend to overestimate their
   utility. These consumers choose fixed-rate tariffs and lower their usage
   as they correct their beliefs. The flat-rate bias arises when switching
   costs deter them from changing tariffs. Using the estimated model, the
   authors find that tariff menus are ineffective screening devices for
   price discrimination by an online grocer. Predicted revenues increase by
   20% when the per-use tariff is dropped, because more consumers choose
   and stay with the flat rate.

AB The authors show how to use nnicrolevel survey data from a tracking
   study on brand awareness in conjunction with data on sales and
   advertising expenditures to improve the specification, estimation, and
   interpretation of aggregate discrete choice models of demand. In a
   departure from the commonly made full information assumption, they
   incorporate limited information in the form of choice sets to reflect
   that consumers may not be aware of all available brands at purchase
   time. They find that both the estimated brand constants and the price
   coefficient are biased downward when consumer heterogeneity in choice
   sets is ignored. These biased estimates can lead firms to make costly
   price-setting mistakes. In addition, the tracking data enable the
   authors to identify separately two processes by which advertising
   influences market shares. They find that advertising has a direct effect
   on brand awareness (inclusion in choice set) in addition to its effect
   on consumer preferences (increase in utility). This improved

AB Offline retailers face trading area and shelf space constraints, so they
   offer products tailored to the needs of the majority. Consumers whose
   preferences are dissimilar to the majority-"preference minorities"-are
   underserved offline and should be more likely to shop online. The
   authors use sales data from Diapers.com, the leading U.S. online
   retailer for baby diapers, to show why geographic variation in
   preference minority status of target customers explains geographic
   variation in online sales. They find that, holding the absolute number
   of the target customers constant, online category sales are more than
   50% higher in locations where customers suffer from preference
   isolation. Because customers in the preference minority face higher
   offline shopping costs, they are also less price sensitive. Niche
   brands, compared with popular brands, show even greater
   offline-to-online sales substitution. This greater sensitivity to
   preference isolation means that these brands in the tail of the long
   tail distribution draw a greater proportion of their total sales from
   high preference minority regions. The authors conclude with a discussion
   of implications for online retailing research and practice.

AB Firms are challenged to improve the effectiveness of cross-selling
   campaigns. The authors propose a customer-response model that recognizes
   the evolvement of customer demand for various products; the possible
   multifaceted roles of cross-selling solicitations for promotion,
   advertising, and education; and customer heterogeneous preference for
   communication channels. They formulate cross-selling campaigns as
   solutions to a stochastic dynamic programming problem in which the
   firm's goal is to maximize the long-term profit of its existing
   customers while taking into account the development of customer demand
   over time and the multistage role of cross-selling promotion. The model
   yields optimal cross-selling strategies for how to introduce the right
   product to the right customer at the right time using the right
   communication channel. Applying the model to panel data with
   cross-selling solicitations provided by a national bank, the authors
   demonstrate that households have different preferences and
   responsiveness to cross-selling solicitations. In addition to generating
   immediate sales, cross-selling solicitations also help households move
   faster along the financial continuum (educational role) and build up
   goodwill (advertising role). A decomposition analysis shows that the
   educational effect (83%) largely dominates the advertising effect (15%)
   and instantaneous promotional effect (2%). The cross-selling
   solicitations resulting from the proposed framework are more customized
   and dynamic and improve immediate response rate by 56%, long-term
   response rate by 149%, and long-term profit by 177%.

   that consumers with an active goal are most vulnerable to
   self-regulatory failure when the object of desire is farther away from
   them (in either time or space) because as the distance increases they
   focus less on the costs of consumption. Finally, results indicate that
   if product information is not externally available (i.e., it must be

AB Firms are increasingly seeking to harness the potential of social

   understanding the antecedents and consequences of relationship formation
   within networks and in predicting interactivity among users. The authors
   develop an integrated statistical framework for simultaneously modeling
   the connectivity structure of multiple relationships of different types
   on a common set of actors. Their modeling approach incorporates several
   distinct facets to capture both the determinants of relationships and
   the structural characteristics of multiplex and sequential networks.
   They develop hierarchical Bayesian methods for estimation and illustrate
   their model with two applications: The first application uses a
   sequential network of communications among managers involved in new
   product development activities, and the second uses an online
   collaborative social network of musicians. The authors' applications
   demonstrate the benefits of modeling multiple relations jointly for both
   substantive and predictive purposes. They also illustrate how
   information in one relationship can be leveraged to predict connectivity
   in another relation.

AB This research demonstrates that during self-customization, consumers use

   about subsequent decisions. When the difficulty experienced during
   decisions later in the process deviates from that which occurs earlier
   in the process, consumer preference is affected by the discrepancy

   that when the difficulty experienced during feature decisions deviates
   from expectations, consumers may spend more or less money on product
   features as a result of discrepant fluency than when they perform the
   same task and the level of difficulty is expected. The results
   demonstrate that discrepant fluency effects are not limited to
   sequential decisions but can influence a single feature decision, which
   was accomplished by altering consumers' expectations before the
   decision. These discrepant fluency effects emerge even when the
   attributes of the alternatives and the composition of the focal decision
   settings remain the same.

AB Four studies investigate the interactive influence of the presence of an
   accompanying friend and a consumer's agency communion orientation on the
   consumer's spending behaviors. In general, the authors find that
   shopping with a friend can be expensive for agency-oriented consumers
   (e.g., males) but not for communion-oriented consumers (e.g., females).
   That is, consumers who are agency oriented spend significantly more when
   they shop with a friend (vs. when they shop alone), whereas this effect
   is attenuated for consumers who are communion oriented. The results also
   show that this interactive effect is moderated by individual differences
   in self-monitoring such that friends are especially influential for
   consumers who are high in self-monitoring, but the effects occur in
   opposite directions for agency- and communion-oriented consumers (i.e.,
   agentic consumers spend more with a friend, while communal consumers
   spend less when accompanied by a friend). Finally, the authors test the
   underlying process and document that the interaction of agency communion
   orientation, the presence of a friend, and self-monitoring is reversed
   when the focal context is changed from "spending for the self" to
   "donating to a charity." They conclude with a discussion of implications
   for research and practice.

AB Studies of consumer decision making often begin with the identification
   of a dimension on which options differ, followed by an analysis of the
   factors that influence preferences along that dimension. Building on a
   conceptual analysis of a diverse set of problems, the authors identify a
   class of related consumers choices (e.g., extreme vs. compromise,
   hedonic vs. utilitarian, risky vs. safe) that can all be classified
   according to their levels of self- versus other-expression (or
   [un]conventionality). As shown in four studies, these problem types
   respond similarly to manipulations that trigger or suppress
   self-expression. Specifically, priming self-expression systematically
   increases the share of the self-expressive options across choice
   problems. Conversely, expecting to be evaluated decreases the share of
   the self-expressive options across the various choice dilemmas. In
   addition, priming risk seeking increases only the choice of risky
   gambles but not of other self-expressive options. These findings
   highlight the importance of seeking underlying shared features across
   different consumer choice problems, instead of treating each type in
   isolation.

AB The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer
   preferences are partly driven by the context provided by the set of
   alternatives. Three important context effects are the compromise,
   attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect
   choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to
   incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not
   offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a
   discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a
   context- free partworth utility and a context-dependent component
   capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on
   choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing
   statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects
   are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and
   accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and
   out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context
   effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize
   the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product
   lines.

AB Designing compensation plans with an appropriate level of incentives is
   a key decision faced by managers of direct sales forces. The authors use
   data on individual salesperson compensation contracts to show that firms
   design their pay plans to both discriminatingly select (i.e., attract
   and retain) salespeople and provide them with the right level of
   incentives. Consistent with standard agency arguments, the authors find
   that firms use higher-powered incentives as the importance of agent
   effort increases. At the same time, the authors find strong support for
   the selection role of these contracts. Specifically, agents with greater
   selling ability and lower risk aversion are associated with jobs
   offering higherpowered incentives. Finally, consistent with prior
   findings on incentive contracts, the authors find no support for the
   insurance implication of the typical agency model. The authors rule out
   alternative explanations for this anomalous result and find that the
   selection role of contracts best explains the result in their context.

AB Amid growing concerns about childhood obesity and the associated health
   risks, several countries are considering banning fast-food advertising
   targeting children. In this article, the authors study the effect of
   such a ban in the Canadian province of Quebec. Using household
   expenditure survey data from 1984 to 1992, authors examine whether
   expenditure on fast food is lower in those groups affected by the ban
   than in those that are not. The authors use a triple
   difference-in-difference methodology by appropriately defining treatment
   and control groups and find that the ban's effectiveness is not a result
   of the decrease in fast food expenditures per week but rather of the
   decrease in purchase propensity by 13% per week. Overall, the authors
   estimate that the ban reduced fast-food consumption by US$88 million per
   year. The study suggests that advertising bans can be effective provided
   media markets do not overlap.
