AB A series of three studies examines potential consumer confusion
   associated with the advertising copy used to describe cause-related
   marketing (CRM) campaigns, where money is donated to a charity each time
   a consumer makes a purchase. The first study assesses the relative
   frequency of various copy formats in CRM on the Internet. The authors
   find that the majority of the copy formats (69.9%) are abstract (e.g., a
   portion of the proceeds will be donated), 25.6% are estimable (e.g., X%
   of the profits will be donated), and 4.5% are calculable (e.g., X,76 of
   the price will be donated). Subsequent studies find that (1) slight
   variations in abstract wording in advertising copy leads to considerable
   differences in consumers' estimates of the amount being donated, (2) the
   amount of the donation estimate for each abstract copy format varies
   considerably across individuals, and (3) the donation amount can impact
   choice. Taken together, the three studies demonstrate that the vast
   majority of advertising copy used to describe CRM donations is abstract,
   that different but legally equivalent abstract copy formats result in
   large differences in mean perceived donation level, and that these
   donation levels can impact consumer choice. Implications for advertising
   strategy and public policy are discussed.

AB It is frequently assumed by marketing practitioners that ad
   effectiveness could be substantially improved by publicity surrounding
   advertising campaigns. This assumption was empirically tested by
   examining the effects of Super Bowl advertising campaign information in
   news stories on consumers' memory of the subsequent ads. Synergy between
   two promotional tools-marketing publicity and advertising-was detected.
   Previous advertising research has explained, to a degree, why some ads
   are better recalled from the crowded pool of ads. The present study
   suggests preadvertising publicity about an ad campaign as another
   consideration. Such publicity could be an effective tool in integrated
   marketing communication (IMC).

   communications, very little academic attention has been paid to DTC Web
   sites. This study is a census of 90 complete DTC drug Web sites. Results
   showed that DTC sites used advertising appeals similar to those found in
   print ads, but they included more monetary incentives and a much higher
   degree of medical and drug information. The data show that these sites
   may be better suited to fulfilling Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

AB Previous research into the use of explicit and implicit conclusions in
   advertising has yet to demonstrate consistent effects for both brand
   attitudes and purchase intentions. While research has examined the role
   of involvement, this study contributes by examining the trait called
   need for cognition (NFC), which addresses a person's propensity to
   engage in effortful thinking. In addition, this study introduces
   argument quality (AQ) as another potential moderator of conclusion
   explicitness effects. In a 2 X 2 experiment of 261 subjects, conclusion
   explicitness (explicit conclusion, implicit conclusion) and AQ (strong,
   weak) are manipulated, with NFC (high NFC, low NFC) as a third measured
   variable. Results indicate more favorable evaluations for implicit
   conclusions over explicit conclusions for high-NFC individuals. Further,
   implicit conclusions result in more favorable brand attitudes and
   purchase intentions when linked with strong AQ for high-NFC individuals.
   The findings confirm that conclusion explicitness does not
   differentially affect the evaluations of low-NFC subjects. Results
   suggest that NFC may represent an important moderating variable for
   future conclusion explicitness research.

AB In cause-related marketing (CRM), a company agrees to donate money to a
   charity each time a consumer engages in a revenue-producing transaction
   with the firm. Since the company benefits first before any obligation to
   donate is accrued, consumers might perceive this practice to be less
   altruistic than an unconditional donation to a cause. If so, CRM could
   backfire, injuring corporate image. This study investigated the effects
   of type of donation (conditional or not conditional upon corporate
   revenue) and reputation of the firm making the donation (firms described
   as scrupulous, average, or irresponsible in the discharge of their
   social responsibility) on consumer regard for the firm; perceived
   mercenary intent of the firm; and whether the social performance of the
   company is consistent with "good" management. Consumer responses were
   predicted based on the contrast effect and attribution theory. Results
   suggest that irresponsible firms increased their favor with consumers by
   pursuing either type of donation. The average firm enhanced its image by
   pursuing an unconditional donation, but a conditional donation did not
   damage firm image. Perception of the scrupulous firm was little changed
   after unconditional donation, but a scrupulous firm suffered a loss of
   favor by pursuing CRM. It is concluded that the average firm does not
   risk a loss of public goodwill when using CRM.

AB Animated advertisements on the Web come in a variety of shapes, sizes,
   and colors; they also animate at different speeds. Although recent
   studies have shown animated ads to be more effective than still ads, the
   role played by the rate of motion in animated ads has been neglected. An
   experiment was designed to address this issue by focusing specifically
   on the physiological and psychological effects of animation speeds in
   Web ads. Hypotheses derived from motion effects, excitation transfer,
   limited capacity, and vividness effects theories were tested via a
   mixed-design experiment wherein participants (N = 47) were exposed to
   both slow-paced and fast-paced animated ads in one of two sequences
   (fast then slow, or slow then fast). Arousal was monitored during
   reception, while memory, conation, and impression formation were
   measured via a postexposure paper-and-pencil questionnaire. Results
   indicate that animation speed is a psychologically significant variable.
   Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Provocative advertising is characterized by a deliberate attempt to gain

   individuals to a provocative appeal for a cause as opposed to a
   provocative advertisement for a standard consumer product, using mild
   erotica as the element of provocative imagery. An experiment using 391
   adult subjects was conducted, and two analyses were performed. The first
   examined the effect of stimulus type (mildly erotic/nonerotic) by
   product category (cause appeal/consumer product) on attitude to the ad.
   The second examined the effect of stimulus type (mildly
   erotic/nonerotic) by cause (AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency
   syndrome]/SIDS [sudden infant death syndrome]) on corporate image. Both
   analyses also included gender as a third independent variable. The
   results suggest that people prefer mildly erotic ads generally, that an
   organization using mild erotica in appeals for a cause will be viewed
   more favorably where the erotica is congruent with the cause, and that
   women may be more responsive to mild erotica in cause appeals than are
   men.

   with advertising practitioners at all levels in 29 agencies in eight
   cities. Many of our informants reported few ethical concerns in their
   own work or in advertising in general. They exhibited "moral myopia," a
   distortion of moral vision that prevents moral issues from coming into
   focus, and "moral muteness," meaning that they rarely talk about ethical
   issues. We find that the reasons for moral muteness and moral myopia are
   categorizable. There were, however, "seeing/talking" advertising
   practitioners who demonstrated "moral imagination" when responding to
   ethical problems. We compare the manner in which the ethically sensitive
   practitioners contemplate and respond to ethical issues with those
   characterized as having moral muteness and moral myopia. We also find
   that the agency context in which advertising practitioners work is
   important in terms of ethical sensitivity. We discuss implications for

   evolved over time, a substantial portion of the research concerning
   characters has emerged during this past decade. Yet there exists a
   research gap concerning the impact of specific spokes-character features
   on brand-related outcomes. In this study, we address this gap and extend
   this stream of literature with the first empirical examination of the
   relationship between specific spokes-character features and brand
   attitude. Based on the tested moderated mediation model, our results
   show that spokes-character trust is an important mediator of the effects
   of spokes-character features on brand attitude. The model also indicates
   that brand experience significantly moderates the effect of
   spokes-character trust on brand attitude. Thus, spokes-character
   features result in more favorable brand attitudes for consumers with
   less brand experience, whereas spokes-character features have little
   effect on brand attitudes for consumers with more experience with the
   brand.

   this problem has evolved in the advertising literature. In the present
   study, Rosenthal and Rosnow's theorizing about demand artifacts is used
   to identify two key mediators of demand bias in the laboratory setting:
   receptivity and motivation. A pilot study and two experiments are
   reported in operationalizing these mediators and in testing their
   utility in the detection of demand bias. The empirical findings support
   Rosenthal and Rosnow's theorizing about the two mediators of demand
   bias, suggesting that both must be explicitly considered for controlling
   the problem. Implications for applying appropriate postexperimental
   inquiries in advertising research are discussed.

AB Objective: To determine patients' smoking status after the diagnosis and
   treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and to
   identify factors associated with smoking cessation.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey study conducted over a 2-year period.
   Setting: Head and neck surgery clinic of an academic tertiary care
   hospital.
   Methods: Two hundred thirteen consecutive patients diagnosed with SCCHN
   were interviewed to ascertain patients' smoking status and the incidence
   of smoking cessation. Information on demographics, tobacco and alcohol
   history, disease characteristics, and treatment modality was also
   collected.
   Main Outcome Measures: The rate of smoking cessation was evaluated, in
   which smoking cessation is defined as the use of no cigarettes at least
   1 month prior to the interview. Possible predictors of smoking cessation
   were evaluated.
   Results: One hundred twenty-five patients were found to be smoking at
   the time of diagnosis. Among these patients, 53.6% stopped smoking after
   diagnosis or during treatment. In the univariate analyses, turnout site
   (p =.01), concurrent alcohol use (p =.03), and number of attempts to
   quit pre- (p =.03) and postdiagnosis (p =.001) were found to be highly
   predictive of patient smoking cessation. Multivariable modelling showed
   that gender, turnout site, and number of attempts to quit smoking were
   significantly and independently related to smoking cessation.
   Conclusions: Although smoking cessation would be presumed to be high
   after cancer diagnosis, this study has identified patient subgroups in
   which postdiagnosis smoking cessation intervention programs need to be
   made more effective.

AB The use of animated spokes-characters in advertising to young children
   is a strategic communication tactic frequently examined, debated, and
   criticized by parents, researchers, child advocates, and government
   officials. Although public opinion suggests that spokes-characters
   influence young children's product desires, academic research has
   generally failed to demonstrate this effect. The present study extends
   previous studies examining spokes-character influence on children, and
   specifically examines the effects of character action and voice. Results
   of two studies support previous findings that although character action
   and voice may influence a young child's attention to an ad, character,
   and product recognition, and even a positive attitude toward the
   product, the relation between spokes-characters and a child's
   preference, intention, and choice of a product is uncertain.

   nostalgia-an individual's yearning for an idealized past-has received
   surprisingly little academic research attention in the advertising
   literature. The current study was designed to address this void by
   exploring thoughts and attitudinal responses of consumers exposed to
   nostalgic (versus non-nostalgic) advertisements. The results of our
   investigation suggest that nostalgic cues in advertising do indeed
   influence the type of thoughts consumers have during ad exposure, and
   that these thought processes appear to have an influence on attitudes
   toward the advertisement and advertised brand. Theoretical and practical
   implications of the findings are discussed.

   the cultural meanings and economic, symbolic, and aesthetic values
   associated with these marketing materials evolved, we use group level
   theories, the sociological framework of collective memory, and rubbish
   theory from social anthropology. These promotional materials were
   transformed from acceptable mass-produced commercial advertisements, to
   despicable representations of a group of people that were "hidden" or
   destroyed, to highly desirable collectibles commanding top dollar on the
   secondary market. Collective memories as recorded in the print press for
   three decades are examined to illustrate attitudinal and value shifts

AB An implicit assumption in advertising content analysis, as well as in
   studies of advertiser intent, is that what an ad says, or what its
   creator intends for it to convey, is also what it means to consumers.
   The presence of global images and foreign appeals in advertising is thus
   often incorrectly taken as evidence that local culture is becoming
   globalized, and that consumer values are changing accordingly. Using a
   reader-response approach to analyze upscale Chinese consumers'
   understandings of global and local television and print advertising, we
   find that this is not the case. Instead, we find two dialectic reactions
   by Chinese consumers. One side is largely driven by the desire for
   global cosmopolitanism and status goods for the sake of mianzi (prestige
   face), whereas the other side is motivated by a more nationalistic
   desire to invoke Chinese values that are seen as local in origin. These
   opposing advertising meanings and preferences have important
   implications for understanding how international advertising affects
   local cultures.

AB Is advertising more effective when the advertised brand name is revealed
   at the onset of an advertising message or when it is withheld until the
   end of the message? Given the propensity of advertising to withhold the
   brand name, advertisers apparently presume the latter, perhaps because
   they believe that the practice sustains attention to the advertisement.
   The network model of memory and related theories of associative learning
   imply superior advertising effectiveness when the brand name is
   presented at the beginning of an advertisement. An experiment was
   conducted to test this proposition. Several award-winning television
   advertisements were remastered to reveal the brand name either at the
   beginning or at the end of the spot. The results support the prediction
   that advertising is more effective when the brand name appears at the
   beginning of the advertisement. Evidence is consistent with the
   conclusion that the effect was caused by strengthening the memory
   association between the brand name and the evaluative implications of
   advertising content, not by any effect of brand-name placement on
   advertising liking, memory for the brand name, or accessibility to
   advertisement content.

AB Recent "paradigm shifting" research in consumer behavior dealing with
   reconstructive memory processes suggests that advertising can exert a
   powerful retroactive effect on how consumers remember their past
   experiences with a product. Building on this stream of research, we have
   executed three studies that incorporate the use of false cues with the
   aim of shedding new light on how post-experience advertising exerts
   influence on recollection. Our first experiment investigates an
   important but yet unexplored issue to advertisers who are perhaps
   reticent about embracing this paradigm: Does the false cue fundamentally
   change how consumers process information? After finding that when the
   false information goes undetected it is processed in a similar manner as
   more "truthful" cues, we use this paradigm to shed light on the
   pictorial versus verbal information debate in advertising. We discuss
   the implications of our findings for those interested in managing
   consumer experience and for advertising researchers seeking indirect
   measures of the influence of advertising.

   Asians have more favorable attitude toward the ad and purchase

   advertising atypical products generate more self-referencing and more
   favorable attitudes toward the model, A(ad), and purchase intentions
   from both Asians and whites.

   marketing information sharing, identifying five major failure points
   that can prevent critical marketing information from reaching creative
   staffers. We identified six specific types of marketing information
   (target audience demographic profile, customer product usage
   information, client's product performance information, competitors'
   product performance information, marketing strategy information, and a
   main selling point supplied by the client) that are considered critical
   to the creation of effective advertising. Using a "knowledge gap"
   analysis in a national survey of creative directors, copywriters, and
   art directors (N = 583), we demonstrate the existence of critical gaps
   where vital information often does not reach creative staffers. The lack
   of significant differences among creatives at different levels within
   agencies for how often information is provided imparted evidence that
   internal agency communication, or agency politics, was not responsible
   for these gaps. We provide specific suggestions for both clients and
   agencies to address these industry-wide knowledge gaps. Our model
   provides a clear road map for future research in this most important
   area.

AB Researchers have investigated a number of different psychological
   constructs that occur as a result of advertising exposure, constructs
   that contribute to the formation of attitudes toward the ad (A(ad)) and
   brand (A(b)). The Dual Mediation Model (DMM) (MacKenzie and Lutz 1989),
   which defines hypothesized interrelationships among these constructs,
   has been well supported in previous research. Other researchers have
   provided evidence that brand. attitudes formed as a result of
   advertising exposure are greater if there is a "match" between the
   cognitive resources required to process the advertising message and
   those made available for processing (Anand and Sternthal 1989). The
   authors suggest that DMM constructs, as well as the links among those
   constructs, are moderated by the match between cognitive resource
   requirements and availability. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the
   nature of these moderating effects will depend on argument quality. The
   results of empirical testing of a modified version of the DMM under
   alternate processing-resource/argument-quality conditions are consistent
   with this theoretical explanation.

AB U.S. and Australian media vehicles are not required to publish or
   broadcast every commercial advertising message submitted. To the
   contrary, owners and managers are free to designate anyone's message as
   unacceptable, and, in fact, they do so, for many reasons. Building on
   the research literature on U.S. business practices, this paper reports
   results of depth interviews with Australian media managers on their
   approaches to deciding what advertising materials to accept or reject.
   The U.S.-based literature provides the basis for a model that
   illustrates the influences on media vehicles' decisions, and Australian
   managers' responses indicate that it readily applies in their country as
   well. Overall, similar to U.S. practices, the single most important
   reason for rejection of advertisements in Australia is a breach of
   taste, although Australian vehicle managers more readily and visibly
   assert deference to the judgment of their more numerous and active trade
   associations.

   advertising effectiveness was investigated. Then, using self-construals
   as individual-level variables in a path model, the study investigated
   their mediating effects on the influence of national culture on the
   effectiveness of comparative advertising. Results indicated not only
   that national culture influences the effectiveness of comparative
   advertising, but also that self-construals have mediating effects on
   attitudes toward the advertisement (Ad) for both indirect comparative
   advertising and noncomparative advertising. Thus, the study goes beyond
   the post hoc explanations that so many studies have used to link
   differences in the effectiveness of advertising to cultural variability,
   and thereby contributes to theory on the mediating effects of
   self-construals. The findings also have implications for advertising
   managerial practices and public policy on the regulation of advertising.
   But perhaps the main contribution of the study is a research design
   using self-construals to demonstrate how individual-level variables can
   mediate the influence of national culture on advertising effectiveness.

   found that these constructs successfully explain why people cognitively,

   efforts of two organization at odds and detect how newspapers' tone
   affect the adopting rates of press releases from each organization.
   Specifically, KT&G(Korea Tomorrow&Global, the number one Korean tobacco
   company) issued a series of press releases which support its marketing
   efforts such as social contributions, media events, boasts of economic
   contributions to central and local governments, and attacks on tobacco
   price increase. On the other hand, the anti-tobacco campaign issued
   press releases on KT&G's image ads and other youth-targeted campaigns as
   well as health problems caused by smoking. Research found that
   newspapers' tone affected the adoption rate of press releases from each
   organization at odds. Kookminilbo, a  church-owned newspaper, mostly
   criticized the KT&G messages and accepted most of Minstery of Health and
   Welfare's press releases. Chosunilbo ignored the KT&G marketing
   messages; however, it paid attention of both health and economic burden
   issues. Hankyereh accepted some issues of KT&G and at the same time it
   attacked KT&G from the perspective of the blue-collar workers and
   farmers with low income. Results apparently showed that the newspapers'
   tone affected the efforts of public relations made by two organization
   at odds. Future study is advised to focus more on the interaction of
   each organization's framing battle in the public opinion court, which
   lacked in this study.

AB In introducing the special issue on international advertising, this
   paper assesses progress made in international research. It begins with
   an examination of the content of international advertising papers
   published in the Journal of Advertising during the past ten years. The
   content of these more recent research articles is then compared to those
   that appeared earlier in the Journal's history. This paper also surveys
   four earlier reviews of the international advertising literature and
   assesses whether issues posed in the reviews have been adequately
   addressed. A new agenda for international advertising researchers is
   offered, consisting of eight research questions and some admonitions
   relating to data collection and collaboration among researchers. The
   contributions of papers in this issue are then detailed in the context
   of the proposed research agenda.

AB This paper offers a new methodological framework to guide researchers
   attempting to quantitatively assess how a pluralistic audience perceives
   a standardized television advertisement. Rasch (1960) measurement theory
   is introduced as an alternative to the more commonly employed multigroup
   confirmatory factor analysis (CIA) approach to assessing cross-cultural
   scalar equivalence. By analyzing a multicultural data set, we are able
   to make various inferences concerning the scalar equivalence of
   Schlinger's confusion scale. The methodology reveals the limits of the
   scale, which in all probability would not have been detected using
   traditional approaches. For researchers attempting to develop new
   scales, or even to refine existing scales, strict adherence to
   established guidelines of item generation together with the application
   of the proposed methodology should ensure better results for both
   theorists and practitioners.

AB This study investigates the moderating roles of self-construal and need
   for cognition (NFC) on brand attitudes and purchase intentions in
   response to comparative versus noncomparative advertising. To enhance
   reliability and external validity, the study is conducted in two
   culturally and economically distinct countries, Thailand and the United
   States. Independent self-construal exerts a moderating effect in both
   countries. Furthermore, as expected, this effect is observed for
   consumers with low but not high NFC. Unexpectedly, however, for low-NFC
   consumers, comparative ads are more persuasive among those with low
   rather than high independent self-construal. Heightened situational
   involvement, evoked by incongruity between self-construal and ad message
   structure, appears to be the psychological mediator underlying this
   effect.

   China's upscale and status-seeking consumers and the cost/benefits of so
   doing. In this study, we analyzed syndicated secondary data involving
   48,000 respondents in 15 cities in China, and compared the extent to
   which television, newspapers, and general and special interest magazines
   reach particular consumer segments effectively. The study then used a
   second database containing cost information on media vehicles, and
   compared their efficiency in reaching segments of upscale/status-seeking
   consumers in China. As hypothesized, and in accord with findings in
   developed economies, we found that magazines have the highest
   targetability among the three most popular mass media. Among special
   interest magazines, fashion magazines are significantly more costly to
   advertise in, while they reach the same income segments as travel and
   business magazines. The implications of these findings on advertising
   research and practices are discussed.

   strategies for goods cannot be automatically applied to services. Yet
   services are the fastest-growing segment of the expanding global market,
   and to compete effectively across cultural boundaries, these businesses
   need to understand appropriate marketing and advertising strategies
   designed especially for services. This paper evaluates the existing
   literature on international services advertising (ISA) to provide an

   influence product judgments even when consumers do not intend to base
   their judgments on COO. Participants learned the attributes of a set of
   brands from advertisements, and categorized each brand as good or bad by
   using a simple attribute rule. Results indicate that the accuracy of
   participants' categorization decisions was influenced by their
   intentional use of the attribute rule and the country stereotypes that
   were activated automatically by COO cues presented during
   categorization. This study also employed the process dissociation
   procedure to generate quantitative estimates of the two sources of
   influence. The results provide converging evidence that COO effects
   occurred automatically and contributed to product evaluations without
   participants' intention or control.

   commercials in different cultural contexts. This study compared the
   visuals of U.S. and Chinese television commercials within the framework
   of high-context versus low-context cultures and individualistic versus
   collectivistic societies. The authors examined how visuals manifested
   themselves in two sets of variables designed especially for this study:
   storytelling and cinematography, as well as culture indicators. Results
   showed that traditional storytelling techniques such as story line and
   comparison and identification are better vehicles for cultural
   manifestations than cinematographic variables such as subjective camera,
   direct address, and pacing. Results on cultural indicators were mixed,
   however, indicating that values manifested in visuals might not be as
   simple as first believed.

AB Indirect persuasion attempts are common in magazine advertisements.
   Although the use of an indirect claim presumably offers some advantage
   to an advertiser, as yet, little is known about how consumers process
   different types of indirect claims. We develop the proposition that when
   consumers are presented with an indirect metaphorical claim, they become
   more receptive to multiple positive inferences about the advertised
   brand. In addition, when the indirect metaphorical claim takes the form
   of a picture, consumers are more likely to spontaneously generate such
   positive inferences at the time of ad exposure. These ideas are
   supported in an experiment using response latency data. Because many of
   the inferences examined in this study could be considered misleading if
   claimed directly, the paper concludes with a discussion of the public
   policy implications of the findings.

   within one ad. Ibis paper investigates the consequences of
   code-switching for ad persuasiveness. The results of two studies suggest
   that code-switching results in the activation of associations relevant
   to the language the slogan switches to. Those associations influence the
   valence of consumers' elaboration such that if the language a slogan
   switches to possesses positive (negative) associations, consumers engage
   in positive (negative) elaboration, resulting in higher (lower)
   evaluations. Attitudinal and contextual variables interact with the
   effect of code-switching on ad responses.

   that consumers who have high information motivations are more likely to
   engage in human-message interaction on a Web site, whereas social
   interaction motivations are more strongly related to human-human
   interaction. Both human-message and human-human interactions had a
   positive effect on attitude toward the site, which leads to positive
   attitude toward the brand and purchase intention.

   and banner color-text color contrast on measures of attention (i.e.,
   recall and recognition) and attitudes toward the ad and the Web site.
   Experiment I results indicate that incongruity has a more favorable
   effect on recall and recognition, whereas congruity has more favorable
   effects on attitudes. Experiment 2 results suggest that when ads
   generate sufficient attention to gain recall or recognition, moderate
   congruity offers the most favorable attitudes toward the ad. Managerial
   implications for the use of these ad execution cues are discussed and
   future research avenues are proposed.

AB Creativity is an important component of advertising. This research
   examines the potential effectiveness of creative advertising in
   enhancing recall, brand attitude, and purchase intent. Our basic
   methodology compares a set of randomly selected award-winning
   commercials (Communication Arts) with a random sample of control
   commercials. The commercials were embedded in television programs and
   subjects for a naturalistic viewing experience. Studies 1 and 2 had
   aided and unaided brand and execution recall as dependent variables. For
   Study 3, brand attitude and purchase intent were the dependent variables
   of interest. Results indicated that creative commercials facilitate
   unaided recall, but that creativity did not enhance aided recall,
   purchase intent, or brand and advertisement attitude. The basic
   advantage of creative advertising in enhancing unaided recall was found
   to persist over a one-week delay.

   creative media choice (i.e., creatively choosing a medium to implicitly
   communicate the message). In an experiment, ads were placed in a
   creative media choice setting and compared with identical ads in a
   traditional medium. Employing theories on media-source effects and on
   cognitive priming and assimilation, it is hypothesized that the creative
   media choice enhances the perception of target brand associations and
   increases ad credibility and ad and brand attitudes. The results support
   the hypotheses. The effects of creative media choice are moderated by
   congruence, and additional analyses suggest that they may be mediated by

   profitability, brand equity, and shareholder value. This perennial
   problem is perhaps even more salient today, as organizations
   increasingly begin to recognize the value of intangible assets and
   question the extent to which marketing should be viewed as an investment
   (as opposed to an expense). This paper introduces the notion of brand
   capability within a tangible-intangible asset valuation framework.
   Specifically, a model is developed to assess the impact of integrated
   marketing communication on brand equity by leveraging
   capability-enhancing marketing expenses to economic values through the
   use of specific combinations of expense-leveraged value indices.

   from the combination of communications tools used. The present study is
   designed to fill a gap in the marketing literature by using a controlled
   experimental design to assess and compare the individual and combined
   influences of two IMC tools-publicity and advertising--on attitude
   toward the ad (A(ad)) and attitude toward the brand (A(b)). The study
   also looks for synergies from the use of multiple media (radio and
   print). Findings show that the combined effects of these IMC tools on
   A(ad) and A(b) are not identical, and that there are complex
   interactions between media, brand familiarity, and the valence of news
   stories.

   deliberately decouple outward images from internal practices, walking a

AB This study examines the influence of product placements in television
   serial comedies on consumer attitudes toward the products. Proposing a
   "Balance Model of Sitcom Product Placement Effects," the study
   integrates genre theory to analyze character-product associations in
   sitcoms, parasocial theory to consider consumer-character referential
   relations, and balance theory to address the main research issue of the
   way that characters' relations to placed products and consumers'
   relations to the characters affect consumers' attitudes to the products.
   The model is based on balance theory, in which attitude alignment is the
   explanation for links between a triad composed of the consumer, the
   sitcom character, and the placed product. The influence of two
   consumer-character variables (attitude and parasocial attachment) and
   two character-product variables (valence and strength of association)
   are tested in a real-world situation. The methodology uses real
   televised sitcoms as stimuli, real viewers as respondents, and a
   real-time on-line survey to measure the relationship among the
   variables. Study findings support the predictions that consumers align
   their attitudes toward products with the characters' attitudes to
   products and that this process is driven by the consumers' attachment to
   the characters.

   reported here use an affectively driven advertising context (i.e.,
   television commercials void of product-relevant information cues) to
   demonstrate (1) that positive and negative forms of affect operate
   differently, and (2) that their direct and indirect effects on attitude
   are influenced by brand familiarity. Cognition played a less dominant
   role in the attitude formation process for an unknown brand compared to
   situations in which consumers held preexisting impressions (i.e., for
   welt-known brands). A means-end model approach is used to link concrete
   and abstract forms of cognition (i.e., brand beliefs) and attitude.

   advertising, two content analyses of ads appearing in a diverse set of

   to unearth information on the frequency with which African-American men
   are portrayed in print advertising; the kinds of products/product
   categories we see advertised by African-American men in ads in these
   magazines; and the roles and occupational status, as well as the
   settings and interactions, in which they were depicted. Study I examined
   portrayals in three new hip-hop magazines (i.e., The Source, Vibe, and
   XXL). Results from the first study indicate that representation of
   African-American men in ads was high, but they were used mainly in ads
   for clothes, shoes, and accessories. They were likely to be shown in
   major roles in these ads, and by themselves. Nonoccupational roles and
   limited portrayals in business or work-related settings were dominant,
   however. Study 2, which formed a basis for comparison, examined
   portrayals in two targeted magazines (i.e., Ebony and Essence) and two
   mainstream magazines (GQ and SPIN). Study 2 found a lower level of
   representation of African-American men in ads in the magazines used in
   this study, but when they were in ads, they were likely to be in major
   roles. There was greater diversity in product categories advertised, but
   overall, the types of interactions, the portrayals in nonoccupational
   roles, and the limited portrayals in business and work-related settings
   mirrored those of Study 1. The present study relates the findings to
   theoretical notions posited by both social learning and cultivation
   theories. Limitations of the studies are addressed and avenues for
   future research are proposed.

AB This study builds on prior work in advertising by investigating issues
   associated with the dimensional representation of memory for print
   advertisements and the antecedent factors that relate to those
   dimensions. Of particular interest to this research are answers to
   questions associated with whether memory for print ads is unidimensional
   or multidimensional, as assessed by aided recall and recognition
   methods, with the nature of the antecedent factors of ad characteristics
   and subjective reactions, and with how the antecedents relate to memory.
   The study identified two dimensions of ad-based antecedents to memory,
   labeled cognitive and affective aspects, and two dimensions of memory,
   labeled recall and recognition. It was found that recall is influenced
   by cognitive, and to a lesser extent, by affective factors, whereas
   recognition is primarily influenced by affective factors. This research
   provides support for the potential use of stimulus-related factors in
   conjunction with, or as surrogates of, memory-based measures of
   effectiveness.

AB Organizations trying to attract job applicants face a trade-off in the
   design of their recruiting advertisements. The use of general ads that
   include limited job attribute specificity has the potential to appeal to
   a wide array of job applicants and to increase the size of the applicant
   pool. However, such advertisements may also increase the number of
   unqualified or inappropriate applicants pursuing employment, and may be
   unappealing to job candidates who are highly focused in their job search
   strategies. Using a three-factor experimental design, two studies
   examine the impact of providing specific/general information on three
   position facets (i.e., the company, the job itself, and the work
   context) on a series of dependent variables. Results suggest that all
   three facets of message specificity impact, to varying degrees,
   individuals' opinions about the ad, perceived appropriateness of the
   job, attitudes toward the ad and company, as well as intentions to
   complete the job application process.

AB The present research addresses how framing may influence the

   adolescents. The research applies regulatory focus theory to explore the
   effectiveness of message framing in antismoking advertisements. The
   Finding reveals that adolescents demonstrate (1) lower intentions to
   smoke, (2) lower perceived pharmacological benefits of smoking, and (3)
   lower perceived psychological benefits of smoking when the fit between
   the regulatory goal and the antismoking message frame is congruent
   (versus incongruent). Therefore, antismoking messages for adolescents
   with a promotion focus should emphasize promotion-related merits of
   abstaining from smoking, whereas antismoking messages for adolescents
   with a prevention focus should emphasize prevention-related merits of
   abstaining from smoking.

   generally more accepting of advertising claims than men. However, men
   and women had decidedly different reactions to the use of hedges (e.g.,
   "may," "probably," "possibly") and pledges (e.g., "definitely,"
   "undoubtedly," "absolutely") in advertising claims. Women responded
   negatively to both types of probability markers, such that mean
   acceptance of the focal claim shifted downward when compared with
   conditions in which no marker was used. On the other hand, hedges
   decreased the variance of claim acceptance among men without affecting
   the mean response, and pledges had little or no effect on the mean or
   variance among men. These results are discussed in terms of sex
   differences in elaboration thresholds and the multiple roles postulate
   of the elaboration likelihood model (ELM).

AB This paper examines the differential effects of celebrity and expert
   endorsements on consumer risk perceptions via three studies. Using
   source model theories, it is hypothesized that for high
   technology-oriented products there will be stronger effects of expert
   endorsers than celebrity endorsers in reducing consumer risk
   perceptions. In addition, for high technology-oriented products, there
   is likely to be an interaction effect between endorser type and consumer
   knowledge on respondents' risk perceptions. Such an interaction effect
   is likely to be absent for products with a low technology orientation.
   These hypotheses are supported by the first two studies. The third study
   examines the underlying theoretical processes of internalization versus
   identification and shows that the stronger effects of expert (versus
   celebrity) endorsers for high technology-oriented products is somewhat
   neutralized for certain types of perceived risks when there is high
   congruency between the celebrity endorser and the product.

AB This study investigates whether metaphors in advertising have a
   synergistic or compensatory effect on brand personality perceptions of
   utilitarian and symbolic products. The effects of metaphoric headlines
   versus pictures are also compared. In general, brands using metaphors in
   ads were perceived to be more sophisticated and exciting, but less
   sincere and competent than those using literal headlines or pictures. Ad
   attitudes, brand attitudes, and purchase intention were also enhanced
   with metaphoric advertising. In addition, compared with utilitarian
   products, symbolic products were perceived to be more sophisticated and
   exciting, but less sincere and competent. It is interesting to note that
   when metaphors were used for utilitarian products, perceptions of
   sophistication and excitement were enhanced, whereas sincerity was
   diluted. The results suggest that metaphors can be strategically used to
   influence brand personality perceptions, particularly for utilitarian
   products. Theoretical and managerial implications, as well as directions
   for future research, conclude this paper.

   are evaluated. Specifically, we examine the influence of perceived home
   page complexity on communication effectiveness, as measured by attention
   to the home page, attitude toward the home page, attitude toward the
   company, and purchase intent. Qualitative research is used to identify
   important factors that appear to influence perceptions of home page
   complexity, including home page length, number of graphics, number of
   links, amount of text, and use of animation. A pretest experiment
   further aided in the selection of appropriate factors and factor levels
   to manipulate in a subsequent, main experiment. The findings in the main
   experiment suggest that consumers respond more favorably toward home
   pages that fall in a moderate range of perceived complexity.

AB Historically, women have had low participation in technological fields,
   and this has been reflected through negative portrayals of women in
   technology advertisements. As producers of e-commerce, women have made
   significant advances, in many cases approaching and even exceeding men.
   Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine whether e-commerce
   advertisements continue to reflect negative stereotypical sex
   differences in relation to technology. Understanding these patterns is
   critical, as negative portrayals may propagate harmful stereotypes to
   men and women; in addition, women exposed to these ads may view them
   disapprovingly and develop negative attitudes toward the brands. To
   examine this, a content analysis of e-commerce ads in magazines was
   conducted. Results illustrate that, compared to past studies, ads for
   e-commerce products and services portray women more equitably.

   less pronounced in more developed regions in China. Compared with their

   believe that DTC advertising exerts its greatest influence on "them,"
   "not me"; (2) older consumers' third-person perceptions of DTC ad
   effects are multidimensional, and different effect dimensions show
   different magnitudes of the third-person effect; and (3) the
   third-person effect in DTC advertising is influenced by

AB This paper examines the influence of marketers on the creativity of
   their advertising agency. There are three main ways in which marketers
   affect the creativity of their agency: (1) setting direction, (2)
   resource allocation, and (3) evaluation. These ideas were empirically
   measured in 1,011 advertising campaigns via questionnaires given to
   agency personnel. Strategy has often been a focal point of advertising
   studies, but this research finds that some sources of strategy are
   better than others. Merely having strategy in client briefs has little
   effect on creativity, but the client's willingness to explore new
   strategic ideas with the agency does have a substantial impact. In
   general, better-resourced agencies do more creative work, and a key
   resource is access to top managers. However, sometimes, top-management
   involvement may lead to counterproductive effects on creativity because
   of the fear this induces within agencies. Sophisticated, high-ranking
   clients appear to send a "chilling" effect throughout the agency, thus
   dampening creative potential. Although this study is based on
   advertising agency responses rather than advertising client responses,
   it provides insight into the complicated notion of agency accountability
   for campaign creativity. In many cases, marketers seeking accountability
   for their campaign creativity need look no farther than themselves.

AB In recent years, affinity-marketing strategy has been widely used by
   for-profit organizations, particularly financial institutions, to
   leverage the goodwill and endorsement of affinity groups to promote
   their service offerings to group members. However, relatively little
   attention has been paid to the underlying factors driving the
   effectiveness of endorsement as it affects the process by which members
   make choices. Applying affinity credit cards as the research context,
   this study examines whether the addition of endorsement effects (i.e.,
   affect transfer effect, perceived quality effect, and cause-related
   effect) of a positively valued affinity group would have any impact on
   its members' choice processes as depicted in the traditional
   hierarchy-of-effects model. The results of this empirical study confirm
   all the hypotheses, with the exception of affect transfer.

AB This study comprehensively reviews the literature on product placements
   to develop an integrative conceptual model that captures how such
   messages generate audience outcomes. The model depicts four components:
   execution/stimulus factors (e.g., program type, execution flexibility,
   opportunity to process, placement modality, placement priming);
   individual-specific factors (e.g., brand familiarity, judgment of
   placement fit, attitudes toward placements, involvement/connectedness
   with program); processing depth (degree of conscious processing); and
   message outcomes that reflect placement effectiveness. The execution and
   individual factors influence processing depth (portrayed as a high-low
   continuum), which in turn impacts message outcomes. The outcomes are
   organized around the hierarchy-of-effects model into three broad
   categories: cognition (e.g., memory-related measures such as recognition
   and recall); affect (e.g., attitudes); and conation (e.g., purchase
   intention, purchase behavior). This study integrates potential main and
   interaction effects among model variables to advance a series of
   theoretical propositions. It also offers an extensive research agenda of
   conceptual and empirical issues that future work can address.

AB By absorbing advanced knowledge and business practices from their
   overseas partners, international joint ventures (IJVs) have helped the
   development of many aspects of Chinese business. Do IJVs in China use
   more sophisticated advertising budgeting methods than their local
   counterparts? To test this, a construct was devised to measure budgetary
   sophistication, taking into account the tendency of firms to use
   multiple methods. Then, personal interviews were conducted with over 200
   advertisers in China, representing a mix of Chinese state-owned
   enterprises (CSOEs), IJVs, and private companies. Their budgeting
   sophistication scores were then related to demographic, attitudinal, and
   behavioral variables. Results showed that the most common budgeting
   method used was "judgmental" and the most common decision-making process
   was "bottom-up, top-down." On average, firms used more than two
   budgeting methods. IJVs and firms that adjust their budgeting methods
   for different profitability levels used more sophisticated budgeting
   methods. Theoretical implications are discussed, and recommendations are
   made for firms that are working in or considering entering the Chinese
   market.

   roster size, or number of sponsors, on sponsorship effectiveness has
   received scant research attention. Two studies investigate the
   hypothesized moderating effect of roster size on consumer evaluations of
   events. Study 1 shows that compared with one-sponsor conditions, an
   increased number of sponsors dilutes the benefits obtained from
   consumers inferring a goodwill sponsorship motive and enhances attitudes
   under sales motives conditions. Study 2 shows that compared with
   one-sponsor conditions, an additional sponsor reduces the negative
   effect of being associated with stigmatized event beneficiaries. The
   results have implications for sponsorship theory, as well as practical
   implications for event promoters and the firms they seek to attract as

   of the advertised brand. It is interesting to note that advertising was
   able to enhance a brand's perceived trustworthiness even in the absence
   of any overt trust claims. Finally, the effectiveness of simplistic

AB This study investigates the relationship between audience involvement-a
   critical audience state in humorous advertising-and the responses to
   humorous ads. It is hypothesized that the degree to which the audience
   is involved with the ad determines how the ad humor is processed because
   the functions that ad humor plays vary depending on the state of
   audience involvement. An experiment involving 360 participants tested
   the hypotheses. The results support the conceptualization of humor's
   various roles and the moderating function of audience involvement.
   Specifically, for products that are not intrinsically humorous, ad humor
   is more effective in influencing audience attitudes toward both the ad
   and brand when involvement is relatively low rather than high.
   Implications are discussed with regard to formulating advertising
   strategies employing humor as a device.

AB Idiosyncratic thinking may be defined as non-ad or brand-related thought
   that is generated in response to a persuasive communication. Although
   idiosyncratic thoughts are not relevant to message elements, they are
   not necessarily unimportant. Idiosyncratic thinking, whenever it occurs,
   uses cognitive resources that could otherwise be used for generating
   message-related thoughts. In addition, it may interfere with the
   efficiency with which message-related thoughts are incorporated into a
   brand attitude. This paper examines the role of idiosyncratic thinking
   in brand attribute formation by proposing and empirically testing a
   conceptual model depicting the interrelationships among message-related
   thoughts (positive and negative), idiosyncratic thoughts, and attitude
   toward the brand. It also examines the moderating impact of processing
   motivation and message strength on model parameters. The results
   identify the circumstances under which idiosyncratic thinking has a
   favorable versus an unfavorable effect on brand attitude. The
   implications of the findings for advertising practitioners are

   encouraged inferences regarding the ad's manipulative intent.
   Furthermore, these gender differences in processing led to evaluative
   consequences. For men, the greater brand-evaluation involvement brought
   about by comparative appeals led to more favorable ad and brand
   evaluations and greater purchase intentions. For women, the heightened
   perceptions of manipulative intent brought about by comparative appeals
   resulted in negative ad and brand evaluations and reduced purchase
   intentions. Finally, the attribute alignability of competing products

   indicate that IMC is a reality among both services ads and physical

   appeals on consumers' recall of ads, as well as the processes underlying
   such effects. Results of experimentation show that ads are more
   memorable when humor is both strong and related to the message, and this
   interaction is mediated by attention and mood. Stronger humor appeals
   also induce higher recall among individuals with a high "need for humor"
   (NFH).

AB Prior research has found that advertising contextual information can
   affect how consumers evaluate the target ad as well as the brand. This
   study extends the existing research by investigating how the immediate
   and long-term effects of contextual priming on ad attitudes and brand
   evaluations may differ due to the low or high applicability of the
   contexts to the advertised brand. Results in the first experiment
   revealed significant interactions between context and applicability,
   while results from the second experiment indicated that, after a delay,
   context had significant main effects on ad attitude and brand
   evaluations regardless of the applicability levels. These findings have
   both theoretical and managerial implications.

AB Due to high costs, fragmented audiences, and cluttered environments,
   advertisers are finding it increasingly difficult to reach key target
   markets. Thus, many are looking to nontraditional media, such as cinema
   advertising, to maximize the effectiveness of advertising expenditures.
   Given the captive nature of this type of advertising, the authors
   explore factors influencing consumers' attitudes toward the cinema as an
   advertising medium, citing reactance, equity, and
   expectancy-disconfirmation theory as guiding theoretical frameworks.
   Using insights derived from 32 in-depth interviews, the authors develop
   a conceptual model around three main themes that shape attitudes toward
   the medium of cinema advertising and find that reactance, equity, and
   expectancy-disconfirmation theory may prove to be promising foundations
   for understanding attitudes toward cinema advertising.

   rely more on mass media and interpersonal channels for health
   information form more positive attitudes toward DTC advertising. In
   addition, reliance on interpersonal channels for health information
   leads consumers to have more active discussions with their health

   The authors contend that inconsistent findings are, in large part, a
   result of the degree to which respondents are free to determine their
   exposure to commercials. It is hypothesized that in studies where
   exposure is not forced, program involvement has a positive effect on
   commercial recall. This proposition was examined during the broadcast of
   four matches of the 2000 European Soccer Championship (N = 344). Results
   show that viewers who saw a highly involving match recalled commercials
   significantly better than those who saw matches that scored lower on
   program involvement. This effect was, in large part, mediated by
   respondents' exposure to the commercials.

   print advertisements sponsored by a nonprofit (MADD; Mothers Against

   advertisements include employing truth in advertising, implicature,
   actor portrayal disclosure, and deceptive (withholding information)
   advertising. We find that the use of real victims in print ad PSAs
   garners the strongest emotional response, the most positive attitude
   toward the advertisement, the strongest perceived social responsibility,
   and the highest proclivity to donate to the nonprofit. Conversely, the
   use of deceptive advertising is not significantly different from using
   an actor portrayal disclosure as regards perceived social responsibility
   and emotional response to the ad. Our findings suggest that the us of
   real victims in PSAs demonstrates socially responsible behavior by the

AB Although some research into warning labels in advertisements has been
   conducted, little examines the impact of the placement of labels in
   print ads, including consumer responses to warning label placement and
   consumer response effects. Social contract theory suggests that
   consumers may, somewhat paradoxically, put a relatively high value on an
   advertisement of a brand that prominently displays warning information,
   rather than minimizing it. Our research probes the relevance of social
   contract assumptions by reviewing current print advertisement warning
   practices with a content analysis (CA) of consumer magazines and by
   testing the effectiveness of label placement strategies with a
   between-subjects experiment. Validating social contract assumptions, our
   study shows more positive consumer responses for recall, attitude toward
   the ad, attitude toward the brand, purchase intention, and responsible
   advertising when warnings are overtly rather than discreetly placed in
   print ads. Also, we develop a robust, multi-item responsible advertising
   scale. Our paper explores the implications and directions for future
   research from our warning label findings.

   attitudes toward the ad and the brand are more favorable. Such positive
   effect of brand/cause fit, however, only emerges for consumers who are
   high in brand consciousness; for those who are low in brand

AB Marketing communications media technologies have the potential to be
   intrusive and influence consumers' perceptions of marketing
   communication. Aggressive direct marketing (DM) is one communication
   tool that has the potential to lead to consumer concern about
   information privacy. Concerned consumers change their behavior: They
   refuse to buy through risky channels or provide information, thus
   jeopardizing the aim of DM. Responsible DM can prevent such reactions
   and build trust. Typical measures taken and recommended to protect
   consumers from privacy violations are of a regulative rather than a
   market-oriented nature, which is directly opposed to companies'
   profit-maximization aims. We propose a segmentation-based approach for
   responsible DM, based on consumer heterogeneity regarding privacy
   concerns and privacy-related behavior. Using two independent samples
   from South Africa and Australia, we explore consumers' views on privacy
   issues and examine the potential of a market-oriented approach to
   responsible DM.

   commercially relevant artifacts by examining the brand community
   centered on the Apple Newton, a brand that was (along with its
   supporting advertising) discontinued in 1998. The members of the Newton
   community create commercially relevant content to fill the void created
   by the lack of advertising for the brand. These artifacts reflect
   tensions with the marketer, the market, and the community itself, and
   imbue the brand with powerful meaning. These data reveal that consumers
   can be quite skilled in the creation of brand-relevant communications,
   applying the styles, logics, and grammar of advertising. The ascendancy

   are the determinants of advertising inefficiency? In a first step, the
   brand advertising efficiency of 35 car brands in the German car industry
   is measured. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to a multiple
   input-output model of advertising. The analysis reveals that, on
   average, 8% of a brand's advertising budget is wasted. In a second step,
   a model identifying the determinants of brand advertising inefficiency
   is developed and tested empirically. The results indicate that
   advertising efficiency is positively related to purchase event feedback
   and the size of the brand product portfolio. The implications and
   possible areas of future research are discussed.

AB Using a resource-matching perspective, this paper tests the effects of
   including diagnostic product information (DPI) in advertising using a
   Taiwanese sample. It is proposed that the effectiveness of DPI is
   contingent on message combinations and individual differences. This
   study showed that one piece of DPI (consensus) enhanced ad message
   involvement and improved ad and brand evaluations, whereas two pieces of
   DPI (consensus and comparative) did not further enhance involvement or
   improve evaluations. In addition, individual differences in need for
   cognition (NFC) moderated the effectiveness of DPI. DPI led to greater
   ad message involvement and more favorable ad and brand evaluations only
   for participants high in NFC.

   compared to the sequential presentation format in terms of ad-avoidance
   intention, generation of cognitive responses, and brand evaluations.
   Results indicate that the simultaneous presentation format reduces
   ad-zapping intentions. However, the distraction effect of the
   simultaneous viewing of the program leads to a reduction of the dominant
   cognitive response generated by the advertising message. Compared to
   sequential presentation, simultaneous presentation of advertising and
   programming reduces support arguments and brand evaluations for
   relatively strong messages, but not for relatively weak messages.

AB Is interactivity always beneficial? Not always. Rather, the effects of
   interactivity on consumers' attitudes toward the site (A(st)) may not be
   a context-free outcome, but instead may change across the product
   categories to which consumers have different "expected interactivity"
   (EI). This study attempts to show how the interactivity-attitude
   relationship is moderated by consumers' varying El levels. By employing
   a 3 (high/medium/low Web site interactivity) x 2 (high/low product
   category expectation) between-subjects factorial experiment, two
   competing hypotheses of how El works were tested: (1) whether El could
   reverse the direction of the interactivity-attitude relationship
   (direction-effects hypothesis), or (2) whether El would change only the
   magnitude of the effects of interactivity on A(st) without changing its
   direction (magnitude-effects hypothesis). The experimental results
   supported the direction-effects hypothesis rather than the
   magnitude-effects hypothesis. Implications for further research and
   advertising practice are discussed.

AB Direct-to-consumer (DTC) branded drug Web sites inform consumers of
   certain specific facts, including risk information, about drugs.
   Prominently displayed risk disclosures can reduce the potentially
   misleading aspects of advertising information and encourage a deeper
   level of consumer processing. Although previous studies of DTC Web sites
   have examined the presence and absence of risk information, no research
   to date has evaluated the placement of risk information relative to
   benefit information on DTC Web sites or whether risk information is
   presented consistently in the DTC category. Bettman, Payne, and Staelin
   (1986) suggested that "the range information presented in different
   formats can result in different decisions" (p. 2). Schema theory can
   guide Web site development, as it suggests that consistency of
   information presentation in an on-line environment can help consumers
   maximize their ability to utilize information at the site. In addition,
   current regulatory practices (Food and Drug Administration [FDA]
   guidelines for fair balance in DTC ads, the Federal Trade Commission
   [FTC] "clear and conspicuous" standards for television and Web site
   disclaimers) suggest that consistency in information presentation can
   also help consumers comprehend information. This study, then, examines
   whether risk information presentation is consistent across DTC Web
   sites, and serves as a first step in the process of understanding what
   guidance might be necessary at DTC Web sites.

AB This study explored the influence of the presumed influence model in the
   context of DTC (direct-to-consumer) advertising. A survey of 404
   physicians studied presumed effects of DTC advertising on patients and
   whether the presumed effects influenced physicians' support for
   regulation and response to patient requests. Results partially supported
   the proposed model. Physicians perceived the highest degree of DTC
   advertising influence on patients' inquiries with their doctors and
   requests for advertised drugs and the lowest degree for beneficial
   influence of DTC ads. Physicians tend to support government regulation
   of DTC advertising, and their support is consistent across different
   demographic and perceptual variables. While physicians' responses to
   patients' requests for an advertised drug is mixed, greater presumed
   detrimental effects predicted refusal of patient requests, even after
   controlling for physicians' demographic and attitudinal characteristics.
   However, acceptance of patients' requests and recommendation of other
   drugs are found to be unrelated to presumed DTC advertising influence.
   The results are discussed in relation to existing theoretical. work and
   DTC advertising literature. Future research recommendations are also
   provided.

   provide little or no product-usage data for audience members. The
   proposed method overlays product-media selectivity indices from sources

AB Arguably, the majority of cause-related marketing (CRM) campaigns

   are highly involved with causes a strong reason to participate. Their
   involvement represents a significant motivating factor. However, a
   multitude of CRM campaigns competing for the limited number of socially
   conscious consumers and the emergence of new generations that are
   reportedly less socially conscious suggests that firms and their
   nonprofit partners should consider additional target-market
   opportunities. In two experiments, we assess the role of donation
   proximity and message framing on campaign attitudes and participation
   intentions of less-involved consumers. Findings reveal that local
   donations and positive message framing serve as effective message cues
   to produce favorable CRM outcomes among this market segment that
   strategists consider fertile ground. Additional findings and
   implications for creating and communicating CRM campaigns are discussed.

AB This study was designed to investigate the effects of dual-task
   processing on consumers' responses to high-versus low-imagery radio
   advertisements. In a repeated-measures experimental design, participants
   listened to six high- and six low-imagery radio spots while
   simultaneously performing a visual-processing task (viewing a series of
   pictures unrelated to the ads or viewing a blank/black screen).
   Consistent with theoretical expectations, the high-imagery radio
   advertisements performed better than the low-imagery ads on measures of
   advertising involvement, attitude toward the ad, brand attitude, and
   purchase intention. The study found that high-imagery radio ads are
   universally superior, but suffer more when there is competition for
   cognitive resources. When a visual-processing task (viewing pictures)
   was introduced, consumers' responses became generally less favorable.
   The pattern of responses, however, varied across ad types and processing
   conditions. In particular, the detrimental effect of introducing a
   picture-viewing task was more pronounced for high-imagery ads than for
   low-imagery ads, as well as on measures of ad-related response
   (advertising involvement and attitude toward the ad). No such moderating
   effect was observed for brand-related responses (brand attitude and
   purchase intention). Theoretical and practical implications of these
   results are discussed.

   cases, the authors identify four characteristics of proactivity:
   initiative taken by the agency, horizon expansion, strategic reflection,
   and signaling. Proactivity was also found to be a driver of client
   satisfaction, which thereby motivated clients to renew services, whereas
   a reactive stance merely reduced dissatisfaction. To enhance their

AB This study explores the conditions under which product placement in an
   on-line game will get noticed and be remembered from a perspective of
   the limited-capacity model of attention. Results show that the location
   of brand messages in the game (referred to here as proximity), game
   involvement, and prior game-playing experience interact to influence
   brand memory. Although experienced players in the moderate-involvement
   condition recognize focal brands better than the peripheral brands, the
   recognition superiority of the focal brands over the peripheral brands
   disappears when experienced players' involvement is high. The
   interaction between proximity and game involvement does not emerge for
   inexperienced players, however. Findings also demonstrate that the
   degree of congruity between the product category of a brand and game
   content influences brand memory such that highly incongruent brands are
   better recalled than either moderately incongruent brands or highly
   congruent brands. Implications for researchers are also discussed.

   responses indicated that their body was reflexively preparing to move

   advertising messages (WAM), few marketing researchers have addressed
   this advertising innovation. Media uses and gratifications theory is
   used to study consumers' perceptions of WAM. Data from in-depth
   interviews indicate that usage is motivated by process, socialization,
   and content needs. Informants perceived WAM as a way to stay "in the
   know," build relationships with companies, and feel part of an
   "in-group." Few would pay for WAM, however, and most would discontinue
   usage if companies sent unsolicited messages. We theorize about two
   potential barriers to adoption: social costs and monetary costs. Our
   interpretations of these behaviors are enfolded with theoretical and

AB Harlow Gale taught psychology at the University of Minnesota from 1895
   to 1903 and supervised one of the first laboratories in experimental
   psychology in the United States. The Gale archival files at the
   University of Minnesota and the citations of scholars who followed
   reveal the depth of Gale's innovativeness and influence as the founder
   of the psychology of advertising. He was the first to undertake
   experimental studies on the effects of advertising and established
   concepts and methods that are still followed today. Gale's
   accomplishments in theory and methods are numerous. They precede
   associational learning models of brand equity, rank order measurement,
   advertising involvement, attitude toward the ad, and low-involvement
   learning.

AB Authenticity is a cornerstone of contemporary marketing. Yet how do
   firms develop brand positions based on authenticity when marketing, and
   in particular, advertising, is believed to be antithetical to such
   positioning? We examine how consumers assess the claims of Trappist and
   Abbey beer brands. We identify three forms of authenticity: pure
   (literal) authenticity, approximate authenticity, and moral
   authenticity. In each case, consumers draw on either indexical or iconic
   cues to form judgments of authenticity, although the type of cue and
   degree of abstraction differ across the three types. We also find that
   the informants are duped by careful advertisements, and explain this by
   proposing that the relationships between indexical and iconic cues are
   closer than previously thought.

AB Counterfactual thinking (CT) is the process of mentally undoing the
   outcome of an event by imagining alternate antecedent states. This
   research distinguishes between two types of CT: positive CT, which
   involves undoing the absence of previous positive outcomes, and negative
   CT, which involves undoing the presence of previous negative outcomes.
   Three experiments demonstrate that engaging in positive CT makes an
   individual's promotional goals (those related to attaining positive
   outcomes, such as accomplishments) more accessible relative to
   preventional goals (those related to avoiding negative outcomes, such as
   mistakes), whereas engaging in negative CT leads to a reversed effect.
   Furthermore, the type of CT (positive versus negative) induced prior to
   ad exposure influences the relative persuasiveness of promotion-versus
   prevention-focused ad appeals.

AB In two experiments, we show how a consumer's susceptibility to normative
   influence (SNI) offers useful insights into the effectiveness of two
   types of testimonials: a typical person endorsement (Study 1) and a
   celebrity endorsement (Study 2). Specifically, we suggest that two
   variables moderate testimonial effects-SNI and product attribute
   information. Results show that in forming their evaluations, high-SNI
   consumers place a greater emphasis on the testimonial than on the
   attribute information. In contrast, low-SNI consumers are more
   influenced by attribute information. A mediation analysis shows that
   advertising attitudes for high-SNI consumers are mediated by testimonial
   thoughts, whereas the attitudes for low-SNI consumers are mediated by
   their attribute thoughts. Theoretical and managerial implications are
   presented.

   conducted in New York City's LaGuardia Airport to explore the
   effectiveness of airport advertising. The results of three
   studies-ethnographic, recognition, and recall-produced five general
   themes. Of particular interest is that depending on the type of
   advertising effectiveness measurement tool used by the
   researcher-recognition or recall-different characteristics of the
   advertisement or its execution correlate more strongly with one
   measurement tool than the other. Message response involvement provides
   an integrated theory that ties these findings together.

   negatively impact brand attitudes of viewers who report high levels of
   program liking. Conversely, viewers reporting lower levels of program
   liking shift brand attitude in a positive direction after exposure to a
   prominent placement. However, the positive shift in brand attitude for
   participants with lower program liking disappears when a
   persuasive-intent prime precedes exposure to the placement. Subtle
   placements are less likely to result in negative shifts in brand
   attitude. The Persuasion Knowledge Model (Friestad and Wright 1994) is

   advertisers used new techniques and a new medium. Yet The Hidden

   promoting subliminal techniques. Nonetheless, the book helped shape

   fast-forward through ads in recorded programming at the expense of other
   advertisement avoidance strategies. While DVRs may increase commercial
   avoidance, they will also facilitate the measurement of commercial
   avoidance. Advertisers can use ad avoidance data to improve creative
   strategies, targeting, message rotation and scheduling, media buying,
   and ROI (return on investment) measurements. The net result should be
   more relevant, engaging, and efficient advertising, which would reduce

   who purchase the product. The present study is an individual-level,

AB Print advertising frequently employs multiple images within a single
   advertisement, each of which is capable of generating an affective
   response. Little is known, however, about how these multiple ad
   components combine to impact overall emotional response to advertising.
   Evidence from three experiments suggests that when advertisement images
   are all positive or all negative, the most extreme image determines
   overall response. When an advertisement contains both positive and
   negative images, a compensatory mechanism seems to drive overall
   response. This implies that there may be little advantage to using
   multiple images of similar valence and intensity, but that a greater
   number of positive pictures will lead to a more positive response in
   mixed-valence advertisements.

   perceived age of advertising models and consumers' cognitive and
   chronological ages has on younger consumers' responses to advertising.
   Findings showed that a high congruency between the model's perceived age
   and the consumer's cognitive age predicted higher degrees of "for-me"
   perceptions, perceived affinity between the self and the brand, brand
   evaluation involvement, self-referencing, and positive brand attitudes.
   Most important, mediation analyses demonstrated that the congruency
   between the perceived model age and consumer cognitive age influenced
   brand attitudes via its influence on "for-me" perceptions, perceived
   self-brand affinity, brand evaluation involvement, and self-referencing.
   In contrast, a high congruency between the model's perceived age and the
   consumer's chronological age predicted a higher degree of "for-me"
   perceptions, but did not predict greater levels of perceived affinity,
   brand evaluation involvement, self-referencing, or positive brand
   attitudes.

   impacts purchase intentions. This study suggests that the impact of
   perceived value on purchase intention is mediated by consumers'
   perceptions of personal susceptibility and the susceptibility of others.
   Results of an experimental study support a mediating effect where
   enhanced value perception leads to increases in perceived influence on
   self relative to others, and therefore enhances purchase intention. The
   results confirm the impact of perceptual biases as suggested by the
   "third-person effect," thus providing some interesting theoretical
   contributions for advertising research as well as for managerial
   implications.

   incongruence, we hypothesize that thematic incongruence could enhance
   advertising evaluations and produce stronger perceptions of existing
   brand associations. The results support the hypotheses and suggest that

AB We examine how the style of magazine advertisements changed between 1969
   and 2002, using ads included in the Which Ad Pulled Best? (WAPB)
   editions published over that period. Six aspects of ad style are
   examined: the proportion of space allotted to pictures, the amount of
   body copy used, inclusion of the brand name in the headline,
   incorporation of the brand into the picture, the layout of pictures and
   text, and the presence or absence of a stand-alone brand block. Using
   contemporaneous copy test data from the WAPB editions, we show that the
   style elements that became more common were those that had been more
   effective, and those that became less common were those elements that
   had proved less effective. Results suggest that during this period
   consumers increasingly approached magazine ads as pictures to be viewed
   and not as documents to be read. In response, magazine advertisers
   adapted by altering their stylistic and design choices to give more
   weight to pictorial elements and less weight to verbal elements.

AB As the inclusion of foreign languages in advertisements is a growing
   global trend, this research examines how language choice may influence
   important advertising outcome measures within a South Korean advertising
   context. Specifically, the study aims to explore how foreign and local
   languages influence recall and recognition for brand name and body copy
   messages. The interaction of using two languages in an advertisement to
   convey different elements of the ad may secure varied levels of
   attention and comprehension. The findings suggest that recall and
   recognition are significantly affected by the language presented. An ad
   presenting a brand name in the foreign language (English Roman alphabet)
   with the body copy message in the local language (Hangul) is an
   effective strategy to enhance recall and recognition of the brand name
   and the ad message within the Korean youth market. The results of this
   study expand linguistic theory within an advertising context while also
   providing international advertisers with useful tips when operating in a
   multinational marketplace. Future research avenues are discussed.

   addresses the question of whether ads that use the same structure that
   appears repeatedly in various ads would consistently be judged as
   original and favorable or whether such judgments Would diminish over
   occurrences of ad exposure. The studies show that, by and large,
   subjects do not discover the formula of the design structure. Moreover,
   even if subjects are informed about it explicitly, the impact of ads
   matching a single design structure shown consecutively is not undermined
   over exposures. As a result, despite the repeated use of a design
   structure in series Of exposures to ads with unrelated contents,
   originality evaluations remain high.

   processing and response. First, traditional hierarchy-of-effects (HOE)
   models are reviewed and then augmented with new developments in
   advertising and persuasion research to identify five major stages: brand
   awareness, brand learning, accepting/rejecting ad claims, brand liking,
   and brand intentions. Theoretical links are identified that predict ad
   creativity will impact 13 key variables in all five HOE stages. An
   experiment is conducted that manipulates the two major determinants of
   ad creativity: divergence and relevance. Results confirm the expected
   divergence-by-relevance interaction effect for 12 of the 13 variables
   demonstrating the potency of creative ads (and the ineffectiveness of
   ads with low creativity). In addition, a test is conducted using
   structural equations modeling (SEM) to see whether all the effects of ad
   creativity are mediated through each successive HOE stage. Results show
   that the HOE's assumptions hold up reasonably well, although divergence
   is powerful enough to exert direct (unmediated) effects on brand
   awareness and brand liking.

   characteristic of emotional reactions to print advertising. We
   demonstrate the reliability and robustness of this linear relation for
   varied samples of print ads in two studies. Relying on the
   bioinformational theory of emotion, We illustrate that this linear
   relation reflects activation of the appetitive motivational system.
   Further investigation of an ad's position on the line revealed that the
   degree of deviation from this line in both directions is positively
   related to creative content. Creative content was determined objectively
   by means of content analysis detecting extraordinary message features
   and subjectively by means of perceived extraordinariness measures.

AB Although some research has examined the effects of animation in
   interactive advertisements, no research has investigated consumer
   responses to animated effects or cartoon spokespeople in print ads.
   Distinctiveness theory suggests that an ad can be considered distinctive
   if it has atypical traits that differentiate it from other marketing
   stimuli. Distinctiveness theory should be readily applied to advertising
   research, as advertising agencies and clients continuously strive to
   make their advertisements different, noticeable, and memorable to
   consumers. Our research applies distinctiveness theory to a creative
   caricature or cartoon spokesperson in print ads in a between-subjects
   experiment. Results of the study reveal that compared with a human
   spokesperson in the same advertisement, the creative use of cartoon
   spokespeople in print ads leads to more positive consumer advertising
   outcomes, including attitude toward the act, attitude toward the brand,
   and purchase intention of the advertised brand. The implications for
   practitioners and directions for future creativity and distinctiveness

   The first study examines creativity's effect on advertising recall using
   two nontraditional media: airport terminal and preshow cinema
   advertising. Results suggest that differences in how consumers interact
   with nontraditional media influence the effect of advertising creativity
   on memory. For cinema advertising, where media consumption is similar to
   traditional media, creativity enhanced recall. For airport advertising,
   where media consumption often occurs when consumers are in a distracted
   state, creativity had no effect. The second study continues this
   investigation of exposure context and extends previous creativity
   research by investigating the recognition dependent variable in a
   forced-exposure context. Recognition is measured at four time-delay
   intervals: no delay and delays of one-week, three-weeks, and five-weeks.
   Creative advertising was found to enhance recognition, and this positive
   effect increased over time.

AB Processing narratives demands sufficient cognitive resources; therefore,
   the effectiveness of narrative advertising depends on individuals'
   cognitive capacities. In contexts where cognitive capacity was
   constrained by processing narrative editorials, narrative advertising
   was less likely to transport and "hook" readers or evoke empathy. The
   relative effectiveness of narrative and argument advertising was also
   moderated by editorial content. When reading narrative magazine
   articles, participants failed to take argument strength into account
   when evaluating a Subsequent ad. In addition, the superior effectiveness
   of narrative advertising compared to argument advertising in terms of
   generating more favorable cognitive responses, warm feelings, and
   positive ad and brand attitudes did not emerge when participants read
   narrative articles. In contrast, when reading facts-based articles,
   participants elaborated more on the Subsequent ad and took argument
   strength into account. In this condition, narrative advertising was able
   to be processed and, as a result, was more effective than argument
   advertising.

   on-line health promotion is indeed Culture bound in the sense that
   health promotion strategies-that is, subjective norm, social support,

   conveyed will structure the perceptions of message recipients in
   profoundly different ways. We set out to measure the impact of varying
   metaphor content within an advertising context on consumer beliefs. We
   report an experiment that isolates the effect of metaphor, which is a
   function of cross-domain comparison, from the effect of figurativeness,
   which is a function of artful deviation. We find that only a highly
   figurative metaphor is able to alter specific consumer beliefs under
   conditions of incidental ad exposure. Consumers who have a high degree
   of ability to process metaphors are an exception to this rule; in their
   case, metaphors, whether figurative or not, did alter beliefs.
   Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Adopting a dynamic constructivist approach to culture (Hong and Chiu
   2001), this project examined the effect of advertising appeals in
   activating self-construals among Chinese Generation X consumers. In
   Study I, the bicultural disposition of this generation was evident when
   its salient self-construals were found to shift toward independence or
   interdependence in response to individualistic versus collectivistic
   advertisements. Study 2 demonstrated further that this self-shifting
   effect emerged only among bicultural Generation X individuals.
   Specifically, compared to when exposed to collectivistic ads, when
   exposed to individualistic ads, low biculturals (low in both
   individualistic and collectivistic orientation measures) responded with
   more independent self-construals, whereas high biculturals (high in both
   orientation measures) responded with more interdependent
   self-construals. Overall, these results are consistent with the
   theoretical expectation about the impact of globalization on
   biculturalism. Moreover, the results also reveal new knowledge about the
   role that contemporary advertising in China plays in promoting cultural
   changes at the individual level.

   New and perplexing ethical issues related to advertising messages have
   emerged with the advent and growth of new and nontraditional media.
   Because of the more complex organizational structures of global

   important marketing tool. As corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an
   issue of growing interest in the business world, many publicly listed
   companies, Including advertising agencies, are Voluntarily disclosing
   information regarding their CSR activities in their annual reports.
   While there is criticism of the ethical values of advertising, some
   advertising agencies can use CSR to promote a positive side of the
   agency's business. This descriptive study analyzes the annual reports of
   the top six holding companies in the global advertising industry to
   promote discourse and theory development in the area. This will be done
   by observing which advertising companies disclose their CSR activities
   and what activities they undertake, as well as the development of a CSR
   disclosure index for advertising agencies. The results indicate that
   some advertising companies do engage in CSR activities and disclose them
   in their annual reports, but the level of these CSR disclosures is
   different between the organizations.

AB To generate additional sales, marketers frequently cross-promote various
   kinds of related and unrelated product and service offers to their
   Customers. This paper examines how offers of additional products in a
   cross-promotion context elicit the emotion of irritation in consumers,
   and subsequently, how such irritation might negatively influence
   consumers' attitudes toward the advertiser and the advertised focal
   brand as well as their Intentions to purchase the brand. In addition,
   this paper examines the moderating effects of the consumer's need to
   evaluate. We hypothesize that additional offers of unrelated products
   lead to higher levels of irritation and that this effect is greater for
   consumers with a high need to evaluate (HNE) than consumers with a low
   need to evaluate (LNE). In addition, we hypothesize that the emotion of
   irritation mediates the effects of additional product offers and the
   need to evaluate on attitudes and intentions. Empirical results support
   the proposed hypotheses.

   often used in the European magazines industry to diminish the decline
   rate of periodical sales, in which a value pack is sold containing the
   magazine issue plus another product. Magazines are sold simultaneously
   with and without promotion at different prices, and promotions are
   serialized by fractioning the additional product across different issues
   of the magazine. Although promoting magazines contemporarily may
   cannibalize nonpromoted sales, this loss is compensated by a long-term
   increase in nonpromoted sales caused by product awareness and loyalty
   improvements. This strategy is increasingly used as an innovative form

   The authors identify conditions under which sponsorship information
   spills over to affect attitudes toward brands and the image of their
   manufacturers. Over two longitudinal field experiments, they find that
   spillover effects from sponsorship messages Occur at both the generic
   sponsorship announcement level and the team performance level. Immediate
   announcement effects are observed on perceptions of both sponsor brand
   quality and corporate image. In the longer term, information regarding
   positive and negative team performance results spills over to
   perceptions of brand quality but not corporate image. The research
   provides recommendations for how managers should minimize negative
   spillover effects and maximize their use of sponsorship information.

   the extent to which counterarguments are generated about the competitor

   Applying a postpositivist research perspective, a new model is
   introduced to integrate these beliefs in terms of advertiser trust and
   industry accountability under the existing theoretical framework of
   persuasion knowledge. Agent and topic knowledge are combined in this
   model based on responses to the industry advocacy campaign. In doing so,

   This paper argues that under certain circumstances, interactivity may
   either enhance or inhibit persuasion. A dual-process model of
   interactivity effects is proposed and tested that posits differential
   effects of interactivity on persuasion depending on person and situation
   factors. Results of an experiment that manipulated level of Web site
   interactivity and task involvement, and measured user ability (Internet
   usage experience), show that under low-involvement conditions, the mere
   presence of interactivity served as a peripheral cue that led to more
   positive attitudes regardless of ability (experience). Under
   high-involvement conditions, however, interactivity elicited more
   positive attitudes for experienced users but less positive attitudes for
   inexperienced users. Implications for the use of interactivity in
   advertising and promotions are discussed.

   factors; exhibits high reliability and concurrent, convergent,

   may help account for the lack of attitude change reported in past
   experimental Studies of placement effects. Specifically, this paper
   examines the effects of repetition of branded product placements in
   television and movies, comparing those that are subtle/"not in your
   face" with those that are more prominent/obvious. Findings suggest chat
   the type of placement (subtle/prominent) and repetition (low/moderate)
   interact to impact brand- and placement-related judgments. Specifically,
   repetition of prominent placements for known brands has a negative
   impact on brand attitude. For subtle cases of product placement,
   however, consumer attitudes are relatively positive and moderate levels
   of repetition have little incremental impact. In addition, findings
   suggest that studios ought to evaluate placement options carefully, as
   repetition of prominent placements may lead to reduced affect for their
   productions, thereby fueling a decline in their audiences. Theoretical
   and practical implications are offered.

AB Most commercials designed to elicit affective reactions do not appear in
   isolation but frequently together. Consequently, a crucial question
   arises as to whether ads trigger affective reactions to ads shown in the
   same pod. The authors report on three experiments that use verbal and
   nonverbal measurement tools to assess these types of effects. Building
   on assimilation-contrast theory, they find that context effects such as
   ad sequence influence affective reactions. Positive results Occur when
   an ad designed to invoke moderate or low emotional responses follows an
   ad evoking strong or moderately positive affect, whereas there is a
   threat when such an ad follows a strong negative emotional ad.

AB This paper explores the effectiveness of repetition variation strategies
   for narrative advertising and argues that repetition strategies that
   involve varying plots will be more difficult to comprehend, and thus
   less persuasive than fixed plot strategies. Experiment 1 compared three
   strategies: using the same plot twice, using different plots, and using
   one continuous plot. As expected, the different plots strategy resulted
   in less favorable ad attitudes than the other two strategies. Experiment
   2 compared the same three strategies, except that this time the
   character sets were kept the same in the different plots strategy.
   Results indicated that it was more difficult for participants to
   comprehend ads using the different plots/same characters strategy than
   those employing the other two strategies, and ad attitudes and brand
   attitudes were less favorable with that strategy as well. The role that
   ease of comprehension plays in mediating the relationship between
   variation strategies and ad/brand attitudes was also established.
   Experiment 3 compared all four strategies. Results showed that it was
   more difficult to comprehend ads that used different plots, regardless
   of whether characters were altered or not, than those that used the same
   or continuous plots strategies. The two different plots strategies also
   resulted in less favorable ad and brand attitudes than the same or
   continuous plots strategies.

AB The study reported here examines knowledge derived from past work on
   involvement in product advertising and explores whether consumer
   involvement works the same way when consumers respond to corporate ads.
   The use of corporate advertising in the United States has increased, but
   only limited research has been done to explore the nature of it. The
   study found key differences between product and corporate ads in terms
   of ad involvement effects on consumers' attitude/behavioral intentions.
   In corporate advertising, predispositional involvement influences
   consumers' ad attitudes and behavioral intentions only when mediated by
   ad involvement, whereas predispositional involvement has both a direct
   and an indirect influence on attitude and intentions in product ads. A
   key implication of this is that creating advertising involvement is even
   more critical in the corporate advertising setting as compared to
   product advertising. In explaining the results, the authors posit
   reasons such differences exist. Also, the results contribute to the
   debate on potential outcomes of corporate advertising by showing that
   corporate advertising can lead to increased product purchase intentions
   for a corporations' products even though the corporate ads are not
   product-focused.

AB In-depth interviews with senior-level agency practitioners (creative,
   planning, and account directors) were conducted to explore their
   thoughts about how advertising works. The study was designed to add to
   the understanding of the academician-practitioner gap in advertising by
   uncovering practitioners' hypothesized knowledge autonomy in the context
   of the sociological theory of professionalization. Results provide
   evidence for the existence of such autonomous practitioner knowledge
   schemas. Agency practitioners' core theories include a two-step "break
   through and engage" process and the longitudinal "mutation of effects"
   idea. They also believe in the primacy of emotional effects. Creativity
   is identified as the singularly most important factor in effectiveness,
   and agency professionals resisted any other regularities that may
   curtail creativity and result in formulaic advertising. Practitioners
   also emphasized the importance of defining boundary conditions when
   making claims about how advertising works, and identified strategic
   campaign objective, product category, medium used, and historical time
   period as key domains to consider. Implications for both academia and
   practice are offered, as are possible future research directions.

AB Corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, while not necessarily
   intended to constitute an endorsement of the brand by the participating
   nonprofit organization, may nonetheless be perceived by consumers as
   such. Our experimental findings of two common types of CSR initiatives
   (licensing associations and cause-related marketing) suggest that not
   only can the method of presentation of CSR initiatives in advertising
   result in perceptions of nonprofit endorsement, but also may be entirely
   confused with explicit seals of approval. Heightened processing
   motivation either falls to correct the misperception of nonprofit
   endorsement or may even enhance its perception as a result of the
   presentation of the CSR initiative in an advertisement. Level of fit
   between the nonprofit and for-profit brand may also result in increased
   perception of endorsement. Given the positive effects of third-party
   endorsements, our results suggest that some CSR initiatives may result
   in consumer inferences that are inaccurate but desirable for the
   company, even while these inferences have potentially negative
   consequences for the nonprofit.

AB This paper examines the impact of mood on consumers' implicit and
   explicit responses to false advertising. In our first experiment, we
   find that those consumers in a positive (versus a negative or neutral)
   mood state are more likely to notice the false information in the
   advertising, but paradoxically, are also likely to develop positive
   feelings toward the brand. In that experiment, we used both a hedonic
   brand (Disney) and a hedonic/emotional ad (autobiographical). In our
   second experiment, we extend the ad stimulus context beyond Disney to
   Wendy's to more readily facilitate autobiographical versus informational
   manipulations. We find that, indeed, the hedonic advertising execution
   (autobiographical vis-a-vis informational) is associated with more
   elaborate processing (but only for those in a positive mood). The
   observed positive affect transfer continued, however, despite the
   greater detection of the false information in the positive mood
   condition. We propose that the negative feelings toward the ad
   associated with detecting the false information are momentary and are
   replaced by positive feelings toward the brand that are engendered by
   positive mood and the advertising, as suggested by the synapse model of
   memory. Our third experiment varies the timing Of Our measures to
   investigate this proposition and finds that timing does matter. We
   conclude with a discussion of the implications of the findings for
   research on mood, deceptive advertising, and implicit versus explicit
   effects of advertising response.

AB With a focus on advertising, the most visible and publicly criticized
   marketing activity, issues that impel advertising regulation and
   self-regulation themselves often generate headlines in the popular press
   as well as business magazines. Beyond the basic longtime concerns of
   advertising veracity, or accusations of its inherent dishonesty,
   advertising regulation often becomes the advocated solution for problems
   of public health, privacy invasions, excessive consumer debt, and public
   aesthetics, as well as social critics' desires to diminish the modern
   cultural trait of secular consumerism (i.e., excessive shopping"). The
   problem is that actual research on the issues requires more than
   responding to the headlines. The model for understanding the existing
   literature of advertising and public policy research presented by
   Rotfeld and Stafford (2007) provides pragmatic guidelines for conducting
   quality research that is informed by and possibly guides advertising
   regulation and self-regulation decisions. The resulting inherently
   interesting future publications would be interdisciplinary,
   pandisciplinary, and multidisciplinary, but also needing discipline.

   (prior negative experience, information privacy concerns, perceived
   ubiquity, trust, and perceived risk) and preference for degree of
   regulatory control. Data from a survey of 5 10 mobile phone users in
   Japan show that mobile users with prior negative experiences with
   information disclosure possess elevated privacy concerns and perceive
   stronger risk, which leads them to prefer stricter regulatory controls
   in mobile advertising. Both perceived ubiquity and sensitivity of the
   information request further the negative impact of privacy concerns on
   trust. No such effect occurs for the impact of privacy concerns on
   perceived risk, however. The authors discuss some theoretical and

   examining the current state of online safeguards for Web sites that

AB Past research of children's television advertising shows that
   gender-related content is very prevalent, yet the potential impact of
   that content on children's attitudes toward advertising messages and
   brands has received very little attention. To address this gap in the
   literature, this paper develops a conceptual framework, based on a
   synthesis of developmental psychology literature, to understand how
   children develop attitudes toward advertisements with gender-related
   content. Next, to examine the conceptual framework, the results of an
   experimental design study with eight- and nine-year-old children are
   reported, confirming the key relationships posited in the conceptual
   framework. Managerial and public policy implications based on this study
   are discussed.

AB The use of comedic violence in viral advertising is becoming widespread,
   but as yet no examination of what influence it may have on consumer
   response has been undertaken. Two experimental studies using a
   commercial panel sample investigate the effects of this executional cue
   on ad message involvement, brand memorability, likelihood of being
   passed on to third parties, and attitude formation. Results suggest that
   humorous ads that combine higher levels of violence intensity with more
   severe consequences appear to elicit greater involvement with the ad
   message, better retention of brand information, higher pass-along
   probability, and greater ad likability. Attitudes toward the brand
   remain unaffected. Furthermore, justification for the violence and
   relatedness to the product brand appear to be important considerations
   when using high intensity-severe consequence comedic violence. The paper
   specifies conditions under which advertisers can expect to gain maximum
   impact when using violent humor in viral advertising campaigns.

   modes, including DVR (digital video recorder) ad skipping, against each

   form of avoidance, ignoring advertisements (cognitive avoidance), has
   effects equal to fast-forwarding. Prior exposure increases effectiveness
   of recall as partial exposures, including fast forwarding, can act as
   reminder ads, but prior exposure also increases avoidance. Doubling the
   message of an ad in its sound track increases effectiveness and is the
   only way to counteract the effects of cognitive avoidance.

AB The terms "soft sell" and "hard sell" are well known to advertising
   scholars and practitioners. Despite widespread use of these terms,
   generally accepted definitions do not exist. Attempts to measure
   soft-sell and hard-sell appeals have typically been unsophisticated,
   relying on a single item that classifies an ad into one category or the
   other. This study is designed to provide a deeper understanding of the
   concepts "soft sell" and "hard sell," and to examine whether they are
   better measured on a single dimension than on two distinct dimensions.
   The main objective of the study is to develop and validate a method for
   measuring soft-sell and hard-sell appeals. To this end, candidate items
   were generated via a review of prior literature, supplemented by content
   analysis, a free-association task, expert judgment, and focus groups.
   The measurement instruments were then purified and validated using a
   pretest with a sample of student participants, and further validated
   using a general consumer sample. Results indicate that soft-sell appeals
   can be measured using a 12-item, 3-factor index, whereas hard-sell
   appeals can be measured using a 15-item, 3-factor index.

   customer complaining is associated with lower advertising efficiency and
   effectiveness in both goods and service industries. The results further
   indicate that responsiveness to third-party customer complaining by
   goods firms is negatively related to advertising effectiveness but does
   not lead to lower overall advertising efficiency in either goods or

   the impacts of and trade-offs involved with, third-party customer

AB The benefits associated with cause-related marketing (CRM) campaigns to
   both the sponsoring firm and its partnering nonprofit are well
   documented. However, the combination of the manner in which CRM messages
   are framed in advertisements and consumers' temporal orientation
   potentially alters a campaign's success. In an initial experiment, we
   assess the moderating role of temporal orientation on effects of the
   temporal framing of CRM messages. We extend these findings with a second
   experiment in which we evaluate whether an individual's temporal
   orientation affects their response to a CRM campaign based on the
   immediacy of the need and the timeliness of the response to the need.
   Findings indicate that consumers' temporal orientation (present or
   future) moderates the influence of the temporal framing within the ad
   (either proximal or distal) for a CRM campaign on attitudes and purchase
   intentions. In addition, attitude toward the CRM campaign mediates the
   effect of the three-way interaction on brand attitude and purchase
   intentions. Implications for both corporations and the nonprofits
   benefiting from CRM campaigns are offered.

AB Advertisers face several message options when they position a new brand
   in well-established categories. Functional benefit claims versus
   experiential claims represent two options. Functional claims focus on
   tangible attributes and benefits, whereas experiential claims focus on
   promises of experiences the consumer should expect from the new brand.
   In this paper, we present the results from two experiments testing the
   persuasiveness of ads promising experience versus the persuasiveness of
   ads promising functional benefits of a new entrant. In the first
   experiment, we found that involvement moderates the effect of claim type
   on attitude toward a new category entrant in retail banking. This
   finding was replicated and extended in a second experiment using ski
   resorts as the context. Our findings suggest that functional benefit
   claims outperform experiential claims in high-involvement situations and
   that the strength of message arguments can be just as important as the
   framing choice. The research also shows that the two advertising claim
   types elicit different cognitive responses: functional claims trigger
   mostly semantic memory, whereas experiential claims trigger more
   episodic memories.

   suggested that consumers have varied reactions to Christian messages in

   levels. Study 1 was a follow-up field experiment conducted with adult
   consumers, while Study 2 was a lab experiment conducted with young
   adults. Results of Study 1 indicated a significant Christian symbol by
   evangelical religiosity interaction on perceived quality and purchase
   intentions such that the Christian symbol enhanced consumer evaluations,
   and the effects were stronger as evangelical religiosity increased.
   Consumers' source perceptions of the marketer in terms of attitude
   similarity, trustworthiness, expertise, and skepticism mediated these
   interaction effects. Results of Study 2 revealed an unusual backlash
   effect of the Christian symbol on purchase intentions for some consumers
   and contrasting mediation results. The results of the two studies are

   in responses to Spanish/English code-switched ads among bilingual

   sociolinguistic theories of information processing. Among 122 bilingual
   Mexican Americans, path analysis showed that when a code-switched ad
   primarily written in Spanish (English) was placed within an all-Spanish
   (all-English) medium, increased ad recall and perceptions of advertiser
   cultural sensitivity occurred. In turn, increased perceptions of
   advertiser cultural sensitivity led to greater cognitive ad involvement
   and persuasion. Based on these findings, the main language of a
   code-switched ad should match that of its medium to increase favorable
   advertising responses.

   Eastern Europe the Czech Republic. Based on a national sample, Czech
   consumers' beliefs about advertising's informational value and its role
   in the nation's economy explained their attitudes toward advertising
   significantly. Our data also revealed five consumer segments ranging
   from enthusiasts to severe critics. Segments with unfavorable attitudes
   saw advertising as being short on information and long on falsity. As
   such, the study's findings signal a need to steer the practice of
   advertising toward more product information, truth, and ethical
   standards. The first of its kind in Central and Eastern Europe, the
   study underscores the need to map consumer attitudes in other Central
   and Eastern European nations, and toward that agenda, it provides a
   framework for measurement of consumer belief profiles and identification
   of diverse attitude segments.

   among consumers attending a NASCAR event. The results of this study
   support prior experimental work (e.g., Johar and Pham 1999), indicating
   that consumers are more likely to correctly identify prominent and
   related sponsors. Importantly, the findings indicate that a reason for
   such recall is that the best-performing properties attract prominent and
   related sponsors, and affective intensity (either strong positive or
   negative feelings) toward a property activates or enhances the cognitive
   processing by consumers of sponsors of highly competitive properties.

   beyond concerns about effectiveness of such marketing communications.
   Previous research finds an unequivocal and harmful increased acceptance
   of cross-gender aggression and rape within society as a result of
   sexualized violence. However, none of these investigations examines the
   impact of violence as an advertising appeal. Thus, our research looks at
   the influence of sexualized violence in ads on rape myth beliefs and
   traditional consumer behavior variables. The findings from our study
   suggest that sexualized violence appeals may impact important
   advertising variables and appeal to specific market segments, but
   nevertheless have little value for marketing success.

   included four television advertisements, one billboard, a poster, and

   assess campaign effects. The study analyzes the effects of campaign
   exposure on awareness, perceived threat, and efficacy. Results obtained
   using analysis of covariance indicate that male and female attitudes
   were significantly different following campaign exposure. Women (but not
   men) increased their perceived severity of domestic violence and
   awareness of services from pretest to posttest. The campaign appeared to
   have effectively reached women. By contrast, male attitudes moved in the
   opposite direction from pre- to posttest, or did not change. A
   comparison of means confirmed these findings and also showed that women
   increased their belief in the effectiveness of services. The authors
   draw comparisons between male and female reactions and offer some

AB Video games, along with other types of violent media, are heavily
   consumed by young people. Concern over the effects of violent video game
   content on child development has led to the establishment of a ratings
   system to help parents understand and manage video game consumption.
   However, it is unclear just how effective or diagnostic these ratings
   are for the intended audience. In this paper, we examine video game
   rating perceptions and suggest that "desensitizing" may influence young
   people's perceptions of ratings, while prior experiences may create
   perceptual biases that influence how rating information is perceived by
   adults. Further, we show that certain rating content descriptors may
   strengthen perceptual biases, suggesting a need to reevaluate the
   current video game rating system.

   of these children) and an experimental study. Although parents and
   children who participated in the focus groups appeared to have few
   concerns with the potential negative effects of violence in television
   advertising, the experimental findings indicate that children may be
   adversely affected by it. Specifically, when exposed to ads with violent
   content in the focal experiment, subjects (ages 8 to 12) were more apt
   to generate aggressive cognitions (than when exposed to ads without
   violent content).

AB Research related to violent media has overwhelmingly focused on the
   consequences of exposure, typically with a view to informing its
   regulation. Such media is extremely popular, yet little research has
   examined why it should be appealing to consumers. The current work
   examines violent consumption in the context of advertisements for
   violent video games. We argue that it is not the violence endemic to
   many of these games, and indeed other media, that is rewarding, but
   rather the domination that often accompanies such depictions. We test
   this basic proposition by manipulating the dominative content of a
   violent depiction. We also examine conditions that moderate the scope of
   this effect.

   developed based on three probability theories-Hyett's Beta Distribution
   (1958), Waring's Theorem (1792), and Greene's Personal Media Probability
   Method (1970)-to overcome the major limitations of the previous exposure
   models such as generation of negative probabilities of exposure (meaning
   that the proportion of people exposed to an ad is less than zero, which
   is illogical) and the models' incapability of handling asymmetrical
   media schedules (which is impractical). The MBD Model is the most
   advanced multivariate media exposure model, designed to work for not
   only the traditional media classes, but also the Internet. An
   illustrative sample of numerical examples demonstrates the accuracy of
   the MBD Model, based on magazine audience data. Then, the performance of
   the MBD Model is compared to that of eight existing media exposure
   models, tested on 440 randomly selected media schedules for a Web
   audience comScore data set. The findings indicate that the MBD Model
   performs well in both prediction and in overcoming the limitations of

   This paper answers recent calls for research into the effects of
   purposeful polysemy, or strategic ambiguity, in minority targeting. The
   results of a quasi-experiment with gay and heterosexual male respondents
   in the context of gay window advertising demonstrate not only
   significant positive target market effects of covert minority targeting
   (i.e., ambiguous ad cues), but also the existence of negative nontarget
   market effects. Emotional responses fully mediate these effects. Our
   results further demonstrate the importance of individual differences and
   product category by suggesting, for example, that gay men who are open
   about their sexual orientation can be targeted using gay window ads when
   the product category is congruent with male stereotypes and with
   mainstream ads when The product category is incongruent with male
   stereotypes.

   children to clearly detect the commercial nature of the game. Also, the
   presence of the ad break was not linked to children's correct
   identification of the persuasive agent. The ad break did mitigate
   advertising effects on children, however, evidenced by decreased desire

   in predicting sponsorship effects, but little research has been done to
   understand the basis for fit perceptions. The current research uses
   three studies to find and test the underlying dimensions used to judge
   the degree of overall fit between a sponsor and object. Starting with an
   exploratory study that uses qualitative cognitive mapping to uncover
   seven dimensions that form the basis for overall fit perceptions, a
   follow-up experiment determines their ability to predict overall fit and
   sponsorship-related attitude changes. The last study tests whether
   overall fit perceptions can be manipulated both positively and
   negatively with fit dimension related communications about the
   sponsorship. The research finds that sponsor product relevance, attitude
   similarity, geographic similarity, audience similarity, and sponsorship
   duration significantly predict overall fit and/or can be used to
   manipulate fit perceptions positively.

AB This research investigates how an individual's self-construal and
   self-regulatory focus interplay in determining advertising message
   persuasiveness. In Experiment 1, we examine the moderating role of an
   individual's chronically accessible self-construal with respect to
   regulatory focus. The results show that individuals with a dominant
   independent self-construal exhibit more positive attitudes toward a
   promotion-focused advertising message and the advocated brand, whereas
   individuals with a prevailing interdependent self-construal show more
   favorable attitudes toward a prevention-focused advertising message and
   the associated brand. While replicating Experiment 1, Experiment 2 lends
   further support for the observed relationship by temporarily priming
   self-construal through a series of contextual advertising images
   involving individual and team sports events. The findings reveal that
   individuals who are primed first by viewing individual sports events
   later evaluate the promotion-focused advertising message and the brand

AB User-generated online content poses a problem when it takes the form of
   advertising. Consumer-generated advertising challenges researchers and
   practitioners to understand consumers' articulated responses to ads and
   to the responses of other consumers, as well as the implications these
   may have for the brand. Traditional research methods such as
   viewer-response testing may be limited when the viewer becomes part of
   the conversation. This exploratory study attempts to interpret the
   conversations consumers have around consumer-generated ads using the
   comments they have posted to each ad's Web page. We show how
   conversations around ads can be mapped and interpreted, and then develop
   a typology of consumer-generated ad conversations. We discuss managerial
   implications of our findings, outline the limitations of the technique
   used, and trace avenues to extend the research.

AB This study develops and tests a conceptual framework for categorizing
   visual metaphors in advertising according to whether the pictorial
   elements in the ad are synthesized or juxtaposed. In this attempt, it
   subscribes to the view that creative ideas frequently share similar
   design structures and patterns in devising visual metaphors. This study
   demonstrates that compared with ad visuals that simply juxtapose
   metaphorical objects, ad visuals that synthesize conceptually similar
   metaphorical objects provoke greater elaboration and elicit more
   favorable consumer attitudes toward both the ad and the brand. These
   positive effects are not free of comprehension costs, however. Ads :hat
   synthesize very dissimilar objects (as compared with ads that juxtapose
   objects) fail to produce the same benefits and might, in some cases,
   even risk reducing the persuasiveness of the argument about key product
   attributes in the advertising message.

   environments. Three experiments compared self-endorsing to endorsing by
   an unfamiliar other. In Experiment I, self-endorsing in online
   advertisements led to higher brand attitude and purchase intention than
   other-endorsing. Moreover, photographs were a more effective persuasion
   channel than text. In Experiment 2, participants wore a brand of
   clothing in a high-immersive virtual environment and preferred the brand
   worn by their virtual self to the brand worn by others. Experiment 3
   demonstrated that an additional mechanism behind self-endorsing was the
   interactivity of the virtual representation. Evidence for

   periods. Using cross-sectional time series analysis, the data reveal
   that changes in firms' advertising and promotion expenditures are
   related to changes in firms' current and future earnings, conditional on
   product classification. In addition, differential effects occur for
   changes during recessions compared to nonrecessionary periods.
   Specifically, the link between advertising and promotion spending
   increases and future earnings is stronger and more immediate during
   recessions. Decreases in advertising and promotion spending during
   recessions have a delayed relationship with future earnings.

   value-driven behavior that is unrelated to the advertising context.
   Evidence from two studies show that exposure to value-laden
   advertisements instigates behavior that is congruent with the
   "advertised" value (i.e., self-direction, security, achievement, or
   benevolence). Moreover, attitudes toward advertising moderate this
   effect. To the extent that people value positive aspects or dislike
   negative aspects of advertising, value-congruent behavior becomes
   respectively more or less likely following exposure to value-laden ads.
   The results highlight new aspects of unintended influences of exposure

   of exposed ads that are physically present, but not actively attended to
   by consumers. The primary justification for this assumption is the mere
   exposure effect. Recent work suggests that when people avoid distracting
   stimuli while engaged in a search or focused activity, however, negative
   affect for the distractor can occur. This distractor devaluation
   hypothesis was applied to banner ads. Results show that participants

   multitasking dampens a well-integrated placement's brand-enhancing
   effect and mitigates an intrusive placement's brand-damaging effect.
   Well-integrated placement produces an assimilation effect, leading to
   convergence of viewers' attitudes toward the placed versus competing
   brands, while intrusive placement triggers a contrast effect that
   results in divergence of these attitudes. Among single-tasking viewers,
   the boomerang effect of an intrusive placement decreases the
   favorability of the placed brand and increases the favorability of the

   to what extent consumers' information-processing tendencies and ad-based
   responses are differentially influenced by the introduction of nostalgic
   cues (either "personal" or "historical" in nature) embedded in an
   advertisement. The results support hypothesized expectations that
   personal nostalgia (a yearning for one's past) generally outperforms
   both historical and non-nostalgic advertising when measures of
   self-directed thoughts, positive affect, and attitude toward the ad are
   considered. However, when cognitive measures (i.e.,
   brand/message-related cognitive responses and message recall) are
   considered, a personally nostalgic ad is shown to be comparable to a
   historical nostalgic ad, but inferior to a non-nostalgic ad. Regression
   results utilizing cognitive response data further indicate that
   individuals' brand attitudes are differentially influenced by the type
   of nostalgia evoked. Practical and theoretical implications for the
   study's findings are discussed, and future research directions are

   theories of responses to emotional advertising, particularly fear
   appeals, focus on cognitive processing or coping strategies, we develop
   a model of emotional competencies and show how emotional information
   management (EIM) affects consumer responses to emotional appeals.
   Informed by affect as information theory, the EIM model suggests that
   managing negative emotions effectively should reduce empathetic
   responses to emotional ads while utilizing positive emotions should
   increase empathy. Empirical survey results demonstrate the efficacy of
   EIM for explaining how emotional appeals affect attitudes toward the ad
   (A(ad)) and behavioral intentions (B-i) to comply with both positively

   differences in aggression (trait aggression) on brand logo memory and on
   attitude change in a violent first-person shooter game (Half-Life 2).
   Physiological arousal (skin conductance levels) was assessed during game
   play and participants reported their sense of presence in the game.
   Results indicate that violence cues influence brand logo memory through
   engagement and affect attitude change via arousal. Although
   physiological arousal led to positive change in brand attitude, it does
   not significantly influence logo memory. Conversely, although higher
   levels of spatial presence led to better logo memory, there was a
   corresponding reduction in attitude change for highly recognized brands.
   We consider the possibility that increased memory but negative attitude
   change with higher presence in violent video games could deter
   advertisers from placing their messages inside violent games.

   positive ad evaluations when the ad is written in that language. The
   results of three studies provide the basis for a Word

   1990) is proposed as a possible solution to this 50-year debate. Using
   endogenous growth theory, we develop a model that links advertising to
   incentives for business innovation and for overall levels of information
   and knowledge in society. Results indicate that advertising expenditures
   offer significant explanatory power for long-term economic growth for a
   panel of 64 countries. This study contributes to the debate in two major
   ways: (1) by empirically showing that on a macrolevel, advertising
   expenditures and economic growth are related; and (2) by developing a
   theoretical economic growth model that demonstrates that not only are
   advertising expenditures related to economic growth, but that they can
   bring about economic growth. Finally, by providing a refinement of how
   marketing actions may positively affect the economy, the study
   contributes to the broader debate of advertising's role in society.

AB A survey explores factors that lead to consumers' ambivalent attitudes
   about green products and buying green products. An experiment further
   tests the moderating influence of this ambivalence on consumer responses
   to green advertising that suggests the advertisers exert different
   levels of green efforts (low, moderate, high). A proposed model predicts
   that high-effort claims induce greater levels of discomfort among
   ambivalent participants, which encourage them to engage in motivated
   processing in which they discount the believability of the ad, as well
   as that of the green claims. As a result, evaluations of the product
   become more negative. The experimental findings confirm these
   predictions.

AB This paper investigates consumer response to advertising for future,
   to-be-released products. Drawing on recent consumer psychology research
   on the optimism bias, positive uncertainty, and affective
   (mis-)forecasting, we explore consumers' positive bias for "the next
   product." A first experimental study of responses to car ads
   investigates how advertising the same product before versus after
   release has significant, favorable effects. Future-oriented advertising
   evokes greater elaboration and stimulates more positive evaluations of
   both ads and brands. The second experimental study replicates and
   extends these findings with mineral water ads for both familiar and
   unfamiliar brands. The third study rules out limited availability as a
   competing explanation and extends the findings by including a time lag
   and actual product consumption.

   e-mail frequency to preserve opt-in lists in an environment of
   saturation. This paper presents two empirical studies suggesting that to
   alleviate consumers' perception of being under heavy e-mail pressure,
   advertisers should help them discard nonrelevant e-mails with minimum
   effort. The research reveals that perceived pressure from any one
   advertiser is an individual phenomenon. Under conditions of low
   relevance, the effect of this pressure on unsubscriptions is moderated
   by the execution of e-mail advertising. Consumer perception of pressure
   from any one advertiser is crucial, as managers can control their own
   advertising but not overall e-mail advertising volume.

AB Does congruity between an ad and its context improve ad memory? This
   research examines task orientation and perceived ad clutter as
   moderating and mediating influences on the relationship between
   ad-context congruity and ad memory in an e-magazine context. The results
   show ad-context congruity increases ad recognition for information
   seekers, whereas it does not have any effect for surfers of an
   e-magazine. Perceived clutter plays a crucial role in this relationship,
   partially mediating the impact of ad-context congruity on recall and
   completely mediating the effect of ad-context congruity on recognition.
   The managerial implications for the burgeoning e-magazine format include
   indications that when recall is paramount, adjacent incongruent ads and
   content can be used, but when recognition is important, congruent ads
   and content should be used and targeted toward people who consume the
   medium to gather specific information.

AB Individual differences in field dependence-independence are an integral
   factor for the perception of product placements. This is because
   field-independent individuals are better able to separate a stimulus
   from its embedding context; thus, they can more easily recognize a
   placement in a complex audiovisual field. In two experiments working
   with authentic audiovisual stimuli, we varied the appearance of
   placements and measured the field dependence of our participants. The
   results of Study 1 demonstrate that field-independent individuals show a
   higher placement recall than field-dependent individuals. Besides
   replicating the findings of Study 1, Study 2 shows that field-dependent
   individuals like the embedded brand more than field-independent
   individuals. The results speak to the importance of individual
   difference variables for product placement research.

AB To examine the portrayal of African-American models in trade journal
   advertising, this longitudinal study content analyzed more than 1,200
   trade journal advertisements, containing about 3,700 people, to provide
   a unique six-decade perspective on African-American ad portrayals in the
   infrequently studied trade segment of the B2B (business-to-business)
   market. Prior research and cultivation theory are the foundations for
   this study. Results from four different B2B sectors-architecture,
   automotive, health, and law-indicate that over the 60-year span of the
   study, the number of African Americans in B2B trade journal ads
   increased. Furthermore, the percentage of black female models increased,
   although the increase was variable and in only one decade of the six
   studied did the percentage of black females exceed that of black males.
   Looking at roles portrayed, by the last two decades of the study, there
   were significant increases in blacks in major roles and significant
   declines in minor roles. Last, there was a marked change in black
   occupational portrayals from primarily blue-collar to
   white-collar/professional roles. Findings based on this six-decade study
   of trade journals representing different sectors of the B2B market
   suggest that B2B advertising, at least in these vehicles, is consistent
   with the mainstreaming tenet of cultivation theory.

AB The growing concern over violence in the media has led to vast amounts
   of research examining the effects of violent media on viewers. An
   important subset of this research looks at how humor affects this
   relationship. While research has considered this subset in television
   programming, almost no research has explored this in the context of
   advertising. This paper builds on the little research that exists by
   examining the effects of combining humor and violence, as well as the
   theoretical approaches that underlie these effects. A content analysis
   is conducted to identify the prevalence of violence, humor, and the
   combination of these elements in a longitudinal sample of Super Bowl
   commercials (2005, 2007, and 2009). Further, we investigate the
   relationship between the joint occurrence of humor and violence in ads
   and ad popularity. We conclude that violent acts are rampant in these
   commercials and that many acts are camouflaged by the simultaneous
   presence of humor, especially in the most popular ads.

AB The effects of spokescharacter personality characteristics on key
   elements of brand equity are hypothesized and tested in two studies.
   More specifically, two studies assess the role of the spokescharacter
   personality characteristics of excitement, sincerity, and competence in
   affecting brand trust, brand attitude, and willingness to pay a price
   premium (WPPP). Study 1 results show that excitement and sincerity
   directly and indirectly affect brand attitude, brand trust, and WPPP.
   Furthermore, sincerity is more positively linked to brand trust than is
   excitement. Study 2 results show that a spokescharacter designed in a
   manner to evoke greater perceived sincerity has a stronger positive
   impact on trust, brand attitude, and WPPP than a spokescharacter
   designed to evoke greater competence. Overall, these findings
   demonstrate that personality-laden spokescharacters featured in
   advertising campaigns can strengthen these equity-related constructs
   found important in enhancing consumer-brand relationships. Implications
   for brand and advertising managers are offered.

AB This research examines the impact of spokesperson accents used in
   persuasive communications on consumer evaluations of and memory for
   products and services. Leveraging the construct of accent standardness
   (i.e., perceived accent prestige and "correctness"), in four
   experiments, listeners demonstrate their overall preferences by giving
   higher ratings to products advertised using less-familiar, more-standard
   accents (e.g., British) relative to more-familiar, less-standard accents
   (e.g., American Southern). However, consumer preferences for standard
   accents do not positively impact their memory; standard accents actually
   lower brand recall. Thus, when choosing a spokesperson's accent, there
   is a trade-off: increasing brand preference by using a standard accent
   or improving memory by using a more familiar, nonstandard accent.

   previous cross-national advertising and globalization studies that
   suggest that advertising is a reflection of cultural and global

   romanticized view of middle-ground politics promoted by political
   establishments both at the national and the international level. We also

   results show that one ad per break maximizes both this disruptive effect

   Results from a naturalistic field study show an attention spill-over

AB This paper investigates the influence of reference groups on self-brand
   connections among Chinese consumers and the implications for advertising
   in China. Reference groups include the in-group (member group) and
   out-groups (aspiration, dissociative, and neutral). Two studies test
   five hypotheses involving both Chinese and foreign brands. The results
   indicate that Chinese consumers report higher self-brand connections for
   Chinese brands in member and aspiration group settings, but higher
   connections with foreign brands in a dissociative group setting.
   Furthermore, individualism/collectivism moderates the influence of
   reference groups on this connection. For brands with images congruent
   with the in-group, compared with more individualistic consumers, more
   collectivist consumers exhibit stronger self-brand connections with
   Chinese brands than with foreign brands. For brands with images
   congruent with the dissociative group, compared with more collectivist
   consumers, more individualistic consumers report stronger self-brand
   connections with foreign brands than with Chinese brands. These results
   have critical implications for advertising in China.

   they watch a variety of evening television shows. In addition, as they
   watch, consumers' self-regulatory resources are expected to be
   "depleted" following a typical day at work and/or home (Baumeister,
   Heatherton, and Tice 1994). Connecting these two ideas, the current
   study tests whether ego depletion moderates the impact of subtle versus
   blatant product placements on viewers' brand recognition and brand
   attitudes. Using experimenter-generated television pilots as stimuli,
   the findings of our empirical investigation indicate that viewers are
   less likely to recognize being exposed to subtly placed than to
   blatantly placed brands, and this difference is magnified by ego
   depletion. In addition, when viewers are not depleted, blatant
   placements lead to more favorable attitudes than subtle placements. When
   viewers are in a depleted state, however, subtle placements lead to more
   favorable attitudes than blatant placements. Theoretical and practical
   implications of these findings are discussed.

   explanatory headline to ads with a pictorial metaphor on brand
   communication effects. An experimental study compared the effects of
   adding a moderate headline, which gives a clue to the ad's message, or a
   complete headline, which clearly spells out the ad's message, to an ad
   without a headline. Results show that a complete headline leads to more
   positive brand communication effects than a moderate headline or no
   headline at all. A complete headline results in stronger brand beliefs
   about the key benefit conveyed by the pictorial metaphor, which in turn
   leads to a more positive brand attitude.

AB The popularity of stereoscopic 3-D technology is encouraging advertisers
   to adopt this format as a new advertising tool in diverse contexts. This
   research investigates the impact of nonglasses and glasses types of
   stereoscopic 3-D advertising, and proposes a theoretical model examining
   the role of presence in advertising effectiveness. Due to their power to
   increase presence, both stereoscopic 3-D advertising formats have a
   significantly stronger impact on diverse marketing variables than flat
   3-D advertising. A structural equation model reveals the process through
   which presence affects advertising effectiveness by enhancing enjoyment
   and increasing perceived product knowledge. In addition, the moderating
   effects of novelty and cybersickness on presence are identified.

   agencies. To remedy this, we surveyed directors of account services and
   creative and media departments in agencies across the United States.
   Findings demonstrate that degree of centralization, formalization,
   internal volatility, and psychological distance are all positively
   related to level of destructive conflict, whereas team spirit has an
   inverse relationship. We also demonstrate that destructive and
   constructive conflict are distinct constructs and not simply opposing
   ends of a continuum. Finally, we show that destructive and constructive
   conflict each influence perceived quality of agency output.

AB Creativity is a trait that is treasured by both advertising agencies and
   clients. How is greater creativity nurtured and cultivated in such an
   intense environment? Passion (in the form of intrinsic motivation) as
   well as industry expertise and knowledge are highly desirable
   ingredients for driving creativity in an advertising agency (Young
   2003). This research proposes a dynamic framework for greater creativity
   that includes passion (individual intrinsic motivation) as one of the
   most important factors in predicting creativity, along with industry
   expertise and knowledge. As a stimulus, management support for
   creativity serves to enhance passion's influence on creativity in this
   model, while the influence of expertise is suppressed by organizational
   politics. The study uses a sample of 1,188 advertising campaigns from
   major U.S. agencies, reported by 413 respondents, to offer an insightful
   framework for advertising creativity.

AB Extant literature over the last couple of years has examined factors
   affecting donor proclivity to contribute to nonprofits. These studies
   focused on factors such as negative emotional response to the ad and
   perceived social responsibility of the sponsor on intent to donate to
   the sponsor, the use of implicature, and truth in advertising. Our
   research adds to this growing body of literature by investigating the
   effect of self-inflicted harm versus blameless victimization in
   nonprofit advertising (locus of control of the harm to the victim). We
   find that blameless victim portrayal results in higher negative
   emotional response to the public service announcement (PSA), perceived
   social responsibility of the sponsor, and willingness to donate to the
   sponsor of a PSA. Specifically, the use of blameless victims seems to
   have the added benefit of generating more positive perceptions of the
   sponsor, which, in turn, also leads to higher intentions to donate.

   positive effect on advertising effectiveness. The present research
   examines the effects of race-stereotyped portrayals on advertising
   effectiveness among both members and nonmembers of a group that is
   stereotyped in an advertisement. We integrate research on consumer
   identity, social categorization, and advertising persuasion to
   hypothesize the process underlying viewers' attitude formation when
   exposed to advertising featuring a race-stereotyped portrayal. Results
   of an experiment conducted in South Africa demonstrate that members of
   the group that is the subject of the stereotyped portrayal (stereotyped
   viewers) feel offended. At the same time, results suggest that
   nonstereotyped viewers experience ambivalence when exposed to
   stereotyped portrayals. Findings highlight the role of viewers' strength
   of identification and provide guidance to advertisers with regard to the
   use of stereotyped portrayals in advertising.

AB This paper examines some of the key factors that determine how hedonic
   advertising appeals influence consumption impulses. Study 1 demonstrates
   that when advertising appeals vividly describe the pleasures of
   consumption rather than the utilitarian functions of the product,
   message recipients are able to visualize the emotions they are likely to
   experience during the consumption process. These anticipated emotions,
   once activated, may be so overwhelming that a tug-of-war between impulse
   and self-restraint occurs, prompting message recipients to generate
   excuses to justify yielding to their consumption impulses. Study 2
   replicates this process and goes further by showing how hedonic appeals
   influence taste anticipation and consumption impulses. Ideas for future
   research and implications for advertising researchers and practitioners
   are also discussed.

   selectively highlight five themes in our review: (1)
   diversified/shifting cultural values, (2) language and brand names, (3)
   acceptable/offensive advertising, (4) media growth and control, and (5)

   implications for academic researchers and advertising professionals that
   these papers collectively provide. In the transitional market in China,
   insights from past studies are relevant for its future development in

   on personal health appeals. A considerably different set of
   relationships is observed when messages focus on environmental appeals.
   Consistent with our theoretical expectations regarding goal
   compatibility effects, prevention-(as opposed to promotion-) focused
   environmental appeals generated more favorable attitudes for individuals
   who are situationally primed to have an independent self-view. In the
   interdependent self-view condition, the promotion-focused appeals
   performed as well as or better than the prevention-focused appeals. The

AB This study assesses consumer perceptions of advertising messages for two
   proenvironmental products by examining the effectiveness of
   environmental versus personal benefit appeals and .99 versus .00 price
   endings. The authors borrow from Prospect Theory and Mental Accounting
   Theory to explain consumers' perceptions of psychological pricing and
   product attributes. In addition, the moderating role of environmental
   skepticism is assessed as it relates to the effectiveness of
   environmentally friendly advertisements. Results indicate that consumers
   feel that some products advertised with environmental appeals are more
   costly, but are not perceived as lower quality as compared with products
   advertised with personal benefits. Findings also indicate a price ending
   x appeal interaction for two different products, but the effects vary
   between the products. Finally, environmental skepticism is found to
   moderate perceptions of the message appeal. Implications are provided.

AB Numerical information is an important feature in green advertising
   claims. In four experiments, the authors examine the extent to which
   numerical precision signals the competence of an advertised company. The
   results suggest that consumers who are low in advertising skepticism
   tend to perceive the advertised company as more competent when presented
   with precise numbers, which are considered more informative and
   scientific. Highly skeptical consumers are less likely to be affected by
   numerical precision. Furthermore, the moderation effect of advertising
   skepticism can be mitigated by consumer topic knowledge about the
   advertised environmental issue: Highly skeptical but less knowledgeable
   consumers are also susceptible to numerical precision.

AB The "green gap" is traditionally thought of as the gap between how
   consumers intend to behave regarding green living and how they actually
   behave. We extend the idea of the green gap by demonstrating a different
   kind of disconcerting green gap. There are three levels of green
   advertising-with tensions embedded in their differing agendas. An
   ethnographic content analysis and phenomenological interviews reveal
   that there is a macro agenda of saving the planet associated with
   nonprofit green advertisers. There is a meso agenda associated with
   for-profit enterprises. These commercial approaches do not appear to be
   aligned with consumers' micro agendas of saving one's own part of the
   planet (or at the very least, of not wasting one's part of it, as
   perpetuated by consumers). We then provide solutions for green
   advertisers in bridging this unsettling green gap among for-profit
   advertisers, nonprofit advertisers, and consumers who want to make being
   green and less wasteful easier in their everyday lives.

AB "Donna Karan Bunny Butcher," "Bloody Burberry": Not-for-profit (NFP)
   campaigns regularly take brands hostage. These shock tactics are meant
   to bring publicity to targeted companies' practices that are deemed
   socially and environmentally irresponsible. The aim is to coerce such
   firms into complying with NFPs' demands, for fear of consumers'
   backlash. Surprisingly, there is scant evidence showing the impact of
   these messages on consumer behavior. This paper examines consumer
   response to messages targeting brands in the context of the luxury
   fashion industry. Two experiments, involving repeated measurement and
   between-subjects message manipulation (framing and target), were
   conducted. Results show that eco-involvement and product involvement are
   moderators of consumer response.

   research examines the effect of the advertiser's creative risk-taking

   creativity literature to develop two behavioral strategies that
   risk-taking advertiser can employ (i.e., creative qualification and
   trust in agency) to enhance advertising originality. We find the
   advertiser's risk taking increases its creative qualification effort and
   its trust in the chosen agency, and it is through qualification and
   trust that advertiser risk taking contributes to campaign originality

AB Metaphors appear frequently in contemporary advertising. The purpose of
   this study is to distinguish between two types of metaphor (explicit
   versus implicit) and to further examine potential influences associated
   with product type and consumer differences in need for cognition (NFC).
   Experimental results from two studies indicate that, regardless of
   metaphor type, ads with metaphors are more effective than nonmetaphor
   ads. An implicit metaphor is more effective than an explicit metaphor in
   hedonic product advertising. In contrast, an explicit metaphor is more
   effective than an implicit metaphor in utilitarian product promotion.
   These results hold only for individuals with high NFC, not for those
   with low NFC. Hence, in practice, marketers stand to gain not only by
   matching the metaphor type with their advertised products or brands but
   also by appropriately framing the products as hedonic or utilitarian.

AB While prior research has suggested that brand personality traits can be
   communicated to consumers via advertising, the question of whether
   consumers can infer traits that go beyond directly observable traits has
   not been addressed. Prior research has established that self-generated
   inferences going beyond direct advertising claims are of significant
   managerial concern because they can have an even stronger impact on
   consumers' brand evaluations than information that is directly
   communicated. This research investigates whether and how consumers infer
   unobservable brand traits through advertisements. Specifically, it
   theorizes that a psychological process-egocentric pattern
   projection-determines consumers' inferences about how two brand
   personality traits are linked on the basis of the extent to which these
   traits are aligned within the self (i.e., geography of self).
   Furthermore, the study contributes to the advertising literature by
   examining and testing the notion that consumers exposed to an
   advertisement generate expectancies regarding unobservable brand traits
   that further guide the revision of ambiguous product information on
   these traits.

AB Using humor to communicate threatening information in advertising can
   often be observed in practice, but scholars have seldom investigated its
   effects. Drawing from dual processing models, the current study proposed
   that response to humor in threat persuasion would depend on the
   individual's level of issue involvement. This proposition was tested in
   two experiments. In Study 1, a significant humor and issue involvement
   interaction effect emerged for threat persuasion ads; low-involvement
   individuals rated the humor ad more positively than the nonhumor ad, and
   the opposite was true for high-involvement individuals. With threat
   intensities varied in Study 2, the results indicated that the
   effectiveness of various threat intensity and humor combinations
   depended on the individual's issue involvement. Implications for both
   theory and practice are discussed.

AB Advertising in online games has grown considerably in recent years and
   is expected to see continued expansion (Cauberghe and DePelsmacker
   2010). However, the literature suggests that banner advertisements in
   games are sometimes ineffective, often being seen as annoying and
   potentially triggering avoidance behavior. Because of the possibility of
   avoidance it is important to examine whether gamers have implicit memory
   of banner ads even if they don't explicitly recall them. The experiment
   conducted here measures both explicit and implicit memory of a banner ad
   in an advergame to assess whether and how well the game players exposed
   to the ad remembered it. Results suggest that a high proportion of the
   gamers exposed to the ads did have explicit and implicit memory of the
   messages shown. Moreover, gamers who were high achievers reported a
   higher level of implicit memory than those who were less effective at
   playing games, suggesting that these ads can be remembered despite a
   high level of concentration on the game. These findings are consistent
   with the notion that banner ads have a stronger chance of being
   effective in advergames than in some other contexts, especially among
   avid gamers.

   the highest intention to play again in the future. These contradictory
   findings suggest to brand marketers who design advergames to be careful
   when combining multiple game features (congruity and proximity) within a

AB This article investigates beliefs that players of digital games hold
   toward the practice of in-game advertising (IGA), referred to as
   "attitudes toward in-game advertising" (AttIGA). The hedonic nature of
   IGA is the strongest, positive predictor of AttIGA. Beliefs about IGA as
   a means to lower games' prices contribute positively, and beliefs about
   fostering materialism contribute negatively to AttIGA. Further, the
   relative importance of the belief factors determining AttIGA relates to
   the playing frequency of role-playing games and racing games. The
   results contribute to theory building and practical considerations of
   digital games as an important yet underutilized advertising medium.

AB Utilizing a computerized racing game, the experiment investigates the
   influence of sensory distractions on implicit brand memory. The results
   suggest that auditory distraction inhibits retrieval of implicit brand
   memory, but visual distraction causes no significant effect. The effects
   of the character's sensory distractions appear only for familiar brands,
   probably because relatively less attention enhances the interference on
   implicitmemory. Comparatively, novel unfamiliar brands attract more
   attention, which nulls the character's sensory distraction. Therefore,
   relatively higher distraction effects on implicit memory occur for
   familiar brands.

   quantitative pretests of an advergaming definition. Exploratory findings
   revealed that parents tended to overgeneralize when identifying
   advergames. Through the use of an online survey, this study also
   examined how parental socialization styles affect parents' attitudes
   toward advergames. As predicted, results indicate that authoritarian and
   authoritative parents hold more negative perceptions toward advergames
   compared to indulgent parents, while all parenting styles exhibited
   negative leanings toward advergaming as a practice. These findings
   indicate the efficacy of parental socialization theory in explaining
   parents' perceptions and attitudes toward this new form of
   advertising-advergames. We discuss important implications for

AB Researchers have typically employed cognitive and affective measures to
   study the effectiveness of brand placements in video games. A
   psychophysiological approach to measuring effectiveness has been sorely
   lacking and is necessary to help both academics and practitioners
   further their understanding of how brand placements work. The current
   study measures individuals' orienting responses in terms of increased
   skin conductance and decreased heart rate upon exposure to brands in
   video games. Results indicate that game players register background
   advertisements subconsciously even though they may not be able to
   explicitly recall them later. There were no differences between gamers
   and nongamers in the recall and recognition of brands from the video
   game. Furthermore, brands with preexisting favorable attitudes
   automatically received further processing, suggesting orienting response
   is an indicator of initial perception rather than further elaboration.

AB Although thousands of advergames are directed at children, little is

   process differs from traditional advertising formats. Investigating the
   underlying persuasive mechanism, Study 1 shows that, for TV advertising,
   persuasion knowledge drives the persuasive effects while, for
   advergames, persuasion is mainly driven by the attitude toward the game.
   Adding advertising cues to the advergame does not increase persuasion
   knowledge but does diminish the positive attitude toward the game
   effect, influencing behavior indirectly. Study 2 demonstrates that, for
   an advergame, the persuasive mechanism does not differ between a
   commercial versus a social persuasive message.

   proposes three routes for emotional memory: attention, elaboration, and
   social cognition. Our exploratory study examines the association between
   ad-elicited emotional arousal and predetermined ad memorability, as a
   proxy for memory for the ad. Results reveal greater amygdala activation
   in memorable (versus unmemorable) ads, reinforcing the association
   between ad-elicited emotional arousal and memory for the ad. Amygdala
   activation was accompanied by activation in the brain region termed the
   superior temporal sulcus (STS), which is involved in social cognition.
   These results are indicative of a sociocognitive emotional memory
   process, which has been neglected in past research. Future research
   directions are discussed.

   lowering their expectations and using different evaluation criteria to

   entity in the case of CGAs-plays a central role in anchoring and shaping
   ad reactions. The impact of the "consumer-made" characteristic-the fact

AB Recent academic research has focused on the use of novelty and shock in

   television advertising is the use of aggressive humor; a dramatic change
   in the way humor has historically been employed. This investigation
   examines two studies of the responses of men and women to violence in
   humorous advertising. The results of both studies reveal differences in
   the responses of men and women suggesting there may be a risk in
   coupling humor with high physical violence in ads targeted toward female
   audiences. The second study examines in a path model the role of
   perceived violations of social norms and perceived humor on the
   attitudes of men and women toward the ad and the brand. The poor
   response of women to more violence with humor ads is closely related to
   their perceived violations of social norms; for men, their more positive
   response to such ads is related to their perception of humor in the ads
   with humor and stronger violence.

AB Two repeated-measure experiments examine the role of spokescharacters in

   willingness to pay a price premium (WPPP) for the brand. Based on the
   theory of anthropomorphization, the first experiment assesses the
   moderating role of the alignment between the spokescharacter personality
   and negative information. Results show that nonaligned negative
   information and personality traits offer a stronger defense for the
   brand. The second experiment extends the first by comparing the role of
   spokescharacters relative to another visual promotion tool, brand logos.
   Results show that when personality and negative information are not
   aligned, there are no significant (unfavorable) effects on brand
   attitude and trust when either spokescharacters or logos are used, but
   the brands are susceptible to unfavorable effects when the negative
   information is aligned. In addition, the spokescharacter offers somewhat
   greater protection for the brand than does the logo when the negative
   information is aligned.

   advertising as a whole. A major finding of the current research is that
   consumers tend to have a mental representation, or exemplar, of the most
   typical type of advertising-television advertising-when they report
   their Att-AiG. Therefore, in reality, Att-AiG primarily reflects
   attitudes toward television advertising. In addition, the results of our

   perceived association distance to the parent brand and extension
   category, was tested and validated using several brand extension cases.

AB False memories are generally viewed as "dumb," in the sense of being
   caused by deficient processing, but recent psychological research has
   shown that elaboration and inferences can result in " smart" false
   memories. These " smart" false memories are explained by fuzzy-trace
   theory (FTT), which assumes that they derive from comprehension of the
   meaning of experience. FTT predicts that " smart" false memories should
   be positively correlated with measured levels of Need for Cognition

   consumer, in other words, that green consumers tend to distrust green
   advertising. Study 1, a survey of U.S. consumers, found no positive
   relationship between green consumerism and general ad skepticism.
   However, green consumerism was negatively related to green advertising
   skepticism. Study 2, a survey of Austrian consumers, addressed the
   underlying mechanism of this negative relationship in a mediation
   analysis. It was shown that green consumers saw more informational
   utility in green ads than nongreen consumers did. This, in turn,
   decreased their green advertising skepticism. The emotional appeal of
   green ads, however, had no impact on green advertising skepticism.
   Findings suggest that the "dilemma for marketers who desire to target
   the green consumer" (Zinkhan and Carlson 1995, p. 5) is far less serious
   than previously thought.

   driven predominantly by playful motive. In either situation,
   celebrity-induced entertainment experiences enhance endorsed brand

   this is moderated by the type of service, customers' involvement, and

   classified as more or less hedonic/utilitarian, and more or less
   involving. Probability markers affect consumers' brand attitude and
   purchase intentions for less-involving services, while this effect is
   not significant for more-involving services. In addition, higher
   tolerance for ambiguity results in preference of hedges over pledges or
   no probability markers, while for consumers with lower tolerance for
   ambiguity the opposite holds. With regards to service type, for
   more-hedonic, less-involving services the use of hedges in advertising
   copy increases brand attitude and purchase intentions, while for
   more-utilitarian, less-involving services pledges result in highest
   levels of brand attitude and purchase intentions.

   forecasting belief that giving to charity leads to happiness. Such
   enhanced affect forecasting beliefs further improve ad attitudes, which

   results of content-analytic and experimental studies that investigate
   the occurrence and effectiveness of gender stereotyping in humorous and
   nonhumorous advertising. The findings from these studies are in line
   with the assumptions of information processing theories. They indicate
   that the way women and men are stereotyped in advertising is dependent
   on humor; in particular, traditional male stereotypes are more prevalent
   in humorous ads, whereas traditional female stereotypes are more
   prevalent in nonhumorous ads. With respect to the influence of these
   stereotypes, humor improves consumers' attitudes, particularly if
   nontraditional stereotyping is utilized instead of traditional
   stereotyping. Furthermore, humor in stereotyped advertising influences
   women more than men. Women evaluate gender portrayals more favorably and
   as more credible in humorous ads than in nonhumorous ads, particularly
   when nontraditional stereotyping instead of traditional stereotypes are
   used. These findings provide implications for gender-role and humor

   agreement on the value of creativity, there are two different
   perspectives on the key components of creativity. One perspective sees
   creativity as primarily divergence, containing elements of novelty,
   aesthetic representation, newness, and difference. The second includes,
   in addition to divergence, the concept of meaningfulness (or
   appropriateness or connectedness) to the consumer. This view argues that
   if an advertisement is not meaningful then it simply is not creative. We
   attempt to find some empirical resolution to this issue. Our findings
   indicate that divergence is indeed an important element of creativity.
   Meaningfulness, however, while certainly very important to ad
   effectiveness, appears to be a distinct and separate construct from

   of visual brand identity. Art directors define visual brand identity as
   the holistic look and feel of a brand, manifest as consistency among the
   brand, its strategy, and all its individual visual elements, ongoing
   over time. Art directors search for ownable visual elements within the
   competitive space and rely on examples of previous brand advertising to
   start ideation. We identified four possible routes that visual brand
   identity construction can take, corresponding to whether existing visual
   brand identity is strong or weak, and whether many or few client
   mandatories are imposed. The interviews also indicated that conflicts
   with clients may arise because elements that contribute to a brand's
   visual identity may be selected, in part, based on art directors'
   personal taste preferences and felt emotion. Implications for managing
   visual branding and for future research on brand identity are discussed.

   challenge are said to have a bigger impact on appreciation than simpler
   or more complex metaphors. Until now, empirical evidence has been
   scarce. This study verifies whether the tipping point can indeed be

   metaphors (in advertisements for 16 different product categories)
   varying in conceptual complexity. Mediation analyses showed that
   metaphors of moderate complexity, although comprehended less well than
   simpler metaphors, are appreciated more than simpler and more complex
   metaphors.

   Extending the expectation-disconfirmation paradigm, this article

   influence their brand attitudes. Studies 1, 2, and 3 tested these
   predictions by exploring consumers' expectations with regard to
   creativity, humor, and specific ad features (e.g., spokescharacters) in
   new commercials. The findings support the predictions; both value-laden

   but many studies thus far have been content analytic in nature. To gain
   a better understanding of who will find comedic violence ads humorous
   and thus have favorable brand perceptions, two experimental studies were
   conducted with gender identity as an influential factor. In Study 1,
   masculine individuals responded more favorably to highly violent and
   humorous ads than feminine individuals did. Study 2 varied the violence
   level in the comedic violence ads and found that when violence was low
   both masculine and feminine individuals responded similarly to the
   comedic violence ad, but when violence was high masculine individuals
   responded more favorably than did feminine individuals. Perceived humor
   was found to be an important mediator of comedic violence ad processing.
   Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are provided.

AB Drawing on schema theory and advertising rhetoric, this article
   contributes to research on incongruent communication with three studies
   exploring consumer responses across different degrees of ad-brand
   incongruity. Study 1 reveals an inverted U-shaped pattern, indicating
   the superiority of moderate incongruity on ad processing time, recall,
   and attitude toward the ad (A(ad)) and the brand (A(b)). Studies 2A and
   2B replicate this pattern and further demonstrate that the affect
   already stored in the brand schema drives brand attitude formation for
   congruent and extremely incongruent ads, whereas both schema- and
   stimulus-based affect determine brand attitude for moderately
   incongruent ads. Study 2B also shows that participants are able to
   resolve ad-brand incongruity and comprehend the ad unless discrepancies
   are extreme. Finally, it is revealed that comprehension of more
   cognitively challenging ads mediates the effect of incongruity on both
   A(ad) and A(b).

   cumulative perceptions of the global value of a brand's past
   advertising. In five empirical studies we show that advertising equity
   is a distinct facet of brand equity, not fully captured by established
   measures of brand equity in terms of brand communication effects and
   brand loyalty. What is more, advertising equity is found to affect
   consumer willingness to voluntarily approach advertising for a brand.
   The findings indicate that advertising equity captures an aspect of
   brand equity which has not yet been studied and that further research to
   better capture the concept and its effects is warranted. We conclude by
   discussing potential implications of advertising equity in terms of
   advertising budgeting and forecasting, pretesting and evaluations of
   advertising, as well as negotiating media and co-branding partnerships.

AB For print advertising, it has been shown that rhetorical figures, tropes
   in particular, are used abundantly and that the effect on ad
   appreciation depends on the ad being perceived as comprehensible. To
   help the audience arrive at the intended interpretation, sometimes
   anchoring information is provided. The question is to what extent the
   same holds for TV commercials. A content analysis of 200 TV commercials
   revealed that the vast majority contained tropes and (verbal and visual)
   anchoring information that either hinted at the intended interpretation
   or spelled it out completely; this anchoring information could be
   presented before/during the trope or after. For each commercial,
   aggregated consumer response data were analyzed. Verbally and visually
   spelling out the intended interpretation increased the perceived
   comprehensibility. For the visual anchoring information, this led to
   higher appreciation scores; for verbal anchoring information, increased
   comprehensibility canceled out the negative effect on appreciation
   caused by providing this information. Verbal anchoring information
   presented after the trope improved appreciation compared to it being
   presented before or during. Advertisers appear to take into account that
   solving the riddle posed by a trope may be difficult if the processing
   pace is set by the medium and provide additional help.

   songs to conduct a 2 (prominence) x 2 (hip-hop culture identity) x 2
   (congruence) experiment, the authors establish that brand prominence
   positively impacts memory; thus, brands that appear in a song's chorus
   may be recalled more often than those appearing in the verse. A
   significant interaction between prominence and congruence revealed that
   subtly placing incongruent brands may enhance brand attitudes; however,
   contrary to extant literature, highly prominent placements of congruent
   brands enhance brand attitudes. While no significant interaction between
   hip-hop culture identity (HHCI) and congruence was found, individuals
   with high levels of HHCI had more positive attitudes toward the
   congruent brand despite exposure to said brand.

AB Identity appealsmarketing communications that invoke one of the target
   market's identitiesare typically well liked by consumers. In contrast
   with this notion, this research examines a situation when consumers
   respond negatively to identity appeals in advertising. Through three
   studies, we find that identity appeals fail when consumers judge an
   identity-congruent ad as portraying information about them that they
   would rather not have widely broadcast. In these cases,
   self-presentation concerns arise, leading to ad dislike. Thus, although
   identity-congruent ads resonate with consumers, such ads may lead to
   negative responses if consumers believe the ad airs their dirty laundry.
   We discuss implications for targeted advertising and identity marketing

AB Consumer embarrassment is a concern for many advertisers. Yet little is
   known about ad-induced embarrassment. The authors investigate when and
   why consumers experience embarrassment as a result of exposure to
   socially sensitive advertisements. The theory distinguishes between
   viewing potentially embarrassing ads together with an audience that
   shares the social identity targeted by the ad and viewing the same ads
   together with an audience that does not share the targeted social
   identity. Four studies provide support for the theory, demonstrating
   that advertising targeting and social context jointly influence feelings
   of embarrassment and advertising effectiveness. These findings have
   important theoretical and practical implications for advertisers.

AB This article investigates the influence of perceived source credibility
   on the effectiveness of health-related public service announcements
   (PSAs) and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communications. Findings
   indicate that online commenters who are perceived to be credible are
   instrumental in influencing consumers' responses to pro- versus
   antivaccination online PSAs. Results further suggest it is not the
   advertising message (i.e., the PSA-advocated position) alone that
   influences consumers' responses (even when consumers perceive the PSA
   sponsor to be highly credible) but rather the commenters' reactions to
   the claims presented in the PSA that also independently contribute to
   consumers' vaccination attitudes and behavioral intentions. Finally,
   results also show that when the relevant expertise of online commenters
   is identified, the effectiveness of the PSA's advertising message is
   moderated by the interactive effect of the online comments and their
   associated perceived credibility.

AB This meta-analysis assessed the persuasive effects of narratives in
   health communication. A search of the literature identified 25 studies
   (N = 9,330) that examined the effects of narratives on persuasion as
   measured by changes in attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. Analyses of
   the effect sizes indicated that, overall, narratives had a small impact
   on persuasion (r = .063, p < .01). Narratives delivered via audio and
   video produced significant effects; print-based narratives, however, did
   not exhibit a significant impact. Further, not all health issues were
   equally affected by narrative messages aiming at intervention. Those
   narratives that advocated detection and prevention behaviors led to
   significant effects, whereas those advocating cessation behaviors did
   not have significant effects. These findings offer both theoretical and
   practical implications.

AB Certain health issues such as mental illness and sexually transmitted
   infections evoke feelings of shame, which typically causes withdrawal
   coping, making it challenging for campaign planners to effectively
   communicate pertinent information in intervention messages. In three
   experimental studies, humor is tested as an advertising strategy that
   might attenuate the negative effects of shame and increase message
   persuasion. As an individual factor that correlates with social anxiety
   and vulnerability to shame, fear of negative evaluation (FNE) is found
   to be a significant moderator to shame and humor level interaction. Low
   FNEs favored humor ads over no-humor ads when shame induction was low
   but favored no-humor ads over humor ads when shame induction was high.
   This response pattern was in contrast to the patterns found for high
   FNEs. The results show the strongest humor benefits for socially anxious
   individuals (high FNEs) with high shame-inducing health issues.
   Theoretical and practical implications are given.

   persuasive messaging can occur by removing the myth and presenting the
   message in a fact-only frame. In Study 2, we optimize the processing of
   the MFMF by including rhetorical questions, which increases elaboration
   of the message content, thus enhancing the likelihood of forming strong,
   positive attitudes toward the mentally ill.

   multitasking is not always detrimental to memory for ads. Two studies
   explored how analytic and holistic processing styles (trait or mood
   induced) affect perceptual processing. Similar to previous findings,
   people processing in an analytic style showed decreased ad recognition
   when performing multiple tasks; however, ad recognition did not decrease
   for people processing holistically. People who were processing
   holistically also demonstrated better recollection memory for the ads
   seen while multitasking than did analytic processors. Differences in
   advertising recognition measures (familiarity and recollection), load
   types, and implications for advertising are also discussed.

AB Given the significant increase in the number of ethnic consumers, firms
   attempt to utilize various marketing communication strategies and
   tactics to promote their brands to these ethnically diverse groups.
   Similarly, many marketers are striving for brand crossovers by
   introducing ethnic offerings to new audiences. This research focuses on
   one such ethnic marketing communication strategythe use of accented
   spokespersons. Building on a prosodic theory of accent, we propose that
   certain prosodic features (i.e., intonation) connote associations of
   sincerity and trustworthiness and thus affect brand sincerity
   perceptions. The current research also demonstrates that the effect of
   intonation depends on the degree of congruity between product ethnicity
   and a spokesperson's accent. Our results reveal that when these
   variables are congruent, consumers rely on the cues that are consistent
   with the advertising appeals. Thus, when a message uses a sincerity
   appeal, falling (versus rising) intonation leads to greater attributions
   of brand sincerity, whereas when a message uses a competence appeal,
   rising (versus falling) intonation triggers higher perceptions of brand
   sincerity. In the condition of incongruity, consumers aim to resolve the
   incongruity and rely on cues that connote the trustworthiness of a
   message (i.e., falling intonation). Theoretical and managerial
   implications conclude the article.

AB When should marketers emphasize attributes or benefits in their

   studies suggest that when a purchase is planned for the distant future
   or when construal levels are high, benefit-based appeals are more
   persuasive than attribute-based appeals. By contrast, when a purchase is
   planned for the near future or when consumers are predisposed to low
   construal levels, attribute-based appeals are equally as persuasive as
   benefit-based appeals. However, when low construal levels are
   temporarily induced using a mind-set manipulation, attribute-based
   appeals are found to be more persuasive than benefit-based appeals.
   Moreover, we demonstrate how these effects occur only when processing
   fluency is uninhibited. This research establishes an important link
   between these appeal types and construal levels, subsequently
   demonstrating when marketers should use these appeals.

   culture positioning (GCCP) strategies can be effective across markets.
   This study compares the content of a large sample of U.S. versus
   Japanese television advertising and looks at several executional
   variables (timing and counting variables) used in prior studies to
   explore whether global brands use more similar executions across the
   United States and Japan in comparison with local brands. Results
   indicate fewer differences for global brands on these dimensions. This
   pattern of results appears to be consistent with the notion that the use
   of GCCP strategies aimed at responding to the trend toward global
   consumer culture have taken hold and that for global brands it is more
   possible to standardize executions, in addition to strategy, than was
   the case in the past. However, results suggest that the amount of time
   that visuals are on screen is more difficult to standardize than other
   elements of the ad, and that ads for services show somewhat more
   similarities than ads for physical products. Theoretical and managerial
   implications are discussed.

   persuasive with a proximal temporal frame (versus distal frame). Message
   frame valence (gain versus loss) moderates the interplay between
   temporal frame and self-view. In addition, message concreteness and
   message persuasiveness are revealed as mediators to the interplay
   between temporal frame and self-view. Interestingly, the mediating
   process varies depending on one's accessible self-view. These findings
   offer guidance for health communication marketers' use of temporal

   exposures that maximize consumer response to an ad. The results show
   that in an experimental setting maximum attitude is reached at
   approximately ten exposures, while recall increases linearly and does
   not level off before the eighth exposure. The findings are of interest
   for two opposing schools of thought in the advertising literature on
   effective frequency. They support the repetitionists' beliefs over the
   minimalists' beliefs on the number of ad exposures needed for maximum
   consumer response. The study further investigates whether the repetition
   effects depend on contingent factors. Low involvement and spaced
   exposures enhance repetition effects on attitude toward the brand.
   Embedded advertising and massed exposures enhance the repetition effects
   on recall. Repetition effects decay over time for both attitude toward
   the brand and recall. The study provides important implications for
   researchers by contributing to the discussion on effective frequency and
   providing support for the repetitionists' view. This view has
   implications for practitioners who try to optimize advertising

AB Concurrent sponsorship, that is, when several brands simultaneously
   sponsor the same event, is a common yet understudied marketing
   communication situation. The research presented in this article explores
   the transfer of image that takes place among the sponsoring brands in
   this situation. The results of two experiments reveal that this image
   transfer is due to stereotypic processing. Additional analyses delineate
   more specifically the stereotyping process at work. They show first that
   the stereotype is ad hoc, rather than based on some a priori developed
   mental schema, and therefore that it is construed from the images
   associated with the concurrent sponsoring brands. And second, that brand
   stereotyping serves a cognitive rather than an evaluative function, thus
   suggesting a valence-neutral process whose outcomes can be beneficial or
   detrimental to a focal sponsor, depending on the images initially
   associated with the other sponsors. The implications of these findings
   for sponsorship research and practice are discussed, along with research
   limitations and future research avenues.

AB This research investigates a frequently encountered and important

   advertisements. Three empirical studies find support for a
   profile-fluency effect: Profile images of products facing inward (versus
   outward) toward the center (versus edge) of an ad are easier for
   consumers to process and result in more positive consumer evaluations.
   In addition, there is evidence that this effect depends on the shopping
   goal of the consumer. The results have clear implications for current
   practices in advertising and offer opportunities for future research.

AB Programming that depicts or implies death constitutes a vital component
   of daily television broadcasts, yet the impact of such programming on
   the evaluation of embedded advertising remains unexplored. Using terror
   management theory, we propose that exposure to routine and commonplace
   death-related television programming will lead to the differential
   evaluation of ensuing advertisements depending on whether they are
   perceived to be of domestic or foreign origin, and that this effect is
   contingent on the nature of the death-related cognitions at play at the
   time of ad exposure. Further, the death-related program context effects
   on embedded advertising are uniqueads at the end, not the beginning, of
   the embedded pod are affected by programming content. Based on the
   empirical findings from four studies we identify the cognitive processes
   underlying consumers' ad evaluation, isolate the pod positions when
   context effects are observed, and suggest a framework for television
   commercial scheduling.

AB The present study examines the effects of regulatory focus, social

   advertising messages. Results indicate that when asked to make judgments
   for distant entities, individuals are more persuaded by a
   promotion-focused frame in terms of ad attitudes, and responsible
   drinking attitudes and intentions, whereas there are no differential
   framing effects on judgments associated with proximal entities. The
   findings suggest the moderating effects of social distance on regulatory
   focus consistent with construal-level theory. In addition, in examining
   boundary conditions the results reveal that the construal-level effects
   are dependent on individuals' involvement levels.

   effect plays an important role in health advertising. The present
   research investigates the moderating role of sensitivity to feelings of
   fluency (or processing ease) on the truth effect. The truth effect was
   more pronounced when the need for affect was high rather than low (Study
   1) and when consumers were primed to trust their feelings (Study 2).
   Finally, Study 3 and Study 4 replicate these findings using advertising
   appeals. Advertisements that encourage consumers to focus on their
   feelings increase susceptibility to the truth effect.

   could be either more or less trusting of marketing. Thus, this article
   explores religiosity's influence on broad marketplace trust that
   influences more specific relational trust in the context of advertising
   messages. Study 1 shows that marketplace and relational trust positively
   mediate the relationship between religiosity and product evaluations.
   Studies 2 and 3 test moderators to this relationship based on three

   on first-person effects (FPEs) in the context of scarcity appeals in
   advertising, using influence of presumed influence, a broader and less
   restrictive theoretical perspective compared to FPEs, to develop a
   revised conceptual model. Specifically, we hypothesize that it is the
   perceived influence on self and others, rather than the difference
   between them as hypothesized by Eisend (2008), that mediates the impact
   of value perception on purchase intention. Using a student sample
   similar to Eisend (2008), albeit with a different product category and
   advertising stimulus, we found value perception has a direct positive
   effect on the perceived influence on others that affects the perceived
   influence on self, which in turn influences purchase intention. Besides
   offering an alternative model for future researchers to explore the role
   of scarcity appeals in advertising, our findings may also help
   advertisers focus on the perceived influence on others and use it to
   influence consumers' own value perceptions and purchase intentions.

AB Advertising creative is widely accepted as critical to advertising
   success. However, generalizations of what works in applied settings
   across different conditions are few. The present study replicates the
   seminal work of Stewart and Furse (1986), who investigated the effect of
   more than 150 creative devices on several copy-testing measures of
   advertising effectiveness. We replicate the analysis using the original
   codebook but examine the link to in-market, short-term sales
   effectiveness. We use a large sample of 312 television ads from several
   product categories aired in multiple countries. Our findings indicate
   that the codebook remains relevant for characterizing current
   advertising practices but many of the creative devices found most (or
   least) effective differ to those from the original study. Similar to
   Stewart and Furse (1986), no single creative device can do much alone to
   explain sales effectiveness. There is no one simple cookbook for making
   sales effective advertising, though such research offers some important
   guidelines.

   omitted from articles due to the value of journal space. We replicate
   and extend Reid, Rotfeld, and Wimmer (1982) by measuring authors'
   compliance with requests to share their study's details, which are
   needed to replicate their published empirical advertising journal
   articles. More than a third of authors did not share enough details of
   the requested study to enable independent replication and extension of
   their work. Extending earlier research, we find that obtaining details
   of author-generated data is much easier (75%) than public secondary data
   (44%). Obtaining details of third-party data was largely impossible. We
   also found important differences in compliance with requests for
   replication information across journals. Our results have implications
   for advertising knowledge generation and the ability to independently
   replicate published research. We offer suggestions to improve and

AB While widely considered an effective resource for communicating the

   with graphic pictorial warnings remains underresearched. The authors use
   an advertising context to replicate and extend findings of Kees and
   colleagues' (2010) study of the direct and indirect effects of graphic
   pictorial cigarette warnings. Across three studies, moderate and high
   graphic warnings are shown to have favorable effects on smoking
   cessation outcomes, a positive effect on attention to the ad, and a
   negative indirect effect on brand purchase intentions, relative to
   text-only or low graphic pictorial warnings. Evoked fear is confirmed as
   a primary mediating mechanism underlying effects. However, these results
   indicate that the high graphic level warning examined does not produce
   significantly stronger effects than a moderate warning. Implications are
   offered for researchers interested in countervailing persuasive messages
   in advertising and recent U.S. litigation regarding use of pictorial
   warnings in advertising and on product packaging.

   observed asymmetric language effects for local firms but not for

   proposes and tests two routes (language expectation and language-based

   Study 2 suggest that slogan evaluations for MNCs were determined via the
   language expectation route, whereas evaluations for local firms were
   determined via the language-based association route. This research

   choices in advertising than bilinguals do. Possible explanations and

AB Can single pairing of background music with an advertised product
   condition choice behavior? Gorn's (1982) demonstration of this effect
   remains controversial given his unconventional conditioning procedure,
   unusual data analyses, probably confounded stimuli, and possible demand
   artifacts. We review prior criticism and conduct three conceptual
   replications (N = 182, 224, 127) circumventing these problems. Study 1
   finds (weak) significant musical conditioning effects for
   low-involvement products. Study 2 fails to find effects for
   higher-involvement products. Study 3 showed conditioning of general
   brand and product evaluations but not of specific brand-related
   evaluations. Demand artifacts play a minor role; contingency awareness
   (marginally) amplifies conditioning effects across studies.

AB This article explores the nature of causality between advertising and
   sales for two mature brands in different industries (carbonated soft
   drinks and smokeless tobacco) using more than three decades of time
   series data. The empirical results suggest that advertising and sales
   for both brands move in tandem over the long term, but only when
   controlling for economic climate. The results further imply that for
   Brand CSD (carbonated soft drinks), advertising and sales appear
   causally unrelated in the short run, while significant one-way causality
   exists from sales to advertising in the long run. This suggests that
   advertising investments over the long term are dependent on sales
   revenues, opposite to what is commonly perceived. A similar advertising
   policy may be in place over the short term for Brand T (tobacco). The
   analysis extends prior research by revisiting the advertising or sales
   assessment using current data from mature industries. We contend that
   advertising expenditures are subject to change based on sales volume in
   slow-growth industries.

   Distinctiveness theory and social identity theory are used to study the
   effect of embedding African American cultural ethnic primes beyond the
   use of ethnic minority models in ads on ad attitude, brand attitude, and
   purchase intentions. Empirical results show that African American
   consumers respond significantly different when viewing a high African
   American cultural ethnic primed ad compared to a low and high white
   cultural ethnic primed ad (i.e., high, low = high, low levels of African
   American cultural ethnic primes found embedded in the ad). No
   significant responses from African American consumers were found when
   exposed to a high African American cultural ethnic primed ad versus a
   low African American cultural ethnic primed ad. This indicates it is not
   enough to include cultural ethnic primes beyond ethnic minority models
   to influence significantly different responses. This study recommends
   that situational and psychological factors (e.g., strength of ethnic
   identification, ethnic self-awareness, usage rate of cultural ethnic
   primes in media and geographic location of target audience, levels of
   ethnocentrism, and proportion of minority group to overall population in
   geographic location of target audience) need to be considered by
   marketers to increase ad effectiveness.

AB Marketers are progressively using product placements to counteract

   consumers are increasingly multitasking while they watch videos, which
   might affect placement effectiveness. In France we conceptually
   replicate research on product-plot integration and multitasking that was
   originally conducted in the United States to analyze how different
   levels of cognitive charge influence this phenomenon. Results show that
   participants under moderate cognitive load liked intrusive placements.
   However, participants under high cognitive load were significantly less
   positive toward intrusive placements. The results show a potential
   U-shaped relationship between placement integration and levels of
   cognitive load.

   The role of client willingness to explore ideas is again found to be a

   others. Although some of the complex interactions found by Koslow,
   Sasser, and Riordan (2006) were not replicated, additional analyses
   suggest other patterns in the data. Some marketer-related factors, such
   as client sophistication and the use of consumer research, improve how
   strategic campaigns are, but they do so at the cost of originality. The
   net effect on the total creativity of a campaign may be minimal, but the
   creative character may change dramatically. Again, marketers seeking

AB Media multitasking, such as using handheld devices like smartphones and
   tablets while watching TV, has become prevalent, but its effect on the
   recall and recognition of advertising has been the subject of limited
   academic research. We contend that the context in which multitasking
   takes place affects consumer memory for advertising delivered via the
   primary activity (e.g., watching television). Specifically, we identify
   the importance of the degree of (a) congruence between the primary and
   second screen activity and (b) social accountability of second-screen
   activities. We test our typology empirically by examining the
   determinants of next-day recall and recognition for billboard
   advertisers (perimeter board advertisements) of a televised soccer
   match. In line with our theory, in most cases media multitasking leads
   to worse recall and recognition. However, in situations where there is
   congruence between primary- and second-screen activities, and secondary
   activities have a higher level of social accountability attached to
   them, advertising recall and recognition improves.

   consumer responses following ambiguous product-harm crises. These
   effects are moderated by promotion depth (i.e., the monetary value of a
   promotion) and brand reputation. Results show that for low-depth
   promotions, donation is more effective than price discount when the
   product-harm crisis involves moderately reputable brands. Importantly,
   the authors identify blame attribution as the mediating mechanism

   studies demonstrate how the effectiveness of consensus claims in ads is
   circumscribed to specific individuals and that interpersonal attachment
   style is a key moderator. Specifically, among individuals with secure
   attachment styles, depicting consensus claims in ads enhances consumers'
   intentions to purchase the advertised product, but among individuals
   with anxious attachment styles, consensus claims are a less effective
   advertising tactic as they result in lower intentions to purchase the

AB Advertisers often use scarcity appeals to influence consumers, with
   announcements such as hurry, limited quantities, and limit: two per
   customer. Based on a persuasion knowledge framework, we show in three
   studies that the effect of scarcity appeals on product evaluation is
   moderated by consumers' expectation of scarcity, such that scarcity
   appeals have a positive effect when expectation of scarcity is high but
   not when it is low. We also show that this interaction effect holds for
   expectation of scarcity due to demand as well as supply, and that
   cognitive load constitutes a boundary condition for this effect. These
   findings contribute to the literature by identifying expectation of
   scarcity as a moderator, persuasion knowledge as a mechanism, and
   cognitive load as a boundary condition for the effect of scarcity
   appeals on product evaluation. From a managerial perspective, this
   research indicates that scarcity appeals are more effective when
   consumers have high compared to low expectations of scarcity; that
   activation of persuasion knowledge can eliminate the positive effect of
   scarcity appeals; and that cognitive load can reinstate the positive
   effect of scarcity appeals on product evaluation.

AB I review the changing advertising landscape and suggest that the
   definition of advertising has inherently changed. Using the current
   advertising context, I develop research questions that consumer behavior
   scholars are well poised to address. This research agenda is rooted in
   real-world observations about advertising and can help us develop new
   theories about when, how, and why advertising influences and persuades
   consumers. A recurring theme in this article is that consumers may be
   misled due to information overload from multiple channels and sources. I
   use the advertising-as-conversation metaphor to derive hypotheses and
   test one such hypothesis in an experiment. I end with a summary and
   discussion of advertising impact measurement.

   Based on these, and a survey of advertising academics and professionals,
   we formulate an updated working definition of advertising as
   brand-initiated communication intent on impacting people. We also test
   and validate this definition and the three dynamics in a content
   analysis of recently published advertising research (2010 to 2015). In
   doing so, we hope to contribute to a more diverse and contemporary

AB In this opinion piece, the author speculates on the future of
   advertising. Arguing that the challenge of predicting the future lies
   mainly in the lack of an acceptable definition of the field, the author
   solves that problem by developing a set of postulates to create
   boundaries for the theory and practice of the discipline. The postulates
   of the present discipline are used as the base from which the future
   might evolve. Three scenarios are proposed for the future of
   advertising: (1) creeping incrementalism, (2) reversal of buyer/seller
   roles, and (3) reinvention of the field. The author suggests that those
   scenarios will develop and play out based on the developmental speed and
   acceptance of the various technologies identified.

AB The future of advertising and marketing communications will be marked by
   an increasingly diverse collection of new digital options added to the
   traditional media and communication options already available to
   marketers. By taking advantage of the unique strengths of different
   communication options, and combining them and sequencing them
   strategically, marketers have the opportunity to drive sales and build
   brands in ways never before possible. Doing so, however, will require
   new concepts, new tools, and new thinking. Toward that goal, this
   article describes seven integrated marketing communications (IMC) choice
   criteria that marketers can use to judge how effectively and efficiently
   they have assembled their IMC programs. The article also outlines five
   priority areas for future research to help further guide the successful
   design and implementation of IMC programs.

AB Technology has irreversibly changed the way that firms identify who is
   more likely to buy, what they are more likely to buy, when they are more
   likely to buy, why they are likely to buy, and how they are likely to
   buy, repurchase, and recommend. It is now easier than ever for firms to
   have a body of evidence in the form of actual insights, as opposed to
   having mere guestimates, on consumers' apparent intentions to buy. Power
   dynamics have changed in the marketing climate, and firms have to factor
   in not only aggressive competitors but also empowered customers with
   limited attention spans. In such a climate, what lies in the future for
   advertising? And how can marketing managers make the most of the
   changing climate and maximize their returns on advertising? How can
   academics advance research related to maximizing the effectiveness and
   efficiency of advertising? These are the questions that this article
   addresses via an integrated framework that expounds all the factors
   related to customers, firms, technological environment, and data
   resources, as well as the contextual factors, including product life
   cycle, customer life cycle, and so on, and their collective impact on
   advertising strategy, which includes advertising content, media

AB Color plays a significant role in firms' strategic marketing
   communications and advertising. This research examines how color (red
   versus blue) in advertising and marketing communications that follow a
   firm's failure dynamically influences consumers' interpretations of
   negative firm information and sensitivity to the firm's response to the
   failure. We find that the color red used in postfailure advertising and
   firm marketing communications narrows the scope of consumers' conceptual
   attention on the firm failure and makes consumers less sensitive to a
   firm's response to the failure. In contrast, exposure to the color blue
   expands the scope of consumers' conceptual attention and makes them
   integrate the firm's response in their firm evaluations. In addition,
   the negative effect of red is mitigated via the use of a more benign
   cue, leading to the broadening of the scope of conceptual attention and
   integration of a firm's response that are consistent with blue cues.

AB Multiscreening, a relatively new form of media multitasking in which
   people use multiple screens simultaneously, has implications for the
   effects of persuasive messages due to limited cognitive capacities of
   people and concurrent modalities of the screens (i.e., both visual). The
   aim of the study is to examine underlying mechanisms (i.e., recognition,
   counterarguing, and enjoyment) of the effect of multiscreening on
   evaluative outcomes (i.e., brand attitude, message attitude, and
   purchase intention). The experiment (N = 182) showed that both
   recognition and counterarguing are underlying mechanisms of the effect
   of multiscreening on evaluative outcomes. Multiscreening has a negative
   effect on evaluative outcomes by recognition and a positive effect on
   evaluative outcomes by counterarguing.

AB In two studies, we explored the effect of media multitasking on viewers'
   cognitive and attitudinal responses to television commercials and the
   moderating role of advertising appeals. The limited capacity theory of
   Lang (2000) that integrates both the motivational and cognitive ability
   aspects of information processing was used as the theoretical framework.
   The results of Study 1 show that, in line with previous findings, media
   multitasking negatively affects cognitive responses but has an overall
   positive effect on attitudinal responses to television commercials. The
   results of Study 2 suggest that this effect on attitudinal responses is
   present only for commercials that focus on the desirability (compared to
   the feasibility) of a product. The results indicate that in media
   multitasking contexts, television commercials that rely primarily on
   stressing the desirability of a product have both a cognitive and an
   attitudinal advantage compared to those that rely primarily on stressing
   the feasibility of a product.

AB Previous research shows that negative emotional charity appeals tend to
   be more effective than other emotional charity appeals because they
   evoke sympathy. However, feelings of loneliness reduce individuals'
   ability to sympathize with others. Based on grounded cognition research,
   we propose that exposure to images of cold objects will lead to feelings
   of physical coldness, which in turn will increase perceptions of
   loneliness, such that negative emotional charity appeals that are viewed
   following exposure to cold (versus neutral or warm) images will be less
   effective at eliciting donations. Findings from four studies provide
   support for this hypothesis and delineate the link between the presence
   of certain commonplace visual images in the media and their influence on
   the effectiveness of embedded negative charity appeals, and identify a
   new context effect that attenuates the effectiveness of charity appeals.

   research addresses this oversight and finds that transgressions
   committed by a brand negatively impact consumers' attitudes toward the

   mediated by perceptions of responsibility and moral reputation. Finally,
   we identify two response strategies that a celebrity can employ to
   mitigate the negative effects of the brand's transgression on the
   celebrity's reputation. However, the effectiveness of these strategies

AB Images of pristine nature constitute frequent elements of visual
   advertising design. Research on the effectiveness of such imagery has
   been scarce, however. Which psychological processes are involved? Do all
   individuals react equally to nature advertising imagery? Based on
   environmental psychology theory, the present research analyzes the
   effectiveness of the use of nature imagery in non-green advertising and
   the underlying processes involved. We conduct three experimental
   studies, two with student samples and one with a representative
   population sample, to test the effects of visual advertising stimuli
   featuring nature versus urban and indoor scenery. Findings contribute to
   research in two ways: First, emotional ad responses that are similar to
   the feelings experienced in nature as well as the retrieval of positive
   autobiographical memories are identified as intervening processes by
   which nature advertising imagery increases attitude toward the ad (Aad)
   and brand (Abr). Second, results indicate these processes are moderated
   by consumers' green traits, with green consumers being more susceptible
   to the persuasive effects of nature advertising imagery even though
   advertisements were non-green. The processes are further-moderated by
   the accessibility of memory of past nature experiences. These findings
   enrich our knowledge on the effects of specific visual appeals and
   provide practical implications for visual advertising effectiveness.

AB This research compares consumer response to traditional green
   advertising appeals to that of less conventional, "green demarketing"
   (GD) appeals-messages by for-profit companies encouraging reduced
   category consumption for the sake of the environment. Rather than
   encouraging greener consumption, modern environmentalism calls for
   decreased consumption overall, a trend reflected in recent advertising
   campaigns (e.g., Patagonia's "Don't Buy This Jacket"). Despite its
   potential impact and unconventionality, research on GD in general is
   sparse, and no empirical research has examined consumer response to GD
   appeals relative to traditional green appeals. In three experiments, we
   find that, in the context of product advertising, consumers' attitudes
   for green ads are more favorable than those for GD ads, mediated by
   greater inferences of genuine environmental concern. However, we find
   the reverse pattern in the context of institutional ads. Further, an
   "anti-consumption amplifier" message embedded in the ad-espousing the
   potential harm of over-consumption-further boosts favorable consumer
   attitudes for the GD institutional ad relative to its traditional green
   counterpart. Importantly, we assess all effects while controlling for
   consumers' individual levels of green consumerism, such that
   implications may be applied more generally rather than to a specific
   segment of green consumers.

   consumers are more attracted to the symbolic value appeals of luxury

AB In this research, we examine plus-size female consumers' reactions to
   the use of plus-size female models in advertising. We demonstrate that
   not only objective body size but also implicit beliefs about the
   malleability of one's size affect attitudes toward a product advertised
   by a plus-size model. Further, we find that this interactive effect is
   mediated by perceived similarity to the model, and appears only when the
   plus-size model is used to advertise a body-relevant product. These
   findings contribute to the burgeoning study of larger-sized female
   models in advertising and suggest that "plus-size" is not a
   one-size-fits-all label.

AB Local and global brands alike have increasingly used code-switching to
   enhance advertising persuasion. Although this tactic is widely used,
   previous studies have focused on bilinguals but not monolinguals.
   Because of the emerging use of code-switching in advertisements in
   monolingual markets, more research efforts are required to understand
   its effectiveness and boundaries among monolinguals. This study
   investigated whether the consumers' local-global identity plays a
   moderating role in the effectiveness of code-switched advertisements
   among monolinguals. The consumers' local-global identity refers to the
   combination of local and global identities possessed by individuals that
   affect how they define themselves in relation to the social environment.
   Study 1 (manipulating consumers' local-global identity) demonstrated
   that the local-global identity moderated the effect of code-switched
   advertisements. The results indicated that the congruence between
   code-switching and the consumers' local-global identity enhanced
   persuasiveness, and that advertising involvement mediated this effect.
   Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 by using a local-global
   identity measure. These findings provide implications for branding and
   advertising strategies.

AB Narratives are a persuasive platform that evokes processing distinct
   from other message formats. Story-ending valence is a component common
   to all stories and can influence how individuals respond to and are
   persuaded by the story. The current work examines how ending valence of
   a cautionary story, a popular type of narrative that delivers a warning
   to the audience, influences story-consistent beliefs through a process
   of global reflection or understanding of the overall story message.
   Across three studies, we find a positive story ending enhances
   reflection on the message meaning and, subsequently, enhances
   story-consistent beliefs.

AB This research examines the role of syntactic complexity-complexity
   induced by the sentence structure of the text-on memory for print ads.
   The authors find that ads aimed at older adults contain significant
   complexity, which commonly used readability indexes fail to detect.
   Further, syntactic complexity adversely affects message recall in older
   (age 65 and up), but not younger, adults. This adverse effect of
   syntactic complexity on memory continues even when motivation to process
   the message is high. The authors discuss the implications of these
   findings.

AB This study measures the degree of advertising effectiveness in previous
   advertising research studies. By analyzing 324 meta-analytic effect
   sizes taken from 44 meta-analyses that included more than 1,700 primary
   studies with more than 2.4 million subjects, the meta-meta-analytic
   effect size of .2 shows that advertising is effective. The findings
   differ across advertising inputs and outcomes, and identify different
   hierarchies of effects due to different underlying processes. The source
   primarily influences attitudes and behavior due to an
   acceptability-inference process; the message influences cognitions and
   emotions due to an emotion-cognition process; strategies foster
   processing and effects on memory due to a retrieval process; and
   receiver characteristics primarily influence attitudes, cognitions, and
   emotions due to a sense-making process. These findings provide
   quantitative evidence for the effectiveness of advertising and major
   advertising tools, provide empirical generalizations for researchers and
   practitioners, and suggest a new contingency for the applicability of
   hierarchy of effects models.

   methodology applied in advertising scholarly publications, based on a
   review of articles in four leading journals: Journal of Advertising,
   Journal of Advertising Research, International Journal of Advertising,
   and Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising. This article
   first identifies two approaches in the positivist paradigm that exert
   strong impacts on the development of advertising research: the message
   effects research tradition in the communication field and the consumer
   psychology research tradition in marketing. With this background, the
   article next introduces several research questions to explore which
   methods have dominated advertising research, the role of theory building
   in affecting the adopted methods and the number of reported studies,
   differences across the journals, and the degree to which researchers
   integrate different methods or approaches (quantitative and qualitative)
   in their research. A content analysis of articles published in these
   four advertising journals from 2001 to 2015 helps address these research
   questions and reveals the current status, shifts, and trends in
   advertising research since the turn of this century.

AB Meta-analyses have become increasingly popular in many fields of the
   social sciences, including advertising research. The results of
   meta-analyses attract substantial interest from both scholars and
   practitioners, as indicated by high citation numbers and widespread
   dissemination in the media. By summarizing results drawn from a set of
   studies concerning a specific topic, and by discovering and explaining
   consistencies and inconsistencies within those results, meta-analysis is
   an essential step in the process of knowledge accumulation, theory
   building, and theory testing in science. Many developments in the last
   years have contributed to the advancement of the method, but they have
   appeared in disparate literatures. Furthermore, each discipline applies
   the method in a particular way that corresponds to the major research
   traditions in a field. However, no attempt to introduce the method to
   advertising researchers is available. The purpose of this article is
   therefore to provide a comprehensive overview of the meta-analysis
   method to advertising researchers that describes the procedures commonly
   applied in advertising research, that provides a better understanding of
   the method and evaluation criteria for judging the quality of
   meta-analyses, and that serves as a starting point for advertising
   researchers who are interested in conducting a meta-analysis.

   methodological guidelines that need to be implemented to improve the
   practice of advertising research. Their focus is on methodology, defined
   as first choosing a suitable theoretical framework to guide the research
   study and then identifying the advertising responses that need to be
   studied. Measurement of those responses is covered elsewhere in this
   special issue in the article by Bergkvist and Langner. Most of the
   frameworks are derived from the authors' own published work, although
   other frameworks are noted where appropriate.

   their own language, and multilingual research settings, where only a
   single language is used and multilingual respondents are studied either
   in their native or nonnative language. We review key principles that
   govern cross-linguistic and multilingual effects in advertising research
   to formulate guidelines for research design and data analysis. In the
   cross-linguistic context, these principles address nonuniform
   cross-linguistic differences in responses (related to nonequivalence of
   individual questionnaire items) versus uniform response effects (related
   to nonequivalence of verbal response category labels). In the
   multilingual context, we bring together evidence that shows how-even
   when comprehension is not a problem-stimuli, questions, and response
   categories may be processed differently in respondents' native versus
   nonnative language.

   published in the Journal of Advertising (JA), the Journal of Advertising
   Research (JAR), and the International Journal of Advertising (IJA)
   between 2012 and 2014. The analysis focused on the measurement of
   attitude toward the ad (A(Ad)), attitude toward the brand (A(Brand)),
   and brand purchase intention (PIBrand) because these are the most
   frequently studied constructs in advertising research. The results show
   there are weaknesses with the theoretical foundation of measures, in
   that constructs are often not defined and the measures are not taken
   from measure development studies. Moreover, there is great diversity in
   the items included in measures, the number of items in the measures, and
   in the answer scales used to capture responses, which casts doubts on
   the comparability of results from different studies. The implications of
   current measurement practice for advertising research are discussed and
   suggestions are made for how authors, editors, and reviewers can
   contribute to improved measurement practice.
