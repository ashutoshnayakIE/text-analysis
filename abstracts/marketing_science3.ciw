AB This paper studies the tendency to use negative ads. For this purpose,
   we focus on an interesting industry (political campaigns) and an
   intriguing empirical regularity (the tendency to "go negative" is higher
   in close races). We present a model of electoral competition in which
   ads inform voters either of the good traits of the candidate or of the
   bad traits of his opponent. We find that in equilibrium, the proportion
   of negative ads depends on both voters' knowledge and the candidate's
   budget. Furthermore, for an interesting subset of the parameter space,
   negativity increases in both knowledge and budget. Using data on the
   elections for the U. S. House of Representative in 2000, 2002, and 2004,
   we examine the model and its implications. Using nonstructural
   estimation, we find that negativity indeed increases in both voters'
   knowledge and the candidate's budget. Furthermore, we also find that
   knowledge and budget mediate the effect of closeness on negativity.
   Using structural estimation, we reinforce these findings. Specifically,
   we find that the model's parameters are within the subset of the
   parameter space discussed above. Thus, the evidence implies that the
   model is not only helpful in identifying variables that were ignored by
   previous studies (i.e., knowledge and budget) but also in explaining an
   intriguing empirical regularity.

AB Sponsored search advertising is ascendant-Forrester Research reports
   expenditures rose 28% in 2007 to $8.1 billion and will continue to rise
   at a 26% compound annual growth rate [VanBoskirk, S. 2007. U. S.
   interactive marketing forecast, 2007 to 2012. Forrester Research
   (October 10)], approaching half the level of television advertising and
   making sponsored search one of the major advertising trends to affect
   the marketing landscape. Yet little empirical research exists to explore
   how the interaction of various agents (searchers, advertisers, and the
   search engine) in keyword markets affects consumer welfare and firm
   profits. The dynamic structural model we propose serves as a foundation
   to explore these outcomes. We fit this model to a proprietary data set
   provided by an anonymous search engine. These data include consumer
   search and clicking behavior, advertiser bidding behavior, and search
   engine information such as keyword pricing and website design.
   With respect to advertisers, we find evidence of dynamic bidding
   behavior. Advertiser value for clicks on their links averages about 26
   cents. Given the typical $22 retail price of the software products
   advertised on the considered search engine, this implies a conversion
   rate (sales per click) of about 1.2%, well within common estimates of
   1%-2% [Narcisse, E. 2007. Magid: Casual free to pay conversion rate too
   low. GameDaily.com (September 20)]. With respect to consumers, we find
   that frequent clickers place a greater emphasis on the position of the
   sponsored advertising link. We further find that about 10% of consumers
   do 90% of the clicks.
   We then conduct several policy simulations to illustrate the effects of
   changes in search engine policy. First, we find the search engine
   obtains revenue gains of 1% by sharing individual-level information with
   advertisers and enabling them to vary their bids by consumer segment.
   This also improves advertiser revenue by 6% and consumer welfare by
   1.6%. Second, we find that a switch from a first-to second-price auction
   results in truth telling (advertiser bids rise to advertiser
   valuations). However, the second-price auction has little impact on
   search engine profits. Third, consumer search tools lead to a platform
   revenue increase of 2.9% and an increase of consumer welfare by 3.8%.
   However, these tools, by reducing advertising exposures, lower
   advertiser profits by 2.1%.

AB In many categories consumers display cyclical buying: they repeatedly
   purchase in the category for several periods, followed by several
   periods of not buying. We believe that the cyclicality is a
   manifestation of cross-category substitution by the consumer, caused by
   "variety-seeking" tendencies as well as by the firm's marketing
   activities in all relevant categories. We propose a Markov
   regime-switching random coefficient logit model to represent these
   behaviors as stochastic switching between high and low category purchase
   tendencies. The main feature of the proposed model is that it divides
   the stream of purchase decisions of a consumer into distinct regimes
   with different parameter values that characterize high versus low
   purchase tendencies. In an empirical application of the model to
   purchases of yogurt-buying households, we find that as many as 38.3%
   households display cyclicality between high and low yogurt-purchasing
   tendencies. Predictions from our proposed model track observed yogurt
   purchases of households over time closely, and the model also fits
   better than two benchmark models. Alternating between high and low
   purchase tendencies may correspond with changing levels of consumer
   inventory in a substitute category. If one ignores this phenomenon, a
   correlation between yogurt inventory and the error term in utility
   arises, leading to biased estimates. Also, we show that cyclicality in
   buying has a key implication for a firm's price promotion strategies: a
   price reduction that is offered to a household during its high
   purchasing tendency period will result in greater increases in sales
   than one that is offered during its low purchasing period. This opens up
   a new dimension for enhancing the effectiveness of promotions-customized
   timing of price reductions.

AB The dramatic impact of the current crisis on performance of businesses
   across sectors and economies has been headlining the business press for
   the past several months. Extant reconciliations of these patterns in the
   popular press rely on ad hoc reasoning. Using historical data on
   currency crisis episodes across the world, we show that the impact of
   the crisis on a firm's business is best understood by focusing on the
   impact of the crisis on the behavior of consumers. Our analyses show
   that consumer behavior in a crisis is characterized by consumption
   smoothing at various levels-intertemporal, intercategory, and
   intracategory. These behavioral adjustments result in significant
   reallocation of consumption expenditures. More importantly, the
   smoothing decisions because of a crisis are distinct and independent of
   the impact of changes in income and prices that accompany a crisis.
   Interestingly, there is marked variation in the patterns of consumption
   smoothing across different types of economies. Taken together, these
   results have important and interesting implications for managers, policy
   makers, and academics.

AB Under the sociological theory of homophily, people who are similar to
   one another are more likely to interact with one another. Marketers
   often have access to data on interactions among customers from which,
   with homophily as a guiding principle, inferences could be made about
   the underlying similarities. However, larger networks face a quadratic
   explosion in the number of potential interactions that need to be
   modeled. This scalability problem renders probability models of social
   interactions computationally infeasible for all but the smallest
   networks. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework for
   modeling customer interactions that is both grounded in the theory of
   homophily and is flexible enough to account for random variation in who
   interacts with whom. In particular, we present a novel Bayesian
   nonparametric approach, using Dirichlet processes, to moderate the
   scalability problems that marketing researchers encounter when working
   with networked data. We find that this framework is a powerful way to
   draw insights into latent similarities of customers, and we discuss how
   marketers can apply these insights to segmentation and targeting
   activities.

AB The World Wide Web contains a vast corpus of consumer-generated content
   that holds invaluable insights for improving the product and service
   offerings of firms. Yet the typical method for extracting diagnostic
   information from online content-text mining-has limitations. As a
   starting point, we propose analyzing a sample of comments before
   initiating text mining. Using a combination of real data and
   simulations, we demonstrate that a sampling procedure that selects
   respondents whose comments contain a large amount of information is
   superior to the two most popular sampling methods-simple random sampling
   and stratified random sampling-in gaining insights from the data. In
   addition, we derive a method that determines the probability of
   observing diagnostic information repeated a specific number of times in
   the population, which will enable managers to base sample size decisions
   on the trade-off between obtaining additional diagnostic information and
   the added expense of a larger sample. We provide an illustration of one
   of the methods using a real data set from a website containing
   qualitative comments about staying at a hotel and demonstrate how
   sampling qualitative comments can be a useful first step in text mining.

   the assumption that model errors are distributed normally eliminates all

   additional categories, the harmonic-mean-estimated Bayes factor selects
   the model with cross-brand pass-through 69% of the time, whereas a
   finite variance estimator of the Bayes factor selects the model with

AB The critical role of research and development (R&D) and advertising in
   the marketing strategy of the firm is well established. This paper
   conceptually and empirically examines why and how much the effectiveness
   of these two marketing instruments differs between times of economic
   expansions versus periods of economic contractions-and whether these
   results depend on the cyclicality of the industry in question. We
   consider a key marketing metric (market share) and a key financial
   metric (firm profit). Our empirical setting is 1,175 U. S. firms across
   a time period spanning over three decades. We find that R&D and
   advertising contribute to firm performance but that their effectiveness
   is not constant across the business cycle. Increasing advertising share
   in contractions has a stronger effect on profit and market share than
   increasing advertising share in expansions. Likewise, investments in R&D
   in contractions lead to higher gains in market share and profit than R&D
   investments in expansions, albeit only in subsequent years. If in
   contractions the firm faces tight budget constraints and has to choose
   between either maintaining R&D or advertising, our simulation results
   show that maintaining R&D is associated with better company performance.
   We find that advertising effectiveness, in general, and in contractions,
   in particular, is systematically moderated by the degree of cyclicality
   of the industry in which the firm operates. In relatively stable
   industries, advertising effects are small or even nonsignificant, and
   they do not go beyond the year the firm advertises. However, in highly
   cyclical industries, advertising effects are long-lasting, its total
   effect being 50% larger (market share) and 200% larger (profits) than in
   industries of average cyclicality. The effect of industry cyclicality on
   advertising effectiveness is especially pronounced in contractions.
   Collectively, these findings provide valuable and actionable insights
   into how firms should respond to contractions in order to grow profits
   and market share.

AB Interpersonal communications have long been recognized as an influential
   source of information for consumers. Internet-based media have
   facilitated information exchange among firms and consumers, as well as
   observability and measurement of such exchanges. However, much of the
   research addressing online communication focuses on ratings collected
   from online forums. In this paper, we look beyond ratings to a more
   comprehensive view of online communications. We consider the sales
   effect of the volume of positive, negative, and neutral online
   communications captured by Web crawler technology and classified by
   automated sentiment analysis. Our modeling approach captures two key
   features of our data, dynamics and endogeneity. In terms of dynamics, we
   model daily measures of online communications about a firm and its
   products as contributing to a latent demand-generating stock variable.
   To account for the endogeneity, we extend the latent instrumental
   variable technique to account for dynamic endogenous regressors. Our
   results demonstrate a significant effect of positive, negative, and
   neutral online communications on daily sales performance. Failure to
   account for endogeneity results in a severe attenuation of the estimated
   effects. From a managerial perspective, we demonstrate the importance of
   accounting for communication valence as well as the impact of shocks to
   positive, negative, and neutral online communications.

AB Online retailing provides an opportunity for new pricing options that
   are not feasible in traditional retail settings. This paper proposes an
   interactive, dynamic pricing strategy from the perspective of customized
   bundling to derive savings for customers while maximizing profits for
   electronic retailers ("e-tailers"). Given product costs, posted prices,
   shipping fees, and customers' reservation prices, we propose a nonlinear
   mixed-integer programming model to increase e-tailers' profits by
   sequentially pricing customized bundles. The model is flexible in terms
   of the number and variety of products customers may choose to
   incorporate during the various stages of their online shopping. Our
   computational study suggests that the proposed model not only attracts
   more customers to purchase the discounted bundle but also noticeably
   increases profits for e-tailers. This online dynamic bundle pricing
   model is robust under various bundle sizes and scenarios. It improves
   e-tailer profit and customer savings the most when facing divergent
   views about product values, lower budgets, and higher cost ratios.

   environment each year. The model accounts for marketing dynamics and a
   product's growth potential as well as for trade-offs with respect to
   marketing effectiveness and profit contribution. The model has been
   successfully implemented at Bayer, one the world's largest
   pharmaceutical and chemical firms. The profit improvement potential is
   more than 50% and worth nearly (sic)500 million in incremental

AB This paper describes the use of a marketing science model by Jetstar, a
   subsidiary of Australia's leading airline, Qantas, to effectively and
   profitably compete in the low-cost carrier marketplace. We trace the
   evolution of the Jetstar strategy from a baseline calibration of its
   initial position, to its efforts to attain price competitiveness and
   service parity, followed by its highly focused, cost-effective service
   delivery strategy. We develop a hierarchical model with parameters
   estimated at the individual level. This allows us to study not only how
   service design and pricing initiatives shift the perceived performance
   of Jetstar relative to its competitors but also how the airline can move
   market preferences toward areas in which it has competitive advantage.
   The contribution of the research is substantial. The Jetstar market
   share went from 14.0% to 18.1% during the first five quarterly waves of
   the research, and profits went from $79 million in 2006-2007, before the
   study was commissioned, to $124 million in 2008-2009.

AB A variable annuity is a popular product for investing retirement income.
   However, thousands of similar-looking variable annuity products are
   being offered by hundreds of financial service companies. In such a
   scenario, how can Prudential achieve meaningful product differentiation
   to increase the sales of its variable annuities? The solution led to the
   development and implementation of the "Emotion Quotient" (EQ) Tool. The
   EQ Tool enabled Prudential to redefine its marketing and sales approach
   along a proactive (as opposed to responsive) market orientation
   paradigm. This was accomplished by first using the EQ Tool to uncover
   and quantify the prevalence of certain emotions (such as fear and
   regret) in the prospective consumer and then pitching relevant variable
   annuity product(s) that could mitigate the specific behavioral risk
   corresponding to the prevalent emotion(s). This approach, which was
   backed by extensive research (as described in this study), enabled
   Prudential to gain over $450 million lift in variable annuity sales and
   contributed to consumer welfare by promoting awareness of behavioral
   risk to investors who are within five years of their retirement. This
   research study illustrates how industry can collaborate with academia to
   successfully apply marketing science to solve real-world business
   problems.

AB We study the bidding strategies of vertically differentiated firms that
   bid for sponsored search advertisement positions for a keyword at a
   search engine. We explicitly model how consumers navigate and click on
   sponsored links based on their knowledge and beliefs about firm
   qualities. Our model yields several interesting insights; a main
   counterintuitive result we focus on is the "position paradox." The
   paradox is that a superior firm may bid lower than an inferior firm and
   obtain a position below it, yet it still obtains more clicks than the
   inferior firm. Under a pay-per-impression mechanism, the inferior firm
   wants to be at the top where more consumers click on its link, whereas
   the superior firm is better off by placing its link at a lower position
   because it pays a smaller advertising fee, but some consumers will still
   reach it in search of the higher-quality firm. Under a pay-per-click
   mechanism, the inferior firm has an even stronger incentive to be at the
   top because now it only has to pay for the consumers who do not know the
   firms' reputations and, therefore, can bid more aggressively.
   Interestingly, as the quality premium for the superior firm increases,
   and/or if more consumers know the identity of the superior firm, the
   incentive for the inferior firm to be at the top may increase. Contrary
   to conventional belief, we find that the search engine may have the
   incentive to overweight the inferior firm's bid and strategically create
   the position paradox to increase overall clicks by consumers. To
   validate our model, we analyze a data set from a popular Korean search
   engine firm and find that (i) a large proportion of auction outcomes in
   the data show the position paradox, and (ii) sharp predictions from our
   model are validated in the data.

AB Many online shoppers initially acquired through paid search advertising
   later return to the same website directly. These so-called "direct
   type-in" visits can be an important indirect effect of paid search.
   Because visitors come to sites via different keywords and can vary in
   their propensity to make return visits, traffic at the keyword level is
   likely to be heterogeneous with respect to how much direct type-in
   visitation is generated.
   Estimating this indirect effect, especially at the keyword level, is
   difficult. First, standard paid search data are aggregated across
   consumers. Second, there are typically far more keywords than available
   observations. Third, data across keywords may be highly correlated. To
   address these issues, the authors propose a hierarchical Bayesian
   elastic net model that allows the textual attributes of keywords to be
   incorporated.
   The authors apply the model to a keyword-level data set from a major
   commercial website in the automotive industry. The results show a
   significant indirect effect of paid search that clearly differs across
   keywords. The estimated indirect effect is large enough that it could
   recover a substantial part of the cost of the paid search advertising.
   Results from textual attribute analysis suggest that branded and broader
   search terms are associated with higher levels of subsequent direct
   type-in visitation.

AB What the firm should say in an advertising message, the choice of
   content, is a critical managerial decision. Here, we focus on a
   particular aspect of the advertising content choice: an
   attribute-focused appeal versus an appeal with no direct information on
   product attributes. We make two assumptions that capture the reality of
   the advertising context. First, we assume that the bandwidth of
   advertising is limited: a firm can only communicate about a limited
   number of attributes. Second, we assume that consumers are active: they
   can choose to engage in a costly search to obtain additional
   product-related information. In this setting, we show that there exists
   an equilibrium where the high-quality firm chooses to produce messages
   devoid of any attribute information in order to invite the consumer to
   engage in search, which is likely to uncover positive information about
   the product. Whereas most of the previous literature has focused on the
   decision to advertise as a signal of quality, we show that message
   content, coupled with consumer search, can also serve as a credible
   signal of quality. In an extension, we show that our results are robust
   to endogenizing the firm's decision on the amount of advertising
   spending.

AB Marketing expenditures in the form of pricing, product development,
   promotion, and channel development are made to maximize profits. A
   challenge in evaluating the effectiveness of these expenditures is that
   decisions such as whether to lower prices or run promotions are made
   based on managers' knowledge of how sensitive consumers are to these
   marketing activities. Although marketing control variables are
   explanatory of sales, they are often set in anticipation of a market
   response, which reflects strategic behavior on the part of a firm. A
   challenge in developing a model of strategic behavior is that the
   process by which marketing expenditures are made is often not directly
   observable. We propose tests for comparing supply-side model
   formulations in which input variables are strategically determined. In
   these models, the joint likelihood of demand (y) and supply (x) can be
   factored into a conditional factor of demand given supply and into a
   marginal factor of supply. We illustrate our approach using data from a
   services company that operates in multiple geographic regions.

AB In marketing applications, it is common that some key covariates in a
   regression model, such as marketing mix variables or consumer profiles,
   are subject to missingness. The convenient method that excludes the
   consumers with missingness in any covariate can result in a substantial
   loss of efficiency and may lead to strong selection bias in the
   estimation of consumer preferences and sensitivities. To solve these
   problems, we propose a new Bayesian distribution-free approach, which
   can ensure that no customer is left behind in the analysis as a result
   of missing covariates. In this way, all customers are being considered
   in devising managerial policies. The proposed approach allows for
   flexible modeling of a joint distribution of multidimensional
   interrelated covariates that can contain both continuous and discrete
   variables. At the same time, it minimizes the impact of distributional
   assumptions involved in covariate modeling because the method does not
   require researchers to specify parametric distributions for covariates
   and can automatically generate suitable distributions for missing
   covariates. We have developed an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo
   algorithm for inference. Besides robustness and flexibility, the
   proposed approach reduces modeling and computational efforts associated
   with missing covariates and therefore makes the missing covariate
   problems easier to handle. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method using extensive simulation studies. We then illustrate the method
   in two real data examples in which missing covariates occur: a mixed
   multinomial logit discrete-choice model in a ketchup data set and a
   hierarchical probit purchase incidence model in a retail store data set.
   These analyses demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes several
   important limitations of existing approaches for solving missing
   covariate problems and offers opportunities to make better managerial
   decisions with the current available marketing databases. Although our
   applications focus on consumer-level data, the proposed method is
   general and can be applied to other marketing applications where other
   types of marketing players are the units of analysis.

AB While millions of products are sold on its retail platform, Amazon.com
   itself stocks and sells only a very small fraction of them. Most of
   these products are sold by third-party sellers who pay Amazon a fee for
   each unit sold. Empirical evidence clearly suggests that Amazon tends to
   sell high-demand products and leave long-tail products for independent
   sellers to offer. We investigate how a platform owner such as Amazon,
   facing ex ante demand uncertainty, may strategically learn from these
   sellers' early sales which of the "mid-tail" products are worthwhile for
   its direct selling and which are best left for others to sell. The
   platform owner's "cherry-picking" of the successful products, however,
   gives an independent seller the incentive to mask any high demand by
   lowering his sales with a reduced service level (unobserved by the
   platform owner).
   We analyze this strategic interaction between a platform owner and an
   independent seller using a game-theoretic model with two types of
   sellers-one with high demand and one with low demand. We show that it
   may not always be optimal for the platform owner to identify the
   seller's demand. Interestingly, the platform owner may be worse off by
   retaining its option to sell the independent seller's product, whereas
   both types of sellers may benefit from the platform owner's threat of
   entry The platform owner's entry option may reduce consumer surplus in
   the early period, although it increases consumer surplus in the later
   period. We also investigate how consumer reviews influence the market
   outcome.

AB Several researchers have proposed models of buyer behavior in
   noncontractual settings that assume that customers are "alive" for some
   period of time and then become permanently inactive. The best-known such
   model is the Pareto/NBD, which assumes that customer attrition (dropout
   or "death") can occur at any point in calendar time. A recent
   alternative model, the BG/NBD, assumes that customer attrition follows a
   Bernoulli "coin-flipping" process that occurs in "transaction time"
   (i.e., after every purchase occasion). Although the modification results
   in a model that is much easier to implement, it means that heavy buyers
   have more opportunities to "die."
   In this paper, we develop a model with a discrete-time dropout process
   tied to calendar time. Specifically, we assume that every customer
   periodically "flips a coin" to determine whether she "drops out" or
   continues as a customer. For the component of purchasing while alive, we
   maintain the assumptions of the Pareto/NBD and BG/NBD models. This
   periodic death opportunity.(PDO) model allows us to take a closer look
   at how assumptions about customer death influence model fit and various
   metrics typically used by managers to characterize a cohort of
   customers. When the time period after which each customer makes her
   dropout decision (which we call period length) is very small, we show
   analytically that the PDO model reduces to the Pareto/NBD. When the
   period length is longer than the calibration period, the dropout process
   is "shut off," and the PDO model collapses to the negative binomial
   distribution (NBD) model. By systematically varying the period length
   between these limits, we can explore the full spectrum of models between
   the "continuous-time-death" Pareto/NBD and the naive "no-death" NBD.
   In covering this spectrum, the PDO model performs at least as well as
   either of these models; our empirical analysis demonstrates the superior
   performance of the PDO model on two data sets. We also show that the
   different models provide significantly different estimates of both
   purchasing-related and death-related metrics for both data sets, and
   these differences can be quite dramatic for the death-related metrics.
   As more researchers and managers make managerial judgments that directly
   relate to the death process, we assert that the model employed to
   generate these metrics should be chosen carefully.

AB We study a duopoly model where consumers are heterogeneous with respect
   to their willingness to pay for two product characteristics and marginal
   costs are increasing with the quality level chosen on each attribute. We
   show that although firms seek to manage competition through product
   positioning, their differentiation strategies critically depend on how
   costly it is to provide higher quality. When the cost of providing
   quality is not too high, firms use only one attribute to differentiate
   their products: they maximally differentiate on one dimension and
   minimally differentiate on the other (a Max-Min equilibrium).
   Furthermore, they always differentiate along the dimension with the
   greater attribute range. As for the dimension with the smaller range and
   along which they agglomerate, firms either choose the highest quality
   level or the lowest quality level possible, depending on whether the
   marginal costs of quality provision are low or intermediate,
   respectively. However, for larger quality provision costs, firms exploit
   both dimensions to differentiate their products. In particular, we
   characterize a maximal differentiation equilibrium in which one firm
   chooses the highest quality level on both attributes while its rival
   offers the lowest quality level on both attributes (a Max-Max
   equilibrium). We discuss the managerial implications of our findings and
   explain how they enrich and qualify previous results reported in the
   literature on two-dimensional differentiation models.

AB Recent business research points to the fortune awaiting to be tapped in
   low-end markets. In this paper, we investigate how the size of the
   low-end market influences a firm's profits and the pioneering firm's
   quality choice. As low-valuation consumers increase in a market, on
   average, consumers' willingness to pay decreases. This may lead us to
   expect firms' profits to decrease as the size of the low-end market
   increases. Our analysis shows that, if the size of the low-end market is
   below a threshold, an increase in the size of the low-end market may
   actually dampen price competition and improve profits, as firms can then
   strategically choose their quality levels such that their products are
   more differentiated. Conventional wisdom also suggests that the
   pioneering firm will offer a higher-quality product and earn more
   profits compared with the later entrant. In contrast to this notion of
   quality advantage, our analysis identifies circumstances in which a
   pioneer can offer a lower-quality product and yet earn more profits. An
   experimental test lends support for some of our model's predictions. We
   further extend the model to consider markets with multiple firms, firms
   with multiple products, and consumers with limited purchasing power.

AB We develop a two-stage consumer-level model of paid search advertising
   response based on standard aggregated data provided to advertisers by
   major search engines such as Google or Bing. The proposed model uses
   behavioral primitives in accord with utility maximization and allows
   recovering parameters of the heterogeneity distribution in consumer
   preferences. The model is estimated on a novel paid search data set that
   includes information on the ad copy. To that end, we develop an original
   framework to analyze composition and design attributes of paid search
   ads. Our results allow us to correctly evaluate the effects of specific
   ad properties on ad performance, taking consumer heterogeneity into
   account. Another benefit of our approach is allowing recovery of
   preference correlation across the click-through and conversion stage.
   Based on the estimated correlation between price- and
   position-sensitivity, we propose a novel contextual targeting scheme in
   which a coupon is offered to a consumer depending on the position in
   which the paid search ad was displayed. Our analysis shows that total
   revenues from conversion can be increased using this targeting scheme

   Subsequent questions maximize information about the decision heuristics
   (minimize expected posterior entropy). To update posteriors after each
   question, we approximate the posterior with a variational distribution
   and use belief propagation (iterative loops of Bayes updating). The
   method runs sufficiently fast to select new queries in under a second
   and provide significantly and substantially more information per
   question than existing methods based on random, market-based, or
   orthogonal-design questions.
   Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that adaptive questions provide
   close-to-optimal information and outperform existing methods even when
   there are response errors or "bad" priors. The basic algorithm focuses
   on conjunctive or disjunctive rules, but we demonstrate generalizations
   to more complex heuristics and to the use of previous-respondent data to
   improve consumer-specific priors. We illustrate the algorithm
   empirically in a Web-based survey conducted by an American automotive
   manufacturer to study vehicle consideration (872 respondents, 53 feature
   levels). Adaptive questions outperform market-based questions when
   estimating heuristic decision rules. Heuristic decision rules predict

AB Past research in marketing and psychology suggests that pricing
   structure may influence consumers' perception of value. In the context
   of two commonly used pricing schemes, pay-per-use and two-part tariff,
   we evaluate the impact of pricing structure on consumer preferences for
   access services. To this end, we develop a utility-based model of
   consumer retention and usage of a new service. A notable feature of the
   model is its ability to capture the pricing structure effect and measure
   its impact on consumer retention, usage, and pricing policy.
   Using data from a pricing field experiment for a new telecommunication
   service, we find that consumers derive lower utility from consumption
   under a two-part tariff than pay-per-use pricing, resulting in lower
   retention of customers and lower usage of the service. Specifically, our
   demand analysis shows that a two-part tariff structure leads to an
   average decline of 10.5% in the annual retention rate and an average
   decrease of 38.7% in yearly usage relative to pay-per-use pricing after
   controlling for income effects. Despite the higher customer churn and
   lower usage, we find that the two-part tariff is still the
   profit-maximizing pricing structure. However, our results show that if
   firms ignore. the pricing structure (or access fee) effect, then they
   would overcharge customers for the access fee and undercharge them for
   the per-minute price. Translated in terms of profitability, the failure
   to account for the access fee effect leads to a reduction of 11% in firm
   profit.

AB Our main objective in this paper is to measure the value of customers
   acquired from Google search advertising accounting for two factors that
   have been overlooked in the conventional method widely adopted in the
   industry: (1) the spillover effect of search advertising on customer
   acquisition and sales in off-line channels and (2) the lifetime value of
   acquired customers. By merging Web traffic and sales data from a
   small-sized U.S. firm, we create an individual customer-level panel that
   tracks all repeated purchases, both online and off-line, and tracks
   whether or not these purchases were referred from Google search
   advertising.
   To estimate the customer lifetime value, we apply the methodology in the
   customer relationship management literature by developing an integrated
   model of customer lifetime, transaction rate, and gross profit margin,
   allowing for individual heterogeneity and a full correlation of the
   three processes. Results show that customers acquired through Google
   search advertising in our data have a higher transaction rate than
   customers acquired from other channels. After accounting for future
   purchases and spillover to off-line channels, the calculated value of
   new customers using our approach is much higher than the value obtained
   using conventional method. The approach used in our study provides a
   practical framework for firms to evaluate the long-term profit impact of
   their search advertising investment in a multichannel setting.

AB We analyze the impacts of social learning (SL) on the dynamic pricing
   and consumer adoption of durable goods in a two-period monopoly.
   Consumers can make either early, uninformed purchases or late but
   potentially informed purchases as a result of social learning. Several
   results are derived. First, we identify the market conditions under
   which ex ante homogeneous consumers may choose to purchase at different
   times. Second, equilibrium adoption may demonstrate inertia (where all
   adopt late) or frenzy (where all adopt early). In particular, adoption
   inertia appears when SL intensity is reasonably high but may vanish when
   SL intensity exceeds a certain threshold. Third, firm profits and social
   welfare first weakly decrease in SL intensity and may then jump up by a
   lump-sum amount at the threshold SL intensity level mentioned above.
   Last, we show that the firm potentially benefits from informative
   advertising or investing to cultivate more social learning.

AB Customer retention and customer churn are key metrics of interest to
   marketers, but little attention has been placed on linking the different
   reasons for which customers churn to their value to a contractual
   service provider. In this paper, we put forth a hierarchical
   competing-risk model to jointly model when customers choose to terminate
   their service and why. Some of these reasons for churn can be influenced
   by the firm (e.g., service problems or price-value trade-offs), but
   others are uncontrollable (e.g., customer relocation and death). Using
   this framework, we demonstrate that the impact of a firm's efforts to
   reduce customer churn for controllable reasons is mitigated by the
   prevalence of uncontrollable ones, resulting in a "damper effect" on the
   return from a firm's retention marketing efforts. We use data from a
   provider of land-based telecommunication services to demonstrate how the
   competing-risk model can be used to derive a measure of the incremental
   customer value that a firm can expect to accrue through its efforts to
   delay churn, taking this damper effect into account. In addition to
   varying across customers based on geodemographic information, the
   magnitude of the damper effect depends on a customer's tenure to date.
   We discuss how our framework can be used to tailor the firm's retention
   strategy to individual customers, both in terms of which customers to
   target and when retention efforts should be deployed.

AB Recent research has empirically characterized the buyer-seller
   relationship as dynamically evolving from one discrete state to another.
   Conventional wisdom would suggest that a customer in a higher
   relationship state that has a higher transaction value would also have
   greater lifetime value to the firm. However, recent evidence suggests
   that higher relationship states can be ephemeral. Hence, the link
   between transaction value and lifetime value is not obvious. In this
   study, we seek to understand, within a specific empirical context, (i)
   the relationship between a customer's transaction value and that
   customer's lifetime value and (ii) the relationship between the lifetime
   value of a customer and the optimal level of marketing activity that
   needs to be directed at that customer. To this end, we develop a
   trivariate Tobit hidden Markov model that allows for (a) transitions
   among relationship states, (b) possible synergies between the various
   products that the supplier firm offers, (c) endogeneity in marketing
   activity, (d) heterogeneity in model parameters, and (e) the presence of
   the no-purchase option. Our results reinforce recent findings by
   Schweidel et al. [Schweidel, D. A., E. T. Bradlow, P. S. Fader. 2011.
   Portfolio dynamics for customers of a multiservice provider. Management
   Sci. 57(3) 471-486] that higher relationship states can be short-lived.
   Importantly for the supplier firm, a customer in the highest
   relationship state in a given period does not yield the highest lifetime
   value to the firm. Hence, the relationship between transaction value
   (i.e., relationship state) and lifetime value can be nonmonotonic. At
   the same time, we also find a nonmonotonic relationship between the
   optimal expenditures that should be directed at a customer and that
   customer's lifetime value; i.e., the optimal level of marketing contacts
   is not the highest for customers with the highest lifetime value.
   Furthermore, we find that the optimal marketing expenditures for myopic
   agents are 14%-33% lower than the corresponding values for
   forward-looking agents. Therefore, not accounting for the long-term
   effects of marketing contacts would lead to suboptimal marketing
   budgets. Moreover, a comparison with the current marketing expenditures
   suggests that the current practice is closer to the myopic policy than
   to the forward-looking one.

   by Eric T. Bradlow while Editor-in-Chief of Marketing Science. The
   foreword was written in four parts; each part covers a different aspect
   of the Workshop on Quantitative Marketing and Structural Econometrics.
   The workshop was cosponsored by Columbia Business School, Duke
   University, the University of California at Los Angeles, and the INFORMS
   Society for Marketing Science and was held at the Fuqua School of
   Business at Duke University in August 2010. The introductory section,
   written by Bradlow, covers why he commissioned these articles in the
   first place. In his section, Jean-Pierre Dube discusses "going from good
   to great" in the structural econometrics area as applied to marketing
   problems. A section jointly written by Brett R. Gordon and Raphael
   Thomadsen (both co-organizers of the workshop) discusses the workshop
   itself and some important thoughts for those people doing "structural
   econometrics in the trenches." Finally, co-workshop organizer Richard
   Staelin's section provides some perspective on both the workshop and
   structural econometrics as they relate to analytical models and
   empirical work for quantitative marketing researchers.

AB What can be learned about marketing phenomena from descriptive,
   structural, and experimental empirical models? Is structure implicit in
   a descriptive empirical model? What is a "reduced-form model?" What is a
   natural experiment, and what can one infer from a study that uses
   experimental data? Having clear answers to these questions can improve
   empirical dialog. This paper defines descriptive, structural, and
   experimental empirical work, provides examples, discusses their
   similarities and differences, and comments on their strengths and
   weaknesses. An important theme is that the marketing question and the
   data available should determine the methods used, and not the other way
   around. Most of the examples discussed reference linear models that are
   widely employed in the marketing literature. Many of the points,
   however, extend to the development and interpretation of cutting-edge
   nonlinear, dynamic, or nonparametric models used in marketing.

AB Marketing researchers have used models of consumer demand to forecast
   future sales, to describe and test theories of behavior, and to measure
   the response to marketing interventions. The basic framework typically
   starts from microfoundations of expected utility theory to obtain an
   econometric system that describes consumers' choices over available
   options, and to thus characterize product demand. The basic framework
   has been augmented significantly to account for quantity choices, to
   accommodate purchases of several products on a single purchase occasion
   (multiple discreteness and multicategory purchases), and to allow for
   asymmetric switching between brands across different price tiers. These
   extensions have enabled researchers to bring the analysis to bear on
   several related marketing phenomena of interest. This paper has three
   main objectives. The first objective is to articulate the main goals of
   demand analysis-forecasting, measurement, and testing-and to highlight
   several considerations associated with these goals. Our second objective
   is to describe the main building blocks of individual-level demand
   models. We discuss approaches built on direct and indirect utility
   specifications of demand systems, and we review extensions that have
   appeared in the marketing literature. The third objective is to explore
   a few emerging directions in demand analysis, including considering
   demand-side dynamics, combining purchase data with primary information,
   and using semiparametric and nonparametric approaches. We hope
   researchers new to this literature will take away a broader perspective
   on these models and see the potential for new directions in future
   research.

AB Digital rights management (DRM) is an important yet controversial issue
   in the information goods markets. Although DRM is supposed to help
   copyright owners by protecting digital content from illegal copying or
   distribution, it is controversial because DRM imposes restrictions on
   even legal users, and there are many industry practitioners who believe
   that the industry would be better off without DRM. In this paper, we
   model consumers' utilities and their incentives to purchase legal
   products versus pirate illegal ones. This allows us to endogenize the
   level of piracy and understand how it is influenced by the presence or
   absence of DRM. Our analysis suggests that, counterintuitively, download
   piracy might decrease when the firm allows legal DRM-free downloads.
   Furthermore, we find that a decrease in piracy does not guarantee an
   increase in firm profits and that that copyright owners do not always
   benefit from making it harder to copy music illegally. By analyzing the
   competition among the traditional retailer, the digital retailer, and
   pirated sources of information goods, we get a better understanding of
   the competitive forces in the market and provide insights into the role
   of digital rights management.

AB Whereas literature in marketing shows that individuals often use
   noncompensatory decision rules, existing research on dyadic choice is
   based on compensatory models. In this paper we present a dyadic
   consider-then-choose model that investigates both compensatory and
   noncompensatory aspects of the joint decision process. The intersection
   of individual consideration sets at the dyad level gives rise to dyadic
   decision processes (DDPs) where dyad members are in concordance or
   discordance about alternatives to consider. We empirically investigate
   the implications of different DDPs on outcomes such as decision
   efficiency and dyadic welfare. The methodological approach merges choice
   experiments with Bayesian statistical models to uncover nuances of the
   dyadic choice process. Data were collected using a multiphase nationwide
   study of 265 husband-and-wife dyads. Results across three categories
   indicate that both concordant and discordant dyads exist. Among
   concordant dyads, the noncompensatory dyads make quicker decisions that
   result in higher dyadic welfare. Among discordant dyads, those that
   restrict their consideration set make quicker decisions that result in
   higher welfare than those that expand their consideration set. These
   findings have important implications for buyers looking to maximize
   dyadic welfare when making joint choices and for sellers making pricing
   and new product design decisions.

AB How should forward-looking managers plan advertising if they envision a
   product-harm crisis in the future? To address this question, we propose
   a dynamic model of brand advertising in which, at each instant, a
   nonzero probability exists for the occurrence of a crisis event that
   damages the brand's baseline sales and may enhance or erode marketing
   effectiveness when the crisis occurs. Because managers do not know when
   the crisis will occur, its random time of occurrence induces a
   stochastic control problem, which we solve analytically in closed form.
   More importantly, the envisioning of a possible crisis alters managers'
   rate of time preference: anticipation enhances impatience. That is,
   forward-looking managers discount the present-even when the crisis has
   not occurred-more than they would in the absence of crisis. Building on
   this insight, we then derive the optimal feedback advertising strategies
   and assess the effects of crisis likelihood and damage rate. We discover
   the crossover interaction: the optimal precrisis advertising decreases,
   but the postcrisis advertising increases as the crisis likelihood (or
   damage rate) increases. In addition, we develop a new continuous-time
   estimation method to simultaneously estimate sales dynamics and feedback
   strategies using discrete-time data. Applying the method to market data
   from the Ford Explorer's rollover recall, we furnish evidence to support
   the proposed model. We detect compensatory effects in parametric shift:
   ad effectiveness increases, but carryover effect decreases (or vice
   versa). We also characterize the crisis occurrence distribution that
   shows that Ford Explorer should anticipate a crisis in 2.1 years and
   within 6.3 years at the 95% confidence level. Finally, we find a
   remarkable correspondence between the observed and optimal advertising
   decisions.

AB Commercial open source software (COSS) products-privately developed
   software based on publicly available source code-represent a rapidly
   growing, multibillion-dollar market. A unique aspect of competition in
   the COSS market is that many open source licenses require firms to make
   certain enhancements public, creating an incentive for firms to free
   ride on the contributions of others. This practice raises a number of
   puzzling issues. First, why should a firm further develop a product if
   competitors can freely appropriate these contributions? Second, how does
   a market based on free riding produce high-quality products? Third, from
   a public policy perspective, does the mandatory sharing of enhancements
   raise or lower consumer surplus and industry profits?
   We develop a two-sided model of competition between COSS firms to
   address these issues. Our model consists of (1) two firms competing in a
   vertically differentiated market, in which product quality is a mix of
   public and private components, and (2) a market for developers that
   firms hire after observing signals of their contributions to open
   source. We demonstrate that free-riding behavior is supported in
   equilibrium, that a mandatory sharing setting can result in high-quality
   products, and that free riding can actually increase profits and
   consumer surplus.

AB We discuss how regression discontinuity designs arise naturally in
   settings where firms target marketing activity at consumers, and we
   illustrate how this aspect may be exploited for econometric inference of
   causal effects of marketing effort. Our main insight is to use commonly
   observed discontinuities and kinks in the heuristics by which firms
   target such marketing activity to consumers for nonparametric
   identification. Such kinks, along with continuity restrictions that are
   typically satisfied in marketing and industrial organization
   applications, are sufficient for identification of local treatment
   effects. We review the theory of regression discontinuity estimation in
   the context of targeting and explore its applicability to several
   marketing settings. We discuss identifiability of causal marketing
   effects using the design and show that consideration of an underlying
   model of strategic consumer behavior reveals how identification hinges
   on model features such as the specification and value of structural
   parameters as well as belief structures. We emphasize the role of
   selection for identification. We present two empirical applications: the
   first measures the effect of casino e-mail promotions targeted to
   customers based on ranges of their expected profitability, and the
   second measures the effect of direct mail targeted by a
   business-to-consumer company to zip codes based on cutoffs of expected
   response. In both cases, we illustrate that exploiting the regression
   discontinuity design reveals negative effects of the marketing campaigns
   that would not have been uncovered using other approaches. Our results
   are nonparametric, easy to compute, and control for the endogeneity
   induced by the targeting rule.

AB Although prior literature has examined reactions to drastic negative
   news, we examine the situation in which decision makers receive
   contradictory information about products and they have to decide whether
   to persist with or abandon product usage. We investigate physician
   reactions to conflicting information concerning the cardiovascular risk
   of Avandia, a diabetes drug. We examine how beliefs about both drug
   effectiveness and drug safety are updated and speculate that experience,
   expertise, and self-efficacy impact how such information is integrated
   with current quality beliefs. Unlike previous Bayesian learning models,
   we consider that some signals, such as positive and negative news
   releases and the firm's marketing effort, may be biased in that they
   provide an opinionated point of view. The results show interesting
   differences in how physician types (specialists, hospital-based primary
   care physicians, heavy and light prescribers) update their beliefs and
   the information sources they use to do so. We find evidence that safety
   issues about Avandia resulted in spillover concern to close competitor
   Actos. The results have implication for determining who should be
   targeted and what vehicles should be used if a firm is faced with a
   situation where consumers are in a quandary because of receiving

AB Market response models based on field-generated data need to address
   potential endogeneity in the regressors to obtain consistent parameter
   estimates. Another requirement is that market response models predict
   well in a holdout sample. With both requirements combined, it may seem
   reasonable to subject an endogeneity-corrected model to a holdout
   prediction task, and this is quite common in the academic marketing
   literature. One may be inclined to expect that the consistent parameter
   estimates obtained via instrumental variables (IV) estimation predict
   better than the biased ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. This
   paper shows that this expectation is incorrect. That is, if the holdout
   sample is similar to the estimation sample so that the regressors are
   endogenous in both samples, holdout sample validation favors regression
   estimates that are not corrected for endogeneity (i.e., OLS) over
   estimates that are corrected for endogeneity (i.e., IV estimation). We
   also discuss ways in which holdout samples may be used sensibly in the
   presence of endogeneity. A key takeaway is that if consistent parameter
   estimates are the primary model objective, the model should be validated
   with an exogenous (rather than endogenous) holdout sample.

   for grocery purchases. They may incur additional transaction costs when
   buying groceries online versus off-line. We integrate the various
   transaction costs into a channel choice framework and empirically
   quantify the relative transaction costs when households choose between
   the online and off-line channels of the same grocery chain. The key
   challenges in quantifying these costs are (i) the complexity of channel
   choice decision and (ii) that several of the costs depend on the items a
   household expects to buy in the store, and unobserved factors that
   influence channel choice also likely influence the items purchased. We
   use the unique features of our empirical context to address the first
   issue and the plausibly exogenous approach in a hierarchical Bayesian
   framework to account for the endogeneity of the channel choice drivers.
   We find that transaction costs for grocery shopping can be sizable and
   play an important role in the choice between online and off-line
   channels. We provide monetary metrics for several types of transaction
   costs, such as travel time and transportation costs, in-store shopping
   time, item-picking costs, basket-carrying costs, quality inspection
   costs, and inconvenience costs. We find considerable household
   heterogeneity in these costs and characterize their distributions. We
   discuss the implications of our findings for the retailer's channel
   strategy.

AB The goal of this paper is to study the behavior of consumers, dealers,
   and manufacturers in the car sector and present an approach that can be
   used by managers and policy makers to investigate the impact of
   significant demand shocks on profits, prices, and dealer networks. More
   specifically, we investigate consumer demand, substitution patterns, and
   price decisions across different cars and dealer locations to identify
   dealerships with low margins or high fixed costs and measure the value
   of closing down dealerships for manufacturers. We apply our model
   empirically to the San Diego area using a transactional data set with
   information about the locations of dealers and consumers, as well as
   manufacturer and retail prices. We find strong consumer disutility for
   travel and find that dealers have local demand areas that are shared
   with a small set of competitors. We show that a reduction of market
   demand by 30% over two years, similar to the economic crisis of
   2008-2009, results in an annual drop in prices of approximately 11%. We
   discuss this price drop in the context of the 2009 federal policy
   measure known as the Car Allowance Rebate System program. We compare
   predictions and actual dealership closings in the General Motors and
   Chrysler dealer networks as an application of our approach.

AB Consumers are often unable to resist the temptation of overconsuming
   certain products such as cookies, crackers, soft drinks, alcohol, etc.
   To control their consumption, some consumers buy small packages or
   abstain from purchasing the product altogether. Other consumers,
   however, still purchase large packages and overconsume. From a strategic
   perspective, firms have the option of introducing small packages or only
   offering large packages. We use the literature on hyperbolic discounting
   to model consumers' self-control problems and examine conditions under
   which firms will offer small packages to help consumers combat their
   self-control problem, and how this offering in turn affects prices,
   profits, consumer, and social welfare. Our results show that introducing
   small packages can increase firms' profits only when a small fraction of
   consumers have overconsumption problems or when small packages can bring
   in new customers. Additionally, we find that competition can sometimes
   reduce the incentives for firms to introduce small packages. This is
   particularly true when a large fraction of consumers is attracted to
   small packages. We also find that firms' profits can sometimes decrease
   if they produce healthier alternatives of their goods. Our analysis of
   consumer welfare reveals that small packages enhance consumer and social
   welfare, even though they sometimes increase the consumption of vice
   goods.

AB Most ads in practice receive no more than a single eye fixation. This
   study investigates the limits of what ads can communicate under such
   adverse exposure conditions. We find that consumers already know at
   maximum levels of accuracy and with high degree of certainty whether
   something is an ad or is editorial material after an exposure of less
   than 100 milliseconds and-if the ad is typical-which product is being
   advertised. Even after an extremely coarse visual presentation of 100
   milliseconds, the product and brand in typical ads are identified well
   above chance levels, with atypical ads doing slightly better at the
   brand level. We propose a new metric that quantifies how effectively
   individual ads communicate their gist in adverse exposure conditions and
   that predicts the immediate interest that ads draw. Bayesian mediation
   analyses show that because of their better gist performance, typical ads
   rather than atypical ones raise immediate interest after very brief
   exposures. These findings challenge some of the received knowledge in
   advertising theory and practice, and they reveal the immediate
   communication benefits of typical ads.

AB There exists a dichotomy in the communication strategies of fashion
   firms-some firms purposefully cloak information on the tastefulness of
   their products, whereas others openly flaunt their tasteful or "it"
   products. This divide in communication strategies cannot be explained by
   existing wealth signaling models of fashion. In this paper, we offer a
   model of fashion that explains the above dichotomy. We model fashion as
   a social device that plays the dual role of allowing people to both fit
   in with their peers and differentiate themselves by signaling their good
   taste or access to information. In this context, we show that a fashion
   firm faces an interesting dilemma-if it restricts information, then only
   sophisticated consumers buy its products and use them to signal their
   taste. Cloaking thus preserves the signaling value of its products but
   reduces the number of social interactions enabled by them. In contrast,
   flaunting undermines the signaling value of its products but increases
   the interactions enabled by them. Given these trade-offs, we derive the
   conditions under which cloaking occurs. We also show that, in
   equilibrium, the most tasteful product endogenously emerges as the
   fashion hit or "it" product.

AB In recent years there has been a growing stream of literature in
   marketing and economics that models consumers as Bayesian learners. Such
   learning behavior is often embedded within a discrete choice framework
   that is then calibrated on scanner panel data. At the same time, it is
   now accepted wisdom that disentangling preference heterogeneity and
   state dependence is critical in any attempt to understand either
   construct. We posit that this confounding between state dependence and
   heterogeneity often carries through to Bayesian learning models. That
   is, the failure to adequately account for preference heterogeneity may
   result in over- or underestimation of the learning process because this
   heterogeneity is also reflected in the initial conditions. Using a
   unique data set that contains stated preferences (survey) and actual
   purchase data (scanner panel) for the same group of consumers, we
   attempt to untangle the effects of preference heterogeneity and state
   dependence, where the latter arises from Bayesian learning. Our results
   are striking and suggest that measured brand beliefs can predict choices
   quite well and, moreover, that in the absence of such measured
   preference information, the Bayesian learning behavior for consumer
   packaged goods is vastly overstated. The inclusion of preference
   information significantly reduces evidence for aggregate-level learning
   and substantially changes the nature of individual-level learning. Using
   individual-level outcomes, we illustrate why the lack of preference
   information leads to faulty inferences.

AB Service providers and their customers are sometimes victims of failures
   caused by exogenous factors such as unexpected bad weather, power
   outages, or labor strikes. When such no-fault failures occur in confined
   zones, service providers may confine customers against their will if
   making arrangements for them to leave is very costly. Such confinements,
   however, can result in severe pain and suffering, and customer
   complaints put regulators under pressure to pass a customer bill of
   rights that allows captive customers to abort failed services. This
   paper shows that service providers are better off preempting such laws
   by voluntarily allowing customers to escape the service under failure.
   Moreover, service providers can profit by targeting compensation to
   customers based on whether they use or leave the service under failure.

AB This paper evaluates the joint impact of exclusive channels and revenue
   sharing on suppliers and retailers in a hybrid duopoly common retailer
   and exclusive channel model. The model bridges the gap in the literature
   on hybrid multichannel supply chains with bilateral complementary
   products and services with or without revenue sharing. The analysis
   indicates that, without revenue sharing, the suppliers are reluctant to
   form exclusive deals with the retailers; thus, no equilibrium results.
   With revenue sharing from the retailers to the suppliers, it can be an
   equilibrium strategy for the suppliers and retailers to form exclusive
   deals. Bargaining solutions are provided to determine the revenue
   sharing rates. Our additional results suggest forming exclusive deals
   becomes less desirable for the suppliers if revenue sharing is also in
   place under nonexclusivity. In our extended discussion, we also study
   the impact of channel asymmetry, an alternative model with fencing,
   composite package competition, and enhanced price-dependent revenue
   sharing.

AB This study examines whether user-generated content (UGC) is related to
   stock market performance, which metric of UGC has the strongest
   relationship, and what the dynamics of the relationship are. We
   aggregate UGC from multiple websites over a four-year period across 6
   markets and 15 firms. We derive multiple metrics of UGC and use
   multivariate time-series models to assess the relationship between UGC
   and stock market performance.
   Volume of chatter significantly leads abnormal returns by a few days
   (supported by Granger causality tests). Of all the metrics of UGC,
   volume of chatter has the strongest positive effect on abnormal returns
   and trading volume. The effect of negative and positive metrics of UGC
   on abnormal returns is asymmetric. Whereas negative UGC has a
   significant negative effect on abnormal returns with a short "wear-in"
   and long "wear-out," positive UGC has no significant effect on these
   metrics. The volume of chatter and negative chatter have a significant
   positive effect on trading volume. Idiosyncratic risk increases
   significantly with negative information in UGC. Positive information
   does not have much influence on the risk of the firm. An increase in
   off-line advertising significantly increases the volume of chatter and
   decreases negative chatter. These results have important implications
   for managers and investors.

AB When social influence plays a key role in the diffusion of new product,
   the value of a customer often goes beyond her own product purchase. We
   posit that a customer's value (CV) comes not only from her purchase
   value (PV) but also from her influence value (IV) (i.e., CV = PV + IV).
   Therefore, a customer's value can be far greater than her purchase value
   if she exerts a considerable influence on others. Building on a
   two-segment influential imitator asymmetric influence model, we develop
   a model framework to derive closed-form expressions for PV, IV, and CV
   by customer segment as well as time of adoption, and we examine their
   comparative statics with respect to the diffusion parameters. A key
   parameter of our model framework is the social apportioning parameter,
   5, which determines the credit a customer receives by influencing other
   potential adopters. We develop an endogenous method for determining 5 as
   a function of the new product diffusion parameters. Our model framework
   allows us to investigate how a firm might accelerate product purchases
   by providing introductory discount offers to a targeted group of
   potential adopters at product launch. We find that purchase acceleration
   frequently leads to a significant increase in total customer value.

AB When a firm can recognize its previous customers, it may use information
   about their past purchases to price discriminate. We study a model with
   a monopolist and a continuum of heterogeneous consumers, where consumers
   have the ability to maintain their anonymity and avoid being identified
   as past customers, possibly at a cost. When consumers can freely
   maintain their anonymity, they all individually choose to do so, which
   results in the highest profit for the monopolist. Increasing the cost of
   anonymity can benefit consumers but only up to a point, after which the
   effect is reversed. We show that if the monopolist or an independent
   third party controls the cost of anonymity, it often works to the
   detriment of consumers.

   switch strategies as they gain experience is estimated as a hidden

   and rewarded behavior effects, heterogeneity, and forward-looking
   behavior. We focus on four key research questions: (1) How important is
   it to combine both components in one model? (2) Does points pressure
   exist in the context of a two-component loyalty program? (3) How is the
   market segmented in its response to the combined program? (4) Do the
   programs complement each other in terms of the incremental sales they
   produce?
   Our most basic message is that the frequency reward and customer tier
   components of loyalty programs should be modeled jointly rather than in
   separate models. We find strong evidence for points pressure for both
   the customer tier and frequency reward components using both model-based
   and model-free evidence. We find a two-segment solution revealing a
   "service-oriented" segment that highly values cash-ins for room upgrades
   and staying in "luxury" hotels, and a "price-oriented" segment that is
   more price sensitive and highly values the frequency reward aspects of
   the loyalty program. Furthermore, we find that both components generate
   incremental sales. Also, there was slight synergy between the programs
   but not a huge amount. Overall, each component contributes to increased
   revenues and does not interfere with the other.

AB This study develops and estimates a dynamic model of consumer choice
   behavior in markets for seasonal goods, where products are sold over a
   finite season and availability is limited. In these markets, retailers
   often use dynamic markdown policies in which an initial retail price is
   announced at the beginning of the season and the price is subsequently
   marked down as the season progresses. Strategic consumers face a
   trade-off between purchasing early in the season, when prices are higher
   but goods are available, and purchasing later, when prices are lower but
   the stockout risk is higher. If the good starts providing utility as
   soon as it is purchased (e.g., apparel), consumers purchasing earlier in
   the season can also get more use from the product compared to those
   purchasing later.
   Our structural model incorporates three features essential for modeling
   the demand for seasonal goods: changing prices limited availability, and
   possible dependence of total consumption utility on the time of
   purchase. In this model, heterogeneous consumers have expectations about
   future prices and product availability, and they strategically time
   their purchases. We estimate the model using aggregate sales and
   inventory data from a fashion goods retailer.
   The results indicate that, in the fashion goods context, ignoring
   consumers' expectations about future availability or the change in total
   consumption utility over the season can lead to biased demand estimates.
   We find that strategic consumers delay their purchases to take advantage
   of markdowns and that these strategic delays hurt the retailer's
   revenues. Retailer revenues facing strategic consumers are 9% lower than
   they would have been facing myopic consumers. Limited availability, on
   the other hand, reduces the extent of strategic delays by motivating
   consumers to purchase earlier. We find that the impact of strategic
   delays on retailer revenues would have been as high as 35% if there were
   no stockout risk. By means of counterfactual experiments, we show that
   the highest retailer profits are achieved by offering small markdowns
   early in the season. On the other hand, given current markdown
   percentages, the retailer can improve profits by carrying less stock as
   consumers accelerate purchases and purchase at higher prices when they
   anticipate scarcity in future periods. As long as the reduction in
   availability is not great, the profit gain from earlier higher-priced
   sales can overcome the loss resulting from the reduction in overall
   sales.

AB Quantity discount pricing is a common practice used by
   business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies. A key
   characteristic of quantity discount pricing is that the marginal price
   declines with higher purchase quantities. In this paper, we propose a
   choice-based conjoint model for estimating consumer-level willingness to
   pay (WTP) for varying quantities of a product and for designing optimal
   quantity discount pricing schemes. Our model can handle large quantity
   values and produces WTP estimates that are positive and increasing in
   quantity at a diminishing rate. In particular, we propose a tractable
   WTP function that depends on both product attributes and product
   quantity and that captures diminishing marginal WTP. We show how such a
   function embeds standard WTP functions in the quantity discount
   literature as special cases. We also demonstrate how to use the model to
   estimate the consumer value potential, which is the product of the
   premium a consumer is willing to pay and her volume potential. Finally,
   we propose a parsimonious experimental design approach for
   implementation.
   We illustrate the model using data from a conjoint study of online movie
   rental services. The empirical results show that the proposed model has
   good fit and predictive validity. In addition, we find that marginal WTP
   in this category decays rapidly with quantity. We also find that the
   standard choice-based conjoint model results in anomalous WTP
   distributions with negative WTP values and nondiminishing marginal
   willingness-to-pay curves. Finally, we identify four segments of
   consumers that differ in terms of magnitude of WTP and volume potential,
   and we derive optimal quantity discount schemes for a monopolist and a
   new entrant in a competitive market.

AB We propose a method to include seasonality in any diffusion model that
   has a closed-form solution. The resulting diffusion model captures
   seasonality in a way that naturally matches the original diffusion
   model's pattern. The method assumes that additional sales at seasonal
   peaks are drawn from previous or future periods. This implies that the
   seasonal pattern does not influence the underlying diffusion pattern.
   The model is compared with alternative approaches through simulations
   and empirical examples. As alternatives, we consider the standard
   Generalized Bass Model (GBM) and the basic Bass Model, which ignores
   seasonality. One of the main findings is that modeling seasonality in a
   GBM generates good predictions but gives biased estimates. In
   particular, the market potential parameter is underestimated. Ignoring
   seasonality in cases where data of the entire diffusion period are
   available gives unbiased parameter estimates in most relevant scenarios.
   However, ignoring seasonality leads to biased parameter estimates and
   predictions when only part of the diffusion period is available. We
   demonstrate that our model gives correct estimates and predictions even
   if the full diffusion process is not yet available.

AB We investigate a business-to-business context and ask when and why a
   firm should announce a "reference program" that commits the firm to
   facilitating the flow of information about the efficacy of its products
   from early adopters to potential late adopters. We model a monopolist
   manufacturer with a new innovation that can be sold to two potential
   customers. We demonstrate here two benefits of a reference program that
   relate not to an increase in later adopters' willingness to pay but to
   an increase in the willingness to pay of the early adopters themselves.
   The impact on the early adopters' willingness to pay arises in two ways
   as a result of their observation of the firm's commitment to information
   transmission. First, in a model of symmetric uncertainty, we show that
   the announcement of a reference program facilitates dynamic pricing by
   the manufacturer in the sense that it allows the firm to provide
   temporary exclusive use of the technology to one of the customers. This
   creates more value, which the manufacturer can extract via a higher
   price. In this way, a reference program can serve as a partial
   substitute for an exclusive-use contract. In a model with asymmetric
   information, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, the firm is
   able to use the reference program as a signal-again, to the early
   adopting customer-that its technology is of high quality. However, such
   a signal requires significant discounts to early adopters to ensure
   separation. As a result, a pooling equilibrium dominates in which the
   manufacturer fosters references regardless of its quality. Finally, by
   allowing the firms' private information to be stochastic, we show that
   separation may be a dominant outcome.

AB Whereas recent research has demonstrated the impact of online product
   ratings and reviews on product sales, we still have a limited
   understanding of the individual's decision to contribute these opinions.
   In this research, we empirically model the individual's decision to
   provide a product rating and investigate factors that influence this
   decision. Specifically, we consider how previously posted ratings may
   affect an individual's posting behavior in terms of whether to
   contribute (incidence) and what to contribute (evaluation), and we
   identify selection effects that influence the incidence decision and
   adjustment effects that influence the evaluation decision.
   Across individuals, our results show that positive ratings environments
   increase posting incidence, whereas negative ratings environments
   discourage posting. Our results also indicate important differences
   across individuals in how they respond to previously posted ratings,
   with less frequent posters exhibiting bandwagon behavior and more active
   customers revealing differentiation behavior. These dynamics affect the
   evolution of online product opinions. Through simulations, we illustrate
   how the evolution of posted product opinions is shaped by the underlying
   customer base and show that customer bases with the same median opinion
   may evolve in substantially different ways because of the presence of a
   core group of "activists" posting increasingly negative opinions.

AB User-generated content is increasingly created through the collaborative
   efforts of multiple individuals. In this paper, we argue that the value
   of collaborative user-generated content is a function both of the direct
   efforts of its contributors and of its embeddedness in the
   content-contributor network that creates it. An analysis of Wikipedia's
   WikiProject Medicine reveals a curvilinear relationship between the
   number of distinct contributors to user-generated content and
   viewership. A two-mode social network analysis demonstrates that the
   embeddedness of the content in the content-contributor network is
   positively related to viewership. Specifically, locally central
   content-characterized by greater intensity of work by contributors to
   multiple content sources-is associated with increased viewership.
   Globally central content-characterized by shorter paths to the other
   collaborative content in the overall network-also generates greater
   viewership. However, within these overall effects, there is considerable
   heterogeneity in how network characteristics relate to viewership. In
   addition, network effects are stronger for newer collaborative
   user-generated content. These findings have implications for fostering
   collaborative user-generated content.

AB We measure the value of promotional activities and referrals by content
   creators to an online platform of user-generated content. To do so, we
   develop a modeling approach that explains individual-level choices of
   visiting the platform, creating, and purchasing content as a function of
   consumer characteristics and marketing activities, allowing for the
   possibility of interdependence of decisions within and across users.
   Empirically, we apply our model to Hewlett-Packard's (HP)
   print-on-demand service of user-created magazines, named MagCloud. We
   use two distinct data sets to show the applicability of our approach: an
   aggregate-level data set from Google Analytics, which is a widely
   available source of data to managers, and an individual-level data set
   from HP. Our results compare content creator activities, which include
   referrals and word-of-mouth efforts, with firm-based actions, such as
   price promotions and public relations. We show that price promotions
   have strong effects but are limited to the purchase decisions, whereas
   content creator referrals and public relations efforts have broader
   effects that impact all consumer decisions at the platform. We provide
   recommendations as to the level of a firm's investments when "free"
   promotional activities by content creators exist. These free marketing
   campaigns are likely to have a substantial presence in most online
   services of user-generated content.

AB The success of any user-generated content website depends crucially on
   its asset of content contributors. How firms should invest in the
   acquisition and retention of content contributors represents a novel
   question that is particularly important for these websites. We develop a
   vector autoregressive (VAR) model to measure the financial values of the
   retention and acquisition of both contributors and content consumers. In
   our empirical application to a customer-to-customer marketplace, we find
   that contributor (seller) acquisition has the largest financial value
   because of their strong network effects on content consumers (buyers)
   and other contributors. However, the wear-in of contributors' financial
   values takes longer because the network effects need time to be fully
   realized. Our simulation-based studies (i) shed light on the value
   implications of "enhancing network effects" and (ii) quantify the
   revenue contributions of marketing newsletter campaigns. Our results
   indicate that enhancing network effects in complementary ways can
   further increase the marginal benefits of acquisition and retention. We
   also find that simply tracking click-throughs may vastly underestimate
   the values of marketing newsletters in our case, by more than a factor
   of 5-which may lead to suboptimal marketing effort allocation.

AB We investigate the evolution of online ratings over time and sequence.
   We first establish that there exist two distinct dynamic processes, one
   as a function of the amount of time a book has been available for review
   and another as a function of the sequence of reviews themselves. We find
   that, once we control for calendar date, the residual average temporal
   pattern is increasing. This is counter to existing findings that suggest
   that without this calendar-date control, the pattern is decreasing. With
   respect to sequential dynamics, we find that ratings decrease: the nth
   rating is, on average, lower than the n-1th when controlling for time,
   reviewer effects, and book effects. We test and find some support for
   existing theories for this decline based on motivation. We then offer
   two additional explanations for this "order effect." We find support for
   the idea that one's ability to assess the diagnosticity of previous
   reviews decreases: when previous reviewers are very different, more
   reviews may thus lead to more purchase errors and lower ratings.

AB User-generated content on social media platforms and product search
   engines is changing the way consumers shop for goods online. However,
   current product search engines fail to effectively leverage information
   created across diverse social media platforms. Moreover, current ranking
   algorithms in these product search engines tend to induce consumers to
   focus on one single product characteristic dimension (e.g., price, star
   rating). This approach largely ignores consumers' multidimensional
   preferences for products. In this paper, we propose to generate a
   ranking system that recommends products that provide, on average, the
   best value for the consumer's money. The key idea is that products that
   provide a higher surplus should be ranked higher on the screen in
   response to consumer queries. We use a unique data set of U.S. hotel
   reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which
   we supplement with data from various social media sources using
   techniques from text mining, image classification, social geotagging,
   human annotations, and geomapping. We propose a random coefficient
   hybrid structural model, taking into consideration the two sources of
   consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different
   hotel characteristics introduce. Based on the estimates from the model,
   we infer the economic impact of various location and service
   characteristics of hotels. We then propose a new hotel ranking system
   based on the average utility gain a consumer receives from staying in a
   particular hotel. By doing so, we can provide customers with the
   "best-value" hotels early on. Our user studies, using ranking
   comparisons from several thousand users, validate the superiority of our
   ranking system relative to existing systems on several travel search
   engines. On a broader note, this paper illustrates how social media can
   be mined and incorporated into a demand estimation model in order to
   generate a new ranking system in product search engines. We thus
   highlight the tight linkages between user behavior on social media and
   search engines. Our interdisciplinary approach provides several insights
   for using machine learning techniques in economics and marketing
   research.

AB Web 2.0 provides gathering places for Internet users in blogs, forums,
   and chat rooms. These gathering places leave footprints in the form of
   colossal amounts of data regarding consumers' thoughts, beliefs,
   experiences, and even interactions. In this paper, we propose an
   approach for firms to explore online user-generated content and "listen"
   to what customers write about their and their competitors' products. Our
   objective is to convert the user-generated content to market structures
   and competitive landscape insights. The difficulty in obtaining such
   market-structure insights from online user-generated content is that
   consumers' postings are often not easy to syndicate. To address these
   issues, we employ a text-mining approach and combine it with semantic
   network analysis tools. We demonstrate this approach using two
   cases-sedan cars and diabetes drugs-generating market-structure
   perceptual maps and meaningful insights without interviewing a single
   consumer. We compare a market structure based on user-generated content
   data with a market structure derived from more traditional sales and
   survey-based data to establish validity and highlight meaningful

AB Social sharing of information goods-wherein a single good is purchased
   and shared through a network of acquaintances such as friends or
   coworkers-is a significant concern for the providers of these goods. The
   effect of social sharing on firm pricing and profits depends critically
   on two elements: the structure of the underlying consumer network and
   the mechanism used by groups to decide whether to purchase at a given
   price. We examine the effect of social sharing under different network
   structures (decentralized, centralized, and complete), which reflect a
   range of market conditions. Moreover, we draw from the mechanism design
   literature to examine several approaches to group decision making. Our
   results suggest that a firm can benefit from increased social sharing if
   the level of sharing is already high, enabling a pricing strategy
   targeted primarily at sharing groups rather than individuals. However,
   the point at which sharing becomes marginally beneficial for a firm
   depends on both the distribution of group sizes (which derives from the
   network structure) and the group decision mechanism. Additional insights
   are obtained when we extend the model. to capture homophily in group
   formation and the potential that a subset of consumers will never share
   for ethical reasons.

AB This paper develops and calibrates a simple yet comprehensive set of
   models for the evolution of binary I attribute importance weights, based
   on a cue-goal association framework. We argue that the utility a
   consumer ascribes to an attribute comes from its association with the
   achievement of a goal. We investigate how associations may be
   represented and then track back the relationship of these associations
   to the utility function. We explain why we believe this to be an
   important problem before providing an overview of the extensive
   literature on learning models. This literature identifies key phenomena
   and provides a foundation for our modeling of binary attribute
   importance learning, which can test for three departures from "rational"
   learning-bias, existence of priors, and the unequal weighting of sample
   observations (order effects). We apply our models in a laboratory
   setting under a number of different relationship strengths, and we find
   that, in our application, consumers' learning about attribute-goal
   associations exhibits bias and the effects of prior beliefs when the
   sample realizations occur with and without noise, and order effects when
   the sample realizations occur with noise. We provide an example of how
   our models can be extended to learning about more than one attribute.

AB We propose a new statistical instrument-free method to tackle the
   endogeneity problem. The proposed method models the joint distribution
   of the endogenous regressor and the error term in the structural
   equation of interest (the structural error) using a copula method, and
   it makes inferences on the model parameters by maximizing the likelihood
   derived from the joint distribution. Similar to the "exclusion
   restriction" in instrumental variable methods, extant instrument-free
   methods require the assumption that the unobserved instruments are
   exogenous, a requirement that is difficult to meet. The proposed method
   does not require such an assumption. Other benefits of the proposed
   method are that it allows the modeling of discrete endogenous regressors
   and offers a new solution to the slope endogeneity problem. In addition
   to linear models, the method is applicable to the popular random
   coefficient logit model with either aggregate-level or individual-level
   data. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via a series
   of simulation studies and an empirical example.

AB This paper analyses firms' decisions to provide connectivity to their
   customers. We distinguish between intraconnectivity-the ability of one
   firm's customers to connect to each other-and interconnectivity-the
   ability of one firm's customers to connect with another firm's
   customers. The profitability implications of allowing connectivity are
   not a straightforward consequence of the consumer value of connectivity,
   because connectivity affects not only the customer value but also the
   intensity of competition by creating or changing network externality. We
   find that if sales are driven by brand switching rather than by category
   expansion, a firm may find it optimal not to provide intraconnectivity
   even if providing it is not costly and may find it optimal to provide
   interconnectivity even at a cost exceeding the consumer value of
   connectivity. On the other hand, if category expansion is possible,
   providing intraconnectivity may be profitable. In this case, either the
   equilibrium intraconnectivity provision may be asymmetric or both firms
   may find it (individually) optimal to provide intraconnectivity. Under
   certain conditions in the latter case, the firms' choice of
   intraconnectivity is a prisoner's dilemma game.

AB Each year in the postsecondary education industry, schools offer
   admission to nearly 3 million new students and scholarships totaling
   nearly $100 billion. This is a large, understudied targeted marketing
   and price discrimination problem. This problem falls into a broader
   class of configuration utility problems (CUPs), which typically require
   an approach tailored to exploit the particular setting. This paper
   provides such an approach for the admission and scholarship decisions
   problem. The approach accounts for the key distinguishing feature of
   this industry-schools value the average features of the matriculating
   students such as percent female, percent from different regions of the
   world, average test scores, and average grade point average. Thus, as in
   any CUP, the value of one object (i.e., student) cannot be separated
   from the composition of all of the objects (other students in the
   enrolling class). This goal of achieving a class with a desirable set of
   average characteristics greatly complicates the optimization problem and
   does not allow the application of standard approaches. We develop a new
   approach that solves this more complex optimization problem using an
   empirical system to estimate each student's choice and the focal
   school's utility function. We test the approach in a field study of an
   MBA scholarship process and implement adjusted scholarship decisions.
   Using a holdout sample, we provide evidence that the methodology can
   lead to improvements over current management decisions. Finally, by
   comparing our solution to what management would do on its own, we
   provide insight into how to improve management decisions in this
   setting.

AB The question as to the optimality of advertising pulsing has attracted
   many researchers over the last half-century. In this paper we specify a
   market share model in which there are two advertising-setting firms as
   well as a no-purchase option. The framework is that of a first-order
   Markov process with three states. The objective of both firms is to
   maximize profits. We are able to demonstrate, for a diminishing returns
   advertising function, that the optimal advertising strategy is pulsing.
   The frequency of the advertising pulse is shown to depend on the
   magnitude of the market share retention rate (state dependence); the
   higher it is, the less frequent the advertising. We further find that
   the optimal advertising budgets do not remain the same when the
   frequency of pulsing changes. Finally, we show that it is optimal for
   both firms to advertise in phase.

   It now becomes optimal to introduce versioning if the goods are not too
   substitute for one another, even when production costs are zero (pure
   information goods). We also demonstrate that the simultaneous release of
   the versions ("day-and-date" strategy) can be optimal when the studio is

   sequential release ("video window" strategy) is typically the outcome
   when the studio negotiates with independent distributors and exhibitors.

AB Consumer new product adoption and preference evolution or learning may
   be influenced by intrinsic or internal factors (e.g., usage experiences,
   personal characteristics), external influences (e.g., social effects,
   media), and marketing activities of the firm. Moreover, the preference
   evolution in a certain category can spill over to other categories;
   i.e., consumers can exhibit cross-category learning. In this paper, we
   develop a multicategory framework to analyze the role of the above
   elements in the formation and evolution of consumer preferences across
   categories. We analyze these elements by employing multiple data sets,
   i.e., by combining revealed preference data (from scanner panel), stated
   data (from surveys measuring consumer lifestyle variables and
   demographics), and external influences (e.g., media mentions) in a
   completely heterogeneous framework while considering other facets of the
   learning process. By jointly estimating the model for organic purchases
   in six distinct food categories, we also explore the role of category
   differences. Results show that consumer new product adoption and
   learning is indeed impacted significantly and to various degrees by the
   aforementioned factors. We show how, by selectively encouraging
   purchases under various scenarios, firms can accelerate the learning
   process, not only for the focal category but also for other categories,
   thereby realizing considerable incremental profits. These results can be
   used by both manufacturers and retailers for more efficient allocation
   of marketing budgets across (new) products.

AB We show how networks modify the diffusion curve by affecting its
   symmetry. We demonstrate that a network's degree distribution has a
   significant impact on the contagion properties of the subsequent
   adoption process, and we propose a method for uncovering the degree
   distribution of the adopter network underlying the dissemination
   process, based exclusively on limited early-stage penetration data. In
   this paper we propose and empirically validate a unified network-based
   growth model that links network structure and penetration patterns.
   Specifically, using external sources of information, we confirm that
   each network degree distribution identified by the model matches the
   actual social network that is underlying the dissemination process. We
   also show empirically that the same method can be used to forecast
   adoption using an estimation of the degree distribution and the
   diffusion parameters at an early stage (15%) of the penetration process.
   We confirm that these forecasts are significantly superior to those of
   three benchmark models of diffusion.
   Our empirical analysis indicates that under heavily right-skewed degree
   distribution conditions (such as scale-free networks), the majority of
   adopters (in some cases, up to 75%) join the process after the sales
   peak. This strong asymmetry is a result of the unique interaction
   between the dissemination process and the degree distribution of its
   underlying network.

AB This paper investigates how firms responded to standardized nutrition
   labels on food products required by the Nutrition Labeling and Education
   Act (NLEA). Using a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we test our
   predictions using two large-scale samples that span 30 product
   categories. Results indicate that the NLEA reduced brand nutritional
   quality relative to a control group of products not regulated by the
   NLEA. At the same time, among regulated products, brand taste increased.
   Although this reduction in nutrition represents an unintended
   consequence of regulation, there were a set of category, firm, and brand
   conditions under which the NLEA produced a positive effect on brand
   nutritional quality. We find that firms were more likely to improve
   brand nutrition when firm risk or firm power is low. Lower risk occurs
   when the firm is introducing a new brand rather than changing an
   existing brand, and weaker power in a category is reflected by lower
   market share in a category. Furthermore, firms competing in low-health
   categories (e.g., potato chips) or small-portion categories (e.g.,
   peanut butter) improved nutrition more than firms competing in
   high-health categories (e.g., bread) or large-portion categories (e.g.,
   frozen dinners). Recommendations for firm strategy and the design of
   consumer information policy are examined in light of these surprising
   firm responses.

AB This paper asks whether brand extension can serve as a signal of product
   quality given that it costs less than a new brand. (Existing literature
   has assumed either that brand extension is cost-neutral or that it costs
   more.) I show that it can as a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, but the
   argument is unconvincing. For one thing, the separating equilibrium is
   not unique; a pooling equilibrium also exists in which brand extension
   signals nothing. For another, the separating equilibrium relies on
   off-equilibrium beliefs that are poorly motivated in the model. I
   propose a refinement of the perfect Bayesian equilibrium that resolves
   both issues. Empirical off-equilibrium beliefs require that consumers'
   off-equilibrium beliefs be justifiable on the basis of their prior
   beliefs and product performance observations. With empirical
   off-equilibrium beliefs, two necessary conditions for brand extension to
   signal product quality are identified: (i) consumers must perceive old
   and new products of the firm to be positively correlated in quality, and
   (ii) at least some consumers must identify with brands and not the firm
   behind the brands. Even with these conditions in place, the signaling
   argument is fragile: firm observability of past performance diminishes
   brand extension's signaling capability; an arbitrarily small probability
   of failure for good products eliminates it. My results suggest that,
   going. forward, the case for brand extension must rest on foundations
   other than signaling product quality.

AB This research examines how individual differences and institutional
   practices influence consumer bidding in auctions. Bidders may be
   motivated by different goals, e.g., thrill (of winning the item, with
   minimal attention to what they pay for it) versus prudence (winning the
   item at a price at or below its perceived value). Also, innate or
   auctioneer-induced differences may exist in the precision and salience
   of bidder cognitions about the item's value. We report two studies on
   how these motivational and cognitive factors influence bids in
   descending and ascending auctions, respectively. Each study also
   manipulated a situational variable (wait time at each price step). The
   two auctions realized different average prices for the same item set.
   Average bids were higher in the descending (versus ascending) auction in
   several study conditions. In both auction formats, bidders primed with
   thrill (versus prudence) bid higher, but more precise and/or salient
   values attenuated this goal effect. Among other results, in the
   descending auction, longer wait times elicited higher bids from bidders
   primed with thrill (but not prudence). In the ascending auction, longer
   wait times produced lower bids for bidders primed with prudence (but not
   thrill). These findings on consumer bidding behavior have practical
   implications for auction design.

   Consistent with our hypothesis, the experiments show that a consumer's
   unrecovered value associated with the base product is positively
   correlated to his likelihood of purchasing the add-on. Formal modeling
   of this bias shows that firms may find penetration pricing strategies
   (such as loss leader pricing) suboptimal. Furthermore, the identified
   bias leads the firm to spend more resources toward enhancing both the
   base product and the add-on quality, especially so when the add-on will
   be offered before the consumer has a chance to extensively use the base
   product. Finally, the effect of competition in the base product market
   is also considered.

AB Firms that sell via a direct channel and via indirect channels have to
   decide whether to allow third-party sellers to use trademarked brand
   names of products in their advertising. This question has been
   particularly controversial for advertising on search engines. In June
   2009, Google started allowing any third-party reseller of a product to
   use a trademark such as "DoubleTree" in the text of its ad, even if the
   reseller did not have the trademark holder's permission. We study the
   effects of this change empirically within the hotel industry. We find
   some evidence that allowing third-party sellers to use a trademark in
   their online search advertising weakly reduced the likelihood of a
   consumer clicking on a trademark holder's paid search ads. However, the
   decrease in paid clicks was outweighed by a large increase in consumers
   clicking on the unpaid links to the hotelier's website within the main
   search results. Our evidence shows that when a third-party seller
   focuses on a trademarked brand in its ads, the ads become less distinct,
   and customers are more likely to ignore the advertised offers and buy
   from the direct channel.

AB In recent years academic research has focused on understanding and
   modeling the survey response process. This paper examines an
   understudied systematic response tendency in surveys: the extent to
   which observed responses are subject to state dependence, i.e., response
   carryover from one item to another independent of specific item content.
   We develop a statistical model that simultaneously accounts for state
   dependence, item content, and scale usage heterogeneity. The paper
   explores how state dependence varies by response category, item
   characteristics, item sequence, respondent characteristics, and whether
   it becomes stronger as the survey progresses. Two empirical applications
   provide evidence of substantial and significant state dependence. We
   find that the degree of state dependence depends on item characteristics
   and item sequence, and it varies across individuals and countries. The
   article demonstrates that ignoring state dependence may affect
   reliability and predictive validity, and it provides recommendations for
   survey researchers.

AB It is well known that individuals often fail to exert proper
   self-control. In organizational settings, this can lead to reduced
   productivity and profits. We use the literature on present-biased
   preferences to model employees' self-control problems and examine how
   firms can design compensation plans to reduce the negative consequences
   of their employees' self-control problems. Our results suggest that
   firms can mitigate self-control problems by delaying payment to the
   employees. This can be achieved by using multiperiod quotas (such as
   annual quotas) to compensate employees for their cumulative performance.
   Although such plans are prevalent in the market, there is little
   theoretical research that shows when multiperiod quota plans can be
   optimal. The paper provides one potential explanation for the widespread
   use of such quota plans. Interestingly, we find that such plans may be
   optimal despite the fact that they encourage more procrastination. We
   also find that such plans lead to higher effort by the. employees and
   can sometimes improve the welfare of not only the firm but also the
   employees.

AB Social interaction (peer) effects are recognized as a potentially
   important factor in the diffusion of new products. In the case of
   environmentally friendly goods or technologies, both marketers and
   policy makers are interested in the presence of causal peer effects as
   social spillovers can be used to expedite adoption. We provide a
   methodology for the simple, straightforward identification of peer
   effects with sufficiently rich data, avoiding the biases that occur with
   traditional fixed effects estimation when using the past installed base
   of consumers in the reference group. We study the diffusion of solar
   photovoltaic panels in California and find that at the average number of
   owner-occupied homes in a zip code, an additional installation increases
   the probability of an adoption in the zip code by 0.78 percentage
   points. Our results provide valuable guidance to marketers designing
   strategies to increase referrals and reduce customer acquisition costs.

AB Competition is intense among rival technologies, and success depends on
   predicting their future trajectory of performance. To resolve this
   challenge, managers often follow popular heuristics, generalizations, or
   "laws" such as Moore's law. We propose a model, Step And Wait (SAW), for
   predicting the path of technological innovation, and we compare its
   performance against eight models for 25 technologies and 804
   technologies-years across six markets. The estimates of the model
   provide four important results. First, Moore's law and Kryder's law do
   not generalize across markets; neither holds for all technologies even
   in a single market. Second, SAW produces superior predictions over
   traditional methods, such as the Bass model or Gompertz law, and can
   form predictions for a completely new technology by incorporating
   information from other categories on time-varying covariates. Third,
   analysis of the model parameters suggests that (i) recent technologies
   improve at a faster rate than old technologies; (ii) as the number of
   competitors increases, performance improves in smaller steps and longer
   waits; (iii) later entrants and technologies that have a number of prior
   steps tend to have smaller steps and shorter waits; but (iv)
   technologies with a long average wait time continue to have large steps.
   Fourth, technologies cluster in their performance by market.

AB Although the assumption of utility-maximizing consumers has been
   challenged for decades, empirical applications of alternative choice
   rules are still very new. We add to this growing body of literature by
   proposing a model based on the idea of a "satisficing" decision maker.
   In contrast to previous models (including recent models implementing
   alternative choice rules), satisficing depends on the order in which
   alternatives are evaluated. We therefore conduct a visual conjoint
   experiment to collect search and choice data. We model search and
   product evaluation jointly and allow for interdependence between them.
   The choice rule incorporates a conjunctive rule for the evaluations and,
   contrary to most previous models, does not rely on compensatory
   trade-offs at all. The results strongly support the proposed model. For
   instance, we find that search is indeed influenced by product
   evaluations. More importantly, the model results strongly support the
   satisficing stopping rule. Finally, we perform a holdout prediction task
   and find that the proposed model outperforms a standard multinomial
   logit model.

AB This paper analyzes the competitive role of retail shopping experience
   in markets with consumer search costs. We examine how a retailer's
   advantage in providing consumer shopping experience affects its
   equilibrium pricing and price advertising strategies. We find that if
   the consumer valuation of a shopping experience is sufficiently low, its
   effect on retailer strategy is similar to that of quality, and the
   retailer with the advantage in shopping experience then deploys higher
   levels of price advertising. On the other hand, when the shopping
   experience is valuable enough for consumers, it acts akin to price
   advertising in that it makes it optimal for the retailer with the
   advantage in shopping experience to eschew price advertising. The
   optimal competitive investments in consumer shopping experience can be
   higher than that of a monopoly. The profit impact of shopping experience
   for a retailer depends on the level of shopping experience: for low
   levels, the profit impact depends on the difference in the levels
   between the retailers, but for high enough levels, it depends only on
   whether the retailer's shopping experience level is higher than that of
   its competitor. In this case, even small differences in shopping
   experience levels can result in large differences in equilibrium
   profits.

   Specifically, because firms using an innovation ratchet strategy delay

AB Word-of-mouth (WOM) plays an increasingly important role in shaping
   consumers' attitudes and buying behaviors. Prior work in marketing has
   mainly focused on the aggregate impact of WOM on product sales as well
   as the generation of WOM. Very little attention has been paid to the
   consumption or usage of WOM. In this paper, utilizing a unique data set
   that collects information from the automobile category on whether a
   consumer generates WOM to others and uses WOM for making purchase
   decisions, we build a discrete-choice model to study consumer WOM
   generation and WOM consumption decisions simultaneously and empirically
   answer questions that have not been explored previously. We are
   particularly interested in studying the key drivers of WOM
   generation/consumption and the synergy effect between the two
   WOM-related activities. We apply the proposed model to survey data
   collected on the automobile category. We find a strong synergy between
   WOM generation and WOM consumption. Although some consumers view WOM
   generation and WOM consumption as complementary to each other, others
   tend to perceive the two activities as competing with each other. We
   also find that consumer product experience and media exposure are
   positively correlated with their propensity to generate WOM. However,
   their effect on WOM consumption is mixed. Our empirical analysis also
   provides evidence of unobserved heterogeneity in the way consumer WOM
   activities are related to consumer product experience. Overall, these
   findings lead to important managerial implications on targeting for
   effective use of WOM as a marketing tool.

AB Contextual advertising entails the display of relevant ads based on the
   content that consumers view, exploiting the potential that consumers'
   content preferences are indicative of their product preferences. This
   paper studies the strategic aspects of such advertising, considering an
   intermediary who has access to a content base, sells advertising space
   to advertisers who compete in the product market, and provides the
   targeting technology. The results show that contextual targeting impacts
   advertiser profit in two ways: First, advertising through relevant
   content topics helps advertisers reach consumers with a strong
   preference for their product. Second, heterogeneity in consumers'
   content preferences can be leveraged to reduce product market
   competition, especially when competition is intense. The intermediary
   has incentives to strategically design its targeting technology,
   sometimes at the cost of the advertisers. When product market
   competition is moderate, the intermediary offers accurate targeting such
   that the consumers see the most relevant ads. When competition is high,
   the intermediary lowers the targeting accuracy such that the consumers
   see less relevant ads. Doing so intensifies competition and encourages
   advertisers to bid for multiple content topics in order to prevent their
   competitors from reaching consumers. In some cases, this may lead to an
   asymmetric equilibrium where one advertiser bids high even for the
   content topic that is more relevant to its competitor.

AB This paper studies optimal product line design when consumers need to
   incur costly deliberation to uncover 1 their valuations for quality. To
   induce deliberation, a firm must maintain quality dispersion and cut the
   price of the high-end product so that consumers are motivated to
   deliberate in the hope that high-end consumption fits their needs. To
   prevent deliberation, the firm may have to offer downgraded quality at a
   low price so that an impulsive purchase will not appear too wasteful.
   Whether the firm should induce deliberation depends on how much surplus
   it creates by aligning the supply of quality with heterogeneous demand
   for quality and how much surplus it captures during this process.
   Interestingly, equilibrium firm profit, consumer surplus, and social
   welfare can all increase with the cost of deliberation. We extend the
   model to accommodate consumers' heterogeneous prior beliefs of their
   valuations for quality. We also discuss how market research could
   benefit from taking into account the endogeneity of consumer
   deliberation.

AB This paper studies product bundling in a distribution channel where a
   downstream retailer combines component goods produced by separate
   manufacturers acting independently. Past literature offers deep insights
   about bundling by a single firm whose unit costs are not impacted by
   choice of selling strategy. But when the retailer bundles goods from
   separate manufacturers, unit costs for the bundler (retailer) are, being
   the prices set by the manufacturers, no longer exogenous. This alters
   the economic balance with respect to bundling. I show that channel
   conflicts weaken the case for bundling. Although bundling is better than
   component selling for the integrated firm, it is no longer so in the
   decentralized channel. The culprit is a combination of vertical channel
   conflict (incentive misalignment with respect to bundle versus component
   sales) and horizontal conflict (each manufacturer wants a higher share
   of profits from bundle sales), with the latter playing a dominant role.
   They cause manufacturers to overprice component goods, weakening the
   retailer's incentives to bundle. The competitive interplay between firms
   when one (retailer) merges the prices of several (manufacturers) leads
   to lower profits for all. Price coordination between the firms could
   partially restore the role of bundling and improve the firms' profits as
   well as consumer surplus.

AB This paper considers the history of keywords used in Marketing Science
   to develop insights on the evolution of marketing science. Several
   findings emerge. First, "pricing" and "game theory" are the most
   ubiquitous words. More generally, the three C's and four P's
   predominate, suggesting that keywords and common practical frameworks
   align. Various trends exist. Some words, like "pricing," remain popular
   over time. Others, like "game theory" and "hierarchical Bayes," have
   become more popular. Finally, some words are superseded by others, like
   "diffusion" by "social networking." Second, the overall rate of new
   keyword introductions has increased, but the likelihood they will remain
   in use has decreased. This suggests a maturation of the discipline or a
   long-tail effect. Third, a correspondence analysis indicates three
   distinct eras of marketing modeling, comporting roughly with each of the
   past three decades. These eras are driven by the emergence of new data
   and business problems, suggesting a fluid field responsive to practical
   problems. Fourth, we consider author publication survival rates, which
   increase up to six papers and then decline, possibly as a result of
   changes in ability or motivation. Fifth, survival rates vary with the
   recency and nature of words. We conclude by discussing the implications
   for additional journal space and the utility of standardized
   classification codes.

AB Presidential elections provide both an important context in which to
   study advertising and a setting that mitigates the challenges of
   dynamics and endogeneity. We use the 2000 and 2004 general elections to
   analyze the effect of market-level advertising on county-level vote
   shares. The results indicate significant positive effects of advertising
   exposures. Both instrumental variables and fixed effects alter the ad
   coefficient. Advertising elasticities are smaller than are typical for
   branded goods yet significant enough to shift election outcomes. For
   example, if advertising were set to zero and all other factors held
   constant, three states' electoral votes would have changed parties in
   2000. Given the narrow margin of victory in 2000, this shift would have
   resulted in a different president.

AB he extensive adoption of uniform pricing for branded variants is a
   puzzling phenomenon, considering that firms may improve profitability
   through price discrimination. In this paper, we incorporate consumers'
   concerns of peer-induced price fairness into a model of price
   competition and show that a uniform price for branded variants may
   emerge in equilibrium. Interestingly, we find that uniform pricing
   induced by consumers' concerns of fairness can actually help mitigate
   price competition and hence increase firms' profits if the demand of the
   product category is expandable. Furthermore, an individual firm may not
   have an incentive to unilaterally mitigate consumers' concerns of price
   fairness to its own branded variants, which suggests the long-run
   sustainability of the uniform pricing strategy. As a result, fairness
   concerns from consumers provide a natural mechanism for firms to commit
   to uniform pricing and enhance their profits.

AB One of the characteristics of the fashion marketplace is the
   unpredictability and apparent randomness of fashion hits. Another one is
   the information asymmetry among consumers. In this paper, we consider
   fashion as a means consumers use to signal belonging to a higher social
   rank and propose an analytical model of fashion hits in the presence of
   competition and consumers who can coordinate on which product to use. We
   show that, consistent with the observed market phenomenon, in
   equilibrium, consumer coordination involves randomization between
   products chosen, i.e., in randomness of fashion hits. Analyzing optimal
   consumer choice, we find that whenever low-type consumer demand for a
   product is positive, a price increase results in a higher probability of
   high-type consumers choosing this product but lower low-type consumer
   demand. We also show that although high-type consumers may prefer
   (higher) prices that would lead to complete separation of the high- and
   the low-type consumers through product use, in equilibrium, firms always
   price as to attract positive demand from low-type consumers. The
   equilibrium price and profits turn out to be nonmonotonic in the
   low-type consumer valuation of being recognized as belonging to a higher
   social rank. Equilibrium profits first increase and then decrease in
   this valuation.

AB Recognizing that initial public offerings (IPOs) represent the debut of
   private firms on the public stage, this study investigates how pre-IPO
   customer and competitor orientations (CCOs) affect IPO outcomes.
   Building on information economics, we propose that CCOs influence
   investors' sentiments toward an IPO and that both IPO-specific variables
   (which influence the credibility of CCO information) and facets of the
   organizational institutional and task environments (which influence the
   appropriateness of CCO information) moderate this influence. We test the
   framework using data collected from computer-aided text analysis, expert
   coders, and secondary sources for 543 IPOs across 43 industries between
   2000 and 2004. A Bayesian shrinkage model, which accounts for
   industry-specific effects and uses latent instrumental variables to
   address CCO endogeneity, shows that CCOs positively influence IPO
   outcomes. Furthermore, (1) underwriter reputation and venture funding
   positively moderate the effects of CCOs; (2) technological and market
   turbulence positively and institutional complexity negatively moderate
   the effect of customer orientation; and (3) technological turbulence,
   competitive intensity, and institutional complexity positively moderate
   the effect of competitor orientation. Also, accounting for endogeneity
   using latent instrumental variables substantially improves the
   predictive validity of the model, relative to alternative model
   specifications.

AB Patients increasingly request their physicians to prescribe specific
   brands of pharmaceutical drugs. A popular belief is that requests are
   triggered by direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA). We examine the
   relationship between DTCA, patient requests, and prescriptions for
   statins. We find that although the effect of requests on prescriptions
   is significantly positive, the mean effect of DTCA on patient requests
   is negative, yet very small. More interestingly, both effects show
   substantial heterogeneity across physicians, which we uncover using a
   hierarchical Bayes estimation procedure. We find that specialists
   receive more requests than primary care physicians but translate them
   less into prescriptions. In addition, we find that the sociodemographic
   profile of the area a physician practices in moderates the effects of
   DTCA on requests and of requests on prescriptions. For instance,
   physicians from areas with a higher proportion of minorities (i.e.,
   blacks and Hispanics) receive more requests that are less triggered by
   DTCA and are accomodated less frequently than physicians from areas with
   a lower proportion of minorities. Our results challenge managers to
   revisit the role of DTCA in stimulating patient requests. At the same
   time, they may trigger public policy concerns regarding physicians'
   accommodation of patient requests and the inequalities they may induce.

AB Firms that serve a large market with many diverse consumer types use
   discriminatory or nonlinear pricing to extract higher revenue, inducing
   consumers to separate by self-selecting from a large number of tariff
   options. But the extent of price discrimination must often be tempered
   by the high costs of devising and managing discriminatory tariffs,
   including costs of supporting consumers in understanding and making
   selection from a complex menu of choices. These tariff design trade-offs
   occur in many industries where firms face many consumer types and each
   consumer picks the number of units to consume over time. Examples
   include wireless communication services, other telecom and information
   technology products, legal plans, fitness clubs, automobile clubs,
   parking, healthcare plans, and many services and utilities. This paper
   evaluates alternative ways to price discriminate while accounting for
   both revenues and tariff management costs. The revenue-maximizing menu
   of quantity-price bundles can be very (or infinitely) large and hence
   not practical. Instead, two-part tariffs (2PTs), which charge a fixed
   entry fee and a per-unit fee, can extract a large fraction of the
   optimal revenue with a small menu of choices, and they become more
   attractive once the costs of tariff management are factored in. We show
   that three-part tariffs (3PTs), which use an additional instrument, the
   "free allowance," are an even more efficient way to price discriminate.
   A relatively small menu of 3PTs can be more profitable than a menu of
   2PTs of any size. This 3PT menu can be designed with less information
   about consumer preferences relative to the menu of two-part tariffs,
   which, in order to segment customers optimally, needs fine-grained
   information about preferences. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive
   insight that more-complex tariffs need not always be more profitable; it
   matters whether the complexity is from many choices or more pricing
   instruments.

AB This article examines cross-price promotional effects in a dynamic
   context. Among other things, we investigate whether previously
   established findings hold when consumer and competitive dynamics are
   taken into account. Five main influential effects (asymmetric price
   effect, neighborhood price effect, asymmetric share effect, neighborhood
   share effect, and private label versus national brand asymmetry) appear
   jointly in the second layer of a pooled HB-VEC-VARX model, together with
   brand- and category-specific variables. This study tests the relative
   importance of these key factors across three scenarios: with no market
   dynamics, when only consumer dynamics are considered, and when
   competitive reactions are also taken into account. The results confirm
   all five influential effects, even if they are jointly estimated, and
   consumer and competitive dynamics are taken into account. National
   brand/private label asymmetry has the strongest influence on the
   cross-price promotional effects and becomes significantly stronger when
   consumer and competitive dynamics are taken into account. Dynamic
   consumer responses and competitive reactions both affect cross-brand
   price elasticities, and contrary to expectations, competitive reactions
   accumulate rather than diminish cross-price elasticities. Preemptive
   switching does occur; i.e., a brand's promotion in period t hurts a
   competitor's sales in subsequent periods. Our findings are based on an
   extensive data set. To attain generalizable results, we analyze 33
   categories in five stores-that is, 165 store/category combinations.

AB We propose a structural model to study the effect of online product
   reviews on consumer purchases of experiential products. Such purchases
   are characterized by limited repeat purchase behavior of the same
   product item (such as a book title) but significant past usage
   experience with other products of the same type (such as books of the
   same genre). To cope with the uncertainty in quality of the product
   item, we posit that consumers may learn from their experience with the
   same type of product and others' experiences with the product item. We
   model the review credibility as the precision with which product reviews
   reflect the consumer's own product evaluation. The higher the precision,
   the more credible the information obtained from product reviews for the
   consumer, and the larger the effect of reviews on the consumer's choice
   probabilities. We extend the Bayesian learning framework to model
   consumer learning on both product quality and review credibility. We
   apply the model to a panel data set of 1,919 book purchases by 243
   consumers. We find that consumers learn more from online reviews of book
   titles than from their own experience with other books of the same
   genre. In the counterfactual analysis, we illustrate the profit impact
   of product reviews and how it varies with the number of reviews. We also
   study the phenomenon of fake reviews. We find that fake reviews increase
   consumer uncertainty. The effects of more positive reviews and more
   numerous reviews on consumer choice are smaller on online retailing
   platforms that have fake product reviews.

AB We reanalyze endogenous sample selection in the context of customer
   scoring, targeting, and influencing decisions. Scoring relies on ordered
   lists of probabilities that customers act in a way that contributes
   revenues, e.g., purchase something from the firm. Targeting identifies
   constrained sets of covariate patterns associated with high
   probabilities of these acts. Influencing aims at changing the
   probabilities that individual customers act accordingly through
   marketing activities. We show that successful targeting and influencing
   decisions require inference that controls for endogenous selection,
   whereas scoring can proceed relatively successfully based on simpler
   models that provide (local) approximations, capitalizing on spurious
   effects of observed covariates. To facilitate the type of inference
   required for targeting and influencing, we develop a prior that frees
   the analyst from having to specify (often arbitrary) exclusion
   restrictions for model identification a priori or to explicitly compare
   all possible models. We cover exclusions of observed as well as
   unobserved covariates that may cause the successive selections to be
   dependent. We automatically infer the dependence structure among
   selection stages using Markov chain Monte Carlo-based variable
   selection, before identifying the scale of latent variables. The
   adaptive parsimony achieved through our prior is particularly helpful in
   applications where the number of successive selections exceeds two, a
   relevant but underresearched situation.

AB A firm may want to preannounce its plans to develop a new product in
   order to stimulate future demand. But given that such communications can
   affect rivals' incentives to develop the same new product, a firm may
   decide to preannounce untruthfully in order to deter competitors. We
   examine an incumbent's preannouncement strategy when there is
   uncertainty regarding the commercial viability of a new product
   opportunity and a threat of rival entry Each firm has a private
   assessment of the market potential for the new product. Two competitive
   incentives arise for the incumbent in terms of discouraging rival entry:
   it can use preemptive communication or it can remain silent and instill
   a pessimistic market potential outlook. We find that an incumbent
   prefers to follow a vaporware strategy-i.e., declares plans to pursue a
   new product opportunity even when it may have no development
   intentions-when its market forecasting capabilities are weak and the
   demand-side benefits from preannouncing are small. By contrast, when the
   incumbent has strong market forecasting capabilities and the demand-side
   benefits are small, the incumbent adopts a suddenware strategy-i.e.,
   remains silent about its new product plans even when it actually plans
   to develop the new product. Finally, when its market forecasting
   capabilities are strong and the demand-side benefits are large, the
   incumbent prefers to engage in a trueware strategy-i.e., truthfully
   preannounces development plans. We show that an interplay between
   competition-related and demand-related considerations is what allows
   trueware to emerge as an equilibrium in the absence of any ex post cost
   to engaging in vaporware. In an extension, we let the incumbent's actual
   development plans leak out and allow the entrant to wait and learn those
   plans prior to setting a research and development level. We identify
   conditions for the entrant to postpone development despite the risk of
   being late to market, as well as conditions for the entrant to commence
   development immediately despite not knowing the incumbent's plans based
   on the observed preannouncement strategy.

AB Hokey Pokey, a popular "super premium" ice cream retailer, has over a
   dozen outlets based in India. Hokey Pokey offers "customized mix-in"
   flavors and realizes the importance of social media platforms to connect
   with its target consumers and create an engaging brand experience.
   However, with a limited marketing budget, the retailer needed to measure
   the success of its social media marketing efforts and create an
   optimized strategy To accomplish this, we proposed and implemented a
   methodology to measure social media return on investment (ROT) and a
   customer's word-of-mouth (WOM) value by first creating a unique metric
   to measure the net influence wielded by a user in a social network,
   customer influence effect (CIE), and then predicting the user's ability
   to generate the spread of viral information. We then link WOM to the
   actual sales that it generates through a second metric, customer
   influence value (CIV), and we implement a strategy at Hokey Pokey to
   measure these metrics and identify their individual drivers. Finally, we
   refine our strategy to increase CIE and CIV, thereby impacting the
   profit. Our research shows that social media can be used to generate
   growth in sales, ROT, and positive word of mouth and can spread brand
   knowledge further.

   newly developed "costs-per-profit" heuristic enable advertisers to
   submit good bids even when there is significant noise in the data. A
   field experiment demonstrates that PROSAD can increase the return on

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of a
   category management tool known as Category Optimizer (TM) at Foster's
   Wine Estates Americas for one of its brands, the Beringer California
   Collection. Foster's was facing a common management problem: harnessing
   its portfolio of Beringer California Collection wines to increase
   profitability, improve its competitive position, and defend against a
   disruptive new entrant in the U.S. wine market called, Yellow Tail.
   Category Optimizer combines the parsimony of an internal market
   structure with the advances that have been made in assortment planning
   in operations research, assortment and stock-keeping-unit level
   modeling, mixed logits, and the marketing literature on the perceptions
   of variety of assortment to develop and estimate a model on readily
   available store scanner data. The model subsequently uses these results
   to inform strategic and tactical decision making. This approach led to
   recommendations that initially seemed counterintuitive; the normal
   response would be for Foster's to consider lowering prices to maintain
   share and volume, a strategy not inconsistent with many of the
   recommendations of past models. However, considering the additional
   degrees of freedom that a product range offered for defense, we
   demonstrated that a combination of price increases together with the
   introduction of a volume-flanker product in a new channel would improve
   profits, increase revenue, and protect and enhance, market share. These
   were successfully implemented in early 2008, earning rich dividends for
   the company; increasing profitability by 70%, revenue by 3%, and
   earnings before interest and taxes by 8.5%; and having a positive impact
   on its brand ranking. In fact, in 2008, it debuted as sixth among the
   international wine brands. It also managed to play an important role in
   deposing Yellow Tail, the market share leader, from its dominant
   position. We conclude the paper by providing examples of other companies
   where this approach has also been successfully implemented and by
   discussing some avenues for future research.

   Marketing Science. This article reviews these papers and projects,
   examines their influence on the relevant organizations, and provides a
   perspective on the diffusion and impact of marketing science models
   within the organizations. We base our analysis on three sources of
   data-the articles, authors' responses to a survey, and in-depth
   interviews with the authors. We draw some conclusions about how
   marketing science models can create more impact without losing academic
   rigor while maintaining strong relevance to practice.
   We find that the application and diffusion of marketing science models
   are not restricted to the well-known choice models, conjoint analysis,
   mapping, and promotional analysis-there are very effective applications
   across a wide range of managerial problems using an array of marketing
   science techniques. There is no one successful approach, and although
   some factors are correlated with impactful marketing science models,
   there are a number of pathways by which a project can add value to its
   client organization. Simpler, easier-to-use models that offer robust and
   improved results can have a stronger impact than academically
   sophisticated models can. Organizational buy-in is critical and can be
   achieved through recognizing high-level champions, holding in-house
   presentations and dialogues, doing pilot assignments, involving
   multidepartment personnel, and speaking the same language as the
   influential executives. And we find that intermediaries often, but not
   always, play a key role in the transportability and diffusion of models
   across organizations.
   Although these applications are impressive and reflect profitable
   academic practitioner partnerships, changes in the knowledge base and
   reward systems for academics, intermediaries, and practitioners are
   required for marketing science approaches to realize their potential
   impact on a much larger scale than the highly selective sample that we
   have been able to analyze.

AB In many markets, a handset vendor and a service provider may enter into
   a tie-in for a handset to be available exclusively through the service
   provider. We examine when and why a service provider and a handset
   vendor may find this arrangement mutually profitable. We find that an
   exclusive handset arrangement (EHA) may serve a dual strategic purpose.
   By restricting its handsets to one service provider, a handset vendor
   may be able to induce a rival handset vendor to compete less
   aggressively. At the same time, the service provider may be able to
   essentially raise a rival service provider's handset costs by limiting
   the handsets available to the rival. Interestingly, the handset vendor's
   market share may be higher when its handset is sold exclusively than
   when it is not. Our results might explain why EHAs seem more attractive
   in some markets than in others, why some service providers have
   exclusive arrangements even for handset models that do not seem popular,
   and how some handset vendors enjoy high market shares despite having
   many exclusive models. Furthermore, an EHA may lower the handset
   vendor's incentives to improve handset quality, supporting concerns
   raised by proponents of wireless network neutrality.

AB In this paper we quantify the economic worth of celebrity endorsements
   by studying the sales of endorsed products. We do so with the use of two
   unique data sets consisting of monthly golf ball sales and professional
   golfer (celebrity) rankings. In particular, we examine the impact Tiger
   Woods had on sales of Nike golf balls. Our identification of the causal
   effect of a celebrity is grounded in the celebrity's random performance
   over time.
   Using two different approaches, reduced form and structural, we find
   that there are substantial celebrity endorsement effects. From our
   structural model, we determine that endorsements not only induce
   consumers to switch brands, a business stealing effect, but also have a
   primary demand effect. We determine that from 2000 to 2010, the Nike
   golf ball division reaped an additional profit of $103 million through
   the acquisition of 9.9 million in sales from Tiger Woods' endorsement
   effect. Moreover, having Tiger Woods' endorsement led to a price premium
   of roughly 2.5%. As a result, approximately 57% of Nike's investment in
   Woods' $181 million endorsement deal was recovered just in U.S. golf
   ball sales alone.

AB Until recently, brand identities were built by firms via brand image
   advertising. However, the flourishing consumer communication weakened
   the firms' grip on their brands. The interaction between advertising and
   consumer communications and their joint impact on brand identity is the
   focal point of this paper.
   We present a model in which consumer preference for functional
   attributes may correlate with the identity they desire to project of
   themselves. This correlation is known to the firm but not to the
   consumers. Both the firm and the consumers can communicate their desired
   brand identity, although the actual brand identity is determined
   endogeneously by the composition of consumers who purchase it (i.e.,
   what types of people consume the brand).
   We find that sometimes the firm can strengthen the identity of its brand
   by refraining from advertising. This result is based on the following
   intermediate finding: advertising can diminish the endogeneous
   informativeness of consumer communications by making it one-sided.
   Furthermore, it turns out that refraining from brand image advertising
   may be optimal for the firm when the product is especially well
   positioned to create a strong identity-i.e., when consumer preferences
   for functional and self-expressive attributes are highly correlated.

AB There is a growing trend among consumers to serially consume small,
   incomplete "chunks" of multiple media types-television, radio, Internet,
   and print within a short time period. We refer to this behavior as media
   multiplexing and note that key challenges for integrated marketing
   communications media planners are (1) predicting which media or
   combination of media their target audience is likely to consume at any
   given time and (2) understanding potential substitutions and
   complementarities in their joint consumption. We propose a forecasting
   model that incorporates media-multiplexing behavior of both traditional
   and new media, their interdependencies, and consumer heterogeneity, and
   we calibrate the model using a rich database of individual-specific
   media activity diaries. The results suggest that accounting for media
   synergies within a single utility specification significantly improves
   model forecasts. We also introduce a utility function that directly
   models cross-channel media complementarities via interactive effects of
   the satiation parameters of own and joint consumption of various media
   types. Finally, our individual-level analyses generate unique insights
   on consumer-level media switching, multiplexing, and individual
   heterogeneity often ignored in aggregate data.

AB A setting is considered where consumers keep track of the extent to
   which brands care about them, which is modeled as altruism of brands
   toward their target consumers. Consumers who purchase an experience good
   of high quality reasonably deduce that the supplier of this good is
   relatively altruistic toward them, and they are therefore more keen to
   purchase a brand extension that is also directed at them. As a result,
   the success of brand extensions depends on the overlap between the
   customers of the original product and the target customers of the
   extension product. The quality and demand for a brand extension can be
   higher if the brand is perceived as caring only for its most

AB We empirically study the motivations of users to contribute content to
   social media in the context of the popular microblogging site Twitter.
   We focus on noncommercial users who do not benefit financially from
   their contributions. Previous literature suggests that there are two
   main types of utility that motivate these users to post content:
   intrinsic utility and image-related utility. We leverage the fact that
   these two types of utility give rise to different predictions as to
   whether users should increase their contributions when their number of
   followers increases. To address the issue that the number of followers
   is endogenous, we conducted a field experiment in which we exogenously
   added followers (or follow requests, in the case of protected accounts)
   to a set of users over a period of time and compared their posting
   activities to those of a control group. We estimated each treated user's
   utility function using a dynamic discrete choice model. Although our
   results are consistent with both types of utility being at play, our
   model suggests that image-related utility is larger for most users. We
   discuss the implications of our findings for the evolution of Twitter
   and the type of value firms may derive from such platforms in the
   future.

AB We examine multilateral bargaining in vertical supply relationships that
   involve an upstream manufacturer who sells through two competing
   retailers. In these relationships the negotiations are interdependent,
   and bargaining externality may arise across the retailers. In addition,
   the timing by which the manufacturer negotiates with the retailers
   becomes important. In simultaneous bargaining the retailers negotiate
   without knowing if an agreement has been reached in the other retail
   channel, whereas in sequential bargaining the retailer in the second
   negotiation is able to observe whether an agreement was reached in the
   first negotiation. We show that simultaneous bargaining is optimal for
   the manufacturer when the retail prices (and profitability) are similar,
   and sequential bargaining is preferred when the dispersion in the retail
   prices is sufficiently large. As a result of ex post renegotiations, the
   manufacturer may strategically stock out the less profitable retailer
   who charged a relatively low retail price and exclusively supply only
   the retailer who charged a relatively high retail price and maintained
   high channel profitability. Moreover, ex post multilateral bargaining
   can buffer downstream competition and thus lead to positive retail
   profits even in markets that are close to perfect competition.

AB Asymmetric complements refer to goods where one good is more dependent
   on the other, yet consumers receive enhanced utility from consuming
   both. Examples include garden hoses and sprinklers, chips and dip, and
   routine versus personalized services where the former has a broader base
   for utility generation and the latter is more dependent on the other's
   presence. Measuring asymmetric effects is difficult when all that is
   observed are the purchase quantities present in a consumer's market
   basket. We propose a direct utility model with a latent decision
   sequence for measuring asymmetric effects that allows us to capture
   differential responses to cross-category purchases and inventories.
   Scanner panel data of milk and cereal purchases are used to investigate
   the presence of asymmetric complementarity, and implications are
   explored through counterfactual analyses involving cross-price
   elasticities and spillover effects of merchandising variables.

AB Physicians may learn about prescription drug effectiveness directly from
   the firm via detailing or from patient experience. Patient-mediated
   learning is aided by the use of free drug samples. The effective use of
   samples is hampered by a lack of understanding of its exact return on
   investment implications. We seek to fill this gap by incorporating the
   physician's sample allocation behavior in the firm's decision making. We
   uncover the following implications for firms as well as policy makers.
   First, we find that the optimal sampling level for a drug category is a
   nonmonotonic function of patient payment ability and the price of the
   drug. Second, an increase in the cost of samples can lead to an increase
   in sampling and a decrease in detailing when the physician's propensity
   to provide sample subsidies is high. Third, when future market growth is
   expected to be high (early stage product life cycle and/or chronic
   drugs) and sampling efficiency is low, the use of sampling is profitable
   for the firm but leads to lower market coverage than when sampling is
   disallowed.

AB Laboratory and field experiments show that when choosing among a set of
   objects, consumers could be subjected to context-dependent preferences
   and evaluate options by considering both the absolute utilities and
   their relative standing in the choice set. Using this premise we
   construct a game-theoretic model of competition between two firms and
   investigate how a firm's decision to differentiate or imitate is
   affected when consumers' preferences are context-dependent. We consider
   two horizontally differentiated firms where some consumers own the
   product of one firm and the rest own the other firm's product. One firm
   upgrades its existing product by adding a new feature. In the absence of
   any cost or capability constraints, to protect its competitive position,
   the other firm would prefer to upgrade its product by adding a
   differentiated new feature. We show that if consumers' preferences are
   context-dependent and the new feature is of an incremental type, the
   second mover prefers to imitate the first mover by adding the same
   feature even when there is no cost disadvantage to differentiate itself.
   This happens because context-dependent preferences cause consumers to
   dislike brands that are very differentiated from one another. Thus, if
   the second mover mimics the first mover, both firms can charge higher
   prices for their upgraded products (i.e., imitation leads to higher
   prices). This outcome, in turn, leads the first mover to pick a new
   feature such that it would induce the second mover to imitate.
   Therefore, our analysis shows that the need for context management leads
   not just to imitation but also to accommodating imitation.

AB The market structure of platform competition is critically important to
   managers and policy makers. Network effects in these markets predict
   concentrated industry structures, whereas competitive effects and
   differentiation suggest the opposite. Standard theory offers little
   guidance-full rationality models have multiple equilibria with wildly
   varying market concentration. We relax full rationality in favor of a
   boundedly rational cognitive hierarchy model. Even small departures from
   full rationality allow sharp predictions-there is a unique equilibrium
   in every case. When participants single-home and platforms are
   vertically differentiated, a single dominant platform emerges.
   Multihoming can give rise to a strong-weak market structure: one
   platform is accessed by all, and the other is used as a backup by some
   agents. Horizontal differentiation, in contrast, leads to fragmentation.
   Differentiation, rather than competitive effects, mainly determines

AB When defection is unobserved, latent attrition models provide useful
   insights about customer behavior and accurate forecasts of customer
   value. Yet extant models ignore direct marketing efforts. Response
   models incorporate the effects of direct marketing, but because they
   ignore latent attrition, they may lead firms to waste resources on
   inactive customers.
   We propose a parsimonious model that allows direct marketing to impact
   three relevant behaviors in latent attrition models-the frequency with
   which customers conduct transactions, the size of the transactions, and
   the duration for which customers remain active. Our model also accounts
   for how the organization targets its direct marketing across individuals
   and over time.
   Using donation data from a nonprofit organization, we find that direct
   marketing increases donation incidence for active donors. However, our
   analysis also shows that direct marketing has the potential to shorten
   the length of a donor's relationship. We find that our proposed model
   offers superior predictive performance compared with models that ignore
   the impact of direct marketing activity or latent attrition. We
   demonstrate the managerial applicability of our modeling approach by
   estimating the impact of direct marketing on donation behavior and
   identifying those donors most likely to conduct transactions in the
   future.

AB We focus on destination categories, so named because they have the
   greatest impact on where households choose to shop and, more generally,
   on how category positioning affects which store a household chooses. We
   propose a reduced-form model-based analytical approach to identify
   categories that fill the destination role. Our approach determines which
   categories are most important to shoppers' store choice decisions and
   helps determine in which categories the retailer provides superior
   value. In addition, our approach allows us to understand the impact of
   the retailer's long-run merchandising policy decisions on the value it
   provides. Previous store choice research considered the effects of
   pricing, assortment and other merchandising decisions at the store level
   but did not focus on the effect of specific categories on store choice.
   This focus leads us to formulate a model that can (1) measure and
   explain the differential impact that specific categories have on
   shoppers' store choice decisions and (2) measure the relative value of
   retailers' category offerings, partitioning that value into the
   component resulting from retailer merchandising and the component that
   is nonmerchandising related. The model form captures differences in
   category value across stores (i.e., the store's category positioning) by
   specifying a spatial model for the store choice and category incidence
   intercepts. Our spatial model recognizes that stores position their
   offering vis-a-vis the category ideal based on long-run category
   merchandising decisions and that not all categories have the same
   importance in store choice decisions. We explore these issues for five
   retailers in the Charlotte, North Carolina market. We find that (1)
   category impact on store choice is highly skewed; (2) although
   categories with higher sales generally have a higher impact on store
   choice decisions, there are exceptions; (3) impact on store choice
   decisions does not vary systematically by the type of category (e. g.,
   perishable versus dry grocery); and (4) our measure of category impact
   on store choice, although correlated with the category development index
   between retailers, is superior in that it provides a basis for comparing
   category impact within a retailer and how relative category value, based
   on long-run merchandising decisions, attracts shoppers to a store.

AB The predominant perception on commonality strategy in product line
   design is that it entails a trade-off decision for a firm between cost
   savings and product differentiation. Adopting the commonality strategy
   may lower a firm's manufacturing costs, but it blurs the distinction
   between products targeting different consumer segments and makes
   consumer switching between products more likely such that
   cannibalization is always intensified. We show that this view in the
   literature is based on a crucial assumption that the quality valuation
   of one consumer segment is greater than that of another segment for all
   product attributes; i.e., one segment's preference structure dominates
   the other segment's preference structure. In this paper we consider the
   case of a nondominating preference structure where each segment has an
   attribute it values more than the other segment does. Interestingly, we
   show that the effect of commonality strategy is more diverse in this
   nondominating preference structure and that commonality can actually
   relieve cannibalization in the product line design. This finding gives
   rise to a previously unrecognized opportunity for firms to redesign
   their product lines to improve profits.

AB I consider a cheap-talk model in which a firm has a chance to
   communicate its product quality to consumers. The model describes how
   advertising can be both informative to consumers and profitable for the
   firm through its content in a vertically differentiated market. I find
   that advertising content may be effective in inducing search even if
   incentives for misrepresentation exist. In particular, a firm with an
   undesirable (low-quality) product is able to attract consumers who would
   have not incurred a search cost had they known its true quality. In this
   case, a semiseparating equilibrium occurs where the lowest firm types
   pool upward in order to increase the expected product quality while
   simultaneously signaling that the product is affordable. Although
   consumers always benefit from truth in advertising, total welfare may
   decrease if an undesirable firm is required to reveal its type. Finally,
   I show that the extent to which misrepresentation can take place
   increases with the cost of advertising coverage.

AB The canonical design of customer satisfaction surveys asks for global
   satisfaction with a product or service and for evaluations of its
   distinct attributes. Users of these surveys are often interested in the
   relationship between global satisfaction and attributes; regression
   analysis is commonly used to measure the conditional associations.
   Regression analysis is only appropriate when the global satisfaction
   measure results from the attribute evaluations and is not appropriate
   when the covariance of the items lie in a low-dimensional subspace, such
   as in a factor model. Potential reasons for low-dimensional responses
   are that responses may be haloed from overall satisfaction and there may
   be an unintended lack of item specificity. In this paper we develop a
   Bayesian mixture model that facilitates the empirical distinction
   between regression models and relatively much lower-dimensional factor
   models. The model uses the dimensionality of the covariance among items
   in a survey as the primary classification criterion while accounting for
   the heterogeneous usage of rating scales. We apply the model to four
   different customer satisfaction surveys that evaluate hospitals, an
   academic program, smartphones, and theme parks, respectively. We show
   that correctly assessing the heterogeneous dimensionality of responses
   is critical for meaningful inferences by comparing our results to those
   from regression models.

AB This paper studies the strategic interaction between firms producing
   strictly complementary products. With strict complements, a consumer
   derives positive utility only when both products are used together. We
   show that value-capture and value-creation problems arise when such
   products are developed and sold by separate firms ("nonintegrated"
   producers). Although the firms tend to price higher for given quality
   levels, their provision of quality is so low that, in equilibrium,
   prices are set well below what an integrated monopolist would choose.
   When one firm can mandate a royalty fee from the complementor producer
   (as often occurs in arrangements between hardware and software makers),
   we find that the value-capture problem is mitigated to some extent and
   consumer surplus rises. However, because royalty fees greatly reduce the
   incentives of the firm paying them to invest in quality, the arrangement
   exacerbates the value-creation problem and leads to even lower total
   quality. Surprisingly, this result can reverse with competition.
   Specifically, when the firm charging the royalty fee faces a vertically
   differentiated competitor, the value-creation problem is greatly
   reduced-opening the door for the possibility of a Pareto-improving
   outcome in which all firms and consumers benefit. It is worth noting
   that this outcome cannot be achieved by giving firms the option of
   introducing a line of product variants; competition serves as a
   necessary "commitment" ingredient.

AB As firms become more customer-centric, concepts such as customer equity
   come to the fore. Any serious attempt to quantify customer equity
   requires modeling techniques that can provide accurate multiperiod
   forecasts of customer behavior. Although a number of researchers have
   explored the problem of modeling customer churn in contractual settings,
   there is surprisingly limited research on the modeling of usage while
   under contract. The present work contributes to the existing literature
   by developing an integrated model of usage and retention in contractual
   settings. The proposed method fully leverages the interdependencies
   between these two behaviors even when they occur on different time
   scales (or "clocks"), as is typically the case in most
   contractual/subscription-based business settings.
   We propose a model in which usage and renewal are modeled simultaneously
   by assuming that both behaviors reflect a common latent variable that
   evolves over time. We capture the dynamics in the latent variable using
   a hidden Markov model with a heterogeneous transition matrix and allow
   for unobserved heterogeneity in the associated usage process to capture
   time-invariant differences across customers.
   The model is validated using data from an organization in which an
   annual membership is required to gain the right to buy its products and
   services. We show that the proposed model outperforms a set of benchmark
   models on several important dimensions. Furthermore, the model provides
   several insights that can be useful for managers. For example, we show
   how our model can be used to dynamically segment the customer base and
   identify the most common "paths to death" (i.e., stages that customers
   go through before churn).

AB Nearly a quarter of all products purchased in U. S. supermarkets and
   drug stores are store brands (SBs). Although the presence of SBs
   benefits both consumers and retailers, it is a threat to the dominance
   of the incumbent national brand manufacturers (NBMs). When considering
   the potential threat of an SB, an NBM generally pursues one of three
   strategies: accommodate, displace, or buffer. Under the accommodation
   strategy, the NBM repositions the products in his existing product line.
   Under the displacement strategy, the NBM elects to supply the SB to
   preempt the entry of the SB supplier. Under the buffering strategy, the
   NBM adds a defender product, which competes with his own product
   offering and the new SB. Using a game-theoretic model, we consider a
   market where consumers are heterogeneous in their valuation of product
   quality and analyze an NBM's response to an SB threat. We focus on two
   important drivers: the NBM's ability to differentiate on the quality
   dimensions and his cost advantage over the outside supplier of SB. To
   completely characterize the NBM's response, we consider two regimes. In
   the first regime, the NBM is a monopolist producer. In the second
   regime, the retailer has the added option of procuring an SB product
   from an independent, nonstrategic SB manufacturer. By comparing the
   results from both regimes, we develop a descriptive theory that
   clarifies the incentives of the NBM to accommodate, displace, or buffer.
   In doing this, we determine how the NBM's whole product portfolio should
   be designed, i.e., the positioning (quality levels) and prices of all
   its offerings.

AB Many durable products with relatively short selling seasons have been
   using returns policies between manufacturers and retailers as the
   contractual protocol for some time. Recently, these sectors have
   witnessed the growing popularity of peer-to-peer Web-based used goods
   markets as important transaction channels between buyers and sellers.
   Given that these two issues are critically linked from both supply and
   demand perspectives, in this paper we study the role that consumer
   valuation of used products plays in shaping a manufacturer's incentive
   to offer a returns policy option to a retailer when used goods might be
   devalued compared to new ones as a result of physical deterioration (or
   obsolescence). We do so through a two-period dyadic channel framework
   where the retailer faces uncertain demand for a durable product from a
   renewable set of customers who are impatient but forward looking. The
   manufacturer, on the other hand, needs to decide whether or not to offer
   a returns contract to the retailer. We first characterize the necessary
   and sufficient condition under which a returns contract is the
   equilibrium strategy as well as the corresponding channel decisions.
   Further analysis of this condition reveals that a higher consumer
   valuation of used products increases the likelihood of a returns
   contract being the equilibrium strategy. This result seems to be robust
   except when the potential demands for the two periods are quite
   deterministic and uncorrelated. However, it contradicts the burgeoning
   managerial trend to replace returns contracts with price-only ones in
   sectors where used goods are valued relatively highly by the consumers.
   We also discuss how used goods markets affect the equilibrium channel
   decisions as well as how demand uncertainty and logistics costs
   associated with returns influence the equilibrium contracting strategy.

AB This paper examines the impact of search engine optimization (SEO) on
   the competition between advertisers for organic and sponsored search
   results. The results show that a positive level of search engine
   optimization may improve the search engine's ranking quality and thus
   the satisfaction of its visitors. In the absence of sponsored links, the
   organic ranking is improved by SEO if and only if the quality provided
   by a website is sufficiently positively correlated with its valuation
   for consumers. In the presence of sponsored links, the results are
   accentuated and hold regardless of the correlation. When sponsored links
   serve as a second chance to acquire clicks from the search engine,
   low-quality websites have a reduced incentive to invest in SEO, giving
   an advantage to their high-quality counterparts. As a result of the high
   expected quality on the organic side, consumers begin their search with
   an organic click. Although SEO can improve consumer welfare and the
   payoff of high-quality sites, we find that the search engine's revenues
   are typically lower when advertisers spend more on SEO and thus less on
   sponsored links. Modeling the impact of the minimum bid set by the
   search engine reveals an inverse U-shaped relationship between the
   minimum bid and search engine profits, suggesting an optimal minimum bid
   that is decreasing in the level of SEO activity.

AB This study examines the strategic implications of retailer shelf layout
   decisions in a market characterized by consumer fit uncertainty. A
   retailer can display competing products in the same location, allowing
   consumers to inspect various products all at once or in distant
   locations, which induces consumers to inspect one product first and then
   decide whether to incur the travel cost to inspect another product. We
   consider a model in which two competing manufacturers distribute two
   horizontally differentiated products through a common retailer. Our
   analysis shows when the two manufacturers offer products of the same fit
   probabilities, the retailer obtains a greater profit by displaying
   competing products in distant locations if the products' fit
   probabilities are not too high; otherwise, the retailer is better off
   displaying competing products in the same location. When manufacturers
   offer products of differentiated fit probabilities, a retailer is more
   likely to benefit from displaying competing products in distant
   locations with an increased fit difference between products. Finally, a
   retailer is more likely to benefit from displaying competing products in
   distant locations when facing less competition from other retailers.

AB A widely debated question in recent years by both strategy theorists and
   antitrust practitioners is what role product differentiation between
   firms plays in their ability to sustain a collusive agreement in order
   to reduce the strength of competition and gain higher profits. This
   paper addresses the following question: What happens to the "product
   differentiation-collusion sustainability" relationship when setting up
   and maintaining an agreement is costly? We show that introducing
   collusion costs into the discussion has relevant implications. Indeed,
   sufficiently high collusion costs modify the underlying market
   structure, thus altering the product differentiation-collusion
   sustainability relationship with respect to the case where collusion
   costs are absent or low. In particular, if the gains from collusion are
   increasing (decreasing) with the degree of product differentiation, the
   relationship between product differentiation and collusion
   sustainability is always positive (negative), whereas if the gains from
   collusion are inverted U-shaped, the relationship is inverted U-shaped
   too. These results stress the importance of considering those markets
   where the coordination between firms is sufficiently costly as
   structurally different from those markets where coordination has no
   costs for firms.

AB I measure the spillover effect of intercollegiate athletics on the
   quantity and quality of applicants to institutions of higher education
   in the United States- an effect popularly known as the "Flutie effect."
   I treat athletic success as a stock of goodwill that decays over time,
   similar to that of advertising. A major challenge is that privacy laws
   prevent us from observing information about the applicant pool. I
   overcome this challenge by using order statistic distribution to infer
   applicant quality from information on enrolled students. Using a
   flexible random-coefficients aggregate discrete choice model that
   accommodates heterogeneity in preferences for school quality and
   athletic success, as well as an extensive set of school fixed effects to
   control for unobserved quality in athletics and academics, I estimate
   the impact of athletic success on applicant quality and quantity.
   Overall, athletic success has a significant, long-term goodwill effect
   on future applications and quality. However, students with
   lower-than-average SAT scores tend to have a stronger preference for
   athletic success, whereas students with higher SAT scores have a greater
   preference for academic quality. Furthermore, the decay rate of
   athletics' goodwill is significant only for students with lower SAT
   scores, suggesting that the goodwill created by intercollegiate
   athletics resides more extensively with lower-scoring students than with
   their higher-scoring counterparts. But, surprisingly, athletic success
   impacts applications even among academically stronger students.

AB Retailers face the problem of finding the assortment that maximizes
   category profit. This is a challenging task because the number. of
   potential assortments is very large when there are many stock-keeping
   units (SKUs) to choose from. Moreover, SKIT sales can be cannibalized by
   other SKUs in the assortment, and the more similar SKUs are, the more
   this happens. This paper develops an implementable and scalable
   assortment optimization method that allows for theory-based substitution
   patterns and optimizes real-life, large-scale assortments at the store
   level. We achieve this by adopting an attribute-based approach to
   capture preferences, substitution patterns, and cross-marketing mix
   effects. To solve the optimization problem, we propose new very large
   neighborhood search heuristics. We apply our methodology to store-level
   scanner data on liquid laundry detergent. The optimal assortments are
   expected to enhance retailer profit considerably (37.3%), and this
   profit increases even more (to 43.7%) when SKU prices are optimized
   simultaneously.

   alternative-based versus attribute-based information processing. Less
   attention has been paid to studying how the processing pattern at the
   point of purchase is associated with a consumer's propensity to buy in
   shopping settings. To understand this relationship, we formulate a
   discrete choice model and perform formal model comparisons to
   distinguish among several possible dependence structures. We consider
   models involving an existing measure of information processing, PATTERN;
   a latent variable version of this measure; and several new refinements
   and generalizations. Analysis of a unique data set of 895 shoppers on a
   popular electronics website supports the latent variable specification
   and provides validation for several hypotheses and modeling components.
   We find a positive relationship between alternative-based processing and
   purchase, as well as a tendency of shoppers in the lower price category
   to engage in alternative-based processing. The results also support the
   case for joint modeling and estimation. These findings can be useful for
   future work in information processing and suggest that likely buyers can
   be identified while engaged in information processing prior to purchase
   commitment, an important first step in targeting decisions.

AB When we think of colas, Coca-Cola first comes to mind. Products such as
   Cola-Cola, Tide laundry detergent, and Chapstick lip balm are the
   prototypical products in their respective categories. For more than
   three decades, research in consumer psychology has accumulated evidence
   on how prototypicality influences memory, shapes the composition of
   consideration set, and affects purchase decision. Yet there is no
   research on how it changes the competitive behavior of firms in a
   horizontally differentiated market. For example, some prototypical
   products are priced lower than other products in their category, whereas
   in certain other categories the prototypical product is priced higher.
   We propose a novel model of spatial competition, where the
   prototypicality of a product influences the probability of the product
   being included in consumers' consideration sets without affecting its
   valuation. Using the model, we examine theoretically the impact of
   prototypicality on the pricing decisions of competing firms. Our
   analysis shows that when consumer valuations are low, the prototypical
   product is priced lower than a nonprototypical product and earns more
   profits. However, when consumer valuations are high, the rank order of
   the prices of the prototypical product and a nonprototypical product is
   reversed, but not the order of profits. We subject these predictions to
   an empirical test. The experimental results lend support for the
   qualitative predictions of the model.

AB Should a firm favor a weaker or stronger employee in a contest? Despite
   a widespread emphasis on rewarding the best employees, managers continue
   to tolerate and even favor poor performers. Contest theory reveals that
   evenly matched contests are the most intense, which implies that a
   contest designer can maximize each player's effort by artificially
   boosting the underdog's chances. We apply this type of "handicapping" to
   a two-period repeated contest between employees, in which the only
   information available about their abilities is their performance in the
   first period. In this setting, employees are strategic and forward
   looking, such that they fully anticipate the potential impact of the
   first-period contest result on the second-period contest and thus adjust
   their behaviors accordingly. The manager also incorporates these
   strategic behaviors of employees when determining an optimal
   handicapping policy. If employees' abilities are sufficiently different,
   favoring the first-period loser in the second period increases the total
   effort over both periods. However, if abilities are sufficiently

AB How do firms develop marketing strategy when consumers seek to satisfy
   both quality and status-related considerations? We develop an analytical
   model to study this issue, examining both pricing and product management
   decisions in markets for conspicuous durable goods. Our analysis yields
   many interesting and nontrivial insights. First, we demonstrate that
   high intrinsic, quality indirectly generates exclusivity via pricing
   effects; in turn, this exclusivity generates considerable social payoffs
   where consumers value status. This insight reverses the direction of
   causality in the existing literature, wherein only status considerations
   matter and mere price increases may enhance consumer utility. Second,
   our dynamic model indicates that where consumers prioritize status
   benefits, producers incur substantial price depreciation in equilibrium.
   Third, we examine the product management strategies used by firms to
   preserve early adopter exclusivity. Finally, we discuss the boundary
   conditions of our results as well as our results' implications for
   managerial and policy issues.

AB Co-creation, the participation of customers in the design and production
   of goods and services, has been gaining popularity in recent years. In
   this research we incorporate firm pricing into the joint production
   process allowing us to study (1) production externalities between firm
   and customers, (2) production externalities among customers, and (3)
   optimal pricing by firms.
   We show that given a choice, a monopoly firm will opt for co-creation
   with customers rather than deal with passive price-taking consumers.
   Furthermore, the firm will increase the effort it devotes to co-creation
   as the number of potential co-creating customers increases.
   We show that the profit of a firm facing a centralized pattern of
   externalities among customers (with an expert, or lead user, in the
   center) can be higher than its profit when facing a decentralized
   pattern of externalities among customers and clearly dominates its
   profit when customers do not have any cross externalities. Thus, we
   provide a different justification for the use of lead users, one that
   depends on their network centrality and not on having lower cost, more
   information, or greater ability than the firm. Because the decentralized
   pattern has more links than the centralized pattern, our results
   demonstrate the importance of the pattern of links between customers,
   and not just their number, in determining the profitability of
   co-creation.
   Furthermore, we find that the lead user's externality spillover to other
   connected users, her neighbors, acts as a force multiplier on the
   efforts exerted by all participants in equilibrium. Specifically, a
   higher spillover from the lead user increases the efforts of the firm,
   the neighbors, and the lead user herself, and this may lead to
   beneficial outcomes for all.
   Finally, we show that in co-creation environments, a monopolist firm may
   benefit by committing to a single price rather than exercising price
   discrimination. This is because the pricing structure affects customers'
   incentive to invest effort in the innovation-production stage.

   why full-credit return policies, which were considered suboptimal from

   authors argued that the underlying reason is that it is the competition
   between suppliers rather than the coordination among channel members

AB Online freelance marketplaces are websites that match buyers of
   electronically deliverable services with freelancers. Although
   freelancing has grown in recent years, it faces the classic "information
   asymmetry" problem-buyers face uncertainty over seller quality.
   Typically, these markets use reputation systems to alleviate this issue,
   but the effectiveness of these systems is open to debate. We present a
   dynamic structural framework to estimate the returns to seller
   reputations in freelance sites. In our model, a buyer decides in each
   period whether to choose a bid from her current set of bids, cancel the
   auction, or wait for more bids. In the process, she trades off sellers'
   price, reputation, and other attributes, as well as the costs of waiting
   and canceling. Our framework addresses dynamic selection, which can lead
   to underestimation of reputation, through two types of persistent
   unobserved heterogeneities: bid arrival rates and buyers' unobserved
   preference for bids. We apply our framework to data from a leading
   freelance firm. We find that buyers are forward looking, that they place
   significant weight on seller reputation, and that not controlling for
   dynamics and selection can bias reputation estimates. Using
   counterfactual simulations, we infer the dollar value of seller
   reputations and provide guidelines to managers of freelance firms.

AB Learning models extend the traditional discrete choice framework by
   postulating that consumers have incomplete information about product
   attributes and that they learn about these attributes over time. In this
   survey we describe the literature on learning models that has developed
   over the past 20 years, using the model of Erdem and Keane as a unifying
   framework [Erdem T, Keane M (1996) Decision-making under uncertainty:
   Capturing dynamic brand choice processes in turbulent consumer goods
   markets. Marketing Sci. 15(1):1-20] We describe how subsequent work has
   extended their modeling framework and applied learning models to a wide
   range of different products and markets. We argue that learning models
   have contributed greatly to our understanding of consumer behavior-in
   particular, in enhancing our understanding of brand loyalty and long-run
   advertising effects. We also discuss the limitations of existing
   learning models and potential extensions. One key challenge is to
   disentangle learning as a source of dynamics from other key mechanisms
   that may generate choice dynamics (inventories, habit persistence,
   etc.). Another is to enhance identification of learning models by
   collecting and using direct measures of signals, perceptions, and
   expectations.

AB Social learning can occur when information is transferred from existing
   customers to potential customers. It is especially important when the
   information that is conveyed pertains to experience attributes, i.e.,
   attributes of products that cannot be fully verified prior to the first
   purchase. Experience attributes are prevalent and salient when consumers
   shop through catalogs, on home shopping networks, and over the Internet.
   Firms therefore employ creative and sometimes costly methods to help
   consumers resolve uncertainty; we argue that uncertainty can be
   partially resolved through social learning processes that occur
   naturally and emanate from local neighborhood characteristics. Using
   data from Bonobos, a leading U.S. online fashion retailer, we find not
   only that local social learning facilitates customer trial but also that
   the effect is economically important because about half of all trials
   were partially attributable to it. Merging data from the Social Capital
   Community Benchmark Survey, we find that neighborhood social capital,
   i.e., the propensity for neighbors to trust each other and communicate
   with each other, enhances the social learning process and makes it more
   efficient. Social capital does not operate on trials directly; rather,
   it improves the learning process and therefore indirectly drives sales
   when what is communicated is favorable.

AB Several key questions in bundling have not been empirically examined in
   marketing: Is mixed bundling more effective than pure bundling or pure
   components? Does correlation in consumer valuations make bundling more
   or less effective? Does bundling serve as a complement or substitute to
   network effects? To address these questions, we develop a
   consumer-choice model from microfoundations to capture the essentials of
   our setting, the handheld video game market. We provide a framework to
   understand the dynamic, long-term effects of bundling on demand. The
   primary explanation for the profitability of bundling relies on
   homogenization of consumer valuations for the bundle, allowing the firm
   to extract more surplus. We find that bundling can be effective through
   a novel and previously unexamined mechanism of dynamic consumer
   segmentation, which operates independent of the homogenization effect,
   and can in fact be stronger when the homogenization effect is weaker. We
   also find that bundles are treated as separate products (distinct from
   component products) by consumers. Sales of both hardware and software
   components decrease in the absence of bundling, and consumers who had
   previously purchased bundles might delay purchases, resulting in lower
   revenues. We also find that mixed bundling dominates pure bundling and
   pure components in terms of both hardware and software revenues.
   Investigating the link between bundling and indirect network effects, we
   find that they act as substitute strategies, with a lower relative
   effectiveness for bundling when network effects are stronger.

AB When a television advertisement causes viewers to switch channels, it
   reduces the audience available to subsequent advertisers. This audience
   loss is not reflected in the advertisement price, resulting in an
   audience externality. The present article analyzes the television
   network's problem of how to select, order, and price advertisements in a
   break of endogenous length in order to correct audience externalities.
   It proposes the Audience Value Maximization Algorithm (AVMA), which
   considers many possible advertisement orderings within a dynamic
   programming framework with a strategy-proof pricing mechanism. Two data
   sets are used to estimate heterogeneity in viewer-switching
   probabilities and advertiser willingness-to-pay parameters in order to
   evaluate the algorithm's performance. A series of simulations shows that
   AVMA typically maximizes audience value to advertisers, increases
   network revenue relative to several alternatives, and runs quickly
   enough to implement.

   by the product choices of their connected others and how the influence
   mechanism may differ for fashion- versus technology-related products. We
   conduct a novel field experiment to induce and observe choice
   interdependence in a closed social network. In our experiment, we
   conceptualize individuals' choices to be driven by multiattribute
   utilities, and we measure their initial attribute preferences prior to
   observing their choice interdependence and collecting network
   information. These design elements help alleviate concerns in
   identifying social interaction effects from other confounds. Given that
   we have complete information on choices and their sequence, we use a
   discrete-time Markov chain model. Nonetheless, we also use a Markov
   random field (MRF) model as an alternative when the information on
   choice sequence is missing. We find significant social interaction
   effects. Our findings show that whereas experts exert asymmetrically
   greater influence on a technology-related product, popular individuals
   exert greater influence on a fashion-related product. In addition, we
   find choices made by early decision makers to be more influential than
   choices made later for the technology-related product. Finally, using
   the MRF with snapshot data can also provide good out-of-sample

AB This paper examines the phenomenon of profit-increasing consumer exit
   and the related phenomenon of profit-decreasing consumer entry We
   demonstrate that firms can be better off in shrinking markets and worse
   off in growing markets, even in the absence of competitive entry or
   exit. Specifically, firms may benefit if a segment of consumers who are
   relatively indifferent about consuming any product in the category leave
   the market. Profits can increase for all firms even if the exiting
   consumers have strong preferences for only one of the products in the
   market. In shrinking markets, it is reasonable to assume that the people
   who are likely to exit the market first are people who are "least
   committed" to the category. In particular, people who are the least
   satisfied with the existing offers are the most likely to change their
   behavior by finding an alternative or adopting a new technology
   Similarly, in growing markets, consumers who enter the market late are
   generally the least committed to the category. Such exiting can relax
   the competitive pressure between firms and lead to increased
   profitability. Our findings provide an explanation for profit growth
   that has been observed in product industries exhibiting slow and
   predictable declines over time, including vacuum tubes, cigarettes, and

   For each manufacturer and retailer factor, we determine whether it can

AB Paid search has become the mainstream platform for online advertising,
   further intensifying competition between advertisers. The main objective
   of this research is twofold. On the one hand, we want to understand, in
   the context of paid-search advertising, the effects of competition
   (measured by the number of ads on the paid-search listings) on click
   volume and the cost per click (CPC) of paid-search ads. On the other
   hand, we are interested in understanding the determinants of
   competition, that is, how various demand and supply factors affect the
   entry probability of firms and, consequently, the total number of
   entrants for a keyword. We regard each keyword as a market and build an
   integrative model consisting of three key components: (i) the realized
   click volume of each entrant as a function of the baseline click volume
   and the decay factor; (ii) the vector of realized CPCs of those entrants
   as a function of the decay factor and the order statistics of the value
   per click at an equilibrium condition; and (iii) the number of entrants,
   the product of the number of potential entrants multiplied by the entry
   probability; the entry probability is determined by the expected revenue
   (a function of expected click volume, CPC, and value per click) and the
   entry cost at the equilibrium condition of an incomplete information
   game. The proposed modeling framework entails several econometric
   challenges. To cope with these challenges, we develop a Bayesian
   estimation approach to make model inferences. Our proposed model is
   applied to a data set of 1,597 keywords associated with digital camera/
   video and their accessories with full information on competition. Our
   empirical analysis indicates that the number of competing ads has a
   significant impact on the baseline click volume, decay factor, and value
   per click. These findings help paid-search advertisers assess the impact
   of competition on their entry decisions and advertising profitability.
   In the counterfactual analysis, we investigate the profit implication of
   two polices for the paid-search host: raising the decay factor by
   encouraging consumers to engage in more in-depth search/click-through
   and providing coupons to advertisers.

AB Researchers and practitioners devote substantial effort to targeting
   banner advertisements to consumers, but they focus less effort on how to
   communicate with consumers once targeted. Morphing enables a website to
   learn, automatically and near optimally, which banner advertisements to
   serve to consumers to maximize click-through rates, brand consideration,
   and purchase likelihood. Banners are matched to consumers based on
   posterior probabilities of latent segment membership, which are
   identified from consumers' clickstreams.
   This paper describes the first large-sample random-assignment field test
   of banner morphing-more than 100,000 consumers viewed more than 450,000
   banners on CNET.com. On relevant Web pages, CNET's click-through rates
   almost doubled relative to control banners. We supplement the CNET field
   test with an experiment on an automotive information-and-recommendation
   website. The automotive experiment replaces automated learning with a
   longitudinal design that implements morph-to-segment matching. Banners
   matched to cognitive styles, as well as the stage of the consumer's
   buying process and body-type preference, significantly increase
   click-through rates, brand consideration, and purchase likelihood
   relative to a control. The CNET field test and automotive experiment
   demonstrate that matching banners to cognitive-style segments is
   feasible and provides significant benefits above and beyond traditional
   targeting. Improved banner effectiveness has strategic implications for
   allocations of budgets among media.

   diffusion theory explains growth in new product markets. We develop an
   analogous theory for established markets exhibiting sporadic growth or
   intermittent declines.
   Our theory suggests that market participants repeatedly take successful
   and unsuccessful actions that cause them to change or to mutate in
   myriad and often unpredictable ways. The environment sorts these
   mutations, determining winners and losers. Abundant mutations often
   cause different market participants to become winners, displacing past
   winners. Abundant mutations also often cause market growth because the
   natural selection mechanism leaves more surviving favorable mutations.
   So one nonobvious falsifiable implication of our theory is that
   displacement precedes growth and stability precedes decline. Another is
   that risk taking, diversity of opinions, and experimentation should
   precede growth.
   We develop a metric for measuring displacement. Using multiple publicly
   available data sets (one including sales for top firms for 55 years and
   another including sales for all automobile models for 25 years), we find
   that our metric provides a practical way to measure the rate of mutation
   and confirm our theory's predictions. Our easily replicated tests show
   that our displacement metric can predict intermittent market growth or
   decline in very different contexts without the need for exogenous
   idiosyncratic explanations. Moreover, other alternative covariates
   (trends, lagged growth, new product entry, macroeconomic indicators,
   etc.) are unable to predict growth or decline.

AB It has been argued that retailers lack both the resources and
   capabilities to maximize category performance. Retailers may seek
   category management (CM) advice from a manufacturer, referred to as a
   category captain (CC). A CC's recommendations affect all brands in the
   category, not just her own. Despite an increase in the number of CC
   collaborations, retailers are still concerned about manufacturer
   opportunism and militant behavior by manufacturers not selected as CCs,
   whereas government agencies are worried about anticompetitive behavior
   that could harm consumers. The Federal Trade Commission recommends
   strictly enforced information firewalls within a CC's organization as a
   best-practice guideline. In this study we develop an empirical model and
   use policy simulations to quantify the impact of CC arrangements with
   information firewalls on retailers, manufacturers, and consumers. We
   show how these effects could be influenced by the (de) activation of
   vertical and horizontal information firewalls within the CC's
   organization.

AB With the availability of social network data, it has become possible to
   relate the behavior of individuals to that of their acquaintances on a
   large scale. Although the similarity of connected individuals is well
   established, it is unclear whether behavioral predictions based on
   social data are more accurate than those arising from current marketing
   practices. We employ a communications network of over 100 million people
   to forecast highly diverse behaviors, from patronizing an off-line
   department store to responding to advertising to joining a recreational
   league. Across all domains, we find that social data are informative in
   identifying individuals who are most likely to undertake various
   actions, and moreover, such data improve on both demographic and
   behavioral models. There are, however, limits to the utility of social
   data. In particular, when rich transactional data were available, social
   data did little to improve prediction.

AB An examination of brand prices in several categories reveals that the
   distribution of prices is multimodal, with firms offering shallow and
   deep discounts. Another interesting feature of these distributions is
   that they may have holes in the interior of the support. These pricing
   distributions do not occur in extant theoretical models of price
   promotions. We develop a dynamic model of competition in which some
   price-sensitive consumers stockpile during periods of deep discounts. A
   game-theoretic analysis of our model generates a multimodal pricing
   distribution with a hole in the interior of the support. Consumer
   stockpiling in our model also gives rise to negative serial correlation
   in prices. This is consistent with our empirical observation of the
   pricing distribution of several brands across multiple categories in the
   IRI marketing data set.
   We generate several interesting insights into firms' optimal promotional
   strategies and their interplay with the clientele mix, market structure,
   and other market factors. We find that, in equilibrium, stockpiling by
   price-sensitive consumers neither harms nor benefits firms when they
   adopt equilibrium strategies. Interestingly, when price-sensitive
   consumers stockpile, even increased consumption as a result of
   stockpiling does not lead to higher profits for firms.

AB Firms constantly grapple with the question of whether to make, buy, or
   ally for innovations. The literature has not, to our knowledge, analyzed
   the choice of and payoff from these alternate routes to innovation for
   the same firm. To address this issue, we collect, code, and analyze the
   choice of and payoff from 3,522 announcements of make, buy, and ally for
   192 firms across 108 industries over five years.
   We find that announcements to make or ally generate positive and higher
   payoffs than announcements to buy, which generate negative payoffs.
   Nevertheless, firms continue to buy for two reasons. First, firms seem
   to have no memory of the payoff from buy, even though they have a memory
   of the payoff from make. Second, firms tend to buy when they lack
   commercializations, even though this strategy does not always seem to
   pay off. These results suggest that firms see buy as a signal to
   investors that they have a solution for what may be a deep strategic
   problem. Nevertheless, the negative returns to a buy can be mitigated if
   the acquirer is experienced, and the target is related and offers high
   customer benefit. We offer explanations for and implications of the
   results.

AB When managers and researchers encounter a data set, they typically ask
   two key questions: (1) Which model (from a candidate set) should I use?
   And (2) if I use a particular model, when is it going to likely work
   well for my business goal? This research addresses those two questions
   and provides a rule, i.e., a decision tree, for data analysts to portend
   the "winning model" before having to fit any of them for longitudinal
   incidence data. We characterize data sets based on managerially relevant
   (and easy-to-compute) summary statistics, and we use classification
   techniques from machine learning to provide a decision tree that
   recommends when to use which model. By doing the "legwork" of obtaining
   this decision tree for model selection, we provide a time-saving tool to
   analysts. We illustrate this method for a common marketing problem
   (i.e., forecasting repeat purchasing incidence for a cohort of new
   customers) and demonstrate the method's ability to discriminate among an
   integrated family of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and its constrained
   variants. We observe a strong ability for data set characteristics to
   guide the choice of the most appropriate model, and we observe that some
   model features (e. g., the "back-and-forth" migration between latent
   states) are more important to accommodate than are others (e. g., the
   inclusion of an "off" state with no activity). We also demonstrate the
   method's broad potential by providing a general "recipe" for researchers
   to replicate this kind of model classification task in other managerial
   contexts (outside of repeat purchasing incidence data and the HMM
   framework).

AB The nature of marketing science is changing in a systematic,
   predictable, and irrevocable way. As information technology enables
   ubiquitous customer communication and big customer data, the fundamental
   nature of the firm's connection to the customer changes: better, more
   personalized service can be offered, from which service relationships
   are deepened, and consequently, more profitable customers grow the
   influence of service within the goods sector and expand the service
   sector in the economy. Marketing is becoming more personalized, and
   marketing science techniques that exploit customer heterogeneity are
   becoming more important. Information technology improvements also
   guarantee the increasing importance and usage of computationally
   intensive data processing and "big data." Most importantly, these trends
   have already lasted for more than a century, and they will become even
   more pronounced in the coming years as a result of the monotonic nature
   of technology improvement. These changes imply a transformation of
   marketing science in both the topics to be emphasized and the methods to
   be employed. Increasingly, and inevitably, all of marketing will come to
   resemble to a greater degree the formerly specialized area of service
   marketing, only with an increased emphasis on marketing analytics.

AB We study the relative importance of online word of mouth and advertising
   on firm performance over time since product introduction. The current
   research separates the volume of consumer-generated online word of mouth
   (OWOM) from its valence, which has three dimensions-attribute, emotion,
   and recommendation oriented. Firm-initiated advertising content is also
   classified as attribute or emotion advertising. We also shed light on
   the role played by advertising content on generating the different types
   of OWOM conversations. We use a dynamic hierarchical linear model (DHLM)
   for our analysis. The proposed model is compared with a dynamic linear
   model, vector autoregressive/system of equations model, and a
   generalized Bass model. Our estimation accounts for potential
   endogeneity in the key measures. Among the different OWOM measures, only
   the valence of recommendation OWOM is found to have a direct impact on
   sales; i.e., not all OWOM is the same. This impact increases over time.
   In contrast, the impact of attribute advertising and emotion advertising
   decreases over time. Also, consistent with prior research, we observe
   that rational messages (i.e., attribute-oriented advertising) wears out
   a bit faster than emotion-oriented advertising. Moreover, the volume of
   OWOM does not have a significant impact on sales. This suggests that, in
   our data, "what people say" is more important than "how much people
   say." Next, we find that recommendation OWOM valence is driven primarily
   by the valence of attribute OWOM when the product is new and driven by
   the valence of emotion OWOM when the product is more mature. Our
   brand-level results help us classify brands as consumer driven or firm
   driven, depending on the relative importance of the OWOM and advertising
   measures, respectively.

AB Customer base analysis is a key element in customer valuation and can
   provide guidance for decisions such as resource allocation. Yet extant
   models often focus on a single activity, such as purchases from a
   retailer or donations to a nonprofit organization. These models do not
   consider other ways that an individual may engage with an organization,
   such as purchasing in multiple brands or contributing user-generated
   content. In this research, we propose a framework to generalize extant
   models for customer base analysis to multiple activities. Using the data
   from a website that allows users to purchase digital content and/or post
   digital content at no charge, we develop a flexible "buy 'til you die"
   model to empirically examine how the two activities are related.
   Compared with benchmarks, our model more accurately forecasts the future
   behavior for both types of activities. In addition to finding evidence
   of coincidence between the activities while customers are "alive," we
   find that the latent attrition processes are related. This suggests that
   conducting one type of activity is informative of whether customers are
   still alive to conduct another type of activity and, consequently,
   affects inferences of customer value.

AB In this paper, we study the entry and expansion decisions of McDonald's
   and KFC in China using an originally assembled data set on the two
   chains' expansion in the China market from their initial entry up to
   year 2007. We analyze how the presence of a rival affects each firm's
   strategies. The results indicate that a rival's presence has a net
   positive effect on a chain's expansion decision. We focus on testing two
   possible explanations for a positive rival impact: market learning and
   demand expansion. First, we derive a set of theoretical predictions on
   how a chain's optimal expansion decision would react to its rival's
   expansion patterns when market learning versus demand expansion is the
   driving force of the rival's positive influence. The empirical analysis
   based on these predictions consistently suggests that market learning is
   more likely to explain the positive effect of KFC on McDonald's and that
   demand expansion is more plausible with McDonald's positive spillover on
   KFC. In other words, the results are consistent with the presence of KFC
   signaling market demand potential and growth to McDonald's and the
   presence of McDonald's helping to cultivate consumer taste and generate
   demand for Western fast food, which benefits KFC.

AB We estimate a dynamic structural model of sales force response to a
   bonus-based compensation plan. This paper provides substantive insight
   into how different elements of the compensation plan enhance
   productivity. We find evidence that (1) bonuses enhance productivity
   across all segments; (2) overachievement commissions help sustain the
   high productivity of the best performers, even after attaining quotas;
   and (3) quarterly bonuses help improve performance of the weak
   performers by serving as pacers to keep the sales force on track in
   achieving its annual sales quotas. The paper also introduces two main
   methodological innovations to the marketing literature: First, we
   implement empirically the method proposed by Arcidiacono and Miller [
   Arcidiacono P, Miller RA (2011) Conditional choice probability
   estimation of dynamic discrete choice models with unobserved
   heterogeneity. Econometrica 79(6): 1823-1867] to accommodate unobserved
   latent-class heterogeneity using a computationally light two-step
   estimator. Second, we illustrate how discount factors can be estimated
   in a dynamic structural model using field data through a combination of
   (1) an exclusion restriction separating current and future payoff and
   (2) a finite-horizon model in which there is no forward-looking behavior
   in the last period.

AB Researchers often collect continuous consumer feedback
   (moment-to-moment, or MTM, data) to understand how consumers respond to
   a variety of experiences (e. g., viewing a TV show, undergoing a
   colonoscopy). Analyzing how MTM judgments are integrated into overall
   evaluations allows researchers to determine how the structure of an
   experience influences consumers' post-experience satisfaction. However,
   this analysis is challenging because of the functional nature of MTM
   data. As such, previous research has typically been limited to
   identifying the influence of heuristics, such as relying on the average
   intensity, peak, and ending.
   We develop a Bayesian functional linear model to study how the different
   "moments" in the MTM data contribute to the overall judgment. Our
   approach incorporates a (temporally) weighted average of MTM data as
   well as specific "patterns" such as peak and trough, thus nesting
   previous approaches such as the "peak-end" rule as special cases. We
   apply our methodology to analyze data on TV show pilots collected by
   CBS. Our results reveal several interesting empirical findings. First,
   the last quintile of a TV show is weighted about four times as much as
   each of the first four quintiles. Second, patterns such as peak and
   trough do not play substantial roles in driving overall evaluations for
   TV shows. Finally, the last quintile is more important for procedural
   dramas than for serial dramas. We discuss the managerial implications of
   our results and other potential applications of our general methodology.

   selling strategy can be mathematically transformed into a problem of

   and sellers have common priors on the probability of each state being
   realized in the future, (ii) consumers are risk-neutral, (iii) sellers
   can commit to spot prices, and (iv) consumers and sellers discount the
   future at the same rate. The result allows both researchers and
   practitioners to extend and/or apply the findings from the vast
   literature on bundling to advance selling problems, and vice versa. We
   highlight several insights that are particularly relevant, such as the
   importance of the dependence of consumer valuations across states on the
   profitability of advance selling in the base case of two states as well
   as in the cases of more than two states or with possible competition in

   prerelease buzz evolution trajectory as the unit of analysis and find
   that the shape of the curve significantly adds power in predicting new
   product performance compared with using product characteristics and firm
   advertising alone. Moreover, daily prerelease buzz evolution data enable
   accurate sales forecasting long before product release, which allows
   sufficient time for managers to adjust product design and/or marketing
   strategy. For example, the forecasting accuracy using an early buzz
   evolution curve ending on the 61st day before product release is not
   only higher than that using accumulated buzz volume until then but also
   higher than that using the total volume of all buzz up until product
   release. Beyond the sales outcome, we find that prerelease buzz is
   quickly reflected in firm stock returns before product release and
   reduces the absolute amount of postrelease stock price correction. The
   model accounts for endogeneity, and the results are robust after
   controlling for buzz sentiment. We also explore the factors influencing
   prerelease buzz evolution patterns, thus generating insights into how to
   manage prerelease buzz dynamics to enhance new product performance.

   However, it is not uncommon for authorized retailers to create an
   additional competitor by diverting units to an unauthorized seller. This
   paper presents an analytical model that demonstrates how diversion from
   authorized retailers to an unauthorized direct competitor can occur
   under circumstances not considered by the prior literature. In fact,
   diversion can represent a prisoner's dilemma whereby retailers diminish
   their own profit by selling to the unauthorized direct seller. The
   authorized retailer's profit loss actually increases as the per-unit
   diversion costs incurred by the authorized retailer decrease. The model
   also shows that the unauthorized direct seller earns greater profit by
   strategically procuring a unilaterally constraining quantity, even
   though this procurement strategy results in an equivalent increase in
   the quantity sold by the retailers. Combined, the results identify a new
   reason for diversion and its consequences for retailers and the
   unauthorized direct seller.

AB Human faces are used extensively in print advertisements. In prior
   literature, researchers have studied spokespersons in general, but few
   have studied faces explicitly. This paper aims to answer three questions
   that are important to both researchers and practitioners: (1) Do faces
   affect how a viewer reacts to an advertisement on the metrics that
   advertisers care about? (2) If faces do have an effect, is it large
   enough to warrant careful selection of faces when constructing print
   advertisements? (3) If faces do have an effect and the effect is large,
   what facial features elicit such differential reactions on these
   metrics, and are such reactions different across individuals and/or
   product categories? Relying on the eigenface method, a holistic approach
   widely used in the computer science field for face recognition, we
   conducted an empirical study to answer these three questions. The
   results show that different faces do have an effect on people's attitude
   toward the advertisement, attitude toward the brand, and purchase
   intention and that the effect is nontrivial. Multiple segments were
   identified and substantial differences were found among people's
   reactions to the faces in the ads across those segments. We also found
   that the effect of faces interacts with product categories and is
   mediated by various facial traits such as attractiveness,
   trustworthiness, and competence. Implications and directions for future
   research are discussed.

   show that an increase in the probability of successfully implementing a
   technology can cause the incumbent to reduce its investment. Under
   certain conditions, if the success probability is high, the incumbent
   allows the entrant to win the new technology so that firms reach an
   equilibrium in which they use different technologies, and threats of
   retaliation prevent attacks; but if the success probability is low, such
   an equilibrium cannot be sustained, and both firms eventually implement

AB Disaggregate demand in the marketplace exists on a grid determined by
   the package sizes offered by manufacturers and retailers. Although
   consumers may want to purchase a continuous-valued amount of a product,
   realized purchases are constrained by available packages. This
   constraint might not be problematic for high-volume demand, but it is
   potentially troubling when demand is small. Despite the prevalence of
   packaging constraints on choice, economic models of choice have been
   slow to deal with their effects on parameter estimates and policy
   implications. In this paper we propose a general framework for dealing
   with indivisible demand in economic models of choice, and we show how to
   estimate model parameters using Bayesian methods. Analyses of simulated
   data and a scanner-panel data set of yogurt purchases indicate that
   ignoring packaging constraints can bias parameter estimates and measures
   of model fit, which results in the inaccurate measures of metrics such
   as price elasticity and compensating value. We also show that a portion
   of nonpurchase in the data (e.g., 2.27% for Yoplait Original) reflects
   the restriction of indivisibility, not the lack of preference. The
   importance of demand indivisibility is also highlighted by the
   counterfactual study where the removal of the smallest package size
   (i.e., 4 oz) mainly results in nonpurchase in the yogurt category
   instead of switching to larger package sizes.

AB Sellers often make claims about product strengths without providing
   evidence. Even though such claims are mere puffery, we show that they
   can be credible because talking up any one strength comes at the
   implicit trade-off of not talking up another potential strength. Puffery
   pulls in some buyers who value product attributes that are talked up or
   emphasized while pushing away other buyers who infer that the attributes
   they value are relative weaknesses. When the initial probability of
   making a sale is low, there are more potential buyers to pull in than to
   push away, so puffery is persuasive overall. This persuasiveness
   requires that buyers have some privacy about their preferences so that
   the seller does not completely pander to them. More generally, the
   results show how comparative cheap talk by an expert to a decision maker
   can be credible and persuasive in standard discrete choice models used
   throughout marketing, economics, and other disciplines.

AB Firms and organizations often need to collect and analyze sensitive
   consumer data. A common problem encountered in such evidence-based
   research is that they cannot collect all essential information from one
   sample, and they may need to link nonoverlapping data items across
   independent samples. We propose an automated nonparametric data fusion
   solution to this problem. The proposed methods are not restricted to
   specific types of variables and distributions. They require no prior
   knowledge about how data at hand may behave differently from standard
   theoretical distributions, and they automate the process of generating
   suitable distributions that match data, therefore making our methods
   particularly useful for linking data with complex distributional shapes.
   In addition, these methods have strong theoretical support; permit
   highly efficient direct fusion to relate a mixture of continuous,
   semicontinuous, and discrete variables; and enable nonparametric
   identification of entire distributions of fusion variables, including
   higher moments and tail percentiles. These novel and promising features
   overcome important limitations of existing methods and have the
   potential to increase fusion effectiveness. We apply the proposed
   methods to overcome data constraints in a study of counterfeiting. By
   combining data sets from multiple sources, data fusion provides a
   feasible approach to studying the relationship between counterfeit
   purchases and various marketing elements, such as consumers' purchase
   motivations, behaviors, and attitudes; brand marketing channels;
   promotions; and advertisements. Therefore, data fusion sheds light on
   counterfeit purchase behaviors and suggests ways to counter counterfeits
   that would not be available if these data sets were analyzed separately.

AB We model the multifaceted impact of pricing decisions in
   business-to-business (B2B) relationships that are governed by trust. We
   show how a seller can develop optimal intertemporal targeted pricing
   strategies to maximize profits over time while taking into consideration
   the impact of pricing decisions on short-term profit margin, reference
   price formation, and long-term relationships. Our modeling framework
   uses a hierarchical Bayesian approach to weave together a multivariate
   nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model, buyer heterogeneity, and control
   functions to facilitate targeting, capture the evolution of trust, and
   control for price endogeneity. We estimate our model on longitudinal
   transactions data from a retailer in the industrial consumables domain.
   We find that buyers in our data set can be best represented by two
   latent states of trust toward the seller-a "vigilant" state that is
   characterized by heightened price sensitivity and a cautious approach to
   ordering and a "relaxed" state with purchase behaviors that are
   consistent with high relational trust. The seller's pricing decisions
   can transition buyers between these two states. An optimal dynamic and
   targeted pricing strategy based on our model suggests a 52% improvement
   in profitability compared with the status quo. Furthermore, a
   counterfactual analysis examines the seller's optimal pricing policy
   under fluctuating commodity prices.

AB We study how peers impact worker productivity growth among salespeople
   in the cosmetics department of a department store. We first exploit a
   shift assignment policy that creates exogenous variation in
   salespersons' peers each week to identify and quantify sources of worker
   learning. We find that peer-based learning is more important than
   learning-by-doing for individuals, and there is no evidence of
   forgetting. Working with high-ability peers substantially increases the
   long-term productivity growth of new salespeople. We then examine
   possible mechanisms behind peer-based learning by exploiting the
   multiple colocated firms in our setting that sell products with
   different task difficulties and compensate their sales forces using
   either team-based or individual-based compensation systems. The
   variation in incentives to compete and cooperate within and across firm
   boundaries, combined with variation in sales difficulty for different
   product classes, allows us to suggest two mechanisms behind peer-based
   learning: observing successful sales techniques of peers and direct
   teaching. Our paper advocates the importance of learning from one
   another in the workplace and suggests that individual peer-based
   learning is a foundation of both organizational learning curves and

AB In search advertising, brand names are often purchased as keywords by
   the brand owner or a competitor. We aim to understand the strategic
   benefits and costs of a firm buying its own brand name or a competitor's
   brand name as a keyword. We model the effect of search advertising to
   depend on the presence or absence of a competitor's advertisement on the
   same results page. We find that the quality difference between the brand
   owner and the competitor moderates the purchase decision of both firms.
   Interestingly, in some cases, a firm may buy its own brand name only to
   defend itself from the competitor's threat. It is also possible that the
   brand owner, by buying its own branded keyword, precludes the competitor
   from buying the same keyword. Our result also implies that the practice
   of bidding on the competitor's brand name creates a prisoner's dilemma,
   and thus both firms may be worse off, but the search engine captures the
   lost profits. We also discuss the difference in our results when the
   search is for a generic keyword instead of a branded keyword. Finally,
   we find some empirical support for our theory from the observation of
   actual purchase patterns on Google AdWords.

AB We investigate how the tendency to adopt a new product independently of
   social influence, the recipients' susceptibility to such influence, and
   the sources' strength of influence vary with social status. Leveraging
   insights from social psychology and sociology about middle-status
   anxiety and conformity, we propose that for products that potential
   adopters expect to boost their status, both the tendency to adopt
   independently from others and the susceptibility to contagion is higher
   for middle-status than for low-and high-status customers. Applying a
   nested case-control design to the adoption of commercial kits used in
   genetic engineering, we find evidence that status affects (i) how early
   or late one adopts regardless of social influence, (ii) how susceptible
   one is to such influence operating through social ties, and (iii) how
   influential one's own behavior is in triggering adoption by others. The
   inverse-U patterns in (i) and (ii) are consistent with middle-status
   anxiety and conformity. The findings have implications for how to use
   status to better understand adoption and contagion mechanisms, and for
   targeting customers when launching new products.

AB Marketing managers often use consumer attitude metrics such as
   awareness, consideration, and preference as performance indicators
   because they represent their brand's health and are readily connected to
   marketing activity. However, this does not mean that financially focused
   executives know how such metrics translate into sales performance, which
   would allow them to make beneficial marketing mix decisions. We propose
   four criteria-potential, responsiveness, stickiness, and sales
   conversion-that determine the connection between marketing actions,
   attitudinal metrics, and sales outcomes.
   We test our approach with a rich data set of four-weekly marketing
   actions, attitude metrics, and sales for several consumer brands in four
   categories over a seven-year period. The results quantify how marketing
   actions affect sales performance through their differential impact on
   attitudinal metrics, as captured by our proposed criteria. We find that
   marketing-attitude and attitude-sales relationships are predominantly
   stable over time but differ substantially across brands and product
   categories. We also establish that combining marketing and attitudinal
   metrics criteria improves the prediction of brand sales performance,
   often substantially so. Based on these insights, we provide specific
   recommendations on improving the marketing mix for different brands, and
   we validate them in a holdout sample. For managers and researchers
   alike, our criteria offer a verifiable explanation for differences in
   marketing elasticities and an actionable connection between marketing
   and financial performance metrics.

   in a setting where consumers repeatedly participate in brand-specific
   surveys of all competing brands in a product category. We also
   investigate the existence and magnitude of the survey participation
   effect at the individual decision maker level while accounting for
   marketing communication efforts of the focal and competing brands. We
   test our proposed individual-consumer-level model using unique
   behavioral panel data with survey participation and marketing
   communication information. Our results suggest that the survey
   participation effect exists in a competitive marketplace setting where
   consumers' intentions toward a focal brand and all the competing brands
   are measured. We find evidence of a backlash effect wherein survey
   participation and marketing communication work against each other. We
   also find that consumers' participation in surveys of competing brands
   does not positively spill over to their choice of the focal brand. Based

AB Traditional advertising, such as TV and print advertising, primarily
   builds awareness of a firm's product among consumers, whereas sponsored
   search advertising on a search engine can target consumers closer to
   making a purchase because they reveal their interest by searching for a
   relevant keyword. Increased consumer targetability in sponsored search
   advertising induces a firm to "poach" a competing firm's consumers by
   directly advertising on the competing firm's keywords; in other words,
   the poaching firm tries to obtain more than its "fair share" of sales
   through sponsored search advertising by free riding on the market
   created by the firm being poached. Using a game theory model with firms
   of different advertising budgets, we study the phenomenon of poaching,
   its impact on how firms allocate their advertising budgets to
   traditional and sponsored search advertising, and the search engine's
   policy on poaching. We find that, as budget asymmetry increases, the
   smaller-budget firm poaches more on the keywords of the larger-budget
   firm. This may induce the larger-budget firm to allocate more of its
   budget to traditional advertising, which, in turn, hurts the search
   engine's advertising revenues. Therefore, paradoxically, even though
   poaching increases competition in sponsored search advertising, the
   search engine can benefit from limiting the extent of poaching. This
   explains why major search engines use "ad relevance" measures to
   handicap poaching on trademarked keywords.

AB In many service markets such as consulting, auto repair, financial
   planning, and healthcare, the service provider may have more information
   about the customer's problem than the customer, and different customers
   may impose different costs on the service provider. In principle, the
   service provider should ethically care about the customer's welfare, but
   it is possible that a provider may maximize only its own profit.
   Moreover, the customer may not know ex ante whether the provider is
   ethical or purely self-interested. We develop a game-theoretic model to
   investigate pricing strategies and the market outcome in service markets
   where the provider has two-dimensional private information about her own
   type (whether ethical or self-interested) and about the customer's
   condition (whether serious or minor). We show that in a less ethical
   market, a self-interested provider will charge different prices based on
   the customer's condition, whereas an ethical provider will charge the
   same price for both conditions. In contrast, in a more ethical market,
   both the self-interested and the ethical provider will charge the same
   uniform price to both types of customers. Interestingly, both market
   efficiency and the customer's ex ante expected surplus might be lower in
   a more ethical market than in a less ethical one.

AB Marketing is a field that is rich in data. Our data is of high quality,
   often at a highly disaggregate level, and there is considerable
   variation in the key variables for which estimates of effects on
   outcomes such as sales and profits are desired. The recognition that, in
   some general sense, marketing variables are set by firms on the basis of
   information not always observable by the researcher has led to concerns
   regarding endogeneity and widespread pressure to implement instrumental
   variables methods in marketing problems. The instruments used in our
   empirical literature are rarely valid and the IV methods used can have
   poor sampling properties, including substantial finite sample bias and
   large sampling errors. Given the problems with IV methods, a convincing
   argument must be made that there is a first order endogeneity problem
   and that we have strong and valid instruments before these methods
   should be used. If strong and valid instruments are not available, then
   researchers need to look toward supplementing the information available
   to them. For example, if there are concerns about unobservable
   advertising or promotional variables, then the researcher is much better
   off measuring these variables rather than using instruments (such as
   lagged marketing variables) that are clearly invalid. Ultimately, only
   randomized variation in marketing variables (with proper implementation
   and large samples) can be argued to be a valid instrument without
   further assumptions.

AB In a dynamic model with overlapping generations of consumers, we study
   duopolistic competition when firms can price discriminate, at each
   period, between their previous customers and the consumers that they
   have never served. Long-term contracts are not enforceable. In
   (Markov-perfect) equilibrium, one firm charges higher prices to its past
   customers than to its new customers, as past customers have revealed
   their strong preferences for the firm; the other firm, however, rewards
   its previous customers by charging lower prices to them than to its new
   customers. This loyalty reward strategy comes from the interplay between
   the firms' usual incentive to extract surplus from consumers with
   revealed strong preferences and their incentives to acquire information
   and to recognize their young loyal customers. The result also relies on
   the firms' inability a priori to tell different generations apart. It is
   the outcome of the unique equilibrium of a simplified two-period (or
   T-period) version of the game and holds with forward-looking consumers
   who are impatient enough.

AB The customer relationship management allocation in marketing budgets is
   potentially misleading when it uses individual customer lifetime value
   estimations from historical data. Planned marketing interventions would
   change the purchasing behavior of different customers, and history-based
   decisions would thus be suboptimal. To cope with this inherent
   endogeneity, we model the optimal allocation of the marketing mix by
   accounting simultaneously for mass interventions and direct marketing
   interventions for each customer. This is a large stochastic dynamic
   problem that, in general, is computationally rather intractable as a
   result of the "curse of dimensionality." We present an algorithm to
   derive the optimal marketing policies (how the firm should allocate its
   marketing resources) and the expected present value of those decisions,
   which maximize the long-term profitability of firms. This allows the
   firm to value customers/segments and helps the firm to target those that
   maximize long-term profitability given the optimal marketing resources
   allocation. We apply the proposed approach in the context of a kitchen
   appliance manufacturer. The results identify

AB Past studies have overlooked the joint effects of economic and customer
   experience factors on service purchase behaviors. Furthermore, service
   firms tend to make substantial investments in enhancing customer
   experience, mitigating the negative effects of service failures through
   recovery efforts and increasing overall customer satisfaction. Yet,
   largely due to a paucity of data, we know little about how the state of
   the economy influences the way in which customers use past service
   experiences to make future purchase decisions. We hypothesize that the
   state of the economy moderates the effects of customer experience
   factors on customers' service purchase behaviors. In addition, we
   examine how personal income influences the degree to which the aggregate
   economy influences service purchase decisions. We test the proposed
   model using panel survey and transaction data from an international
   airline carrier. Our findings demonstrate that, contrary to wisdom in
   the popular press, customer experience matters more when the economy is
   doing better, not worse. Furthermore, lower income consumers are more
   sensitive to changes in the economy than higher income consumers. We
   validate the hypothesized model using a controlled experiment and
   establish that aggregate measures of the economy can be used to predict
   individual perceptions and purchase intentions.

AB A well-established phenomenon of consumer buying behavior is that
   consumers evaluate prices relative to a reference point and exhibit loss
   aversion; i.e., their propensity to buy is more negatively affected by
   prices above the reference point than it is positively affected by
   prices below the reference point. The objective of this paper is to
   analytically examine how the competitive strategy and profitability of
   firms are affected by the presence of consumer loss aversion in the
   price dimension. Although we assume that consumer loss aversion
   increases consumer propensity to search for lower prices, we find that
   it does not necessarily lead to lower prices or profits when firms
   compete over multiple periods and when the consumer reference price in
   subsequent periods is affected by current prices. Specifically, consumer
   loss aversion could lead to higher prices and profits when consumer
   valuation is sufficiently high relative to search costs and the
   proportion of consumers with positive search costs is in an intermediate
   range. We also show that when forward-looking firms incorporate the
   negative effect of price promotions on future profits, the equilibrium
   range of price promotions may actually increase.

AB The potential demand in a new industry evolves over time. Demand is
   initially low, but advertising by the industry's early entrants can
   speed up demand growth. However, there is intrinsic uncertainty of the
   demand level in each period and uncertainty of the demand evolution
   path, which can be affected by the underlying economic environment. We
   construct a dynamic model that features the stochastically and
   endogenously expanding demand of a new industry, and we investigate the
   optimal entry and exit behavior of firms as the industry evolves. We
   find that firms' incentive to enter early depends critically on the cost
   that early entrants have to pay in developing the market. When the cost
   is high and the benefit spills over to potential entrants, firms have an
   incentive to wait, and the probability of entry can increase with the
   number of incumbents under certain circumstances. Firms' entry strategy
   is also influenced by the transition of economic states. Firms are more
   likely to enter under a state that shows the prospect of demand taking
   off soon. We also find that, in the early stage of an industry, higher
   demand uncertainty can induce faster entry.

AB Probabilistic or opaque selling, whereby a seller hides the exact
   identity of a product until after the buyer makes a payment, has been
   used in practice and received considerable attention in the literature.
   Under what conditions, and why, is probabilistic selling attractive to
   firms? The extant literature has offered the following explanations: to
   price discriminate heterogeneous consumers, to reduce supply-demand
   mismatches, and to soften price competition. In this paper, we provide a
   new explanation: to exploit consumer bounded rationality in the sense of
   anecdotal reasoning. We build a simple model where the firm is a
   monopoly, consumers are homogeneous, and there is no demand uncertainty
   or capacity constraint. This model allows us to isolate the impact of
   consumer bounded rationality on the adoption of opaque selling. We find
   that although it is never optimal to use opaque selling when consumers
   have rational expectations, it can be optimal when consumers are
   boundedly rational. We show that opaque selling may soften price
   competition and increase the industry profits as a result of consumer
   bounded rationality. Our findings underscore the importance of consumer
   bounded rationality and show that opaque selling might be even more
   attractive than previously thought.

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that when firms face a negative externality
   like gray marketing (i.e., the selling of branded goods outside of the
   manufacturer's authorized channels), an effective strategy to reduce the
   negative impact is to centralize decision making. Nevertheless, in
   industries with significant gray marketing, we observe many firms with
   decentralized decision making. Our study assesses whether decentralized
   decision making can be optimal when a manufacturer faces gray market
   distribution. We consider a market where a focal firm competes with an
   existing competitor that produces a differentiated product and a gray
   marketer that sources an identical product from a lower-priced foreign
   market. We find that decentralization is optimal under quantity-based
   competition, provided the gray market is relatively uncompetitive and
   the level of competitive intensity between the focal firm and the
   competitor is high. Decentralization leads a firm to make aggressive
   production decisions, which leads to lower prices, yet it also leads to
   higher market share for the firm compared to centralization. When the
   level of competitive intensity between a firm and its competitor is
   high, the gain in market share more than offsets the loss due to lower
   prices. As a result, the focal firm is better off decentralizing its
   operations independent of (a) whether the competitor operates in the
   foreign market, and (b) the competitor's organizational structure. This
   finding contradicts the belief that centralized decision making is
   always optimal when authorized manufacturers attempt to limit the
   negative impact of gray markets. The findings also provide insight to
   understand why firms might employ decentralized decision making in
   industries where gray markets are active.

AB Recent years have seen a considerable rise in the use of product
   placement in television shows. Taking advantage of second-by-second
   product placement, advertising, and audience tuning data, this research
   explores the impact of such product placement on the extent to which
   viewers tune away from downstream advertisements. Motivated by the
   behavioral priming literature, we examine how this impact relates to the
   brand- and category-match between product placement and subsequent
   advertising, as well as the temporal distance between them. Our analysis
   suggests that the coveted first position of a commercial break holds a
   greater audience when preceded by product placement from the same brand.
   This indicates a positive synergy between the two activities that can
   reduce audience decline by more than 10%. Product placements by other
   brands, however, can actually exacerbate audience loss, thus interfering
   with the reach of advertisements by competitors. Significantly, these
   changes in audience size are not temporary, but are retained across the
   remaining commercials in the same break. We discuss the managerial
   implications of these findings and directions for future research in the
   rapidly changing media landscape.

AB Competitor orientation, i.e., the focus on beating the competition
   rather than maximizing profits, seems to thrive in business situations
   despite being, by definition, suboptimal for profit-maximizing firms.
   Our research explains how a competitor orientation can persist and even
   thrive in equilibrium in markets that reward only profits. We apply
   evolutionary game theory to business markets where reputation matters.
   We use three games that represent classic interactions in business
   marketing: Chicken (to illustrate competition for product adoption), the
   Battle of the Sexes (channel negotiations), and the Prisoners' Dilemma
   (pricing battles). Initial populations are assumed to have both
   profit-maximizing managers and competitor-oriented managers (i.e., those
   who gain additional utility from beating others). We demonstrate that a
   competitor orientation can survive in equilibrium despite selection that
   is based solely on profits. Using Chicken, we show that a competitor
   orientation thrives and can even overrun the population. We use the
   Battle of the Sexes to show that a competitor orientation will overrun
   one population in a two-sided negotiation (e. g., all retailers in a
   retailer/manufacturer dyad). Last, using the Prisoners' Dilemma, we show
   that competitor orientation is not selected against. We conclude that
   evolutionary profit-driven selection pressures cannot be assumed to
   eliminate nonprofit-maximizing behavior even when selection is based
   purely on profitability.

   They help the firm elicit truthful reporting of demand information from

   is positively associated with purchase intent while the former is not.

   assumption of widely used models, the best and worst responses do not
   originate from the same data generating process. We propose a sequential
   evaluation model and show that people are likely to engage in a two-step
   evaluation process and are more likely to select the worst alternative
   first before selecting the best. We find that later choices have
   systematically larger coefficients as compared to earlier choices. We
   also find the presence of an elicitation effect that leads to larger
   coefficients when respondents are asked to select the worst alternative,
   meaning that respondents are surer about what they like least than what
   they like most. Finally, we investigate global inference retrieval in
   choice tasks, which can be represented by the central limit theorem and
   normally distributed errors, versus episodic retrieval represented by
   extreme value errors. We find that both specifications of the error term
   are plausible and advise using the proposed sequential logit model for
   practical reasons. We apply our model to data from a national survey
   investigating the concerns associated with hair care. We find that
   accounting for the sequential evaluation in the best-worst tasks and the
   presence of the scaling effects leads to different managerial
   implications compared to the results from currently used models.

   purchase behavior evolution. Four types of decision aids are examined:
   those for (1) nutritional needs, (2) brand preference, (3) economic
   needs, and (4) personalized shopping lists. We construct and estimate
   nonhomogeneous hidden Markov models of store-and category-level purchase
   decisions, in which parameters vary over time across hidden states as
   driven by usage experience with different decision aids. We find that
   consumers evolve through distinct behavioral states over time, and the
   evolution is attributable to their prior usage experience with various
   decision aids. Moreover, the impact varies by the specific decision aid,
   behavioral state, and category characteristics. In addition, consumers
   gravitate toward habitual decision processes in online grocery stores,
   and their average price and promotion sensitivities increase first and
   then decrease but the level of heterogeneity rises continuously. We
   identify beneficial versus potentially undesirable decision aids and
   demonstrate how the proposed research method can help online retailers
   improve their store environments, design customized promotions, and
   quantify the payoffs of these strategies.

   empirical model of network choice by two multistore firms. I use
   lattice-theoretical results to address the computational burden of
   solving for an equilibrium in store networks. The framework integrates
   the static entry game of complete information with post-entry outcome
   data while using simulations to correct for the selection of entrants. I
   present an application of the model to the case of the convenience store
   industry in Okinawa Island, Japan, using unique cross-sectional data on
   store networks and revenues. I use parameter estimates to examine the
   impact of a hypothetical horizontal merger on store configurations,
   costs, and profits. Results suggest a retailer's trade-off between cost
   savings and lost revenues from clustering its stores is positive across
   markets and negative within a market. I find an acquirer of a
   hypothetical merger of two multistore firms would decrease its number of
   stores in suburbs but increase its number in the city center.

AB In the last decade, design innovation has gained increasing prominence
   in the marketplace, with a growing number of firms innovating not only
   through technology but also through novel product forms (i.e., design).
   However, while the effect of technological innovation on product sales
   is a heavily studied topic, a defining theory of how design innovation
   influences product sales is still missing. This paper provides
   demand-and supply-side theories to formulate a set of coherent
   hypotheses about the effect of design innovativeness, i.e., the degree
   of novelty in a product's design, on sales' evolution over time. The
   hypotheses are tested in two different samples. In the first, car models
   introduced in the United States from 1978 to 2006 (for a total of 2,757
   model-year data) are analyzed. In the second, motorcycle models
   introduced in the United States from 1980 to 2008 (for a total of 2,847
   model-year observations) are analyzed. I find that design innovativeness
   diminishes initial sales' status but increases sales' growth rates.
   Furthermore, design and technological innovativeness have a negative
   interaction effect on sales' initial status, but a positive effect on
   sales' growth rates. Finally, brand strength and brand advertising
   expenditures worsen the negative effect of design innovativeness on
   initial sales' status, but boost its positive effect on sales' growth
   rates.

AB The focus of this paper is dual distribution channels in
   business-to-business markets. We take the perspective of the
   distributor, and examine how different forms of competition with a
   manufacturer-owned channel impact distributor opportunism. Next, we
   consider how the same forms of competition impact the distributor's end
   customers. Based on a multi-industry field study of industrial
   distributors, we highlight the complex processes that characterize dual
   distribution systems. We show that while competition with a
   manufacturer-owned channel increases distributor opportunism, it also
   has the potential to benefit the distributor's end customers. In
   addition, although actions taken by a manufacturer to create vertical
   separation between channels limit competition, such actions also reduce
   end customer satisfaction.

AB There is substantial academic interest in modeling consumer experiential
   learning. However, (approximately) optimal solutions to forward-looking
   experiential learning problems are complex, limiting their behavioral
   plausibility and empirical feasibility. We propose that consumers use
   cognitively simple heuristic strategies. We explore one viable
   heuristic-index strategies-and demonstrate that they are intuitive,
   tractable, and plausible. Index strategies are much simpler for
   consumers to use but provide close-to-optimal utility. They also avoid
   exponential growth in computational complexity, enabling researchers to
   study learning models in more complex situations.
   Well-defined index strategies depend on a structural property called
   indexability. We prove the indexability of a canonical forward-looking
   experiential learning model in which consumers learn brand quality while
   facing random utility shocks. Following an index strategy, consumers
   develop an index for each brand separately and choose the brand with the
   highest index. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that an index
   strategy achieves nearly optimal utility at substantially lower
   computational costs. Using IRI data for diapers, we find that an index
   strategy performs as well as an approximately optimal solution and
   better than myopic learning. We extend the analysis to incorporate risk
   aversion, other cognitively simple heuristics, heterogeneous foresight,
   and an alternative specification of brands.

AB We disentangle and study the relative importance of different risk
   preferences in explaining extended warranty purchases and the high
   premia paid for them. Empirical and behavioral research on insurance is
   at odds with whether diminishing returns (curvature of the utility
   function), or loss aversion and nonlinear probability weighting lead to
   observed consumer behavior. This lack of consensus is primarily due to
   the inability of standard choice data to separate different risk
   preferences, and the consequent need to rely on strong parametric
   assumptions. We design two conjoint studies (consistent with
   simultaneous and sequential decision making) with choices about washing
   machines and extended warranties, where subjects are given failure
   probabilities and repair costs. Using stated choice data from the
   surveys, we can nonparametrically identify product and risk preferences.
   We find that loss aversion is significantly more important than
   curvature and probability weights in explaining extended warranty
   choices. Importantly, failure to decompose risk-averse behavior into
   that arising from curvature, loss aversion, and probability weighting
   leads to lower washer prices and profits. These findings are robust to
   alternate reference point assumptions. We rationalize the premia paid
   for warranties by exploring retailer incentives to price discriminate,
   and test the theory on complementary goods pricing. Finally, based on
   counterfactual analysis, forcing separate retailers to sell washers and
   extended warranties is not necessarily welfare enhancing as cited in the
   media and previous literature.

AB Recently there has been significant interest in studying consumer
   behavior in sponsored search advertising (SSA). Researchers have
   typically used daily data from search engines containing measures such
   as average bid, average ad position, total impressions, clicks, and cost
   for each keyword in the advertiser's campaign. A variety of random
   utility models have been estimated using such data and the results have
   helped researchers explore the factors that drive consumer click and
   conversion propensities. However, virtually every analysis of this kind
   has ignored the intraday variation in ad position. We show that
   estimating random utility models on aggregated (daily) data without
   accounting for this variation will lead to systematically biased
   estimates. Specifically, the impact of ad position on click-through rate
   (CTR) is attenuated and the predicted CTR is higher than the actual CTR.
   We analytically demonstrate the existence of the bias and show the
   effect of the bias on the equilibrium of the SSA auction. Using a large
   data set from a major search engine, we measure the magnitude of bias
   and quantify the losses suffered by the search engine and an advertiser
   using aggregate data. The search engine revenue loss can be as high as
   11% due to aggregation bias. We also present a few data summarization
   techniques that can be used by search engines to reduce or eliminate the
   bias.

AB This paper investigates the importance of network effects in the demand
   for ethanol-compatible vehicles and the supply of ethanol fuel. An
   indirect network effect, or positive feedback loop, arises in this
   context due to spatially-dependent complementarities in the availability
   of ethanol fuel and the installed base of ethanol-compatible vehicles.
   Marketers and social planners are interested in whether these effects
   exist, and if so, how policy might accelerate adoption of the ethanol
   fuel standard within a targeted population. To measure these feedback
   effects, I develop an econometric framework that considers the
   simultaneous determination of ethanol-compatible vehicle demand and
   ethanol fuel supply in local markets. The demand-side model considers
   the automobile purchase decisions of consumers and fleet operators; the
   supply-side model considers the ethanol market entry decisions of
   competing fuel retailers. The framework extends extant market entry
   models by endogenizing the market size shifting fuel retailer profits. I
   estimate the model using zip code panel data from four states over a
   nine-year period. The model estimates provide evidence of a network
   effect. Under typical market conditions, entry of an additional ethanol
   fuel retailer leads to a 6% increase in the probability of
   ethanol-compatible vehicle purchase. The entry model estimates imply
   that the first entrant requires a local installed base of approximately
   300 ethanol-compatible vehicles to be profitable. As an application, I
   demonstrate that subsidizing fuel retailers to offer ethanol in
   selective geographic markets can be an effective policy to indirectly
   increase ethanol-compatible vehicle sales.

AB Multipart tariffs are widely favored within service industries as an
   efficient means of mapping prices to differential levels of consumer
   demand. Whether they benefit consumers, however, is far less clear as
   they pose individuals with a potentially difficult task of dynamically
   allocating usage over the course of each billing cycle. In this paper we
   explore this welfare issue by examining the ability of individuals to
   optimally allocate consumption over time in a stylized cellular-phone
   usage task for which there exists a known optimal dynamic utilization
   policy. Actual call behavior over time is modeled using a dynamic choice
   model that allows decision makers to both discount the future (be
   myopic) and be subject to random errors when making call decisions. Our
   analysis provides a "half empty, half full" view of intuitive
   optimality. Participants rapidly learn to exhibit farsightedness, yet
   learning is incomplete with some level of allocation errors persisting
   even after repeated experience. We also find evidence for an asymmetric
   effect in which participants who are exogenously switched from a low
   (high) to high (low) allowance plan make more (fewer) errors in the new
   plan. The effect persists even when participants make their own plan
   choices. Finally, interventions that provide usage information to help
   participants eradicate errors have limited effectiveness.

AB What is the role that color plays in consumers' perception of the gist
   of ads during the increasingly brief and blurred exposures in practice?
   Two studies address this question. The first study manipulates the level
   of blur of the exposure and the presence or absence of color in the ad
   image, during exposures that lasted 100 milliseconds (msec). It reveals
   a buffer effect of color: color contributes little to gist perception
   when sufficient visual detail is available and ads are typical, but
   color enables consumers to continue to perceive the gist of ads
   accurately when the exposure is blurred. The second study finds that
   color inversion of the entire ad deteriorates gist perception, but that
   color inversion of the background scene does not affect gist perception
   when the exposure is blurred. This provides evidence that the color
   composition of the central object in the ad scene plays a key role in
   protecting the gist perception of advertising under adverse exposure
   conditions. The underlying mechanism is likely to be cognitive rather
   than sensory. Implications for advertising theory and design are
   discussed.

AB Different objectives such as category demand expansion or market share
   stealing warrant the use of different marketing instruments. To help
   brand managers make informed decisions, it is essential that marketing
   mix models appropriately measure their effects. Random Utility Models
   that have been applied to this problem might not be adequate because
   they do not allow the effects of marketing instruments of one brand to
   spillover to preference for competing alternatives. Additionally, they
   have the Invariant Proportion of Substitution (IPS) property, which in
   some situations imposes counter-intuitive restrictions on individual
   choice behavior. Recognizing that effects of marketing instruments can
   spill across brands in a category, we propose an alternative choice
   model that relaxes the IPS property: the cross attributes flexible
   substitution logit model. We apply the model in two very different
   empirical settings, i.e., consumer choices of brands of refrigerated
   yogurt, and prescription-writing choices of physicians in the
   hyperlipidemia category. In both settings the proposed model provides
   consistent evidence that certain marketing instruments produce sales
   gains primarily from growing the category pie, while others produce
   gains from stealing share. By contrast, the random coefficient logit and
   generalized nested logit models both predict that gains from all
   marketing instruments would have similar sources.

AB We analyze two pricing mechanisms for information goods. These
   mechanisms are selling, where up-front payment allows unrestricted use,
   and pay-per-use, where payments are tailored to use. We analytically
   model a market where consumers differ in use frequency and where use on
   a pay-per-use basis invokes a psychological cost associated with the
   well known "ticking meter" effect. We demonstrate that pay-per-use
   yields higher profits in a monopoly provided the associated
   psychological cost is low. In a duopoly, one firm uses selling and the
   other uses pay-per-use. Here, in contrast to the monopoly, selling
   yields higher profits than pay-per-use. We demonstrate that,
   surprisingly, the profits of both duopolists can increase as the
   psychological cost associated with pay-per-use increases. Next, we show
   that uncertainty in consumer use frequency does not affect pay-per-use
   in a monopoly, but lowers profits from selling. In a duopoly, both the
   seller and the pay-peruse provider obtain lower profits when use
   frequency is uncertain. We also analyze how pricing mechanism
   performance is affected if the firms cannot commit to prices, if the
   pay-per-use provider offers a two-part tariff, and if consumers are
   risk-averse.

AB In many consumption settings (e.g., restaurants), individuals consume
   products either alone or with their peers (e.g., friends). In this
   study, we propose a general framework for modeling peer effects by
   including two new peer effects: the exogenous peer effect (exogenous
   factors that could change the peer's behavior) and the peer presence
   effect (when the peer is present but not consuming). We also include the
   well known endogenous peer effect. We develop an empirical model that
   allows us to identify all three effects simultaneously and apply the
   model to behavioral data from a casino setting. It is a simultaneous
   equation model with the structural parameters expressed as a function of
   the ratio of the reduced form parameters. This necessitates the use of
   the Minimum Expected Loss approach, allowing us to obtain consistent
   estimates at the individual level. Our data comprise detailed gambling
   activity for a panel of individuals at a single casino over a two-year
   period. Our results show that all three types of peer effects exist.
   These effects vary across individuals and exhibit considerable asymmetry
   within pairs of peers. We discuss how our results can help managers
   allocate resources more effectively and policy makers formulate
   regulatory guidelines with more complete information.

AB In recent years, customer lifetime value (CLV) has gained increasing
   importance in both academia and practice. Although many advanced
   techniques have been proposed, the recency/frequency/monetary value
   (RFM) segmentation framework, and its related probability models, remain
   a CLV mainstay. In this article, we demonstrate the deficiency in RFM as
   a basis for summarizing customer history (data compression), and extend
   the framework to include clumpiness (C) by a metric-based approach. Our
   main empirical finding is that C adds to the predictive power, above and
   beyond RFM and firm marketing action, of both the churn, incidence, and
   monetary value parts of CLV. Hence, we recommend a significant
   implementation change: from RFM to RFMC.
   This work is also motivated by noting that although statistical models
   based on RFM summaries can fit well in aggregate, their use can lead to
   significant micro-level (e.g., ranking of customers) prediction errors
   unless C is captured. A set of detailed empirical studies using data
   from a large North American retailer, in addition to six companies that
   vary in their business model: two traditional (e.g., CDNow.com) and four
   Internet (e.g., Hulu.com), demonstrate that the "clumpiness phenomena"
   is widely prevalent, and that companies with "bingeable content" have
   both high potential and high risk segments, previously unseen, but now
   uncovered because of the new framework: RFM to RFMC.

AB Current complex dynamic markets are characterized by numerous brands,
   each with multiple products and price points, and differentiated on a
   variety of product attributes plus a large number of new product
   introductions. This study seeks to analyze dynamic pricing paths in a
   highly complex branded market, consisting of 663 products under 79 brand
   names of digital cameras. The authors develop a method to classify
   dynamic pricing strategies and analyze the choice and correlates of
   observed pricing paths in the introduction and early growth phase of
   this market. The authors find that, despite numerous recommendations in
   the literature for skimming or penetration pricing, market pricing
   dominates in practice. In particular, the authors find five patterns:
   skimming (20% frequency), penetration (20% frequency), and three
   variants of market-pricing patterns (60% frequency), where new products
   are launched at market prices. Skimming pricing launches the new product
   16% above the market price and subsequently increases the price relative
   to the market price. Penetration pricing launches the new product 18%
   below the market price and subsequently lowers the price relative to the
   market price. Firms exhibit a mix of these pricing paths across their
   portfolios. The specific pricing paths correlate with market, firm, and
   brand characteristics such as competitive intensity, market pioneering,

AB Firms with a customer-centric structure-an organizational design that
   aligns each business unit with a distinct customer group-are expected to
   exhibit superior performance compared to firms that are internally
   structured. Top executives invoke these customer-centric beliefs when
   initiating corporate reorganizations. However, a lack of empirical
   evidence linking these customer-centric structures to better long-term
   financial performance raises doubts if corporate structure can truly
   foster customer centricity and better position a firm to satisfy
   customers and hence exhibit superior performance. The current research
   addresses this question by using longitudinal data (1998-2010) that
   links Fortune 500 firms' corporate-level structure to performance.
   Utilizing a dueling mediator model with allowance for endogeneity in a
   firm's organizational structure choice, the study reveals that a
   corporate-level customer-centric structure translates to greater
   customer satisfaction, but simultaneously adds coordinating costs.
   Further explaining customer-centric structure's record of mixed success,
   the benefits of increased customer satisfaction diminish (1) as
   competitors have already adopted customer-centric structures, (2) in
   fragmented markets where competitors leave few unique customer needs
   unaddressed, and (3) in less profitable industries. Ultimately, we show
   that aligning corporate structure around customers pays off only in
   specific competitive environments.

AB Blood banks rely on marketing to encourage donors to give blood. Many,
   if not most, blood banks in the United States are community-based
   not-for-profit organizations with limited marketing budgets. As a
   result, blood banks increasingly use novel and inexpensive online media,
   i.e., paid, owned, and earned (POE) media, in their marketing efforts.
   We propose a dynamic model to help blood bank marketing managers
   understand how blood donations can be managed via online POE media. We
   analytically characterize the optimal forward-looking paid media
   strategies, taking into account the asymmetric costs related to shortage
   and excess of blood, as well as the possibility of a cost-free target
   donation zone. We detail new advertising resource allocation rules for
   blood banks and show when traditional allocation recommendations do not
   apply. Additionally, we discover that under certain circumstances,
   owned/earned media activities hurt the blood bank's performance, despite
   being (predominantly) free. We validate our analytical model by using
   daily donation data from a community-based blood bank and measure the
   effects of POE media activities on the level of blood donated.

AB Many video ads are designed to go viral so that the total number of
   views they receive depends on customers sharing the ads with their
   friends. This paper explores the relationship between the number of
   views and how persuasive the ad is at convincing consumers to purchase
   or to adopt a favorable attitude towards the product. The analysis
   combines data on the total views of 400 video ads, and crowd-sourced
   measurement of advertising persuasiveness among 24,000 survey responses.
   Persuasiveness is measured by randomly exposing half of these consumers
   to a video ad and half to a similar placebo video ad, and then surveying
   their attitudes towards the focal product. Relative ad persuasiveness is
   on average 10% lower for every one million views that the video ad
   achieves. The exceptions to this pattern were ads that generated views
   and large numbers of comments, and video ads that attracted comments
   that mentioned the product by name. Evidence suggests that such ads
   remained effective because they attracted views due to humor rather than
   because they were outrageous.

   buyers will be realized only if the total funds committed by the buyers
   reach a specified goal. When the buyers are sufficiently heterogeneous
   in their product valuations, the creator should offer a line of products
   with different levels of product quality. Compared to the traditional
   situation where orders are placed and fulfilled individually, with the
   crowdfunding mechanism, a product line is more likely than a single
   product to be optimal and the quality gap between products is smaller.
   This paper also shows the effect of the crowdfunding mechanism on

AB Many firms operate customer communities online. This is motivated by the
   belief that customers who join the community become more engaged with
   the firm and/or its products, and as a result, increase their economic
   activity with the firm. We describe this potential economic benefit as
   "social dollars." This paper contributes evidence for the existence and
   source of social dollars using data from a multichannel entertainment
   products retailer that launched a customer community online. We find a
   significant increase in customer expenditures attributable to customers
   joining the firm's community. While self-selection is a concern with
   field data, we rule out multiple alternative explanations. Social
   dollars persist over the time period observed and arose primarily in the
   online channel. To assess the source of the social dollar, we
   hypothesize and test whether it is moderated by participation behaviors
   conceptually linked to common attributes of customer communities. Our
   results reveal that posters (versus lurkers) of community content and
   those with more (versus fewer) social ties in the community generated
   more (fewer) social dollars. We found a null effect for our measure of
   the informational advantage expected to accrue to products that
   differentially benefit from content posted by like-minded community
   members. This overall pattern of results suggests a stronger social than
   informational source of economic benefits for firm operators of customer
   communities. Several implications for firms considering investments in
   and/or managing online customer communities are discussed.

AB We investigate the causal effect of position in search engine
   advertising listings on outcomes such as click-through rates and sales
   orders. Because positions are determined through an auction, there are
   significant selection issues in measuring position effects. A simple
   mean comparison of outcomes at two positions is likely to be biased due
   to these selection issues. Additionally, experimentation is rendered
   difficult in this situation by competitors' bidding behavior, which
   induces selection biases that cannot be eliminated by randomizing the
   bids for the focal advertiser. Econometric approaches to address the
   selection are rendered infeasible due to the difficulty of finding
   suitable instruments in this context. We show that a regression
   discontinuity (RD) approach is feasible to measure causal effects in
   this important context. We apply the approach to a large and unique data
   set of daily observations containing information on a focal advertiser
   as well as its major competitors. Our RD estimates demonstrate that
   there are significant selection biases in the more naive estimates.
   While a mean comparison of outcomes across positions would indicate very
   large position effects, we find that our RD estimates of these effects
   are much smaller, and exist only in some of the positions. We further
   investigate moderators of these effects. Position effects are stronger
   when the advertiser is smaller, and when the consumer has low prior
   experience with the keyword for the advertiser. They are weaker when the
   keyword phrase has specific brand or product information, when the ad
   copy is more specific as in exact matching options, and on weekends
   compared to weekdays.

AB The notion of peer influence in new product adoption or trial is well
   accepted. We propose that peer influence may affect repeat behavior as
   well, though the process and source of influence are likely to differ
   between trial and repeat. Our analysis of the acceptance of a risky
   prescription drug by physicians provides three novel findings. First,
   there is evidence of contagion not only in trial but also in repeat.
   Second, who is most influential varies across stages. Physicians with
   high centrality in the discussion and referral network and with high
   prescription volume are influential in trial but not repeat. In
   contrast, immediate colleagues, few of whom are nominated as a
   discussion or referral partner, are influential in both trial and
   repeat. Third, who is most influenceable also varies across stages. For
   trial, it is physicians who do not consider themselves to be opinion
   leaders, whereas for repeat, it is those located towards the middle of
   the status distribution as measured by network centrality. The pattern
   of results is consistent with informational social influence reducing
   risk in trial and normative social influence increasing conformity in
   repeat.

AB Media multitasking competes with television advertising for consumers'
   attention, but may also facilitate immediate and measurable response to
   some advertisements. This paper explores whether and how television
   advertising influences online shopping. We construct a massive data set
   spanning $3.4 billion in spending by 20 brands, measures of brands'
   website traffic and transactions, and ad content measures for 1,224
   commercials. We use a quasi-experimental design to estimate whether and
   how TV advertising influences changes in online shopping within
   two-minute pre/post windows of time. We use nonadvertising competitors'
   online shopping in a difference-in-differences approach to measure the
   same effects in two-hour windows around the time of the ad. The findings
   indicate that television advertising does influence online shopping and
   that advertising content plays a key role. Action-focus content
   increases direct website traffic and sales. Information-focus and
   emotion-focus ad content actually reduce website traffic while
   simultaneously increasing purchases, with a positive net effect on sales
   for most brands. These results imply that brands seeking to attract
   multitaskers' attention and dollars must select their advertising copy
   carefully.

AB Extant research on choice designs in marketing focuses on the
   construction of efficient homogeneous designs where all respondents get
   the same design. Recently marketing scholars proposed the construction
   of efficient heterogeneous designs where different respondents or groups
   of respondents get different subdesigns, and demonstrated substantial
   efficiency gain when such heterogeneous designs are employed. A
   significant hurdle in the widespread adoption of heterogeneous designs
   is the high computation cost, even when the number of subdesigns
   contained in the heterogeneous design is restricted to be small. In this
   paper we propose a new approach for the construction of efficient
   heterogeneous choice designs. In contrast to extant approaches that are
   based on an exact design framework where it is computationally
   prohibitive to do an exhaustive search to find a globally optimal
   design, our proposed approach is based on the continuous design
   framework where well-established mathematical theories can be leveraged
   for quick identification of a globally optimal design. The proposed
   approach makes it feasible to generate a highly efficient choice design
   that is completely heterogeneous-a unique subdesign for each individual
   respondent in the choice experiment. The proposed approach is the first
   in the marketing literature to find a completely heterogeneous choice
   design with assured high global design efficiency using the continuous
   design framework. Results from simulation and empirical studies
   demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach over extant
   approaches in constructing efficient heterogeneous choice designs.

AB Digitization of content is changing how consumers and firms use purchase
   and rental markets. Low transaction costs make accessing content easier
   for consumers. Digital technology enables firms to create nondurable
   "rental" versions of their content and to restrict content to the
   purchasing consumer, effectively shutting down resale markets. To
   empirically analyze the interaction of purchase and rental markets, I
   design a preference measurement tool to recover consumers' intertemporal
   preferences through current-period choices alone. I then use these
   preferences to solve for a dynamic equilibrium between consumers and the
   firm. In the context of the online home video market, I find that when
   the firm is able to commit to holding prices fixed forever, providing
   content through the purchase market alone is sufficient. However, when
   the firm is unable to commit, it should serve both purchase and rental
   markets. Canonical theory models would predict exclusive rentals, but
   the purchase option enables indirect price discrimination in practice. I
   also find that when consumers place a premium on accessing new content,
   they are less likely to intertemporally substitute, thereby increasing
   the firm's pricing power. Consistent with theory, commitment to future
   prices increases profits considerably. This finding supports the rigid
   pricing structure of such retailers as Apple, despite studios' push
   toward more pricing flexibility.

AB There are few marketing studies of social learning about new
   technologies in low-income countries. This paper examines how learning
   through opinion leaders and social networks influences demand for
   nontraditional cookstoves-a technology with important health and
   environmental consequences for developing country populations. We
   conduct marketing interventions in rural Bangladesh to assess how stove
   adoption decisions respond to (a) learning the adoption choices of
   locally identified "opinion leaders" and (b) learning about stove
   attributes and performance through social networks. We find that
   households generally draw negative inferences about stoves through
   social learning and that social learning is more important for stoves
   with less evident benefits. In an institutional environment where
   consumers are distrustful of new products and brands, consumers appear
   to rely on their networks more to learn about negative product
   attributes. Overall, our findings imply that external information and
   marketing campaigns can induce initial adoption and experiential
   learning about unfamiliar technologies, but sustained use ultimately
   requires that new technologies match local preferences.

AB Research has shown that advertising assets and R&D (research and
   development) assets increase shareholder value. Although one might
   conclude that their impacts on bankruptcy risk are merely the inverse of
   their impacts on shareholder value, we argue otherwise and show that the
   differences hinge on the fact that shareholder value is a function of
   expected cash flows from all future periods, whereas bankruptcy risk is
   a function of expected cash flow from only the next period. We show that
   current market turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets
   and R&D assets on expected cash flow from the next period but not on
   expected cash flows from more distant future periods. Therefore, market
   turbulence moderates the impacts of advertising assets and R&D assets on
   bankruptcy risk but not shareholder value. Market stability increases
   the impact of advertising assets on reducing bankruptcy risk, whereas
   market turbulence increases the impact of R&D assets on reducing
   bankruptcy risk. Using a data set of more than 1,000 firms covering
   three decades, we find support for our hypotheses. Out-of-sample
   validation indicates that bankruptcy prediction performance improves
   when including marketing variables in addition to the usual financial
   predictors.

AB Networks and the embedded relationships are critical determinants of how
   people communicate and form beliefs. The explosion of social media has
   significantly increased the scope and impact of social learning among
   consumers. This paper studies observational learning in networks of
   friends versus strangers. A consumer decides whether to adopt a product
   after receiving a private signal about product quality and observing the
   actions of others. The preference for the product has greater
   heterogeneity in the stranger-network than in the friend-network. We
   show that when the network is small, observing friends' actions helps
   the consumer make more accurate inferences about quality. As the network
   grows, however, the stranger-network becomes more effective. Underlying
   these results are two competing effects of network heterogeneity on
   social learning. These are the individual preference effect, which
   allows one to make a better quality judgment when the preference element
   of past actions is more certain, and the social conforming effect,
   wherein private signals are underused in quality judgment as people
   follow others' actions. We find cascading is more likely to occur in the
   friend-network than in the stranger-network. For a high-quality firm,
   the stranger-network generates greater sales than the friend-network
   when the network size is sufficiently large or the private signal is
   sufficiently accurate. We also examine the existence of experts and
   firms using advertising to influence consumers. Finally, we show how
   networks that are highly homogeneous or heterogeneous could impede
   observational learning.

AB This research examines how prepurchase information that reduces consumer
   uncertainty about a product or service can affect consumer decisions to
   reverse an initial product purchase or service enrollment decision. One
   belief commonly held by retailers is that provision of greater amounts
   of information before the purchase reduces decision reversals. We
   provide theory and evidence showing conditions under which
   uncertainty-reducing information provided before the purchase decision
   can actually increase the number of decision reversals. Predictions
   generated from an analytical model of consumer behavior incorporating
   behavioral theory of reference-dependence are complemented by empirical
   evidence from both a controlled behavioral experiment and econometric
   analysis of archival data. Combined, the theory and evidence suggest
   that managers should be aware that their information provision decisions
   taken to reduce decision reversals may actually increase them.

AB Firms invest in technology to increase productivity. Yet in emerging
   markets, where a culture of informality is widespread, information
   technology (IT) investments leading to greater transparency can impose a
   cost through higher taxes and the need for regulatory compliance. The
   tendency of firms to avoid productivity-enhancing technologies and
   remain small to avoid transparency has been dubbed the "Peter Pan
   Syndrome." We examine whether firms make the trade-off between
   productivity and transparency by examining IT adoption in the Indian
   retail sector. We find that computer technology adoption is lower when
   firms are motivated to avoid transparency. Specifically, technology
   adoption is lower when there is greater corruption, but higher when
   there is better enforcement and auditing. So, firms have a higher
   productivity gain threshold to adopt computers in corrupt business
   environments that suffer from patchy and variable enforcement of the tax
   laws. Not accounting for this motivation to hide from the formal sector
   underestimates productivity gains from computer adoption. Thus, in
   addition to their direct effects on the economy, enforcement, auditing,
   and corruption can have indirect effects through their negative impact
   on adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies that also increase
   operational transparency.

AB In this paper, we untangle the searchable and experiential dimensions of
   quality responses to entry by counterfeiters in emerging markets with
   weak intellectual property rights. Our theoretical framework analyzes
   market equilibria under competition from counterfeiting as well as under
   monopoly branding. A key theoretical prediction is that emerging markets
   can be self-corrective with respect to counterfeiting issues in the
   following sense: First, counterfeiters can earn positive profits by
   pooling with authentic brands only when consumers have good faith in the
   market (i.e., they believe there is low probability that any product is
   a counterfeit). When the proportion of counterfeits in the market
   exceeds a cutoff value, brands invest in self-differentiation from the
   competitive-fringe counterfeiters. Second, to attain a separating
   equilibrium with counterfeiters, branded incumbents upgrade the
   searchable quality (e.g., appearance) of their products more and improve
   the experiential quality (e.g., functionality) less compared with
   monopoly equilibrium. However, in the pooling equilibrium with sporadic
   counterfeits, authentic firms instead may invest in experiential quality
   to attract more of the expert consumers who are well versed in quality.
   This prediction uncovers the nature of product differentiation in the
   searchable dimension and helps with analyzing real-world innovation
   strategies employed by authentic firms in response to entries by
   counterfeit entities. In addition, welfare analysis hints at a nonlinear
   relationship between social welfare and intellectual property
   enforcement.

AB Consumers in many emerging markets exhibit a pronounced preference for
   western and global brands, while domestic brands are often associated
   with a cheap but low quality image. Frustrated with the negative
   country-of-origin (COO) stereotype imposed on them, many domestic brands
   from emerging markets follow a variety of approaches to disguise their
   COO and pretend to be foreign. This paper studies the strategic aspects
   of this phenomenon. We consider an experience good market where
   consumers learn about each brand's quality, using its COO as a prior.
   Each firm can invest in product quality or COO dissociation; the former
   generates better quality signals while the latter simply masks the
   firm's COO identity. The analysis reveals a few main insights. Sharing a
   reputation leads to a common good problem where firms free-ride on each
   other's quality investments. As a high quality firm dissociates itself
   from the stereotype, it ceases to contribute to the COO image but also
   prevents its low quality peers from free-riding on it. This incurs a
   negative direct effect but a positive strategic effect on the group
   image. Consequently, a country's COO image may actually improve when
   more high quality brands shun their identities and pretend to be
   foreign. In equilibrium, COO image improves monotonically as firms
   become more efficient in providing quality. However, the prevalence of
   COO dissociation may first increase then decrease. We discuss the
   implications of these results for emerging market brands as well as
   policy makers.

AB Consumer search activities can be endogenously determined by the ad
   positions in sponsored search advertising. We model how advertisers
   compete for ad positions in sponsored listings and, conditional on the
   list of sponsored ads, how online consumers search for information and
   make purchase decisions. On the consumer side, assuming that users
   browse information from top to bottom and adopt a sequential search
   strategy, we develop a two-stage model of consumer search (whether to
   click and whether to stop the search) that extends the standard
   sequential search framework in economics literature. On the advertiser
   side, it is very difficult to fully specify the optimal strategies of
   advertisers because the equilibrium outcome depends on variables that
   researchers do not observe. As we have an incomplete model of advertiser
   competition, we propose using the necessary condition that, at
   equilibrium, no advertiser will find another available ad position more
   valuable than the one it has chosen. Using a data set obtained from a
   search engine, we find that consumers can be classified into two
   segments that exhibit distinct search behaviors. For advertisers, the
   value of search advertising comes primarily from terminal clicks, which
   represent the last link (including organic results) clicked by an online
   user. We also demonstrate that the value of ad positions depends not
   only on the identities and positions of the advertisers in sponsored
   listings but also the composition of online consumers who exhibit
   distinct search behaviors.

AB Firms are increasingly engaging with customers on social media. Despite
   this heightened interest, guidance for effective engagement is lacking.
   In this study, we investigate customers' compliments and complaints and
   firms' service interventions on social media. We develop a dynamic
   choice model that explicitly accounts for the evolutions of both
   customers' voicing decisions and their relationships with the firm.
   Voices are driven by both the customers' underlying relationships and
   other factors such as redress seeking. We estimate the model using a
   unique data set of customer voices and service interventions on Twitter.
   We find that redress seeking is a major driver of customer complaints,
   and although service intervention improves relationships, it also
   encourages more complaints later. Because of this dual effect, firms are
   likely to underestimate the returns on service intervention if measured
   using only voices. Furthermore, we find an "error-correction" effect in
   certain situations, where customers compliment or complain when others
   voice the opposite opinions. Finally, we characterize the distinct
   voicing tendencies in different relationship states, and show that
   uncovering the underlying relationship states enables effective
   targeting. We are among the first to analyze individual customer level
   voice dynamics and to evaluate the effects of service intervention on
   social media.

   leading Chinese website providing user-generated reviews, to study how
   consumers learn, from reading online reviews, the quality and cost of
   restaurant dining. We propose a learning model with three novel
   features: (1) different reviews offer different informational value to
   different types of consumers; (2) consumers learn their own preferences,
   and not the distribution of preferences among the entire population, for
   multiple product attributes; and (3) consumers update not only the
   expectation but also the variance of their preferences. Based on
   estimation results, we conduct a series of counterfactual experiments
   and find that the value from Dianping is about 7 CNY for each user, and
   about 8.6 CNY from each user for the reviewed restaurants in this study.
   The majority of the value comes from reviews on restaurant quality, and
   contextual comments are more valuable than numerical ratings in reviews.

AB The window between a film's theatrical and video releases has been
   steadily declining with some studios now testing day-and-date strategies
   (i.e., when a film is released across multiple channels at once). We
   present a model of consumer choice that examines trade-offs between
   substitutable products (theatrical and video forms), the possibility of
   purchasing both alternatives, a congestion externality affecting
   consumption at theaters with heterogeneous consumer groups, and a decay
   in the quality of the content over time. Our model permits a normative
   study of the impact of shorter release windows (zero-three months) for
   which there is a scarcity of relevant data. We characterize the market
   conditions under which a studio makes video release time and price
   selections indicative of direct-to-video, day-and-date, and delayed
   video release tactics. During seasons of peak congestion, we establish
   that day-and-date strategies are optimal for high-quality films with
   high content durability (i.e., films whose content tends to lead
   consumers to purchase both alternatives) whereas prices are set to
   perfectly segment the consumer market for films with low content
   durability. We find that lower congestion effects provide studios with
   incentives to delay release and price the video to induce multiple
   purchasing behavior for films with higher content durability. However,
   an increase in congestion effects can, in certain cases, actually lead
   to higher studio profitability. We also show that, at the lower range of
   quality, an increase in movie quality should often be accompanied by a
   later video release time. Surprisingly, however, we observe the opposite
   result at the upper range of movie quality: an increase in quality can
   justify an earlier release of the video.

AB Bucket- based price discrimination is a unique price format that
   involves monthly subscription fees and instantaneous quotas (the number
   of rental products that can be checked out). We propose an empirical
   model in which consumers make dynamic purchase decisions under
   consumption uncertainty, accounting for the constraints imposed by the
   instantaneous quota. Applying the model to an online DVD rental data
   set, we find that (1) consumers incur a large disutility (similar to$8)
   from stockout (i.e., unmet consumption needs); (2) such a disutility
   drives consumers' overpurchase of the service quota as a way to avoid
   potential stockout situations; and (3) the dynamics of overpurchase are
   driven by the interplay between trends in consumption needs and the
   magnitude of consumers' plan-switching costs. We run counterfactual
   exercises to better understand how the instantaneous quota and stockout
   risk affect consumers' consumption rates, purchase decisions, and firm
   profitability. We find that the instantaneous quota induces a greater
   stockout compared with a monthly quota. We further demonstrate that the
   company should recognize the drivers of the dynamics in overpurchase to
   balance short- and long-term profitability-for example, by offering
   targeted discounts to customers with excess overpurchase.

AB Firms track consumers' shopping behaviors in their online stores to
   provide individually personalized banners through a method called
   retargeting. We use data from two large-scale field experiments and two
   lab experiments to show that, although personalization can substantially
   enhance banner effectiveness, its impact hinges on its interplay with
   timing and placement factors. First, personalization increases
   click-through especially at an early information state of the purchase
   decision process. Here, banners with a high degree of content
   personalization (DCP) are most effective when a consumer has just
   visited the advertiser's online store, but quickly lose effectiveness as
   time passes since that last visit. We call this phenomenon
   overpersonalization. Medium DCP banners, on the other hand, are
   initially less effective, but more persistent, so that they outperform
   high DCP banners over time. Second, personalization increases
   click-through irrespective of whether banners appear on motive congruent
   or incongruent display websites. In terms of view-through, however,
   personalization increases ad effectiveness only on motive congruent
   websites, but decreases it on incongruent websites. We demonstrate in
   the lab how perceptions of ad informativeness and intrusiveness drive
   these results depending on consumers' experiential or goal-directed Web
   browsing modes.

AB In managing service failures such as stockouts, most research has
   emphasized preventive mechanisms, whereas stockout recovery mechanisms
   have been largely ignored. We propose and examine a failure-recovery
   mechanism (i.e., contractual stockout recovery) in the presence of
   demand uncertainty and compare it with failure-prevention mechanisms in
   a dyadic distribution channel.
   We find that stockout recovery mechanisms can improve channel
   profitability under certain conditions. More importantly, we find that
   stockout recovery may outperform stockout prevention mechanisms such as
   return policy and vendor managed inventory in improving manufacturer and
   channel profitability. This is because stockout recovery reduces
   channel-wide stockout risks and allows benefits from the reduced risks
   to be shared between the manufacturer and the retailer, helping
   alleviate double marginalization. Although return policy also reduces
   stockout risks, it does so by increasing inventory risks in the channel
   without reducing channel exposure to demand uncertainty. Thus, our
   research suggests that stockout recovery can be an effective alternative
   in managing stockouts to those common methods of stockout prevention
   mechanisms.

AB Beverage consumption occurs many times a day in response to short-run
   needs that fluctuate. We develop a model in which consumers are
   heterogeneous in self-regulating consumption by balancing short-run
   needs (e.g., hydration and mood) with long-term goals (e.g., health).
   The model has two novel features: (1) utility depends on the match
   between occasion-specific needs and product attributes, and (2) dynamics
   of consumption and stockpiling are at the level of product attributes.
   We estimate the model using unique intraday beverage consumption,
   activity, and psychological needs data. We find that only a third of
   individuals do not self-regulate. Of the two-thirds who self-regulate,
   over 40% self-regulate adaptively based on past choice, whereas 25%
   self-regulate both adaptively and anticipating future needs. Our
   attribute-need match model enables us to assess unmet demand for new
   products with attributes that match co-occurring occasion-specific
   needs. Specifically, we find that a product satisfying a combination of
   "health-hydrating" needs expands overall beverage consumption by as much
   as 5%. Our framework of modeling heterogeneity in self-regulation by
   balancing short-run needs with long-term goals is more broadly
   applicable in contexts where situational needs vary, and long-term
   effects are gradual and hard to discern (e.g., nutrition, smoking, and
   preventive health care).

AB Building on the structural two-sided matching model, we develop a
   framework to study the sourcing market in the context of marketing firms
   matching with manufacturers. Both sides prefer partners that could
   generate significant values with better sourcing process abilities.
   Moreover, experienced manufacturers are preferred by the branded
   marketing firms who may even be willing to compensate the matching
   intermediary more for facilitating that preference. Empirical research,
   measuring the values of such matching and the intermediary's pricing
   (through commission) on observed marketing firms' characteristics and
   the low-cost manufacturers and the deals that result, is problematic,
   when some of the characteristics are only partially observed and the
   matching is endogenous. With the matching model, we can control for
   endogenous matching. We find evidence of positive assortative matching
   of pairs' size on both sides of the market. We also find that
   manufacturers' location and tenure, and whether the marketing firms are
   listed, are important factors in identifying the preferred matching
   partners and the related ranking. Without controlling for endogenous
   matching, the intermediary's pricing equation estimates are biased,
   especially for the marketing firms that specialize in luxury products.

AB Advertising networks have recently played an increasingly important role
   in the online advertising market. Critical to the success of an
   advertising network are two mechanisms: an allocation mechanism that
   efficiently matches advertisers with publishers and a pricing scheme
   that maximally extracts surplus from the matches. In this paper, we
   quantify the value and investigate the determinants of a successful
   advertiser-publisher match, using data from Taobao's advertising
   network. A counterfactual experiment reveals that the platform's profit
   under a decentralized allocation mechanism is close to the profit level
   when the platform centrally assigns the matching under perfect platform
   knowledge of matching values. In another counterfactual experiment, we
   explore the effect of platform technology and revenue model on the
   strategic choice of the pricing schemes of list price versus generalized
   second price (GSP) auction pricing. We find that platforms that profit
   from the advertiser side may have less incentive to adopt GSP auction
   than platforms that profit from the publisher side.

   contributions from different countries and from faculty of a wider set
   of schools. We show that faculty from top-ranked business schools have
   always published in Marketing Science, and continue to do so. We also
   show that the variety of schools with authors who publish in Marketing
   Science has increased, and that much of this expansion has occurred
   outside of North America. This international expansion appears to be
   driven by collaborations between authors in North America and those in
   other areas. One of the factors that may be fueling the increase in the
   variety of schools with authors publishing in Marketing Science is an
   increased tendency for collaboration by three or more authors. In
   general, Marketing Science has remained an outlet for authors from top
   schools, and has also become a place where authors from a much broader
   array of schools, especially those outside the United States, can
   publish.

AB Market liberalization of the German household electricity market has led
   to an excessive number of competitors (1,150 electricity providers) and
   volatile price dynamics on price comparison sites. To date, providers
   that are struggling to achieve a top ranking on price comparison sites
   do not appear to implement a consistent or elaborate strategy for
   attracting customers. We developed a pricing tool, Electricity Contract
   Optimization (ECO), that addresses this highly competitive market
   situation by integrating various available data sources, such as data
   from price comparison sites, demographic data, and regional sales or
   cost data. ECO sets regionally varying one-time bonuses to attract new
   customers on price comparison sites with the goal of optimizing sales
   and profit targets or optimally allocating sales budgets. Based on two
   field experiments, we demonstrate that ECO's optimization procedure
   reduces ENTEGA yearly sales costs for new customer business, on average,
   by 35% relative to previously used pricing heuristics. ENTEGA uses ECO
   monthly to analyze different scenarios or to set prices and one-time
   bonuses on price comparison sites.

AB Georgia Aquarium (GA), a non-profit organization, is the world's second
   largest aquarium (by water volume) and is among the most popular tourist
   destinations in the United States. Recently GA management has observed
   that the organization's growth trajectory is stagnating. While other
   aquariums face a similar trend, GA wants to be proactive and reverse
   this direction. They face a multifaceted business challenge involving
   four conflicting objectives: (1) How to increase revenues without
   increasing ticket prices; (2) how to increase attendance without
   compromising visitor satisfaction; (3) how to increase the impact of
   media investments without spending more; (4) how to attract customers
   with long-term value potential. To address these challenges, we
   developed an integrated approach consisting of multiple marketing
   science models including Data Envelopment Analysis, Competition
   Analysis, Spatial Analysis, Media Optimization Analysis, and Pass Holder
   Lifetime Net Revenue Analysis. Based on the findings of our analyses and
   the parameter estimates of our models, GA proceeded with a field
   implementation to validate our suggestions. As a result, they realized a
   10% increase in attendance and a 12% increase in revenue in 2013,
   thereby enhancing their bottom line and growth.

AB This paper addresses the repositioning of Kmart Australia in 2011. It
   shows how by calibrating emotional as well as cognitive reactions and
   estimating their impact on purchase intentions, Kmart was able to focus
   its communications, improving market share. We measure nine key
   emotions, ranging from surprise to anger. Including these emotions
   significantly improves our model for likelihood to choose a store.
   Measuring emotions enabled Kmart's advertising agency to create a
   television commercial that tapped into the specific emotions that most
   strongly predict the likelihood to choose a store; that is, the model
   drove the development of the advertising creative. The resulting
   television commercial tested well and was effective when launched. At
   the individual level, cognitions and emotions changed dramatically. At
   the aggregate level, an econometric model showed that store visits were
   significantly enhanced. Kmart's EBIT (earnings before interest and tax)
   increased by 30%, whereas Kmart's main rival had almost no EBIT growth,
   despite vigorous attempts to counter Kmart's campaign. One of our key
   contributions is to incorporate emotions into marketing science models
   of evaluation and purchase intentions. We also provide a new methodology
   to measure emotions. The approach enables marketing science to
   participate in the design of marketing stimuli, rather than just testing
   preexisting ones.

AB This paper investigates early stage "modern" grocery retail adoption in
   an emerging market using primary household-level panel data on grocery
   purchases in India's largest city, Mumbai. Specifically, we seek insight
   on which socioeconomic class is more likely to adopt, and why. We model
   adoption as a two-stage process of modern retail choice followed by
   category expenditures within a shopping trip. We find a nonmonotonic
   (V-shaped) relationship between socioeconomic class and preferences for
   modern retail; specifically, modern retail spending and relative
   preference are greater among the upper and lower middle classes,
   relative to the middle middle class. Upper middle class preference of
   modern retail is driven by credit card acceptance, shorter store
   distance (relative to other segments), and higher vehicle ownership;
   whereas lower prices and low travel costs drive the preferences of the
   lower middle class. Modern retail is preferred more for branded and less
   for perishable categories. Interestingly, the lower middle class share
   of modern grocery retail's revenues is largest, and this share is
   projected to grow as prices fall and store density increases. To address
   concerns of endogeneity and generalizability, we replicate the key
   results with a "conjoint" type study with exogenous variation in price
   and distance in two cities-Mumbai and Bangalore. We discuss implications
   for targeting and public policy in emerging markets.

AB A vexing challenge when using the utility-maximization framework to
   estimate consumers' decisions on which set of goods to purchase and how
   much quantity to buy is obtaining a functional form of the utility that
   satisfies three criteria: tractability, flexibility, and global
   regularity. Flexibility refers to the ability of a utility function to
   impose minimal prior restrictions on demand elasticities. Global
   regularity refers to the ability of a utility function to satisfy
   regularity properties required by economic theory in the entire feasible
   space of variables. The tractable utility functions used so far are
   either inflexible, which could yield inaccurate estimates of underlying
   elasticities, or do not satisfy global regularity, which can result in
   invalid expressions of likelihood and invalid policy simulations. I
   tackle this problem by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for
   global regularity of Basic Translog utility. Using simulated and scanner
   data, I show that the proposed demand system yields better model fit,
   more accurately captures underlying elasticities, and yields
   substantially different results in counterfactuals compared to
   alternatives used in prior literature. Specifically, unlike the
   alternatives used so far, the proposed demand system allows for
   complementarities between goods, and more accurately captures the extent
   of their inferiority, the extent of their substitutability, and
   asymmetries in cross price effects.

AB We study the pricing decision for a monopolist launching a new
   innovation. At the time of launch, we assume that the monopolist has
   incomplete information about the true demand curve. Despite the lack of
   objective information the firm must set a retail price to maximize total
   profits. To model this environment, we develop a novel two-period
   non-Bayesian framework where the monopolist sets the price in each
   period based only on a nonparametric set of all feasible demand curves.
   Optimal prices are dynamic as prices in any period allow the firm to
   learn about demand and improve future pricing decisions. Our main
   results show that the direction of dynamic introductory prices (versus
   static prices) depends on the type of heterogeneity in the market. We
   find that (1) when consumers have homogeneous preferences, introductory
   dynamic price is higher than the static price; (2) when consumers have
   heterogeneous preferences and the monopolist has no ex ante information,
   the introductory dynamic price is the same as the static price; and (3)
   when consumers have heterogeneous preferences and the monopolist has ex
   ante information, the introductory dynamic price is lower than the
   static price. Furthermore, the degree of this initial reduction
   increases with the amount of heterogeneity in the ex ante information.

   not been extensively studied. This paper offers an analysis of the
   generalized second-price auction with budget constraints. We find that
   the budget constraint may induce advertisers to raise their bids to the
   highest possible amount for two different reasons, i.e., to accelerate
   the elimination of the budget-constrained competitor, and to reduce
   their own advertising cost. Thus, in contrast to the current literature,
   our analysis shows that both budget-constrained and unconstrained
   advertisers could bid more than their own valuation. We further extend
   the model to consider dynamic bidding and budget-setting decisions.

AB This paper examines position auctions with budget-constrained
   advertisers, a dominant bidding environment used by publishers to
   allocate positions in online advertising. Budget constraints play a
   crucial role in equilibrium bidding by inducing advertisers to
   strategically deplete a higher-ranked advertiser's budget to gain in
   rank. This strategic consideration has consequences for the advertisers'
   profits and the publisher's revenue. An advertiser's profit can strictly
   decrease with her budget when competition for an advertising space
   (e.g., a keyword) is intense. The publisher's revenue can also strictly
   decrease when an increase in the higher-ranked advertiser's budget
   induces the lower-ranked rival to reduce her bid, due to her inability
   to deplete the higher-ranked advertiser's budget. Several managerial
   implications for advertisers and publishers are discussed.

AB Marketing Science is in a very healthy state as the premier journal for

   way in bringing novel and innovative methodologies and expanding into
   new substantive areas of inquiry. The journal is now at the cusp of its
   next stage of creativity and innovation. I outline new research
   possibilities due to big data, behavioral field studies, and managerial
   interest in substantive areas such as health, sustainability, emerging
   markets, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As quantitative marketing's
   leading journal, Marketing Science should aid the field in the efficient
   production of in-depth, valid, current, and relevant knowledge across
   the breadth of the discipline. To this end, I will actively manage
   incentives for exploitation and deepening of existing competencies in
   established areas while supporting exploration and broadening into
   newer, riskier topics at Marketing Science. To increase the field's
   overall efficiency of knowledge production, I suggest a lexicographic
   approach to reviewing where the incremental contribution threshold is
   primary and demands on quality of execution be driven by what is needed
   for proving the validity of the incremental contribution claims.

AB In this paper we study product line scope and pricing decisions in a
   horizontally differentiated duopoly. Past research has shown that a firm
   may offer a broader product line to attract higher demand or charge a
   higher price (or both), and benefit at the expense of its competitor. We
   show that such outcomes may be reversed, especially when consumers have
   relatively high valuation and low heterogeneity in their preferences for
   the line extension. We find that an equilibrium exists such that only
   one firm prefers to expand scope but profits may be higher for both
   firms, even in the absence of market size expansion. This is because a
   broader scope permits that firm to effectively price discriminate by
   raising prices for its core customers. The competitor optimally responds
   by lowering prices to gain share and earn a higher profit. Thus, higher
   prices for the firm expanding its product line translate into higher
   demand for the competing firm, thus increasing profit for both. We show
   that our results hold when firms deploy generic, offensive or defensive
   strategies during product line expansion.

AB Over the past 10 years there has been increased recognition of the
   importance of publicity as a means of generating product awareness.
   Despite this, previous research has seldom investigated the impact of
   publicity on demand. We contribute to the literature by (i) proposing a
   new method for the interpretation of publicity data, one that maps the
   information in news articles (or broadcasts) to a multidimensional
   attribute space; (ii) investigating how different types of publicity
   affect demand; and (iii) investigating how different types of publicity
   interact with firms' own marketing communication efforts. We study these
   issues for statins. We find that publicity plays an important role both
   for expanding the market for statins and for determining which statins
   patients or physicians choose. We also find evidence that publicity can
   serve as either a substitute or a complement for traditional marketing
   channels depending on the complexity of the information type. We argue
   that the interaction results are driven by the relative strengths of the
   corroborative and rational inattention functions in publicity. These
   results suggest that managers should be aware of the interactions
   between publicity and traditional marketing channels to better determine
   how to allocate their marketing expenditures.

AB Of the many proposals to reverse the obesity epidemic, the most
   contentious is the use of price-based interventions such as the fat tax.
   Previous investigations of the efficacy of such initiatives in altering
   consumption behavior yielded contradictory findings. In this article, we
   use six years of point-of-sale scanner data for milk from a sample of
   over 1,700 supermarkets across the United States to investigate the
   potential of small price incentives for inducing substitution of
   healthier alternatives. We exploit a pricing pattern particular to milk
   in the United States, whereby prices in some geographical regions are
   flat across whole, 2%, 1%, and skim milk; whereas in other regions they
   are decreasing with the fat content level. The prevailing price
   structure is determined at a chain and regional level, and is
   independent of local demand conditions. This exogenous variation in
   price structure provides a quasi-experimental set-up to analyze the
   impact of small price differences on substitution across fat content. We
   use detailed demographics to evaluate price sensitivity and substitution
   patterns for different socioeconomic groups. Results show that small
   price differences are highly effective in inducing substitution to lower
   calorie options. The impact is highest for low-income households who are
   also most at risk for obesity. Our results suggest that a selective
   taxation mechanism that lowers the relative prices of healthier options,
   such that those price changes are reflected in shelf prices at the
   point-of-purchase, can serve as an effective health policy tool in the
   efforts to control obesity.

AB Beauty contests are auction mechanisms used to buy or sell
   differentiated products where the auctioneer does not specify a decision
   rule to pick the winning bidder. Beauty contests are widely used in
   procuring welfare-to-work projects, freelance services, selling online
   ads, real estate transactions, and hiring, dating/marriage decisions.
   Unlike price-only auctions, beauty contests have no closed-form bidding
   strategies and suffer from nonmultiplicatively separable unobserved
   auction heterogeneity, which makes their estimation challenging. To
   address these challenges, we formulate beauty contests as incomplete
   information games and present a two-step estimator. A key contribution
   of our method is its ability to account for common-knowledge
   auction-specific unobservables using finite unobserved types. We show
   that unobserved auction types and distributions of bids are
   nonparametrically identified and recoverable in the first step using a
   nonparametric Expectation-Maximization (EM)-like algorithm, and that
   these can then be used in the second step to recover cost distributions.
   We present an application of our method in the online freelancing
   context. We find that seller margins in this marketplace are around 15%
   of the bid, and that not accounting for unobserved heterogeneity can
   significantly bias cost estimates in this setting. Based on our
   estimates, we run counterfactual simulations and provide guidelines to
   managers of freelance firms.

AB Countermarketing, or efforts to reduce consumption of certain products,
   has become common in categories such as tobacco, junk food, fossil
   fuels, and furs. Countermarketing has a particularly long history in the
   tobacco industry. Efforts to reduce smoking have included excise taxes
   that increase the cost of consumption, smoke-free restrictions that make
   consumption less convenient, and antismoking advertising campaigns that
   highlight the dangers of tobacco use. This article presents an analysis
   of the relative effectiveness of these different strategies. We find
   that cigarette excise taxes are the most effective tool for reducing
   overall cigarette sales, followed by antismoking advertising. Smoke-free
   restrictions are not found to have a significant effect on cigarette
   sales. We also investigate how these various policy tools induce product
   substitution. This issue is of considerable importance because some
   countermarketing techniques may potentially shift consumers to more
   dangerous, higher nicotine and tar cigarettes. Specifically, we find
   that excise taxes levied on a per pack basis rather than based on
   nicotine levels often shift consumers to more dangerous products.

AB We empirically study the impact of the entry of a new theater on two
   important product decisions that incumbents in the movie exhibition
   industry face: (1) whether to invest in screening movies that are
   expected to be popular, and (2) when to adopt new releases. For
   theaters, both of these decisions feature a cost-demand trade-off
   inherent in quality decisions: Although screening popular and recent
   movies brings more patrons to the theater, distributors take a higher
   share of the revenue for such movies. The impact of competitive entry on
   the incumbent's quality decisions is ambiguous, as it may simultaneously
   increase the competitive pressure to invest more in these dimensions of
   quality and also change the demand conditions that incumbents face. We
   find that incumbent theaters do not increase the provision of popular
   and recent movies in response to rival entry. To identify the role of
   competitive incentives, we study the differential impact of entry based
   on whether the entrant belongs to the same parent firm as the incumbent
   theaters. This comparison reveals that competitive incentives push
   incumbents to screen movies with high expected success more frequently
   and to adopt movies sooner. The product responses we document have
   important implications for the revenue impact of entry and the
   conclusions that researchers can draw from this impact. Ignoring the
   provision of these quality dimensions suggests cannibalization to exceed
   business stealing, a conclusion that is reversed when we account for
   endogenous product responses. We also show that our findings on
   popularity and recency cannot be explained by concomitant changes in
   theaters' other product decisions, such as the variety of movies
   screened.

AB An exchange promotion allows consumers to turn in an old good and
   receive a discount toward the purchase of a new product. The old good
   that is turned in can either be within the same category as the new good
   or it may be in a different category. For example, one can turn in an
   old CD player to count toward a new CD player (a within-category
   exchange or traditional trade-in) or toward a new television (a
   cross-category exchange). This paper studies both within-category and
   multicategory exchange promotions and analyzes their similarities and
   differences. In a competitive setting with two firms, we model exchange
   promotions and establish the equilibrium outcomes. We find that
   categories in which consumers have a high level of waste aversion are
   more likely to have multicategory exchange promotions rather than
   within-category or no promotions. Multicategory exchange promotions can
   increase both consumers' replacement purchases and their new purchases.
   Interestingly, we also find that strategic considerations can lead to a
   prisoner's dilemma outcome in which neither firm offers any kind of
   exchange promotion. However, waste aversion and multicategory exchange
   promotions can give firms stronger incentives to get out of the
   prisoner's dilemma outcome.

AB When match uncertainty is resolved via costly evaluation, the first
   product sampled by a customer is more likely to make the sale. This
   prompts firms to lower their products' evaluation costs to attract
   customers to sample their products first. Such efforts by firms are
   called customer learning investment (CLI). When product quality is
   freely observable but horizontal match is not, we examine how CLI
   choices interact with quality and price competition in a duopoly. CLI
   has a competition effect in that a higher CLI of a firm increases its
   demand but decreases that of its rivals. In the market-covered duopoly,
   both qualities will decrease (increase) when the high-end (low-end) firm
   invests more in customer learning, and remain unchanged when they invest
   equally, relative to when neither firm invests. We further show that the
   firm with a higher relative production efficiency invests more in
   customer learning than the competitor. In the market-not-covered
   duopoly, CLI by the low-end firm also creates a market-expansion effect
   by inducing some additional low-end customers to sample and purchase its
   product. This may induce it to invest more than the high-end firm, even
   when the latter has a higher relative production efficiency.

AB We study three ways firms can communicate about their brands-paid media
   (advertising), earned media (word of mouth and online social media), and
   owned media (brand websites and other owned content)-and the roles these
   media types play in reminding (i.e., activating memory), informing
   (i.e., learning their tastes for the brand), or enhancing enjoyment
   (e.g., gaining additional utility from socializing about the brand). We
   do this for a new TV show setting using a data set that contains
   reported viewing, exposures, expectations, and experiences. We present
   descriptive analyses and results from a new structural model, which
   indicate that earned media is more impactful than paid and owned media
   per exposure. However, paid media has far more exposures, so for a given
   percentage increase, paid media's influence dominates earned and owned
   media. Earned media operate primarily through enhancing enjoyment,
   whereas paid media operate through reminding and owned media through
   reminding, but discourage live viewing. We find that media exposures
   help consumers learn about how well they will like the program. However,
   this learning can either increase or decrease the expected liking, and
   in our data the average audience effects are negligible. Overall, we
   find that earned and paid media play a central role in developing and
   maintaining entertainment brands.

AB This research examines the effects of hyper-contextual targeting with
   physical crowdedness on consumer 1 responses to mobile ads. It relies on
   rich field data from one of the world's largest telecom providers who
   can gauge physical crowdedness in real-time in terms of the number of
   active mobile users in subway trains. The telecom provider randomly sent
   targeted mobile ads to individual users, measured purchase rates, and
   surveyed purchasers and nonpurchasers. Based on a sample of 14,972
   mobile phone users, the results suggest that, counterintuitively,
   commuters in crowded subway trains are about twice as likely to respond
   to a mobile offer by making a purchase vis-a-vis those in noncrowded
   trains. On average, the purchase rates measured 2.1% with fewer than two
   people per square meter, and increased to 4.3% with five people per
   square meter, after controlling for peak and off-peak times, weekdays
   and weekends, mobile use behaviors, and randomly sending mobile ads to
   users. The effects are robust to exploiting sudden variations in
   crowdedness induced by unanticipated train delays underground and street
   closures aboveground. Follow-up surveys provide insights into the causal
   mechanism driving this result. A plausible explanation is mobile
   immersion: As increased crowding invades one's physical space, people
   adaptively turn inwards and become more susceptible to mobile ads.
   Because crowding is often associated with negative emotions such as
   anxiety and risk -avoidance, the findings reveal an intriguing, positive
   aspect of crowding: Mobile ads can be a welcome relief in a crowded
   subway environment. The findings have economic significance because
   people living in cities commute 48 minutes each way on average, and
   global mobile ad spending is projected to exceed $100 billion. Marketers
   may consider the crowdedness of a consumer's environment as a new way to
   boost the effectiveness of hyper-contextual mobile advertising.

AB One of the most intriguing findings in the multichannel customer
   management literature is the positive association between multichannel
   purchasing and customer profitability The question is whether this
   finding can be put into action. That is, can a firm develop a marketing
   campaign to increase multichannel purchasing and hence average customer
   profitability, and if so what are the key factors that enable success.
   We design and implement a randomized field experiment to investigate
   this question. The field experiment tests four marketing campaigns that
   vary in the communications message and the provision of financial
   incentives. We find that the multichannel/profitability relationship is
   actionable. A properly designed marketing campaign increases the number
   of multichannel customers and increases average customer profitability.
   That campaign's message emphasizes the benefits of multichannel shopping
   but does not rely on financial incentives. Moreover, we use propensity
   score matching to show that, after accounting for self-selection,
   multichannel customers are more profitable than they would be if they
   were not multichannel. A post-test analysis suggests that the
   multichannel/nonfinancial incentive campaign succeeded in inducing
   customers to become multichannel because it decreased customer reactance
   and increased perceived behavioral control.

AB Motivated by the growing practice of using social network data in credit
   scoring, we analyze the impact of using network -based measures on
   customer score accuracy and on tie formation among customers. We develop
   a series of models to compare the accuracy of customer scores obtained
   with and without network data. We also investigate how the accuracy of
   social network -based scores changes when consumers can strategically
   construct their social networks to attain higher scores. We find that
   those who are motivated to improve their scores may form fewer ties and
   focus more on similar partners. The impact of such endogenous tie
   formation on the accuracy of consumer scores is ambiguous. Scores can
   become more accurate as a result of modifications in social networks,
   but this accuracy improvement may come with greater network
   fragmentation. The threat of social exclusion in such endogenously
   formed networks provides incentives to low-type members to exert effort
   that improves everyone's creditworthiness. We discuss implications for
   managers and public policy.

AB In sponsored search advertising, advertisers bid to be displayed in
   response to a keyword search. The operational activities associated with
   participating in an auction, i.e., submitting the bid and the ad copy,
   customizing bids and ad copies based on various factors (such as the
   geographical region from which the query originated, the time of day and
   the season, the characteristics of the searcher), and continuously
   measuring outcomes, involve considerable effort. We call the costs that
   arise from such activities keyword management costs. To reduce these
   costs and increase advertisers' participation in keyword auctions,
   search engines offer an opt-in tool called broad match with automatic
   and flexible bidding, wherein the search engine automatically places
   bids on behalf of the advertisers and takes over the above activities as
   well. The bids are based on the search engine's estimates of the
   advertisers' valuations and, therefore, may be less accurate than the
   bids the advertisers would have turned in themselves. Using a game
   -theoretic model, we examine the strategic role of keyword management
   costs, and of broad match, in sponsored search advertising. We show that
   because these costs inhibit participation by advertisers in keyword
   auctions, the search engine has to reduce the reserve price, which
   reduces the search engine's profits. This motivates the search engine to
   offer broad match as a tool to reduce keyword management costs. If the
   accuracy of broad match bids is sufficiently high, advertisers adopt
   broad match and benefit from the cost reduction, whereas if the accuracy
   is very low, advertisers do not use it. Interestingly, at moderate
   levels of bid accuracy, advertisers individually find it attractive to
   reduce costs by using broad match, but competing advertisers also adopt
   broad match and the increased competition hurts all advertisers'
   profits, thus creating a "prisoner's dilemma." When advertisers adopt
   broad match, search engine profits increase. It therefore seems natural
   to expect that the search engine will be motivated to improve broad
   match accuracy. Our analysis shows that the search engine will increase
   broad match accuracy up to the point where advertisers choose broad
   match, but that increasing the accuracy any further reduces the search
   engine's profits.

AB We provide a descriptive study of the cross-category effects of
   satisfaction with financial services on retention behavior. Behavioral
   contrast and learning theories provide the bases for our understanding
   of these effects. Our empirical results reveal the following: (i) Across
   banking and investment categories, when customers have different
   providers, satisfaction with one lowers the retention probability in the
   other service. (ii) A customer who is dissatisfied with the investment
   service is more likely to stay with the current banking service. (iii)
   Significantly, we find that when the same firm is involved in both
   categories, dissatisfaction with the firm in the investment category
   spills over into the banking category thereby lowering its retention
   probability. We also find that: (a) among customers who are satisfied
   with banking (investment), more exposure to media increases retention
   probability; (b) although switching costs and order of acquisition
   affect retention, they do not show cross-category interactions with
   satisfaction. We then obtain implications for customer lifetime value
   (CLV) and show that it can increase satisfaction by leveraging both the
   within and across category effects. Bottom line: It is important for a
   company providing multiple services to measure satisfaction at the
   category level but to manage customers across categories.

   characteristic. Consumers are divided into loyals, who always purchase
   their preferred product, and switchers, who have heterogeneous
   preferences for the four products. If consumers substitute easily
   between the products produced by one firm, the firms promote one product
   at a time to avoid cannibalization. If consumers mainly substitute
   between the products with the same characteristic, the firms often
   employ joint promotions with at least one product at a deep discount.
   If, at the same time, consumers easily substitute to the products in
   other categories, the firms use joint promotions less often and avoid
   simultaneous deep discounts.

AB Promotions are used in marketing to increase sales and drive profits by
   temporarily decreasing the price 1 per unit of a good. Some price
   promotions apply to all quantities (20% off), some have limits on the
   number of units that can be purchased at a reduced price, and others
   only offer the discount if the volume purchased is sufficiently high. We
   develop a model of price promotions in the context of a direct utility
   model where its effects are incorporated through the budget constraint.
   Price promotions complicate the estimation and analysis of direct
   utility models because they induce kinks and points of discontinuity in
   the budget set. We propose a Bayesian approach to addressing these
   irregularities and demonstrate the ability of the direct utility model
   to be used in counterfactual analyses of price promotions. We
   investigate the stability of utility function estimates for consumers
   under alternative price promotions, and find that the majority of the
   effect of a price promotion is through the budget set, not through
   changes in the utility function. We also investigate the economic value
   of customized price promotions where the customization includes the
   value and format of the offer.

   Traditional approaches towards monitoring such perceptions (e.g.,
   surveys) are costly and time consuming, and their results may quickly
   become outdated. Extant data mining methods are unsuitable for this
   goal, and generally require extensive hand-annotated data or context
   customization, which leads to many of the same limitations as direct
   elicitation. Here, we investigate a novel, general, and fully automated
   method for inferring attribute-specific brand perception ratings by
   mining the brand's social connections on Twitter. Using a set of over

   automatic ratings estimates with directly-elicited survey data, finding
   a consistently strong correlation. The approach provides a reliable,

AB Accurate forecasting of sales/consumption is particularly important for
   marketing because this information can be used to adjust marketing
   budget allocations and overall marketing strategies. Recently, online
   social platforms have produced an unparalleled amount of data on
   consumer behavior. However, two challenges have limited the use of these
   data in obtaining meaningful business marketing insights. First, the
   data are typically in an unstructured format, such as texts, images,
   audio, and video. Second, the sheer volume of the data makes standard
   analysis procedures computationally unworkable. In this study, we
   combine methods from cloud computing, machine learning, and text mining
   to illustrate how online platform content, such as Twitter, can be
   effectively used for forecasting. We conduct our analysis on a
   significant volume of nearly two billion Tweets and 400 billion
   Wikipedia pages. Our main findings emphasize that, by contrast to basic
   surface-level measures such as the volume of or sentiments in Tweets,
   the information content of Tweets and their timeliness significantly
   improve forecasting accuracy. Our method endogenously summarizes the
   information in Tweets. The advantage of our method is that the
   classification of the Tweets is based on what is in the Tweets rather
   than preconceived topics that may not be relevant. We also find that, by
   contrast to Twitter, other online data (e.g., Google Trends, Wikipedia
   views, IMDB reviews, and Huffington Post news) are very weak predictors
   of TV show demand because users tweet about TV shows before, during, and
   after a TV show, whereas Google searches, Wikipedia views, IMDB reviews,
   and news posts typically lag behind the show.

AB User profile is a summary of a consumer's interests and preferences
   revealed through the consumer's online activity. It is a fundamental
   component of numerous applications in digital marketing. McKinsey &
   Company view online user profiling as one of the promising opportunities
   companies should take advantage of to unlock "big data's" potential.
   This paper proposes a modeling approach that uncovers individual user
   profiles from online surfing data and allows online businesses to make
   profile predictions when limited information is available. The approach
   is easily parallelized and scales well for processing massive records of
   user online activity. We demonstrate application of our approach to
   customer-base analysis and display advertising. Our empirical analysis
   uncovers easy-to-interpret behavior profiles and describes the
   distribution of such profiles. Furthermore, it reveals that even for
   information-rich online firms profile inference that is based solely on
   their internal data may produce biased results. We find that although
   search engines cover smaller portions of consumer Web visits than major
   advertising networks, their data is of higher quality. Thus, even with
   the smaller information set, search engines can effectively recover
   consumer behavioral profiles. We also show that temporal limitations
   imposed on individual-level tracking abilities are likely to have a
   differential impact across major online businesses, and that our
   approach is particularly effective for temporally limited data. Using
   economic simulation we demonstrate potential gains the proposed model
   may offer a firm if used in individual-level targeting of display ads.

AB An accurate prediction of what a customer will purchase next is of
   paramount importance to successful online retailing. In practice,
   customer purchase history data is readily available to make such
   predictions, sometimes complemented with customer characteristics. Given
   the large product assortments maintained by online retailers,
   scalability of the prediction method is just as important as its
   accuracy. We study two classes of models that use such data to predict
   what a customer will buy next, i.e., a novel approach that uses latent
   Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and mixtures of Dirichlet-Multinomials
   (MDM). A key benefit of a model-based approach is the potential to
   accommodate observed customer heterogeneity through the inclusion of
   predictor variables. We show that LDA can be extended in this direction
   while retaining its scalability. We apply the models to purchase data
   from an online retailer and contrast their predictive performance with
   that of a collaborative filter and a discrete choice model. Both LDA and
   MDM outperform the other methods. Moreover, LDA attains performance
   similar to that of MDM while being far more scalable, rendering it a
   promising approach to purchase prediction in large product assortments.

AB Bayesian hierarchical modeling is a popular approach to capturing
   unobserved heterogeneity across individual units. However, standard
   estimation methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be
   impracticable for modeling outcomes from a large number of units. We
   develop a new method to sample from posterior distributions of Bayesian
   models, without using MCMC. Samples are independent, so they can be
   collected in parallel, and we do not need to be concerned with issues
   like chain convergence and autocorrelation. The algorithm is scalable
   under the weak assumption that individual units are conditionally
   independent, making it applicable for large data sets. It can also be
   used to compute marginal likelihoods.

AB As technology advances, new products (e.g., digital cameras, computer
   tablets, etc.) have become increasingly more complex. Researchers often
   face considerable challenges in understanding consumers' preferences for
   such products. This paper proposes an adaptive decompositional framework
   to elicit consumers' preferences for complex products. The proposed
   method starts with collaborative-filtered initial part-worths, followed
   by an adaptive question selection process that uses a fuzzy support
   vector machine active learning algorithm to adaptively refine the
   individual-specific preference estimate after each question. Our
   empirical and synthetic studies suggest that the proposed method
   performs well for product categories equipped with as many as 70 to 100
   attribute levels, which is typically considered prohibitive for
   decompositional preference elicitation methods. In addition, we
   demonstrate that the proposed method provides a natural remedy for a
   long-standing challenge in adaptive question design by gauging the
   possibility of response errors on the fly and incorporating the results
   into the survey design. This research also explores in a live setting
   how responses from previous respondents may be used to facilitate active
   learning of the focal respondent's product preferences. Overall, the
   proposed approach offers new capabilities that complement existing
   preference elicitation methods, particularly in the context of complex
   products.

AB Online Display Advertising's importance as a marketing channel is
   partially due to its ability to attribute conversions to campaigns.
   Current industry practice to measure ad effectiveness is to run
   randomized experiments using placebo ads, assuming external validity for
   future exposures. We identify two different effects, i.e., a strategic
   effect of the campaign presence in marketplaces, and a selection effect
   due to user targeting; these are confounded in current practices. We
   propose two novel randomized designs to: (1) estimate the overall
   campaign attribution without placebo ads, (2) disaggregate the campaign
   presence and ad effects. Using the Potential Outcomes Causal Model, we
   address the selection effect by estimating the probability of selecting
   influenceable users. We show the ex-ante value of continuing evaluation
   to enhance the user selection for ad exposure mid-flight. We analyze two
   performance-based (CPA) and one Cost-Per-Impression (CPM) campaigns with
   20 million users each. We estimate a negative CPM campaign presence
   effect due to cross product spillovers. Experimental evidence suggests
   that CPA campaigns incentivize selection of converting users regardless
   of the ad, up to 96% more than CPM campaigns, thus challenging the
   standard practice of targeting most likely converting users.

AB In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender
   system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences
   of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based
   automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment
   shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of
   store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques
   with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically
   identifies shoppers' preferences based on their reactions and uses that
   information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the
   system uses a camera to capture a shopper's behavior in front of the
   mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial
   expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time
   point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar
   to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences,
   purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally,
   recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences,
   purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded
   shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several
   variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration
   that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical
   test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation
   against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems:
   self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET).
   The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second
   empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time
   applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR
   experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments.
   VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and
   shoppers.

AB In large markets comprising hundreds of products, comprehensive
   visualization of competitive market structures can be cumbersome and
   complex. Yet, as we show empirically, reduction of the analysis to
   smaller representative product sets can obscure important information.
   Herein we use big search data from a product- and price-comparison site
   to derive consideration sets of consumers that reflect competition
   between products. We integrate these data into a new modeling and
   two-dimensional mapping approach that enables the user to visualize
   asymmetric competition in large markets (>1,000 products) and to
   identify distinct submarkets. An empirical application to the LED-TV
   market, comprising 1,124 products and 56 brands, leads to valid and
   useful insights and shows that our method outperforms traditional models
   such as multidimensional scaling. Likewise, we demonstrate that big
   search data from product-and price-comparison sites provide higher
   external validity than search data from Google and Amazon.

AB This paper examines how firms should allocate their advertising budgets
   between consumers who have a high preference for their products (i.e.,
   strong segment) and those who prefer competing products (i.e., weak
   segment). Targeted advertising transmits relevant information to
   otherwise uninformed consumers and it is used as a price discrimination
   device. With targeted advertising and price discrimination, we find
   that, when the attractiveness of the weak segment is low, each firm
   advertises more intensively in its strong segment. The same result
   arises when the attractiveness of the weak segment is high and
   advertising is sufficiently expensive. Interestingly, when the
   attractiveness of the weak segment is high but advertising costs are
   sufficiently low, it is optimal for each firm to advertise more
   intensively in its weak segment. The paper also investigates how
   advertising strategies and equilibrium profits are affected by price
   discrimination. Compared with uniform pricing, firms can increase or
   reduce the intensity of advertising targeted to each segment when price
   discrimination is allowed. Furthermore, when the attractiveness of the
   weak market is high, price discrimination boosts firms' profits provided
   that advertising costs are sufficiently low. The reverse happens when
   advertising costs are high.

AB Manufacturers in many industries frequently use vertical price policies,
   such as minimum advertised price (MAP), to influence prices set by
   downstream retailers. Although manufacturers expect retail partners to
   comply with MAP policies, violations of MAP are common in practice. In
   this research, we document and explain both the extent and the depth of
   MAP policy violations. We also shed light on how retailers vary in their
   propensity to violate MAP policies, and the depth by which they do so.
   Our inductive research approach documents managerial wisdom about MAP
   practices. We confront these insights from practice with a large
   empirical study that includes hundreds of products sold through hundreds
   of retailers. Consistent with managerial wisdom, we find that authorized
   retailers are more likely to comply with MAP than are unauthorized
   partners. By contrast to managerial wisdom, we find that authorized and
   unauthorized markets are largely separate, and that violations in the
   authorized channel have a small association with violations in the
   unauthorized channel. Last, we link our results to the literatures on
   agency theory, transaction cost analysis, and theories of price
   obfuscation.

AB This research investigates whether there are enduring effects of goal
   achievement and failure within customer loyalty promotion programs. We
   collaborated with a major hotel chain to launch a large scale field
   experiment involving 95,532 existing loyalty customers. We observed
   customers' hotel stays for eight months before the experiment, eight
   months during the experiment, and eight months after the experiment.
   Customers in the treatment group were asked to increase their hotel
   nights during the 8-month promotion by a set percentage relative to
   their baseline to receive a reward. Overall, the promotion led to
   increased purchasing in the post-promotion period. However, only 20% of
   customers successfully reached the goal whereas 80% missed the goal. We
   use a propensity score analysis to examine the distinct effects of goal
   achievement versus goal failure. Results show that goal attainment
   significantly increased post-promotion purchasing whereas goal failure
   significantly reduced post-promotion purchasing. Additionally, we use
   econometric methods to empirically test a behavioral theory of
   relationship-based reciprocity. We find that customers in a high status
   tier relationship, with the most invested in the firm, are most affected
   by goal failure whereas customers in a low status tier relationship,
   with the least invested in the firm, are most affected by goal success.
   Because the type of loyalty program described in this paper is widely
   used in a variety of industries the findings suggest that marketers
   should set reachable goals within loyalty promotion programs. Firms
   should be particularly cautious about the impact of goal failures for
   the firm's most loyal customers.

AB In this paper, we study the effect of a firm's local channel exits on
   prices charged by incumbents remaining in the marketplace. Exits could
   result in higher prices due to tempered competition or lower prices due
   to reduced colocation or agglomeration benefits. The net effect of these
   two countervailing forces remains unknown. In addition, little is known
   about how this effect could change depending on incumbents' geographic
   locations. We address this research gap by examining new car price
   reactions by incumbent multiproduct automobile dealerships who
   experience the exit of a Chrysler dealership in their local markets. We
   find evidence that the competition effect exceeds the colocation effect:
   prices increase by about 1% ($318) following an exit relative to the
   price change in the absence of an exit. More important, we find that the
   price increase is lower at dealerships more proximate to the exiting
   dealership than dealerships farther away for the same set of cars
   available across these locations. This finding suggests differences in
   the extent of the two forces (competition and agglomeration) at
   different distances from the closed dealership. We assess the
   generalizability of our results by looking at the impact of GM's closure
   of Pontiac dealerships. Taken together, our results inform consumers,
   firms, and policymakers about possible implications of an exit.

AB A seller often needs to determine the amount of product information to
   provide to consumers. We model costly consumer information search in the
   presence of limited information. We derive the consumer's optimal
   stopping rule for the search process. We find that, in general, there is
   an intermediate amount of information that maximizes the likelihood of
   purchase. If too much information is provided, some of it is not as
   useful for the purchase decision, the average informativeness per search
   occasion is too low, and consumers end up choosing not to purchase the
   product. If too little information is provided, consumers may end up not
   having sufficient information to decide to purchase the product. The
   optimal amount of information increases with the consumer's ex ante
   valuation of the product, because with greater ex ante valuation by the
   consumer, the firm wants to offer sufficient information for the
   consumer to be less likely to run out of information to check. One can
   also show that there is an intermediate amount of information that
   maximizes the consumer's expected utility from the search problem
   (social welfare under some assumptions). Furthermore, this amount may be
   smaller than that which maximizes the probability of purchase; that is,
   the market outcome may lead to information overload with respect to the
   social welfare optimum. This paper can be seen as providing conditions
   under which too much information may hurt consumer decision making.
   Numerical analysis shows also that if consumers can choose to some
   extent which attributes to search through (but not perfectly), or if the
   firm can structure the information searched by consumers, the amount of
   information that maximizes the probability of purchase increases, but is
   close to the amount of information that maximizes the probability of
   purchase when the consumer cannot costlessly choose which attributes to
   search through.

AB We study the pass-through of wholesale price changes onto regular retail
   prices using an unusually detailed data set obtained from a major
   retailer. We model pass-through as a two-stage decision process that
   reflects both whether as well as how much to change the regular retail
   price. We show that pass-through is strongly asymmetric with respect to
   wholesale price increases versus decreases. Wholesale price increases
   are passed through to regular retail prices 70% of the time while
   wholesale price decreases are passed through only 9% of the time.
   Pass-through is also asymmetric with respect to the magnitude of the
   wholesale price change, with the magnitude affecting the response to
   wholesale price increases but not decreases. Finally, we show that
   covariates such as private label versus national brand, 99-cent price
   endings, and the time since the last wholesale price change have a much
   stronger impact on the first stage of the decision process (i.e.,
   whether to change the regular retail price) than on the second stage
   (i.e., how much to change the regular retail price).

AB The marketing and operations disciplines have increasingly accounted for
   the presence of strategic consumer behavior. Theory suggests that such
   behavior exists when consumers are able to consider future distribution
   of prices, and that this behavior exposes firms to intertemporal
   competition that results with a downward pressure on prices. However,
   deriving future distribution of prices is not a trivial task. Online
   decision support tools that provide consumers with information about
   future distributions of prices can facilitate strategic consumer
   behavior. This paper studies whether the availability of such
   information affects transacted prices by conducting an empirical
   analysis in the context of the airline industry. Studying the effect at
   the route level, we find significant price reduction effects as such
   information becomes available for a route, both in fixed-effects and
   difference-in-differences estimation models. This effect is consistent
   across the different fare percentiles and amounts to a reduction of
   approximately 4%-6% in transactions' prices. Our results lend ample
   support to the notion that price prediction decision tools make a
   statistically significant economic impact. Presumably, consumers are
   able to exploit the information available online and exhibit strategic
   behavior.

AB Successful initial public offerings (IPOs) provide firms with access to
   valuable resources, but also put pressure on firms to impress potential
   investors with evidence of their current well-being and prospects for
   future growth. To impress investors IPO firms might curtail their
   marketing budgets, which appears to inflate current earnings and provide
   evidence of current well-being. However, curtailing marketing budgets
   unexpectedly during an IPO may be a myopic practice, in that the
   immediate benefits of these budget cuts are offset by their longer-term
   adverse consequences on financial well-being. The extent of these
   adverse consequences in turn may be moderated by external firm factors,
   including strategic alliances and key customer relationships, and
   internal firm factors, such as the strategic emphasis on value creation
   versus value appropriation. A sample of 1,095 IPOs during 2000-2011
   reveals evidence of myopic marketing practices in more than 37% of the
   sample. Investors seem misled during IPOs, but they correct their
   beliefs in the three years following the IPO and penalize these firms.
   The penalty for myopic marketing budgeting practices also increases with
   more strategic alliances and a strategic emphasis on value creation
   versus value appropriation, but it decreases in the presence (versus
   absence) of key customer relationships.

AB To inform the design of sales force compensation plans when carryover
   effects exist, we propose a dynamic model where these effects, together
   with present selling efforts, drive sales. Our results show that a
   salesperson with low risk aversion exerts effort to decrease attrition
   from existing business, whereas a salesperson with high risk aversion
   does not. Why? Because carryover increases not only expected sales but
   also sales uncertainty. Consequently, the manager should incentivize the
   high risk-aversion salesperson with a concave compensation plan to
   counterbalance suboptimal customer attrition, and the low risk-aversion
   salesperson with a convex compensation plan that limits coasting on past
   efforts. We generalize our results to when the firm employs multiple
   salespeople, and when advertising and personal selling are budgeted
   together.

   goods using a data set that captures a detailed level of consumer search
   and attribute information for digital cameras. Consumers search
   extensively, engaging in 14 searches on average prior to purchase.
   Individual level search is confined to a small part of the attribute
   space. Early search is highly predictive of the characteristics of the
   camera eventually purchased. Search paths through the attribute space
   are state dependent and display "lock-in" as the search unfolds.
   Finally, the first-time discovery of the chosen alternative usually
   takes place toward the end of the search sequence. We discuss these and
   other findings in the context of optimal search strategies and discuss
   the prospects for consumer learning during search.

AB Accurate predictions of a customer's activity status and future purchase
   propensities are crucial for managing customer relationships. This
   article extends the recency-frequency paradigm of customer-base analysis
   by integrating regularity in interpurchase timing in a modeling
   framework. By definition, regularity implies less variation in timing
   patterns and thus better predictability. Whereas most stochastic
   customer behavior models assume a Poisson process of "random" purchase
   occurrence, allowing for regularity in the purchase timings is
   beneficial in noncontractual settings because it improves inferences
   about customers' latent activity status. This especially applies to
   those valuable customers who were previously very frequently active but
   have recently exhibited a longer purchase hiatus. A newly developed
   generalization of the well-known Pareto/NBD model accounts for varying
   degrees of regularity across customers by replacing the NBD component
   with a mixture of gamma distributions (labeled Pareto/GGG). The authors
   demonstrate the impact of incorporating regularity on forecasting
   accuracy using an extensive simulation study and a range of empirical
   applications. Even for mildly regular timing patterns, it is possible to
   improve customer-level predictions; the stronger the regularity, the
   greater the gain. Furthermore, the cost in terms of data requirements is
   marginal because only one additional summary statistic, in addition to
   recency and frequency, is needed that captures historical transaction
   timing.

AB Features involving the taste, smell, touch, and sight of products, as
   well as attributes such as safety and confidence, are not easily
   measured in product research without respondents actually experiencing
   them. Moreover, product researchers often evaluate a large number of
   these attributes (e.g., >50) in applied studies, making standard
   valuation techniques such as conjoint analysis difficult to implement.
   Product researchers instead rely on ratings data to assess features for
   which the respondent has had actual experience. In this paper we develop
   a method of monetizing rating data to standardize product evaluations
   among respondents. The adjusted data are shown to increase the accuracy
   of purchase predictions by about 20% relative to existing methods of
   scale adjustment, leading to better inference in models using ratings
   data. We demonstrate our method using data from a large scale product
   use study by a packaged goods manufacturer.

AB This paper examines the incentives of firms to invest in socially
   responsible product innovations. Our analysis connects the existence of
   socially responsible innovations to the presence of intrinsic and
   extrinsic social responsibility preferences. In addition to deriving
   economic value from the product, consumers have heterogeneous intrinsic
   needs to consume products that are socially responsible. They also have
   extrinsic social comparison preferences that are based on their meetings
   with others in social interactions. The frequency of these meetings are
   endogenous to the consumption choices of consumers. A consumer enjoys a
   social comparison benefit if her consumption decision is more socially
   responsible than the consumer that she meets in a social interaction and
   a social comparison cost if it is less socially responsible.
   The analysis reveals a nonmonotonic effect of social comparison effects
   on innovation incentives. When the economic value of a product is
   relatively small, the incentive to innovate decreases as social
   comparison effects increase. By contrast, when the economic value of a
   product is sufficiently large, increases in social comparison effects
   increase the incentive to innovate. Social comparison benefits and costs
   have different effects on competition between firms. In particular,
   social comparison benefits soften price competition, whereas social
   comparison costs tend to exacerbate price competition. We also identify
   market conditions where a monopoly invests more or less compared to a
   firm facing competition.

AB In the last two decades, organized retailing has transformed the
   retailing landscape in emerging economies, where unorganized retailing
   has traditionally been dominant. In this paper, we build a theoretical
   model of unorganized and organized retailing in emerging economies by
   carefully modeling key characteristics of the retailing environment, the
   retailers, the consumers, and product categories. The primary insight
   that we obtain is that in a competitive market comprising of only
   unorganized retailers, the advent of organized retailing injects
   efficiency into the market leading to a reduction in the number of
   unorganized retailers. This, in turn, makes the market less competitive.
   Building on this basic insight, we obtain a number of counterintuitive
   results. For instance, (i) the presence of organized retailing may
   increase the prices charged by unorganized retailers; (ii) as the
   consumers' transportation cost to the unorganized retailers increases,
   the market share of the unorganized retailing sector may increase; (iii)
   as the probability of bulk consumption increases and consumers prefer to
   purchase more from the organized retailer, prices and profits at the
   organized retailer may decrease; and (iv) the presence of organized
   retailing can lead to both consumer and social surplus being lower
   because consumers face higher prices at unorganized retailers and there
   is wastage in the economy due to bulk purchasing at organized retailers.
   Our model offers an explanation for certain surprising empirical
   observations related to retailing in emerging markets, such as why in
   the last few years in the Indian market the unorganized retailers who
   have survived the advent of organized retailing seem to be doing better.
   Implications from our research can provide guidance to policy makers
   grappling with issues related to the balanced growth of unorganized and
   organized retailing in emerging markets.

AB This paper studies information sharing in a distribution channel where
   the manufacturer possesses better demand-forecast information than the
   downstream retailer. We examine three information-sharing formats: no
   information sharing (i.e., the manufacturer ex ante commits to not
   sharing its forecast), voluntary information sharing (i.e., the
   manufacturer makes the sharing decision ex post after receiving the
   forecast), and mandatory information sharing (i.e., the manufacturer is
   mandated to share its forecast). We characterize the equilibrium
   outcomes under the three sharing formats and investigate the firms'
   preferences regarding these formats. It is shown that when the retailer
   is risk-neutral, both firms are indifferent between voluntary and
   mandatory sharing. Among the three formats, ex ante, the retailer
   prefers the no-sharing format whereas the manufacturer prefers the
   mandatory-sharing format. In addition, we find that a more accurate
   forecast benefits both firms under voluntary-and mandatory-sharing
   formats, but may hurt both firms under the no-sharing format. Finally,
   we show that risk aversion plays a critical role in the firms' sharing
   decisions and the impact of forecast accuracy. Specifically, when the
   retailer is risk-averse, the manufacturer may prefer the no-sharing
   format over the voluntary-sharing format, and improving forecast
   accuracy may hurt both firms even under voluntary sharing.

AB The proliferation of free trials for high-tech services calls for a
   careful study of their effectiveness, and the drivers thereof. On one
   hand, free trials can generate new paying subscribers by allowing
   consumers to become acquainted with the service free of charge. On the
   other hand, a disappointing trial experience might alienate potential
   customers, when they decide not to adopt the system and are lost for
   good. This dilemma is particularly worrisome in early periods, when
   service quality has not been "tried and tested" in the field, and
   breakdowns occur. We accommodate these phenomena in a model of
   consumers' free-trial and regular adoption decisions. Among other
   effects, it incorporates usage-and word-of-mouth-based learning about
   quality in a setting where quality itself is evolving. Consumers are
   forward-looking in that they account for changes in quality and
   anticipate uncertainty reduction due to trial usage. We estimate our
   model and run simulations on the basis of a rich and unique data set
   that incorporates customers' trial subscription, adoption, and usage
   behavior for an interactive digital television service. The results
   underscore that free trials constitute a double-edged sword, and that
   timing and consumers' usage intensity during the trial are key to the
   effectiveness of these promotions. Implications for managers are also
   discussed.

AB Firms use different attribution strategies such as last-click or
   first-click attribution to assign conversion credits to search keywords
   that appear in their consumers' paths to purchase. These attributed
   credits impact a firm's future bidding and budget allocations among
   keywords and, in turn, determine the overall return-on-investment of
   search campaigns. In this paper, we model the relationship among the
   advertiser's bidding decision for keywords, the search engine's ranking
   decision for these keywords, and the consumer's click-through rate and
   conversion rate on each keyword, and analyze the impact of the
   attribution strategy on the overall return-on-investment of paid search
   advertising.
   We estimate our simultaneous equations model using a six-month panel
   data of several hundred keywords from an online jewelry retailer. The
   data comprises a quasi-experiment as the firm changed attribution
   strategy from last-click to first-click attribution halfway through the
   data window. Our results show that returns for keyword investments vary
   significantly under the different attribution strategies. For the focal
   firm, first-click attribution leads to lower revenue returns and a more
   pronounced decrease for more specific keywords. Our policy simulation
   exercise shows how the firm can increase its overall returns by better
   attributing the real contribution of keywords. We discuss how an
   appropriate attribution strategy can help firms to better target
   customers and lower acquisition costs in the context of paid search
   advertising.

   number of donors and amounts donated consistent with sympathy biases
   such as the "identifiable victim," "in-group," and "reference
   dependence." A monthly reframing of the ask amount increases donors and
   the amount donated relative to daily reframing. A second field
   experiment targeted to past donors, finds that the effect of sympathy
   bias on giving is smaller in percentage terms but statistically and
   economically highly significant in terms of the magnitude of additional
   dollars raised. Methodologically, the paper complements the work of
   behavioral scholars by adopting an empirical researchers' lens of
   measuring relative effect sizes and economic relevance of multiple

   domain within one field setting. Beyond the benefit of conceptual
   replications, the effect sizes provide guidance to managers on which

AB Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platforms have become a major engine of
   growth in Internet commerce. This is especially true in countries such
   as China, which are experiencing a big rush toward e-commerce. The
   emergence of such platforms gives researchers the unique opportunity to
   investigate the evolution of such platforms by focusing on the growth of
   both buyers and sellers. In this research, we build a utility-based
   model to quantify both cross and direct network effects on Alibaba
   Group's Taobao.com, the world's largest online C2C platform (based in
   China). Specifically, we investigate the relative contributions of
   different factors that affect the growth of buyers and sellers on the
   platform. Our results suggest that the direct network effects do not
   play a big role in the platform's growth (we detect a small positive
   direct network effect on buyer growth and no direct network effect on
   seller growth). More importantly, we find a significant, large and
   positive cross-network effect on both sides of the platform. In other
   words, the installed base of either side of the platform has propelled
   the growth of the other side (and thus the overall growth).
   Interestingly, this cross-network effect is asymmetric with the
   installed base of sellers having a much larger effect on the growth of
   buyers than vice versa. The growth in the number of buyers is driven
   primarily by the seller's installed base and product variety with
   increasing importance of product variety. The growth in the number of
   sellers is driven by buyer's installed base, buyer quality, and product
   price with increasing importance of buyer quality. We also investigate
   the nature of these cross-network effects over time. We find that the
   cross-network effect of sellers on buyers increases and then decreases
   to reach a stable level. By contrast, the cross-network effect of buyers
   on sellers is relatively stable. We discuss the policy implications of
   these findings for C2C platforms in general and Taobao in particular.

AB This research aims to understand and predict online customers' store
   visit and purchase behaviors. To this end, we develop a model that
   accounts for different patterns of online store visits at the individual
   level. Given the latency of visit patterns, we employ a changepoint
   modeling framework and statistically infer them using a Bayesian
   approach. The inferences obtained are then used to examine the effects
   of visit patterns on purchase dynamics across store visits. Using
   Internet clickstream data at an online retailer, we find that online
   store visit patterns tend to be clustered with significant variation
   across customers in terms of the number and size of visit clusters as
   well as the visit frequencies, both within and between clusters.
   Furthermore, the conversion rates vary significantly, depending on store
   visit patterns, such that they tend to be higher at later visits within
   a visit cluster, compared with earlier visits. The proposed model
   thereby offers superior fit and predictive performance than benchmark
   models that ignore clustered visit patterns and their impact on purchase
   behavior. We demonstrate the model's ability to better identify
   prospective customers by utilizing their visit patterns, which can
   assist marketers in scoring customers and making targeting decisions
   across individuals for marketing activity.

AB We study the effects of information content in 59,814 pharmaceutical
   sales calls on doctors' prescription decisions for statins, in the face
   of entry of competing brands and generics, using a hierarchical Bayesian
   distributed lag model. We conclude that adding information content to
   the prescription response model improves the in-and out-of-sample
   performance of the model. In the first six months following generic
   entry, it is more effective for incumbent brands to detail on drug
   contraindications and indications, compared to other periods, to
   positively differentiate from generics. In the first six months
   following branded entry, it is less effective for incumbent brands to
   detail on drug indications and costs, given increased competitive
   clutter. We also document substantial heterogeneity among doctors in
   their response to information content. Our model is helpful for analysts
   to more accurately assess the effectiveness of detailing. Our empirical
   results are also informative for drug manufacturers as they set or
   change their messaging policies in response to entry and help firms to
   tailor their message content at the doctor level.

AB Past research has primarily focused on what happens after a merger. This
   research attempts to determine whether anticipated benefits from the
   merger actually accrue. We characterize the effects of observed
   variables on whether pairs of firms merge, vis-a-vis roommate matching,
   and then link these factors to post-merger innovation (i.e., number of
   patents). We jointly estimate the two models using Markov Chain Monte
   Carlo methods with a unique panel data set of 1,979 mergers between
   4,444 firms across industries and countries from 1992 to 2008. We find
   that similarity in national culture and technical knowledge has a
   positive effect on partner selection and post-merger innovation.
   Anticipated synergy from subindustry similarity, however, is not
   realized in post-merger innovation. Furthermore, some key synergy
   sources are unanticipated when selecting a merger partner. For example,
   financial synergy from higher total assets and complementarity in total
   assets and debt leverage as well as knowledge synergy from breadth and
   depth of knowledge positively influence innovation but not partner
   selection. Furthermore, factors that dilute synergy (e.g., higher debt
   levels) are unanticipated, and firms merge with firms that detract from
   their innovation potential. Overall, the results reveal some incongruity
   between anticipated and realized synergy.

AB Experimental methods are critical tools in marketing, psychology, and
   economics to isolate the effects of key variables from vagaries
   intrinsic to field data. As such, they are often considered exempt from
   the sort of sample selectivity artifacts widely documented in empirical
   research, in part because participants are randomly assigned to
   experimental conditions. To conserve time and resources, experiments
   often focus on items participants have chosen or are familiar with, for
   example, postchoice satisfaction ratings, certain free recall tasks, or
   specifying consideration sets preceding brand choice. When consumer
   input even partially influences the items about which researchers
   request subsequent data, the potential for item selectivity arises. In
   such situations, analyses are contingent on both the choice context(s)
   of the experiment and the alternatives participants elect to evaluate,
   potentially leading to substantial item selectivity overall and to
   differing degrees across conditions. We examine situations in which a
   nonignorable "choose one of many" (polytomous) selection process limits
   which items offer up subsequent information, and develop methods to
   allow substantive results to pertain to the full set of items, not only
   those selected. The framework is illustrated via two experiments in
   which participants choose and then evaluate a frequently purchased
   consumer good as well as data first examined by Ratner et al. [Ratner
   RK, Kahn BE, Kahneman D (1999) Choosing less-preferred experiences for
   the sake of variety. J. Consumer Res. 26(1): 1-15]. Results indicate
   substantial item selectivity that, when corrected for, can lead to
   markedly different interpretations of focal variable effects, such as
   large effect size changes and even sign reversal. Moreover, failing to
   flexibly account for item selectivity across experimental conditions,
   even in well-designed experimental settings, can lead to inaccurate
   substantive inferences about consumers' evaluative criteria. We further
   demonstrate robustness to theoretically driven (but not overtly
   misspecified) selection rules and provide researchers with a simple,
   "two-step" exploratory procedure akin to a "control function"
   approach-involving just one additional variable added to standard
   models-to determine whether and to what degree item selectivity may be
   affecting their substantive results.

AB We explore the use of big data tools to shed new light on the idea
   generation process, automatically "read" ideas to identify promising
   ones, and help people be more creative. The literature suggests that
   creativity results from the optimal balance between novelty and
   familiarity, which can be measured based on the combinations of words in
   an idea. We build semantic networks where nodes represent word stems in
   a particular idea generation topic, and edge weights capture the degree
   of novelty versus familiarity of word stem combinations (i.e., the
   weight of an edge that connects two word stems measures their scaled
   co-occurrence in the relevant language). Each idea contains a set of
   word stems, which form a semantic subnetwork. The edge weight
   distribution in that subnetwork reflects how the idea balances novelty
   with familiarity. Based on the "beauty in averageness" effect, we
   hypothesize that ideas with semantic subnetworks that have a more
   prototypical edge weight distribution are judged as more creative. We
   show this effect in eight studies involving over 4,000 ideas across
   multiple domains. Practically, we demonstrate how our research can be
   used to automatically identify promising ideas and recommend words to
   users on the fly to help them improve their ideas.

   develops a benefit-based model for conjoint analysis that assumes

AB This paper studies the ability of competing retailers to form a cartel
   by sharing information with their mutual manufacturer. In a market
   characterized by demand uncertainty, colluding retailers wish to share
   information about the potential market demand to coordinate on the
   optimal collusive retail price. However, in light of potential exposure
   to antitrust investigations and possible sanctions, the retailers search
   for mechanisms to exchange information while avoiding the risks of
   scrutiny by the antitrust authorities. This paper examines such a
   mechanism: each retailer shares his private information with the mutual
   manufacturer; the wholesale price set by the latter is thereafter used
   by the retailers to infer the market condition and coordinate on the
   cartel's price. Although a cartel at the retail level limits the
   manufacturer's sold quantity, under certain conditions the manufacturer
   is better off accepting the retailers' private information, thereby
   assisting the cartel formation. Moreover, vertical information sharing
   between the retailers and their mutual manufacturer can result in lower
   consumer surplus than that would have occurred had the retailers been
   permitted to collude directly.

AB Seeded marketing campaigns (SMCs) involve firms sending products to
   selected customers and encouraging them to spread word of mouth (WOM).
   Prior research has examined certain aspects of this increasingly popular
   form of marketing communication, such as seeding strategies and their
   efficacy. Building on prior research, this study investigates the
   effects of SMCs that extend beyond the generation of WOM for a
   campaign's focal product by considering how seeding can affect WOM
   spillover effects at the brand and category levels. The authors
   introduce a framework of SMC-related spillover effects, and empirically
   estimate these with a unique data set covering 390 SMCs for products
   from 192 different cosmetics brands. Multiple spillover effects are
   found, suggesting that while SMCs can be used primarily to stimulate WOM
   for a focal product, marketers must also account for brand- and
   category-level WOM spillover effects. Specifically, seeding increases
   conversations about that product among nonseed consumers, and,
   interestingly, decreases WOM about other products from the same brand
   and about competitors' products in the same category as the focal
   product. These findings indicate that marketers can use SMCs to focus
   online WOM on a particular product by drawing consumers away from
   talking about other related, but off-topic, products.

   advertising impacts the volume of online WOM about advertised brands and

   encourages or discourages viewers to engage in this particular social TV
   activity. Using data containing television advertising instances and the
   volume of minute-by-minute social media mentions, our analyses reveal
   that television advertising impacts the volume of onlineWOMfor both the
   brand advertised and the program in which the advertisement airs. We
   additionally find that the programs that receive the most online WOM are
   not necessarily the best programs for advertisers interested in online
   engagement for their brands. Finally, our results highlight the brand,
   advertisement, and program characteristics that can encourage or

AB Consumers' preferences can often be represented using a multimodal
   continuous heterogeneity distribution. One explanation for such a
   preference distribution is that consumers belong to a few distinct
   segments, with preferences of consumers in each segment being
   heterogeneous and unimodal. We propose an innovative approach for
   modeling such multimodal distributions that builds on recent advances in
   sparse learning and optimization. We apply the model to conjoint
   analysis where consumer heterogeneity plays a critical role in
   determining optimal marketing decisions. Our approach uses a two-stage
   divide-and-conquer framework, where we first divide the consumer
   population into segments by recovering a set of candidate segmentations
   using sparsity modeling, and then use each candidate segmentation to
   develop a set of individual-level heterogeneity representations. We
   select the optimal individual-level heterogeneity representation using
   cross-validation. Using extensive simulation experiments and three field
   data sets, we show the superior performance of our sparse learning model
   compared to benchmark models including the finite mixture model and the
   Bayesian normal component mixture model.

AB We study the identification of the search method consumers use when

   search method-simultaneous or sequential-is identified with data on
   consumers' consideration sets (but not the sequence of searches), prices
   for the considered alternatives and marketwide price distributions. We
   show that identification comes from differences in the patterns of
   actual prices in consumers' consideration sets across search methods. We
   also provide a new estimation approach for the sequential search model
   that uses such data. Using data on consumer shopping behavior in the
   U.S. auto insurance industry that contain information on consideration
   sets and choices, we find that the pattern of actual prices in
   consumers' consideration sets is consistent with consumers searching
   simultaneously. Via counterfactuals we show that the consideration set
   and purchase market shares of the largest insurance companies are
   overpredicted under the incorrect assumption of sequential search. As
   the search method affects consumers' consideration sets, which in turn
   influence brand choices, understanding the nature of consumer search and
   its implications for consideration and choice is important from a

AB Product lines are ubiquitous. For example, Marriott International
   manages high-end ultra-luxury hotels (e.g., Ritz-Carlton) and low-end
   economy hotels (e.g., Fairfield Inn). Firms often bundle core products
   with ancillary services (or add-ons). Interestingly, empirical
   observations reveal that industries with ostensibly similar
   characteristics (e.g., customer types, costs, competition, distribution
   channels, etc.) employ different bundling strategies. For example,
   airlines bundle high-end first class with ancillary services (e.g.,
   breakfast, entertainment) while hotel chains bundle ancillary services
   (e.g., breakfast, entertainment) at the low-end. We observe, unlike
   hotel lines that are highly differentiated at different geographic
   locations, airlines suffer low core differentiation because all
   passengers (first-class and economy) are at the same location (i.e.,
   same plane, weather, delays, cancellations, etc.). In general, we find
   product lines with low core differentiation (e.g., airlines, amusement
   parks) routinely bundle high-end while product lines with highly
   differentiated cores (e.g., hotels, restaurants) routinely bundle
   low-end. High-end bundling makes the high-end more attractive,
   increasing line differentiation (less intraline competition) while
   low-end bundling decreases line differentiation. Therefore, bundling
   allows optimal differentiation given a differentiation constraint
   (complex costs). Last, firms may use strategic bundling for targeting in
   their core products; e.g., low-end hotels bundle targeted add-ons
   unattractive to high-end consumers such as lower-quality breakfasts and
   slower Internet.

AB We test an information theory of prosocial behavior whereby ego utility
   and self-signaling crowd out the effect of consumption utility on
   choice. The data come from two field experiments involving purchases of
   a consumer good bundled with a charitable donation. Across experimental
   cells, we randomize the price level and the donation level. A model-free
   analysis of the data reveals nonmonotonic regions of demand when the
   good is bundled with relatively large charitable donations. Subjects
   also self-report lower ratings of "feeling good about themselves" when
   offered bundles with large donations and price discounts. The evidence
   suggests that price discounts crowd out consumer self-inference of
   altruism. Alternative motivation-crowding theories are rejected due to
   their inability to explain the nonmonotonic data moments. The standard
   use of interaction effects and other falsification checks to explore the
   underlying choice mechanism in an experimental setting is complicated in
   our self-signaling context. Instead, a novel feature of our analysis
   consists of using the experimental data to estimate the structural form
   of a model of consumer demand with self-signaling. We specify a model in
   which consumers obtain both consumption and ego utility from their
   choices. Ego utility derives from a consumer's posterior self-beliefs
   after making her choice. An estimator is proposed that handles the
   potential multiplicity of equilibria that can arise in the
   self-signaling model. The model estimates allowus to quantify the
   economic role of ego utility and to explore the underlying signaling
   mechanism. Nested tests reject the hypothesis of no self-signaling.
   Alternative model specifications that potentially allow for nonmontonic
   demand without the self-signaling structure exhibit an inferior fit to
   the data. The model estimates imply that consumer response to the
   donations are mainly driven by ego utility and not by consumption
   utility (i.e., not by altruistic motives). The findings from the
   combination of a field experiment and a structural model contribute to a
   growing literature on self-signaling and consumer behavior by
   quantifying the magnitude of self-signaling on preferences and choices.
   The results also have implications for the design of a cause marketing
   campaign and the potential negative synergies between price and nonprice
   promotions.

   changepoint model, exploits the underlying regime structure in a
   sequence of acquired customer cohorts to make predictive statements
   about new cohorts for which the firm has little or no longitudinal
   transaction data. To accomplish this, we develop our model within a
   hierarchical Bayesian framework to uncover evidence of (latent) regime
   changes for each cohort-level parameter separately, while disentangling
   cross-cohort changes from calendar-time changes. Calibrating the model
   using multicohort donation data from a nonprofit organization, we find
   that hold-out predictions for new cohorts using this model have greater
   accuracy-and greater diagnostic value-compared to a variety of strong
   benchmarks. Our modeling approach also highlights the perils of pooling
   data across cohorts without accounting for crosscohort shifts, thus
   enabling managers to quantify their uncertainty about potential regime
   changes and avoid "old data" aggregation bias.

AB It has been shown that a monopolist can use advance selling to increase
   profits. This paper documents that this may not hold when a firm faces
   competition. With advance selling a firmoffers its service in an advance
   period, before consumers knowtheir valuations for the firms' services,
   or later on in a spot period, when consumers know their valuations. We
   identify two ways in which competition limits the effectiveness of
   advance selling. First, while a monopolist can sell to consumers with
   homogeneous preferences at a high price, this homogeneity intensifies
   price competition, which lowers profits. However, the firms may
   nevertheless find themselves in an equilibrium with advance selling. In
   this sense, advance selling is better described as a competitive
   necessity rather than as an advantageous tool to raise profits. Second,
   competition in the spot period is likely to lower spot period prices,
   thereby forcing firms to lower advance period prices, which is also not
   favorable to profits. Rational firms anticipate this and curtail or
   eliminate the use of advance selling. Thus, even though a monopolist
   fully exploits the practice of advance selling, rational firms facing
   competition either mitigate it or avoid it completely.

AB For many years, marketing managers have used dynamic sales response
   models to compute expected sales conditional on the available
   information. These models fail to recognize that the volatility
   (conditional variance) of sales can vary over time. Moreover, the
   covolatilities (conditional covariances) between sales and marketing-mix
   variables can be time varying. Both concepts introduce a new range of
   strategic and tactical considerations for product and brand managers.
   Using a multivariate volatility model, we investigate the covolatility
   of sales and the marketing mix of a focal brand and competing brands in
   the market. We also examine carryover effects from a volatility
   perspective. The methodology is applied to six product categories sold
   by Dominick's Finer Foods. The results reveal valuable implications for

AB Using a detailed data set from the U.S. automotive industry, we enrich
   the existing literature on product line breadth with new results that
   highlight previously unexplored operational aspects of its benefits and
   costs. We find that expanding product line breadth has a significant
   effect on increasing mismatch costs arising from the increased demand
   uncertainty associated with product proliferation. These mismatch costs
   are manifested through additional discounts and inventories. The effect
   of product line breadth on mismatch costs is comparable in magnitude to
   the effect on production costs, suggesting that the operational benefits
   of inventory pooling achievable by rationalizing product lines can be
   very substantial. Furthermore, we quantify the benefit of using a
   platform strategy to mitigate the effects of a broad product line on
   production costs. Finally, we propose an additional, attribute-based
   measure of product line breadth and find that product line breadth can
   work as a hedge against changes in demand conditions. For example,
   automakers that offer a broader range of fuel economy levels increase
   their market share and reduce their average discounts as gas prices
   become more volatile.

AB We develop a game-theoretic model to examine the entry of copycats and
   its implications by incorporating two salient features; these features
   are two product attributes, i.e., physical resemblance and product
   quality, and two consumer utilities, i.e., consumption utility and
   status utility. Our equilibrium analysis suggests that copycats with a
   high physical resemblance but low product quality are more likely to
   successfully enter the market by defying the deterrence of the
   incumbent. Furthermore, we show that higher quality can prevent the
   copycat from successfully entering the market. Finally, we show that the
   entry of copycats does not always improve consumer surplus and social
   welfare. In particular, when the quality of the copycat is sufficiently
   low, the loss in status utility from consumers of the incumbent product
   overshadows the small gain in consumption utility from buyers of the
   copycat, leading to an overall decrease in consumer surplus and social
   welfare.

   information on the likelihood of subsequent adoption. The results
   highlight the degree of homophily with the adopting stock as well as the
   level of customer uncertainty as key characteristics determining the
   nature of the effect of stock information. In particular, information
   about a large existing adoption stock generates a positive effect on
   adoption only under moderate customer uncertainty combined with
   sufficient homophily; in other levels of uncertainty and/or homophily we
   find effects ranging from null to negative. This is the first direct

   who have funds and businesses that seek loans, and explore the
   implications of such policies for banks and depositors. Our results
   indicate the policy could erode market discipline and increase banks'

   than they would have in the absence of the policy. We find this policy
   may even harm consumers. Moreover, market competition magnifies the lack
   of market discipline and induces additional moral hazard for excessive
   risk taking. Counterfactuals indicate banks may reduce their deposit

AB The creation and sharing of user-generated content such as product
   reviews has become increasingly "social," particularly in online

   have used monetary rewards to motivate product review contributions,
   empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of such rewards remains
   limited. We examine the possible moderating effect of social
   connectedness (measured as the number of friends) on publicly offered
   monetary rewards using field data from an online review community. This
   community saw an (unexpected) overall decrease in total contributions
   after introducing monetary rewards for posting reviews. Further
   examination across members finds a strong moderating effect of social
   connectedness. Specifically, contributions from less-connected members
   increased by 1,400%, while contributions from more-connected members
   declined by 90%. To corroborate this effect, we rule out multiple
   alternative explanations and conduct robustness checks. Our findings
   suggest that token-sized monetary rewards, when offered publicly, can
   undermine contribution rates among the most connected community members.

AB Chronic diseases, which account for 75% of healthcare expenditure, are
   of particular importance in trying to understand the rapid growth of
   healthcare costs over the last few decades. Individuals suffering from
   chronic diseases can consume three types of services: secondary
   preventive care, which includes diagnostic tests; primary preventive
   care, which consists of drugs that help prevent the illness from getting
   worse; and curative care, which includes surgeries and expensive drugs
   that provide a quantum boost to the patient's health. Although the
   majority of cases can be managed by preventive care, most consumers opt
   for more expensive curative care that leads to a substantial increase in
   overall costs. To examine these inefficiencies, we build a model of
   consumers' annual medical insurance plan decisions and periodic
   consumption decisions and apply it to a panel data set. Our results
   indicate that there exists a sizable segment of consumers who purchase
   more comprehensive plans than needed because of high uncertainty
   vis-a-vis their health status, and that once in the plan, they opt for
   curative care even when their illness could be managed through
   preventive care. We examine how changing cost-sharing characteristics of
   insurance plans and providing more accurate information to consumers via
   secondary preventive care can reduce these inefficiencies.

AB Firms seeking business opportunities often face corruptible agents in
   many markets. This paper investigates the marketing strategy
   implications for firms competing for business, and for the buyer in a
   corruptible market. We consider a setting in which a buyer (a firm or
   government) seeks to purchase a good through a corruptible agent.
   Supplier firms that may or may not be a good fit compete to be selected
   by the agent. Only the agent observes whether a firm is a good fit.
   Corruption arises due to the agent's incentive to select a nondeserving
   firm in exchange for bribes. Intuitively and as expected, a sufficiently
   large monitoring of the agent eradicates corruption. Interestingly,
   however, increasing the monitoring from an initial low level can
   backfire, making the agent more likely to select a nondeserving firm.
   This nonmonotonic agent behavior makes it difficult for the buyer to
   reduce corruption. The implication is that the buyer should choose
   either to be ignorant or to take drastic measures to limit corruption.
   Furthermore, we show that unilateral anticorruption controls, such as
   the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, on a U.S. firm seeking
   business in a corrupt foreign market can actually increase the firm's
   profits.

AB This paper examines the spillover effects of promotions when products
   from different firms are consumed in a bundle. Using data from the
   HIV/AIDS category, a canonical example of combination therapy, we
   estimate a hierarchical Bayesian logit model across treatment regimens
   and show that detailing for one drug can increase demand for other drugs
   that are often combined with the focal drug. Such spillover effects
   could lead to free riding by the drugs benefitting from the spillover.
   We investigate the managerial and policy implications of detailing
   spillover effects via counterfactual policy simulations based on a
   dynamic oligopoly game of detailing. For managers, we show how firms can
   internalize the spillover effects and reduce the incentive for free
   riding. For policy makers, the implications of our findings relate to
   detailing restrictions that are often proposed on branded drugs. These
   restrictions aim to increase social welfare by encouraging the use of
   generic drugs. However, in combination therapies generic drugs may
   actually benefit from the detailing of complementary branded products.
   If detailing was curtailed, this could adversely affect generic drug
   prescriptions as well, which runs counter to policy makers' objectives
   of encouraging use of generic drugs.

AB Conventional advice to firms in competitive markets is to raise barriers
   against competitive poaching of their customers. However, we see
   instances where a firm enables competitor advertising to its customers.
   For example, Walmart hosts banner ads for TVs from Sears to customers
   searching for TVs on Walmart. com, risking a loss of customers in
   exchange for a commission. This paper explores whether and under what
   conditions allowing competitor advertising in one's store may be a
   beneficial strategy. We analyze a duopoly market where customers are
   heterogeneous in search costs, information, and preferences. We find
   that hosting a competitor ad for an undifferentiated product can
   mitigate price competition and boost profits of both firms if the
   advertising commission is high enough. Otherwise, hosting competitor
   advertising may decrease the profits of both firms. Thus, there is no
   conflict of interest between firms in advertising and in setting the ad
   commission level. Yet the host prefers more efficient ads while the
   advertiser does not. Furthermore, the equilibrium outcome is asymmetric,
   with only one store featuring ads of the other. If stores are
   sufficiently differentiated in marginal costs of the product, the cost
   disadvantaged store will be the host. We show that the results are
   robust to displaying price in the ad, to different commission
   structures, and to customer uncertainty about the commission rate.

   on manufacturers and retailers in a distribution channel when there are

   behavioral price discrimination, which rely only on differences in price
   elasticity across customers, our pricing model allows the firm
   strategies to additionally account for differences in price elasticity
   across time (due to switching costs). We estimate a dynamic pricing
   model using empirical data from the cola category and, through a series
   of counterfactuals, we find that the retailer should simply outsource
   the data analytics and customization of coupons to manufacturers and
   improve its profit beyond what it can achieve by proactively couponing
   on its own. We further find that serving as an information broker to
   sell its customer database to manufacturers can be a vital source of
   profit to the retailer. By contrast, manufacturers end up worse off,
   illustrating that customer information is a potent source of channel
   power to the retailer. Finally, we show that simply using customers'
   most recent purchase information can significantly impact firms'
   profits. BPD based on this information is easy to implement and of low

   dyadic compromise effect (DCE) exists, the association between dyadic
   and individual compromise effects, and strategies to mitigate the DCE.
   We build a statistical model of dyadic choice that formally incorporates
   DCE. We conduct two studies to test our proposed models empirically. In
   Study 1, we begin with an investigation of the DCE with student
   subjects. In Study 2, we test for the presence of DCE among married
   couples when making retirement investment choices. In both studies,
   model-free and model-based evidence provides strong support for the
   presence of DCE. A model that incorporates DCE provides a better fit
   than models that do not. Evidence in support of DCE is shown to be
   robust to alternative compromise effect model specifications and utility
   aggregation methods. We find that the individual compromise effect
   tendency of a group member with a greater stake in the decision is
   likely to persist as a DCE in the joint choice setting. Our findings
   suggest that education of segments vulnerable to compromise effects
   reduces the DCE.

AB Managing marketing resources over time requires dynamic model
   estimation, which necessitates specifying some parametric or
   nonparametric probability distribution. When the data generating process
   differs from the assumed distribution, the resulting model is
   misspecified. To hedge against such a misspecification risk, the extant
   theory recommends using the sandwich estimator. This approach, however,
   only corrects the variance of estimated parameters, but not their
   values. Consequently, the sandwich estimator does not affect any
   managerial outcomes such as marketing budgeting and allocation
   decisions. To overcome this drawback, we present the minimax framework
   that does not necessitate distributional assumptions to estimate dynamic
   models. Applying minimax control theory, we derive an optimal robust
   filter, illustrate its application to a unique advertising data set from
   the Canadian Blood Services, and contribute several novel findings. We
   discover the compensatory effect: Advertising effectiveness increases
   and the carryover effect decreases as robustness increases. We also find
   that the robust filter uniformly outperforms the Kalman filter on the
   out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we uncover the existence of a
   profit-volatility trade-off, similar to the returns-risk trade-off in
   finance, whereby the volatility of profit stream decreases at the
   expense of reduced total profit as robustness increases. Finally, we
   prove that, unlike for-profit companies, managers of nonprofit
   organizations should optimally allocate budgets opposite the
   advertising-to-sales ratio heuristic; that is, advertise more (less)
   when sales are low (high).

   parameterization, if brand equity were to depreciate more slowly, or if
   advertising were more effective at building brand equity, then brand
   value would increase. However, counterintuitively, we find that when the
   effectiveness of advertising is sufficiently high, increasing the rate
   at which brand equity depreciates can increase the value of a firm's
   brand, even as it reduces the value of the firm overall.

AB Firms using online advertising regularly run experiments with multiple
   versions of their ads since they are uncertain about which ones are most
   effective. During a campaign, firms try to adapt to intermediate results
   of their tests, optimizing what they earn while learning about their
   ads. Yet how should they decide what percentage of impressions to
   allocate to each ad? This paper answers that question, resolving the
   well-known "learn-and-earn" trade-off using multi-armed bandit (MAB)
   methods. The online advertiser's MAB problem, however, contains
   particular challenges, such as a hierarchical structure (ads within a
   website), attributes of actions (creative elements of an ad), and
   batched decisions (millions of impressions at a time), that are not
   fully accommodated by existing MAB methods. Our approach captures how
   the impact of observable ad attributes on ad effectiveness differs by
   website in unobserved ways, and our policy generates allocations of
   impressions that can be used in practice. We implemented this policy in
   a live field experiment delivering over 750 million ad impressions in an
   online display campaign with a large retail bank. Over the course of two
   months, our policy achieved an 8% improvement in the customer
   acquisition rate, relative to a control policy, without any additional
   costs to the bank. Beyond the actual experiment, we performed
   counterfactual simulations to evaluate a range of alternative model
   specifications and allocation rules in MAB policies. Finally, we show
   that customer acquisition would decrease by about 10% if the firm were
   to optimize click-through rates instead of conversion directly, a
   finding that has implications for understanding the marketing funnel.

AB Outlet stores offer attractive prices at locations far from central
   shopping districts. They form a large and growing component of many
   firms' retailing strategies, particularly in the fashion industry. I use
   a structural demand model to show that consumers are segmented according
   to their sensitivity to travel distance and taste for product newness. I
   then develop a supply model to predict product development responses to
   changes in store locations. Through policy simulations, I discover that
   the firm uses outlet stores to serve lower-value consumers who
   self-select by traveling to outlet stores from central shopping
   districts. The firm sells older, less desirable merchandise through
   outlet stores to prevent cannibalization of regular store revenues by
   means of exploiting the positive correlation between consumers' travel
   sensitivity and taste for new products. I find that the rate of new
   product introduction in regular stores would fall by 16% if outlet
   stores were closed down, while variable profits would decline by 23%.
   These results imply that the existence of outlet stores may enable firms
   to improve quality in their regular channels, thus counteracting brand
   dilution effects.

AB Consumers engage in costly searches to evaluate the increasing number of
   product options available from online retailers. Presenting the best
   alternatives at the beginning reduces search costs associated with a
   consumer finding the right product. We use rich data on consumer
   click-stream behavior from a major web-based hotel comparison platform
   to estimate a model of search and click. We propose a method of
   determining the ranking of search results that maximizes consumers'
   click-through rates (CTRs) based on partial information available to the
   platform at the time of the consumer request, its assessment of
   consumers' preferences, and the expected consumer type based on request
   parameters from the current visit. Our method has two distinct
   advantages. First, we endogenize a consumer response to the ranking
   using search refinement tools, such as sorting and filtering of product
   options. Accounting for these search refinement actions is important
   since the ranking and consumer search actions together shape the
   consideration set from which clicks are made. Second, rankings are
   targeted to anonymous consumers by relating price sensitivity to request
   parameters, such as the length of stay, number of guests, and day of the
   week of the stay. We find that predicted CTRs under our proposed ranking
   are almost double those of the platform's default ranking.

AB We study consumer search behavior in a brick-and-mortar store
   environment, using a unique data set obtained from radio-frequency
   identification tags, which are attached to supermarket shopping carts.
   This technology allows us to record consumers' purchases as well as the
   time they spent in front of the shelf when contemplating which product
   to buy, giving us a direct measure of search effort. We estimate a
   linear regression of price paid on search duration, in which search
   duration is instrumented with a search-cost shifter. We show that this
   regression allows us to recover the marginal return from search in terms
   of price at the optimal stopping point for the average consumer. Our
   identification strategy and coefficient interpretation are valid for a
   broad class of search models, and we are hence able to remain agnostic
   about the details of the search process, such as search order and search
   protocol. We estimate an average return from search of $2.10 per minute
   and explore heterogeneity across consumer types, product categories, and
   category location in the store. We find little difference in the returns
   from search across product categories, but large differences across
   consumer types and locations. Our findings suggest that situational
   factors, such as the location of the category or the timing of the
   search within the shopping trip, are more important determinants of
   search behavior than category characteristics such as the number of
   available products.

AB Whereas the extant literature on entry-order effects establishes that
   first entrants often earn higher market shares ("market-share
   advantage"), the literature on distribution suggests that increased
   distribution has a positive effect on sales. Can distribution help us
   better understand entry-order effects on market shares? This paper
   examines how the first entrant in a geographical market achieves a
   market-share advantage through distribution. For this purpose, I propose
   a simple method of decomposing sales into physical distribution and
   sales performance. The data come from a manually collected panel on six
   major Japanese convenience-store chains from 47 geographical markets
   between 1991 and 2007. Using an instrumental variable approach to
   address the potential endogeneity of entry order, I find first entrants
   have a positive market-share advantage over later entrants.
   Specifically, the physical distribution, measured by the number of
   outlets in a market, drives most of the advantage. Meanwhile, the
   positive effect on sales performance for the first chain brand becomes
   nonexistent when I control for the outlet density. This paper further
   finds that the density of own outlets is nonmonotonically (inverted U)
   related to sales performance per outlet, suggesting dynamic outlet
   expansion faces a trade-off between the business-stealing effect in a
   chain ("cannibalization") and the advertising effect through repetition.

AB This paper examines firms' product policies when they sell an add-on
   (e.g., Internet service) in addition to a base product (e.g., hotel
   rooms) under vertical differentiation (e.g., four-versus three-star
   hotels). I show that the role of an add-on differs; higher-quality firms
   prefer to sell it as optional to discriminate consumers, and
   lower-quality firms trade off discrimination and differentiation, trying
   to lure consumers from higher-quality rivals with a lower-price add-on.
   Equilibrium policies of lower-quality firms are more sensitive to the
   cost-to-value ratio of an add-on. If the ratio is sufficiently small,
   then they sell it to all consumers, potentially explaining why lower-end
   hotels are more likely than higher-end ones to offer free Internet
   service. Contrary to consensus in the literature, optional add-ons can
   intensify price competition over consumers who trade off a
   higher-quality base product versus a lower-quality base including an
   add-on. Hence, higher-quality firms are incentivized to commit to
   bundling, while lower-quality firms prefer to commit to not selling it.
   Add-ons can further reduce lower-quality firms' profits if consumers
   cannot observe the prices, because holding up consumers ex post
   encourages them to switch to higher-quality rivals, which then become
   better off. Therefore, lower-quality firms are incentivized to advertise
   add-on prices, and higher-quality firms are not.

AB We use monthly sales of all wines, beer, and spirits sold between 2006
   and 2011 by Sweden's retail monopoly on alcohol to estimate the causal
   effect of retail distribution on market share by volume at the product
   level. Products are defined at the level of the stock-keeping unit. Two
   institutional features are key to identifying the causal effect: First,
   the monopolist uses four levels of retail distribution; a change in
   retail distribution is therefore associated with a discrete shift in the
   number of stores that carry a product in a given month. Second, the
   retailer is legally bound and monitored by the European Union to ensure
   that it acts in a non-discriminatory manner with all its suppliers.
   These features allow us to rule out many possible confounding factors in
   estimating the effect of distribution on sales volume. We find large and
   statistically significant effects from changes in retail distribution on
   market share by volume across all levels of retail distribution. The
   associated volume elasticity of retail distribution is convex; the wider
   the retail distribution the greater the marginal volume increase from
   further widening. In this market, wider distribution means reaching
   stores with successively smaller assortment. Our results indicate that
   the smaller assortment in smaller stores, coupled with a low resistance
   to compromise, is the main reason for the convex pattern. In other
   words, convexity appears to be generated by products achieving "a larger
   share of a smaller pie" as retail distribution expands.

   responses and its online reputation. We focus on the hotel industry and
   present several findings. First, hotels are likely to start responding
   following a negative shock to their ratings. Second, hotels respond to
   positive, negative, and neutral reviews at roughly the same rate. Third,
   by exploiting variation in the rate with which hotels respond on
   different review platforms and variation in the likelihood with which
   consumers are exposed to management responses, we find a 0.12-star
   increase in ratings and a 12% increase in review volume for responding
   hotels. Interestingly, when hotels start responding, they receive fewer
   but longer negative reviews. To explain this finding, we argue that
   unsatisfied consumers become less likely to leave short indefensible
   reviews when hotels are likely to scrutinize them. Our results highlight
   an interesting trade-off for managers considering responding: fewer
   negative ratings at the cost of longer and more detailed negative
   feedback.

AB We investigate in a competitive setting the consequences of mobile geo
   targeting, the practice of firms targeting consumers based on their
   real-time locations. A distinct market feature of mobile geo targeting
   is that a consumer could travel across different locations for an offer
   that maximizes his total utility. This mobile-deal seeking opportunity
   motivates firms to carefully balance prices across locations to avoid
   intrafirm cannibalization, which in turn mitigates interfirm price
   competition and prevents firms from going into a prisoner's dilemma. As
   a result, a firm's profit can be higher under mobile geo targeting than
   under uniform or traditional targeted pricing. We extend our model in
   three different directions: (a) a fraction of consumers are not aware of
   mobile offers outside of their permanent locations, (b) mobile offers
   can be collected when consumers travel for other reasons, and (c) firms
   use both permanent and real-time locations when setting prices. Our
   findings have important managerial implications for marketers who are
   interested in optimizing their mobile geo-targeting strategies.

AB Evidence shows that marketers can direct consumers' limited attention to

   asks: How should firms decide which attribute to make prominent in
   competitive environments? A key feature of this setting is that
   consumers' preferences are context-dependent and that a firm's choice of
   an attribute affects the evaluation of all products in the category. We
   develop a model in which firms selectively promote one of two attributes
   (e.g., image or performance) before competing in price. We find when
   consumers evaluate both attributes, perceived differentiation within an
   attribute can become diluted; we call this the dilution effect. This
   implies that making the same attribute prominent can arise in
   equilibrium. Only if there is a sufficient quality advantage in an
   attribute do we find equilibria with firms making different attributes
   prominent. We also show how the dilution effect can be a disincentive
   for investments in quality improvements.

   emphasized in the academic marketing science literature, including
   incorporation of consumer heterogeneity and state dependence into
   choice, and controls for the endogeneity of the firm's historical

   an approach that involves conducting estimation separately across fixed
   partitions of the score variable that targeting is based on, which may
   be useful in other behavioral targeting settings. The models are
   customized to facilitate casino operations and are implemented at the
   MGM Resorts International's group of companies. The framework is
   evaluated using a randomized trial implemented at MGM involving about
   1.5 million consumers. Using the new model produces about $1 million to

AB In 2008, New York City mandated that all chain restaurants post calorie
   information on their menus. For managers of chain and standalone
   restaurants, as well as for policy makers, a pertinent goal might be to
   monitor the impact of this regulation on consumer conversations. We
   propose a scalable Bayesian topic model to measure and understand
   changes in consumer opinion about health (and other topics). We
   calibrate the model on 761,962 online reviews of restaurants posted over
   eight years. Our model allows managers to specify prior topics of
   interest such as "health" for a calorie posting regulation. It also
   allows the distribution of topic proportions within a review to be
   affected by its length, valence, and the experience level of its author.
   Using a difference-in-differences estimation approach, we isolate the
   potentially causal effect of the regulation on consumer opinion.
   Following the regulation, there was a statistically small but
   significant increase in the proportion of discussion of the health
   topic. This increase can be attributed largely to authors who did not
   post reviews before the regulation, suggesting that the regulation
   prompted several consumers to discuss health in online restaurant
   reviews.

AB Inmany industries, product design andmanufacturing lead times are
   sufficiently long that both the quality level of a product and the
   amount of inventory produced must be determined before a firm knows what
   the actual demand will be. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical
   analysis of such a setting. We first consider a centralized channel and
   characterize the optimal decisions by establishing relationships that
   must hold between the elasticity of cost of quality and the elasticity
   of revenue and show that quality and inventory are strategic
   substitutes. Next, we consider a decentralized channel with a wholesale
   price contract, in which a manufacturer determines quality and wholesale
   price, while a retailer determines inventory and retail price. We find
   that, different from the case without endogenous inventory, product
   quality can be higher in a decentralized channel compared to a
   centralized channel, and this is because a wholesale price contract
   shields the manufacturer from inventory risk. For both centralized and
   decentralized channels, we find that as demand uncertainty increases,
   quality decreases, while, different from the case without endogenous
   quality, inventory can be U-shaped. Interestingly, to mitigate the
   impact of demand uncertainty on profit, quality can be a more effective
   lever than inventory in a centralized channel; however, in a
   decentralized channel, quality is less responsive and inventory is more
   responsive to demand uncertainty than in a centralized channel.

   product. This practice has been observed in a number of industries. In

   profitable pricing strategy relative to the conventional "pay as asked"
   pricing (PAAP) strategy. We show that PAYW has a number of advantages
   over PAAP such that it is well suited for some industries but not for
   others. These advantages are as follows: (1) PAYW helps a firm to
   maximally penetrate a market; (2) it allows a firm to price discriminate
   among heterogenous consumers; (3) it helps to moderate price
   competition. We derive conditions under which PAYW dominates PAAP and

AB A key conundrum facing organizations is how to adjust marketing budgets
   in response to the business cycle. While most firms use procyclical
   spending (spending less during economic contractions), academic studies
   often recommend countercyclical spending (spending more during
   contractions), which begs the following question: What is the right
   thing to do? The spending problem is compounded further when demand is
   not just driven by one country's business cycle, but by the
   (nonsynchronized) business cycles of multiple countries, as is the case
   for tourism marketing aiming to attract tourists originating from
   different countries. We derive insights into the best way to allocate
   marketing budgets across countries under varying economic conditions. We
   show that the allocation decisions are driven by the procyclical versus
   countercyclical nature of three factors: unit sales, marketing
   effectiveness, and per-unit profit contribution. To study how unit sales
   and marketing effectiveness respond to the business cycle, we develop a
   transfer function dynamic hierarchical linear model. We also model the
   responsiveness of the profit contribution to the business cycle. In an
   application to New Zealand tourism marketing, we find that a
   reallocation of the government's marketing budget could yield an
   increase in tourist revenues of NZD $121 million.

AB In developing countries, mobile telecom networks have emerged as major
   providers of financial services, bypassing the sparse retail networks of
   traditional banks. We analyze a large individual-level data set of
   mobile money transactions in Tanzania to provide evidence of the impact
   of mobile money on alleviating financial exclusion in developing
   countries. We identify three types of transactions: (i) money transfers
   to others, (ii) short-distance money self-transportation, and (iii)
   money storage for short to medium periods of time. We utilize a natural
   experiment of an unanticipated increase in transaction fees to identify
   the demand for these transactions. Using the demand estimates, we find
   that the willingness to pay to avoid walking with cash an extra
   kilometer (short-distance self-transportation) and to avoid storing
   money at home (money storage) for an extra day are 1.25% and 0.8% of an
   average transaction, respectively, which demonstrates that mobile money
   ameliorates significant amounts of crime-related risk. We explore the
   implications of these estimates for pricing and demonstrate the
   profitability of incentive-compatible price discrimination based on type
   of service, consumer location, and distance between transaction origin
   and destination. We show that differential pricing based on the features
   of a transaction delivers a Pareto improvement.

AB This study analyzes the impact of offline television advertising on
   multiple metrics of online chatter or user-generated content. The
   context is a quasi experiment in which a focal brand undertakes a
   massive advertising campaign for a short period of time. The authors
   estimate multiple dimensions of chatter (popularity, negativity,
   visibility, and virality) from numerous raw metrics using the content
   and the hyperlink structure of consumer reviews and blogs. The authors
   use the method of synthetic control to construct a counterfactual
   (synthetic) brand as a convex combination of the rivals during the
   preadvertising period. The gap in the dimensions of chatter between the
   focal brand and the synthetic brand in the test versus advertising
   periods assesses the influence of advertising. Offline television
   advertising causes a short but significant positive effect on online
   chatter. This effect is stronger on information-spread dimensions
   (visibility and virality) than on content-based dimensions (popularity
   and negativity). Importantly, advertising has a small short-term effect
   in decreasing negativity in online chatter.

AB Increased competition from the Internet has raised concerns about the
   quality of prescription drugs sold online. Given the pressure from the
   Department of Justice, Google agreed to ban pharmacies not certified by
   the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) from sponsored
   search listings. Using comScore click-through data originated from
   health-related queries, we study how the ban affects consumer search and
   click behavior in a difference-in-differences framework using the
   synthetic control method. We find that non-NABP-certified pharmacies
   received fewer clicks after the ban, and this effect is heterogeneous.
   In particular, pharmacies not certified by the NABP but certified by
   other sources (other-certified websites), experienced an increase in
   organic clicks that partially offset the loss in paid clicks after the
   ban. By contrast, pharmacies not certified by any certification agency
   experience much lower rates of substitution in organic clicks. These
   results suggest that the ban has increased the search cost for
   other-certified websites, but at least some consumers overcome the
   search cost by switching from sponsored to organic links. The lower
   substitution for uncertified websites may be explained by the rising
   consumer concerns about the quality of drugs sold on uncertified
   websites after the ban.

AB Multichannel retailing has created several new strategic choices for
   retailers. With respect to pricing, an important decision is whether to
   offer a "self-matching policy," which allows a multichannel retailer to
   offer the lowest of its online and store prices to consumers. In
   practice, we observe considerable heterogeneity in self-matching
   policies: There are retailers who offer to self-match and retailers who
   explicitly state that they will not match prices across channels. Using
   a game-theoretic model, we investigate the strategic forces behind the
   adoption (or non-adoption) of self-matching across a range of
   competitive scenarios, including a monopolist, two competing
   multichannel retailers, as well as a mixed duopoly. Though self-matching
   can negatively impact a retailer when consumers pay the lower price, we
   uncover two novel mechanisms that can make self-matching profitable in a
   duopoly setting. Specifically, self-matching can dampen competition
   online and enable price discrimination in-store. Its effectiveness in
   these respects depends on the decision-making stage of consumers and the
   heterogeneity of their preference for the online versus store channels.
   Surprisingly, self-matching strategies can also be profitable when
   consumers use "smart" devices to discover online prices in stores. Our
   findings provide insights for managers on how and when self-matching can
   be an effective pricing strategy.

AB In the pharmaceutical industry, a product recall financially impacts not
   only the firm undertaking the recall but also other competitors in the
   category since it affects physician and consumer perception of the
   category as a whole. Often, such competitors have to engage in defensive
   marketing at the category level without complete certainty about whether
   a recall will occur or not. Such defensive effort could then lead to a
   change in postrecall sales effort directed at capturing market share in
   that category. This decision is affected by the probability of the
   recall and the size of the loyal segment in the category facing the
   recall, i.e., physicians who will continue to prescribe the category
   even without marketing effort. We focus on competitor reaction to
   product recalls where the competitor participates in multiple product
   categories that exhibit (dis) economies of scope in sales effort across
   them. Equilibrium analysis of our game-theoretic model uncovers several
   managerial insights that illustrate the importance of scale (dis)
   economies on the competitor's promotional strategy in the wake of a
   recall. First, economies of scope across the two products leads to
   either an increase or decrease in postrecall sales effort for both
   products simultaneously depending on the loyal market size for the
   category. Second, diseconomies of scope can lead to a complete
   withdrawal of postrecall sales effort from one of the two products
   depending on the size of the loyal market, the cross-category price, and
   the recall probability. Third, as the recall probability increases,
   category-defense effort and postrecall sales effort are unequivocally
   complementary given economies of scope across the two products but may
   be substitutes given diseconomies of scope.

AB With the cooperation of a large mobile service provider, we conduct a
   novel field experiment that simultaneously randomizes the prices of two
   competing movie theaters using mobile coupons. Unlike studies that vary
   only one firm's prices, our experiment allows us to account for
   competitor response. We test mobile targeting based on consumers'
   real-time and historic locations, allowing us to evaluate popular mobile
   coupon strategies in a competitive market. The experiment reveals
   substantial profit gains from mobile discounts during an off-peak
   period. Both firms could create incremental profits by targeting their
   competitor's location. However, the returns to such "geoconquesting" are
   reduced when the competitor also launches its own targeting campaign. We
   combine our experimentally generated data with a demand model to analyze
   optimal pricing in a static Bertrand-Nash equilibrium. Interestingly,
   competitive responses raise the profitability of behavioral targeting
   where symmetric pricing incentives soften price competition. By
   contrast, competitive responses lower the profitability of geographic
   targeting, where asymmetric pricing incentives toughen price
   competition. If we endogenize targeting choice, both firms would choose
   behavioral targeting in equilibrium, even though more granular
   geobehavioral targeting combining both real-time and historic locations
   is possible. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering
   competitor response when piloting novel price-targeting mechanisms.

AB As Internet advertising infomediaries nowadays provide rich competition
   information, sponsored search advertisers are becoming more strategic
   when selecting keywords. This paper empirically examines the spillover
   effects in advertisers' keyword market entry decisions, that is, how an
   advertiser's likelihood of using a keyword is affected by competitors'
   keyword entry decisions. We develop a structural model to characterize
   advertisers' keyword market entry decisions. We apply the model to a
   panel data set of 1,252 laptop-related keywords mainly used by 28
   manufacturers, retailers, and comparison websites that advertise on
   Google. Our analysis leads to several interesting findings. First, an
   advertiser's expected position affects the nature of the competition. In
   particular, the spillover effect from below-ranked competitors is always
   positive, while the spillover effect from above-ranked competitors is
   either positive or negative. Second, the spillover effect from
   above-ranked ads is directionally affected by firms' product-line
   characteristics: the effect among firms offering homogenous products
   (e.g., comparison sites) is negative, whereas the effect among firms
   with more differentiated products (e.g., manufacturers and retailers) is
   positive. Third, the spillover effect from above-ranked ads is
   directionally affected by firms' positions in a distribution channel:
   the effect from upstream (downstream) on downstream (upstream) firms
   tends to be negative (positive). Finally, a downstream firm is more
   likely to learn new keywords from an upstream firm but not vice versa.
   Our counterfactual simulations demonstrate that the keyword-specific
   competition information provided by infomediaries can improve the search
   engine's revenue by about 5.7%.

AB In this paper, I introduce a framework of price promotions by firms that
   preschedule their sale dates. I set up a dynamic model of demand
   accumulation in which high-and low-valuation consumers enter the market
   every period. The high-valuation consumers buy immediately and leave the
   market; the low-valuation consumers accumulate while waiting for the
   sale price. The firms schedule the dates of their promotions in advance.
   I find that often they use mixed strategies, choosing the future
   promotion period according to a probability distribution function. If
   the firms can cancel their prescheduled sales, typically they can wait
   longer until holding sales by shifting the probability distribution
   towards later periods. Scheduling promotions in advance increases the
   firms' profits in comparison to the case when the promotion decision is
   made in the period when the promotion is offered.

   to highlight the core contribution and maximize readability and impact.
   The section will encourage competition among authors for publishing
   timely and contemporaneously relevant research-undervalued attributes in
   traditional contribution evaluation-on topics with high impact
   potential. In exchange, it will accept papers that make major
   contributions on one "primary" dimension (methodological, modeling or
   substantive), with more relaxed thresholds on the non-primary dimensions
   compared to traditional top journals, and offer faster reviews and time
   to print. Authors benefit from the promise of first-mover impact
   rewards, while the field benefits from faster entry and a larger volume
   of novel, timely and relevant ideas. The section will have a distinct
   editorial structure and a one round conditional accept/out review
   process. The editorial elaborates on the purpose of the section, its

   consumers' listening histories across many digital music platforms,
   adoption of streaming leads to very large increases in the quantity and
   diversity of consumption in the first months after adoption. Although
   the effects attenuate over time, even after half a year, adopters play
   substantially more, and more diverse, music. Relative to music
   ownership, where experimentation is expensive, adoption of streaming
   increases new music discovery. While repeat listening to new music
   decreases, users' best discoveries have higher play rates. We discuss
   the implications for consumers and producers of music.

AB We measure the causal effects of income and wealth on the demand for
   private-label products. Prior research suggests that these effects are
   large and, in particular, that private-label demand rises during
   recessions. Our empirical analysis is based on a comprehensive
   household-level transactions database matched with price information
   from store-level scanner data andwealth data based on local house value
   indices. The Great Recession provides a key source of the variation in
   our data, showing a large and geographically diverse impact on household
   incomes over time. We estimate income and wealth effects using "within"
   variation of income, at the household level, andwealth, at the zip code
   level. Our estimates can be interpreted as income and wealth effects
   consistent with a consumer demand model based on utility maximization.
   We establish a precisely measured negative effect of income on
   private-label shares. The effect of wealth is negative but not precisely
   measured. However, the estimated effect sizes are small, by contrast to
   prior academic work and industry views. An examination of the possible
   supply-side response to the recession shows only small changes in the
   relative price of national-brand and private-label products. Our
   estimates also reveal a large positive trend in private-label shares
   that predates the Great Recession. We examine some possible factors
   underlying this trend, but find no evidence that it is systematically
   related to specific private-label quality tiers or to the overall rate
   of private-label versus national-brand product introductions.

AB We investigate the increasingly common business setting in which
   companies face the possibility of both observed and unobserved customer
   attrition (i.e., "overt" and "silent" churn) in the same pool of
   customers. This is the case for many online-based services where
   customers have the choice to stop interacting with the firm either by
   formally terminating the relationship (e.g., canceling their account) or
   by simply ignoring all communications coming from the firm. The standard
   contractual versus noncontractual categorization of customer-firm
   relationships does not apply in such hybrid settings, which means the
   standard models for analyzing customer attrition do not apply. We
   propose a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to capture silent
   and overt churn. We apply our modeling framework to two different
   contexts-a daily deal website and a performing arts organization. In
   contrast to previous studies that have not separated the two types of
   churn, we find that overt churners in these hybrid settings tend to
   interact more, rather than less, with the firm prior to churning; that
   is, in settings where both types of churn are present, a high level of
   activity-such as customers actively opening emails received from the
   firm-is not necessarily a good indicator of future engagement; rather it
   is associated with higher risk of overt churn. We also identify a large
   number of "silent churners" in both empirical applications-customers who
   disengage with the company very early on, rarely exhibit any type of
   activity, and almost never churn overtly. Furthermore, we show how the
   two types of churners respond very differently to the firm's
   communications, implying that a common retention strategy for proactive
   churn management is not appropriate in these hybrid settings.

AB We explore the effects of television advertising in the setting of the
   National Football League's Super Bowl telecast. The Super Bowl is well
   suited for evaluating advertising because viewers pay attention to the
   ads, more than 40% of households watch the game, and variation in ad
   exposures is exogenous because a brand cannot choose how many
   impressions it receives in each market. Viewership is primarily
   determined based on local preferences for watching the two competing
   teams. We combine Super Bowl ratings data with weekly sales data in the
   beer and soda categories to document three primary findings about
   advertising. First, the relationship between Super Bowl viewership and
   sales in the week leading up to the game reveals the brands customers
   buy to consume during the game. We find some brands are consumed while
   watching the game while others are not, but this is unrelated to whether
   a brand ever advertised during the Super Bowl or advertises in a
   specific year. This rejects the theory that advertising works by serving
   as a complement to brand consumption. Second, we find that post-Super
   Bowl sales effects of ad viewership are concentrated in weeks with
   subsequent sporting events. This suggests Super Bowl advertising builds
   a complementarity between the brand and sports viewership more broadly.
   Finally, we collect data on National Collegiate Athletic Association
   basketball tournament viewership to test this theory and find that the
   complementarity between a brand's sales and viewership of the tournament
   is enhanced by Super Bowl ad viewership. Together, these findings
   identify advertising as a determinant of why some brands
   outperformothers for particular consumption occasions such as sports
   viewership.

AB Between 2006 and 2011, daily print newspapers in the United States lost
   20% of their paid subscribers, partly because of the increasing
   availability of alternative sources of news, such as free content
   provided on newspaper websites and by news aggregators such as Yahoo.
   However, contrary to the expectation that firms respond to softening
   demand by lowering prices, newspapers increased subscription prices by
   40%-60% during this period. In this paper, we explain and quantify the
   factors responsible for these price increases. We calibrate models of
   readership and advertising demand using data from a top-50 U.S. regional
   print newspaper. Conditional on these demand models, we calibrate the
   newspaper's optimal pricing equations and assess whether the increases
   in subscription prices are mainly rationalized by (a) the decline in
   overall reader willingness to pay (WTP) in the presence of heterogeneity
   among subscribers, which rendered it optimal for the newspaper to focus
   on the high WTP readers, or (b) the newspaper's reduced incentive to
   subsidize readers at the expense of advertisers, because of softening
   demand for newspaper advertising. We find that the decline in the
   ability of the newspaper to subsidize readers by extracting surplus from
   advertisers explains most of the increase in subscription prices. Of the
   three available subscription options (daily, weekend, and Sunday only),
   subscription prices increased more steeply for the daily option, a
   pattern consistent with the view that newspapers are driving away low
   valuation weekday readers while preserving Sunday readership and the
   corresponding ad revenues. Thus, our research augments theoretical
   propositions in two-sided markets by providing a formal empirical
   approach to unraveling the relative importance of the roles played by
   agents on the subsidy and demand sides in determining prices.

AB Microentrepreneurs in emerging markets often rely on informal lenders
   for their routine borrowing needs. This paper investigates informal
   lenders' and microentre-preneurs' incentives to participate in a
   lender-borrower relationship in a market in which repayments are neither
   law protected nor asset secured. We consider a borrower who seeks a
   short-term loan, invests in a project, and repays in full using her
   project earnings if the project is successful. If the project fails, the
   borrower uses her outside option to repay over a period of time. The
   analysis uncovers an interesting effect of the borrower's outside option
   on the loan rate offered by the lender-the loan rate first increases and
   then decreases with the borrower's outside option. An important policy
   implication is that an increase in the outside options of the poor
   microentrepreneurs might actually reduce their surplus. Finally, we find
   that lenders in emerging markets may be more likely to engage in
   informal lending compared to those in developed or poorer markets.

AB This paper develops a new rationale for decentralization in distribution
   channels: providing a one-stop comparison shopping experience for
   consumers. In our duopoly model, when consumers are knowledgeable about
   their brand preferences, each manufacturer would distribute through its
   own vertically integrated retail outlets only. When some consumers are
   unsure about their brand preferences, however, it may be optimal for one
   of the manufacturers to also distribute through its competitor's
   outlets. The resulting equilibrium has several interesting properties.
   First, only one of the manufacturers chooses to add competitor-outlet
   distribution, not both-even when the manufacturers are symmetric.
   Second, the manufacturer distributing through its competitor's outlets
   also distributes through its own outlets, i.e., its distribution
   strategy is a hybrid strategy, combining vertical integration and
   decentralization. Third, when the manufacturers' brands are asymmetric,
   it is the weaker brand that has a stronger incentive to pursue hybrid
   distribution. Fourth, the competitor's outlets in question welcome the
   new brand, even when no consumer would actually buy the new brand-a case
   of pure showrooming. These results highlight the linkages between
   distribution strategy, shopping efficiency, and retail formats. Shopping
   costs and consumers' uncertainty about their own brand preferences
   create a demand for multibrand retailing, and in pursuing this demand,
   manufacturers may eschew the efficiency advantages of vertical
   integration in favor of hybrid distribution. However, the fact that only
   one of the manufacturers chooses to do so suggests that this strategy
   also has weaknesses, which we discuss in the paper.

AB We develop a flexible methodology to protect marketing data in the
   context of a business ecosystem in which data providers seek to meet the
   information needs of data users, but wish to deter invalid use of the
   data by potential intruders. In this context we propose a Bayesian
   probability model that produces protected synthetic data. A key feature
   of our proposed method is that the data provider can balance the
   trade-off between information loss resulting from data protection and
   risk of disclosure to intruders. We apply our methodology to the problem
   facing a vendor of retail point-of-sale data whose customers use the
   data to estimate price elasticities and promotion effects. At the same
   time, the data provider wishes to protect the identities of sample
   stores from possible intrusion. We define metrics to measure the average
   and maximum loss of protection implied by a data protection method. We
   show that, by enabling the data provider to choose the degree of
   protection to infuse into the synthetic data, our method performs well
   relative to seven benchmark data protection methods, including the
   extant approach of aggregating data across stores.

AB In the digital economy, influencing and controlling the spread of
   information is a key concern for firms. One way firms try to achieve
   this is to target firm communications to consumers who embrace and
   propagate the spread of new information on emerging and "trending"
   topics on social media. However, little is known about whether early
   trend propagators are indeed responsive to firm-sponsored messages. To
   explore whether early propagators of trending topics respond to
   advertising messages, we use data from two field tests conducted by a
   charity and an emerging fashion firm on the microblogging service
   Twitter. On Twitter, "promoted tweets" allow advertisers to target
   individuals based on the content of their recent postings. Twitter
   continuously identifies in real time which topics are newly popular
   among Twitter users. In the field tests, we collaborated with a charity
   and a fashion firm to target ads at consumers who embraced a Twitter
   trend early in its life cycle by posting about it, and compared their
   behavior to that of consumers who posted about the same topic later on.
   Throughout both field tests, we consistently find that early propagators
   of trends are less responsive to advertising than consumers who embrace
   trends later.

AB On search keywords with trademarked terms, the brand owner ("focal
   brand") and other relevant firms compete for consumers. For the focal
   brand, paid clicks have a direct substitute in the organic links below
   the paid ad(s). The proximity of this substitute depends on whether
   competing firms are aggressively bidding to siphon off traffic. We study
   the returns to focal brands and competitors using large-scale
   experiments on Bing with data from thousands of brands. When no
   competitors are present, we find a positive, statistically significant
   impact of brand ads of 1%-4%, with larger brands having a smaller causal
   effect. In this case, the effective "cost per incremental click" is
   significantly higher than what focal brands typically pay on other
   keywords. When the focal brand ad is present, competitors in paid
   positions 2-4 can "steal" 1%-5% of the focal brand's clicks and raise
   its costs by shifting traffic to the paid link. Finally, for a set of
   brands that face competition on their brand search but choose not to
   advertise, competitors "steal" 18%-42% of clicks, suggesting a strong
   causal effect of position. Under such position effects, we find the
   return on investment on defensive advertising to be strongly positive.

AB Marketing managers are responsible for understanding and predicting
   customer purchasing activity. This task is complicated by a lack of
   knowledge of all of the calendar time events that influence purchase
   timing. Yet, isolating calendar time variability from the natural ebb
   and flow of purchasing is important for accurately assessing the
   influence of calendar time shocks to the spending process, and for
   uncovering the customer-level purchasing patterns that robustly predict
   future spending. A comprehensive understanding of purchasing dynamics
   therefore requires a model that flexibly integrates known and unknown
   calendar time determinants of purchasing with individual-level
   predictors such as interpurchase time, customer lifetime, and number of
   past purchases. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric
   framework based on Gaussian process priors, which integrates these two
   sets of predictors by modeling both through latent functions that
   jointly determine purchase propensity. The estimates of these latent
   functions yield a visual representation of purchasing dynamics, which we
   call the model-based dashboard, that provides a nuanced decomposition of
   spending patterns. We show the utility of this framework through an
   application to purchasing in free-to-play mobile video games. Moreover,
   we show that in forecasting future spending, our model outperforms
   existing benchmarks.

AB In collaboration with three companies selling a diverse set of products,
   we conducted randomized field experiments in which experimentally
   tailored email ads were sent to millions of individuals. We found
   consistently that personalizing the emails by adding consumer-specific
   information (e.g., recipient's name) benefited the advertisers.
   Importantly, such content is not likely to be informative about the
   advertised product or the company. In our main experiment, we found that
   adding the name of the message recipient to the email's subject line
   increased the probability of the recipient opening it by 20% (from 9.05%
   to 10.80%), which translated to an increase in sales' leads by 31% (from
   0.39% to 0.51%) and a reduction in the number of individuals
   unsubscribing from the email campaign by 17% (from 1.2% to 1.0%). We
   present similar experiments conducted with other companies, which show
   that the effects we document extend from objectives ranging from
   acquiring new customers to retaining customers who have purchased from
   the company in the past. Our investigation of several possible
   mechanisms suggests that such content increases the effort consumers
   make in processing the other content in the rest of the advertising
   message. Our paper quantifies the benefits from personalization and
   sheds light on the role of noninformative advertising content by
   analyzing several detailed measures of recipient's interaction with the
   message. It provides external validity to psychological mechanisms and
   has clear implications for the firms that are designing their
   advertising campaigns.

AB Marketing researchers and practitioners are interested in targeting
   individuals in social networks who may have disproportionately higher
   levels of influence over others in their network. While the extant
   literature suggests individual characteristics or network position as
   proxies for relative influence, our study bridges these two streams by
   investigating the endogenous acquisition of network position as a
   function of exogenous individual characteristics. Specifically, do those
   with higher expertise achieve higher influence when people endogenously
   choose those to whom they listen? Using an agent-based modeling
   simulation framework, we model the dynamics of two types of individuals,
   i.e., independents with exogenous information and imitators. Over the
   course of multiple diffusions, agents choose whom to "listen to" for
   information; dropping less useful ties and adding new ones. We find that
   independents can have less influence (out-degree) than imitators who
   collect information from multiple sources. Furthermore, this effect is
   exacerbated by homophily. Noise in communication channels, on the other
   hand, moderates these effects, yet can increase penetration rates. We
   show that our results are robust to alternative dynamic network
   structures. Our research suggests that marketers should consider the
   environment, community characteristics, communication medium, and
   product domains when assessing the relative influence of individuals.

AB Consumer preferences change through time and firms must adjust their
   product positioning for their products to continue to be appealing to
   consumers. These changes in product positioning require fixed
   investments such that firms reposition only occasionally. I construct a
   model that can include predictable and unpredictable consumer preference
   changes, and where a firm optimally repositions its product given the
   current market conditions, and expected future repositionings. When
   unpredictable consumer preferences evolve away from a current firm's
   positioning, the decision to reposition is like exercising an option to
   be closer to current consumer preferences, or waiting to reposition
   later or for those preferences to return so as to be closer to the
   firm's current position. We characterize this optimal repositioning
   strategy, how it depends on the discount factor, variance of
   preferences, and repositioning costs. I compare the optimal policy of
   the firm with what could be optimal from a social welfare point of view,
   and find that the firm repositions more frequently than is efficient
   when there is full market coverage. With predictable changes in consumer
   preferences, the optimal repositioning strategy involves overshooting
   and asymmetric repositioning thresholds.

AB Firms often learn about their own capabilities through their products'
   successes and failures. This paper explores the interaction between
   learning about capabilities and product strategy in a formal model. We
   consider a firm that can launch a sequence of products, where each
   product's success probability depends on the fit between the firm's
   capabilities and the product. A successful new product always causes the
   firm to become more optimistic about the capability most relevant for
   that product; however, it can also cause the firm to become less
   optimistic about some of its other capabilities, including capabilities
   the new product does not use. The firm's optimal forward-looking product
   strategy accounts for short-run expected profits as well as for the
   information value of learning for future decisions. We find that a
   product sharing few or even no capabilities with potential future
   products can have a greater information value than a product that shares
   more capabilities with future products and that learning about
   capabilities can affect the optimal sequence of product launch
   decisions.

AB With behavior-based pricing (BBP), firms use customers' purchase history
   data to price discriminate between past and new customers. Prior

   investigate BBP in a channel setting in which manufacturers sell to
   customers through exclusive retailers. We examine how channel members'
   adoption of BBP affects wholesale and retail prices, profits, consumer
   surplus, and social welfare. We find that BBP decreases channel members'
   profits when retailers use BBP and manufacturers use uniform pricing.
   However, BBP increases channel members' profits when manufacturers and
   retailers use BBP. In addition, BBP by retailers alone increases
   consumer surplus, whereas BBP by manufacturers and retailers decreases
   consumer surplus. When manufacturers also use BBP, BBP decreases social
   welfare to a greater degree than when only retailers use BBP.
   Furthermore, when manufacturers cannot use BBP, their profits are higher
   with long-term wholesale price contracts. When manufacturers can use
   BBP, short-term wholesale price contracts yield higher profits for
   manufacturers and retailers.

AB Political advertising is controversial, as there is widespread concern
   about money from political action committees (PACs and super PACs)
   distorting the democratic process. Studying advertising effectiveness
   is, however, a challenging topic for several reasons, including the
   endogenous nature of fundraising and ad spending rates. However, the
   extensive use of targeting based on designated marketing areas (DMAs)
   creates a setting in which neighboring counties with comparable
   demographics receive different levels of advertising exposure. In this
   paper, we leverage these advertising discontinuities along DMA borders
   to study the relative effectiveness of political advertising on vote
   shares and turnout rates in 2010 and 2012 senatorial elections. We find
   that negative advertising sponsored by PACs is significantly less
   effective than that sponsored by candidates in affecting two-party vote
   shares and voter turnout. A 1% increase in negative advertising by the
   candidate produces a significant 0.015% lift in the candidate's
   unconditional vote shares. By contrast, negative advertising from PACs
   is ineffective in increasing its supported candidate's unconditional
   vote share. Further analysis reveals that the competitiveness of races
   moderates the effectiveness of political advertising, providing
   implications for those managing candidates' campaigns, PACs, and super
   PACs.

   meaning and functionality. Based on this premise, we investigate whether
   the economic rise of emerging markets may have begun to impact the
   typical one-size-fits-all design of many international product
   categories. Focusing on Hollywood films, and exploiting a recent
   relaxation of China's foreign film importation policy, we provide
   evidence suggesting that these impacts may exist and be nonnegligible.
   In particular, we show that the Chinese society's aesthetic preference
   for lighter skin can be linked to the more frequent casting of
   pale-skinned stars in films targeting the Chinese market. Implications
   for the design of international products are drawn.

AB When a firm introduces a radical innovation, consumers are unaware of
   the product's uses and benefits. Moreover, consumers are unsure of
   whether they even need the product. In this situation, we consider the
   role of marketing communication as generating consumers' need
   recognition and thus market demand for a novel product. In particular,
   we model marketing communication as a two-sided process that involves
   both firms' and consumers' costly efforts to transmit and assimilate a
   novel product concept. When the marketing communication takes on a
   two-sided process, we study a firm's different information disclosure
   strategies for its radical innovation. We find that sharing innovation,
   instead of extracting a higher rent by keeping the idea secret, can be
   optimal. A firm may benefit from the presence of a competitor and its
   communication effort. The innovator can share its innovation so that
   competitors can also benefit, which encourages rivals to enter the
   market. The presence of such competition guarantees a higher surplus for
   consumers, which can induce greater consumer effort in a two-sided
   communication process. Moreover, the increased consumer effort, in turn,
   prompts complementarity in the communication process and lessens the
   potential free-riding effect in communication between firms.
   Additionally, it encourages the rival firm to exert more effort,
   especially when the role of consumers becomes more important. Sharing
   innovation with a rival serves as a mechanism to induce more efforts in
   a two-sided communication process.

AB Many pharmaceutical companies use overt anti-counterfeiting technologies
   (OACTs), such as holograms, to fight counterfeiters. An OACT is
   typically implemented on the drug packaging, which makes it difficult
   for counterfeiters to produce convincing copies and easy for patients to
   tell the difference between authentic and counterfeit medicines. I
   consider a model in which an authentic firm sells its drug at a reliable
   source and counterfeiters and illegitimate genuine sellers sell their
   drugs at a dubious source. The authentic firm chooses an OACT to combat
   counterfeiters. I show that there may be an inverted U-shaped
   relationship between the complexity of the OACT and the magnitude of
   counterfeit medicine purchases. The nature of this relationship is a
   consequence of an OACT engendering two opposing effects. On one hand,
   adopting an OACT imposes an entry cost on counterfeiters, causing fewer
   counterfeiters to enter the dubious source; as a result, the drugs at
   this source have a greater chance of being genuine (a counterfeiters'
   entry-dampening effect). On the other hand, more patients head to this
   dubious source rather than the reliable source owing to the increased
   chance of obtaining a genuine drug (a patients' demand-enhancing
   effect). When the selected OACT is sufficiently complex to replicate,
   the former effect overrides the latter and thus the problem of
   counterfeit purchasing is relieved. However, when the OACT is not
   adequately sophisticated, the latter effect more than offsets the
   former. This leads to an anti-counterfeiting trap: the use of a
   rudimentary OACT may beget more counterfeit purchases. This result
   offers an understanding to the phenomenon that despite enormous spending
   on the upgrading of OACTs in recent years, annual global sales of
   counterfeit drugs have actually risen. I also find that using an OACT
   may result in higher prices for both counterfeit and authentic drugs.
   Furthermore, I demonstrate that, at the optimum, an authentic firm may
   find it more profitable to employ a mediocre OACT, whereas it may not
   use any OACTs if its price is regulated.

AB We ask whether online opinions impact consumers' decision quality and
   assess whether this impact occurs immediately or requires one to undergo
   learning first. We focus on a setting where consumers have multiple
   learning experiences using opinions from both uni- and bidirectional
   network ties. This allows us to investigate the impact of learning from
   both weak and strong ties. We find that, with sufficient experience,
   having more ties may lead to better decisions. However, the dynamic
   effects are dependent on the strength of the tie. Additional strong ties
   (operationalized as bidirectional links) lead to immediate positive
   effects on decision quality. However, additional weak ties
   (unidirectional, follower relationships) initially lead to lower
   decision quality. We find beneficial learning effects, however: adding
   more weak ties improves decision quality once one has sufficient
   experience in the community. Indeed, more-experienced consumers receive,
   ultimately, higher positive effects on decision quality from weak ties
   compared with strong ties. We interpret this as demonstrating that one
   needs to learn the norms of a new community before using the available
   information to improve decisions.

AB Facing purchase choice involving ambiguity in product quality, consumers
   behave in a boundedly rational manner. Consumers also exhibit varying
   degrees of predisposition toward a product. We present a simple model of
   boundedly rational choice under ambiguity. The model's key feature is
   that it captures the interaction between predisposition and ambiguity.
   We build on the choice model to derive demand curves and the unique
   equilibrium market outcomes (regarding prices, profits, and market
   shares) under duopolistic competition. In equilibrium, market shares are
   proportional to prices. In symmetric competition, higher equilibrium
   prices obtain when the ambiguity in product quality is high or when the
   customer base is partisan. For vertically differentiated products, the
   strategy of a higher-quality firm to marginally reduce ambiguity depends
   on the ambiguity level inherent in the product-market environment. The
   presence of informed customers may increase the equilibrium prices and
   profits of both firms. An understanding of the predisposition-ambiguity
   interaction may improve the firm's information and brand management
   strategy.

AB In a product market where consumers are open to uninformed purchases, we
   study competition between a traditional and an online retailer in the
   presence of showrooming. Several results are obtained. First,
   showrooming intensifies competition and lowers both firms' profits, thus
   supporting traditional and online retailers' recent strategy of carrying
   more exclusive varieties. Second, lowering consumer search costs may
   aggravate showrooming and decrease the traditional retailer's profits
   for intermediate search costs. Third, opening an online store expands
   the demand of the traditional retailer but intensifies competition, thus
   lowering its profits under certain conditions. Fourth, a return policy
   by the online retailer alleviates showrooming and relaxes competition
   but weakly reduces its demand, increasing its profits only for
   intermediate search costs. The return policy (weakly) increases the
   traditional retailer's profits. Fifth, when search cost is not high
   enough, price matching by the traditional retailer may also intensify
   competition and hurt its profits. We then examine how webrooming
   interacts with showrooming. When webrooming resolves partial match
   uncertainty, it may increase both firms' profits by inducing more

AB Accounting-based approximations of Tobin's q (AATQ) are increasingly
   popular in marketing. AATQ differ from Tobin's original conception in
   that they use accounting data to assess the replacement cost of a firm's
   assets; the core problem with this is that valuable assets go unrecorded
   in external reports, including systematic underrecording of market-based
   assets. This research examines the extensive erroneous claims made about
   AATQ in marketing studies. We note the widespread use of the metrics and
   demonstrate that the AATQ used in marketing (1) are not comparable
   across industries, (2) do not use only tangible assets in their
   denominator, and (3) should not find equilibrium at 1. AATQ are often
   described as performance metrics and can respond appropriately to
   certain types of positive performance. Unfortunately, they also respond
   positively to performance-neutral strategic choices. Furthermore,
   whenever AATQ exceed 1, as is typical, they increase even with
   completely wasted investments. We note that AATQ are especially
   problematic measures of performance for marketers because they are
   biased toward reporting that investments in market-based assets (e.g.,
   brand equity and customer satisfaction) are effective. The misuse of
   AATQ we document suggests the need for marketing scholars to pay greater
   attention to the theoretical underpinnings of their metrics.

AB The interplay between innovation and the stock market has been
   extensively studied by scholars across all business disciplines.
   However, one phenomenon remains understudied: the association between
   innovation and stock market bubbles. Bubbles-defined as rapid increases
   and subsequent declines in stock prices-have been primarily examined by
   economists who generally do not focus on individual characteristics of
   innovations or on the consequences of bubbles for their parent firms. We
   set out to fill this gap in our paper. Using a sample of 51 major
   innovations introduced between 1825 and 2000, we test for bubbles in the
   stock prices of parent firms subsequent to the commercialization of
   these innovations. We identify bubbles in 73% of the cases. The
   magnitude of these bubbles increases with the radicalness of
   innovations, with their potential to generate indirect network effects,
   and with their public visibility at the time of commercialization.
   Moreover, we find that parent firms typically raise new equity capital
   during bubble periods and that the amount of equity raised is
   proportional to the magnitude of the bubble. Finally, we show that the
   buy-and-hold abnormal returns of parent firms are significantly positive
   between the beginning and the end of the bubble, suggesting that these
   innovations add value to their firm and to the economy, in spite of the
   bubble. Our findings have important implications for managers interested
   in commercializing innovations and for policy makers concerned with the
   stability of the financial system.

AB Online search intermediaries, such as Amazon or Expedia, use rankings
   (ordered lists) to present third-party sellers' products to consumers.
   These rankings decrease consumer search costs and increase the
   probability of a match with a seller, ultimately increasing consumer
   welfare. Constructing relevant rankings requires understanding their
   causal effect on consumer choices. However, this is challenging because
   rankings are endogenous: consumers pay more attention to highly ranked
   products, and intermediaries rank the most relevant products at the top.
   In this paper, I use the first data set with experimental variation in
   the ranking from a field experiment at Expedia to make three
   contributions. First, I identify the causal effect of rankings and show
   that they affect what consumers search, but conditional on search, do
   not affect purchases. Second, I quantify the effect of rankings using a
   sequential search model and find an average position effect of $1.92,
   which is lower than literature estimates obtained without experimental
   variation. I also use model predictions, data patterns, and a feature of
   the data set (opaque offers) to show rankings lower search costs,
   instead of affecting consumer expectations or utility. Finally, I show a
   utility-based ranking built on this model's estimates benefits consumers
   and the search intermediary.

AB Display advertising is a major source of revenue for many online
   publishers and content providers. Historically, display advertising
   impressions have been sold through prenegotiated contracts, known as
   reservation contracts, between publishers and advertisers. In recent
   years, a growing number of impressions are being sold in real-time
   bidding (RTB), where advertisers bid for impressions in real time, as
   consumers visit publishers' websites. RTB allows advertisers to target
   consumers at an individual level using browser cookie information, and
   enables them to customize their ads for each individual. The rapid
   growth of RTB has created new challenges for advertisers and publishers
   on how much budget and ad inventory to allocate to RTB. In this paper,
   we use a game theory model with two advertisers and a publisher to study
   the effects of RTB on advertisers' and publishers' strategies and their
   profits. We show that symmetric advertisers use asymmetric strategies
   where one advertiser buys all of his impressions in RTB, whereas the
   other advertiser focuses on reservation contracts. Interestingly, we
   find that while both advertisers benefit from the existence of RTB, the
   advertiser that focuses on reservation contracts benefits more than the
   advertiser that focuses on RTB. We show that while RTB lowers the
   equilibrium price of impressions in reservation contracts, it increases
   the publisher's total revenue. Despite many analysts' belief that,
   because of being more efficient, RTB will replace reservation contracts
   in the future, we show that publishers have to sell a sufficiently large
   fraction of their impressions in reservation contracts to maximize their
   revenue. We extend our model to consider premium consumers, publisher's
   uncertainty about the number of future visitors, and effectiveness of ad
   customization.

AB Despite the common practice of multiple standards in the high-technology
   product industry, there is a lack of knowledge on how compatibility
   between base products and add-ons affects consumer purchase decisions at
   the brand and/or standard level. We recognize the existence of
   compatibility constraints and develop a dynamic model in which a
   consumer makes periodic purchase decisions on whether to adopt/replace a
   base and/or an add-on product under the expectation of future price,
   quality, and compatibility. Dynamic and interactive inventory effects
   are included by allowing consumers to account for the long-term
   financial implications when planning to switch to a base product that is
   incompatible with their inventory of add-ons. Applying the model to the
   consumer purchase history of digital cameras and memory cards from 1998
   to 2004, we demonstrate that the inventory of add-ons significantly
   affects the purchase of base products. This "lock-in" effect is enhanced
   when future prices of add-ons increase. Interestingly, it is more costly
   for consumers to switch from Sony to other brands than vice versa. In
   two policy simulations, we explore the impact of alternative
   compatibility policies. For example, if Sony had not created its
   proprietary Memory Stick, the market share of its cameras would have
   been reduced by 6 percentage points. This result provides important
   insights that leading brands and early movers should implement a
   proprietary standard.

AB The rising obesity epidemic is a worldwide concern for consumers, firms,
   and policy makers. One reason for the rise in obesity is consumers'
   over-consumption of vice goods such as cookies, crackers, and soft
   drinks. Some authors have suggested that firms have incentives to make
   vice goods unhealthier and to encourage over-consumption. There are
   calls for regulations to ensure that firms make such products healthier
   by reducing harmful ingredients and provide nutritional information.
   Furthermore, public policy makers have begun to educate consumers to
   avoid over-consumption by using strategies such as pre-purchase
   planning. In this paper, we investigate how firms selling vice goods
   should respond to the growing concerns about obesity. We analyze how
   firms should adjust prices and product design to cater to consumers with
   self-control problems and obesity concerns. We use the literature on
   hyperbolic discounting to model consumers with self-control problems. In
   this framework, we examine how the unhealthiness of vice goods affects
   prices, firm's profits, consumer surplus, and public health. In
   addition, we study how public policy efforts to encourage pre-purchase
   planning impact firm's profits and consumers. Our results show that
   unlike standard goods, for vice goods a decrease in quality (i.e.,
   increase in unhealthiness) and an increase in price can serve as a
   self-control device and increase demand. Therefore, firms sometimes can
   charge higher prices and make more profits by producing unhealthier
   products. Interestingly, producing unhealthier products can sometimes
   increase consumer surplus and improve public health. We also show that
   as the proportion of consumers who use pre-purchase planning increases,
   firms should respond by raising prices. In such situations, consumer
   surplus and public health improve but firm's profits decline. These
   results have important implications for restaurants and firms that sell
   vice goods and for public policy makers who aim to combat obesity.

AB This paper proposes a method that makes use of firms' mass store
   closures to measure the store network effects of cannibalization and
   density economies. I calculate each store's contribution to chain-level
   profits via one-store perturbations on the set of retained stores, and
   map these onto the firm's closure choices. To separate the demand and
   supply-side store network effects, I exploit the fact that the
   business-stealing effect intensifies with local network density, whereas
   the supply-side disadvantage prevails at sparse regions of the network.
   I apply the method to study the Starbucks chain. The average rate of
   cannibalization imposed by a neighbor outlet is 1.2% within one mile and
   0.4% within one to three miles. For remote outlets, operation costs
   increase by 0.3% of revenues for each mile of distance from the network.
   Counterfactual analyses suggest that income level is a more important
   determinant of demand than population count at low levels of store
   penetration, whereas high-population regions can sustain denser store
   networks because of the softening of the cannibalization effect.

AB We develop a hierarchical choice model to account for the choice utility
   heterogeneity of individual shoppers that belong to the same household.
   Our model allows us to measure how much variability in purchase behavior
   exists among individuals in a household, and to compare this to the
   variability that exists across households. Because of the presence of
   multiple shoppers from the same household, we also extend the concept of
   household-level state dependence to consider state dependence at the
   individual level. We apply our model to five different grocery
   categories. We find that the intrahousehold heterogeneity in estimated
   brand intercepts and (to a lesser extent) price sensitivities is about
   20%-30% of the interhousehold heterogeneity in these parameters.
   However, with promotion sensitivities, we find intrahousehold
   heterogeneity, in most cases, to be as large as interhousehold
   heterogeneity. Our state dependence results show that past brands
   purchased by an individual have a much stronger influence on subsequent
   purchases than those purchased by anyone in the household. We use our
   estimated utility parameters to compare the expected profitability of
   promotions targeted at the individual rather than at the household and
   find substantial (more than 50%) improvements in the incremental revenue
   of supermarket promotions.

   demand realizations) under the quota policy. The variance in profits for
   the reseller is, however, higher under the partial-refund policy. We
   explain the source of profit variations by comparing it across different
   channel structures (centralized and decentralized). Next, we formally
   extend the model to include a disutility associated with profit
   variation and show that when the manufacturer has a variation-induced
   disutility, the partial-refund contract should be used, as it is the
   dominating contract. Similarly, when the retailer has a
   variation-induced disutility, the quota contract should be used. This is
   consistent with the pattern of profit variations in the risk-neutral
   case where the manufacturer has lower variation with the partial-refund
   contract while the reseller has lower variation with the quota contract.
   Finally, our analysis also shows how the manufacturer may employ a
   combination policy to better manage its own profit variation while
   providing adequate overstocking protection for the reseller.

AB Many sellers bundle add-ons (e.g., in-flight entertainment, hotel
   amenities) with core services (e.g., transportation, lodging). One
   surprising empirical finding is that consumers often believe bundle
   frames provide greater value than equivalent unbundle frames ($10 > $9 +
   $1) despite equal all-inclusive prices. Although these context or
   framing effects appear irrational in isolation, the bundle-framing
   effect might reflect market relationships caused by underlying seller
   motives. We show that bundling can signal information about product
   appeal, that is, popularity. Specifically, only sellers of wide-appeal
   (popular) add-ons (e.g., well-liked entertainment, sought-after hotel
   amenities, standard side salads, popular excursions) have an incentive
   to bundle their add-ons with their core products (e.g., flights, hotel
   rooms, restaurant entrees, cruise trips). By contrast, sellers of
   narrow-appeal (niche) add-ons (e.g., unorthodox entertainment, unpopular
   amenities, exotic side salads, unusual excursions) find that bundling is
   undesirable because they lose core revenue. Consequently, bundling can
   convey information about horizontally differentiated markets even when
   the total all-inclusive price equals that of unbundling. Perhaps some
   presumed consumer biases can reveal market relationships. Frames provide
   information about the framer.

AB We examine the effect of managerial response on consumer voice in a
   dynamic quality environment. We argue that the consumer is motivated to
   write reviews not only because reviews may impact other consumers, but
   because reviews may impact the management and the quality of the
   service. We examine this empirically in a scenario in which reviewers
   receive a credible signal that the service provider is listening.
   Specifically, we examine the "managerial response" feature allowed by
   many review platforms. We hypothesize that managerial responses will
   stimulate reviewing activity and, in particular, will stimulate negative
   reviews that are seen as more impactful. This effect is further
   heightened because managers respond more and in more detail to negative
   reviews. Using a multiple-differences specification, we show that
   reviewing activity and particularly negative reviewing is indeed
   stimulated by managerial response. Our specification exploits comparison
   of the same hotel immediately before and after response initiation and
   compares a given hotel's reviewing activity on sites with review
   response initiation to that on sites that do not allow managerial
   response. We also explore the mechanism behind the effect using an
   online experiment.

AB This paper investigates a manufacturer's ability to influence compliance
   rates among its authorized online retailers by exploiting changes in the
   minimum advertised price (MAP) policy and in dealer agreements. MAP is a
   pricing policy widely used by manufacturers to influence prices set by
   their downstream partners. A MAP policy imposes a lower bound on
   advertised prices, subjecting violating retailers to punishments such as
   termination of distribution agreements. Despite this threat, violations
   are common. I uncover two key elements to improve compliance:
   customization to the online environment and credible monitoring and
   punishments. I analyze the pricing, enforcement, and channel management
   policies of a manufacturer over several years. During this period, new
   channel policies take effect, providing a quasi-experiment. The new
   policies lead to substantially fewer violations. With improved
   compliance, channel prices increase by 2% without loss in volume. The
   reduction in violations is particularly stark among authorized retailers
   with lower sales volume, those that previously operated unapproved
   websites, and those that have received violation notifications for the
   specific product before. Moreover, low service providers improve their
   service. At the same time, there is an increase in opportunistic
   behavior among top retailers, or retailers that received notifications
   for other products, and for less popular products via deep discounting.

AB We consider a persuasion setting in which the sender of a message tries
   to elicit a desired action from a receiver by means of a compelling
   argument. To understand which arguments may indeed be compelling, the
   sender can use information about the receiver's preferences prior to the
   communication stage. We find that when the sender's motives are
   transparent to the receiver, communication is influential only if the
   sender is not well informed about the receiver's preferences. The sender
   prefers an interior level of information quality, whereas the receiver
   prefers complete privacy unless disclosure is necessary to induce
   communication. We also find that the parties may fail to trade at
   intermediate communication cost levels. In other cases, the content and
   cost of communication can affect market outcomes simultaneously.
   Finally, in general, the sender's first-best outcome involves pooling
   with unattractive sender types: the sender prefers to stay relatively
   guarded about which aspects he is knowledgeable about in order to hinder
   the receiver's discernment when topics he does not master are touched
   on. Our results are discussed in the contexts of matching markets,

AB We quantify the effect of consumers' price uncertainty on gasoline
   prices and margins on an Italian highway. We observe the change in
   prices triggered by a longitudinal policy-based change in consumers'
   price information from one in which drivers on the highway have no
   information on the prices of stations they encounter to one that allows
   consumers to observe the prices of four upcoming stations on a single
   price sign by the side of the highway. Using these data, we estimate a
   model of consumer search and purchase behavior and a corresponding model
   of gas station pricing. We then measure the impact of varying degrees of
   price information on equilibrium prices, including (i) no price
   information, (ii) the current policy, and (iii) full price information.
   We also compare the current policy with an alternative policy in which
   stations' prices are advertised with individual price signs. We find
   that when consumers do not have price information, gas stations are able
   to charge 31% more, in terms of higher price-cost margins, than when
   prices are known. Our welfare analysis suggests that price information
   is worth (sic)0.57 to consumers every time they take the highway.
   Relative to the current mandatory policy, advertising price on
   individual signs is worth (sic)0.19 more to consumers.

AB Online advertisers often utilize multiple publishers to deliver ads to
   multi-homing consumers. These ads often generate externalities and their
   exposure is uncertain, impacting advertising effectiveness across
   publishers. We analyze the inefficiencies created by externalities and
   uncertainty when information is symmetric between advertisers and
   publishers, in contrast to most previous research that assumes
   information asymmetry. Although these inefficiencies cannot be resolved
   through publisher-side actions, attribution methods that measure
   campaign uncertainty can serve as alternative solutions to help
   advertisers adjust their strategies. Attribution creates a virtual
   competition between publishers, resulting in a team compensation
   problem. The equilibrium may potentially increase the aggressiveness of
   advertiser bidding, leading to increased advertiser profits. The popular
   last-touch method is shown to overincentivize ad exposures, often
   resulting in lower advertiser profits. The Shapley value achieves an
   increase in profits compared with the last-touch method. Popular
   publishers and those that appear early in the conversion funnel benefit
   the most from advertisers using last-touch attribution. The increase in
   advertiser profits comes at the expense of total publisher profits and
   often results in decreased ad allocation efficiency. We also find that
   the prices paid in the market will decrease when more sophisticated
   attribution methods are adopted.

   with a major telecommunications provider to design, deploy, and analyze
   the outcomes of a randomized control trial at the household level to
   evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy. A random subset of likely
   churners were selected to be called by the firm. We also randomly
   selected whether their friends would be called. We find that listing
   likely churners to be called reduced their propensity to churn by 1.9
   percentage points from a baseline of 17.2%. When their friends were also
   listed to be called, their likelihood of churn reduced an additional 1.3
   percentage points. The client lifetime value of likely churners
   increased 2.1% with traditional proactive churn management, and this
   statistic becomes 6.4% when their friends were also listed to be called
   by the firm. We show that, in our setting, likely churners receive a

   discuss how this signal may trigger mechanisms akin to both financial
   comparisons and conformity that may explain our findings.

   approximately three-month period along with user review data from
   Amazon. com. Our estimation accounts for confounding factors in the
   effects of online word-of-mouth measures via the use of instrumental
   variables. There are several key insights. Overall, we find that
   bottom-ranked reviewers have a greater effect on sales than top-ranked
   reviewers. Top-ranked reviewers can be opinion leaders, but their
   influence is largely limited to special cases like very new products or
   products with high variance in existing reviews. Additional analysis
   reveals that the differences in the influence of top-and bottom-ranked
   reviewers is driven by both what they write (content) and who they are
   (identity). The results are robust across multiple product categories

AB In 2012, consumers paid $32 billion in overdraft fees, representing the
   single largest source of revenue for banks fromdemand deposit accounts
   during this period. Owing to consumer attrition caused by overdraft fees
   and potential government regulations to reform these fees, financial
   institutions have become motivated to investigate their overdraft fee
   structures. Banks need to balance the revenue generated from overdraft
   fees with consumer dissatisfaction and potential churn caused by these
   fees. However, no empirical research has been conducted to explain
   consumer responses to overdraft fees or to evaluate alternative pricing
   strategies associated with these fees. In this research, we propose a
   dynamic structural model with consumer monitoring costs and
   dissatisfaction associated with overdraft fees. We apply the model to an
   enterprise-level data set of more than 500,000 accounts with a history
   of 450 days, providing a total of 200 million transactions. We find that
   consumers heavily discount the future and potentially overdraw because
   of impulsive spending. However, we also find that highmonitoring costs
   hinder consumers' effort to track their balance accurately;
   consequently, consumers may overdraw because of rational inattention.
   The large data set is necessary because of the infrequent nature of
   overdrafts; however, it also engenders computational challenges, which
   we address by using parallel computing techniques. Our policy
   simulations show that alternative pricing strategies may increase bank
   revenue and improve consumer welfare. Fixed bill schedules and overdraft
   waiver programs may also enhance social welfare. This paper explains
   consumer responses to overdraft fees and evaluates alternative pricing
   strategies associated with these fees.

   we estimate using aggregate data from the single-serve coffee system
   industry. We use the parameter estimates to quantify the impact of
   licensing on equilibrium prices and profits for firms in the industry.
   In particular, we look at the decision to allow other firms to sell
   components (coffee pods) that are compatible with a firm's primary good
   (coffee machines) by licensing the use of its patents. We solve for the
   counterfactual market equilibrium in which one of the market leaders
   enters a licensing agreement with one of the competitor brands-with the
   latter brand only selling compatible coffee pods and not the machines.
   We show the existence of a range of royalty rates under which firms
   could potentially reach a beneficial licensing agreement. In addition,
   we find that the relationship between the licensee's profits and the
   royalty rate is not always decreasing. Finally, we find that, within the
   set of royalty rates in which licensing benefits both brands, the
   licensing agreement is associated with less price dispersion in the
   aftermarket (coffee pods), and with lower prices of the primary good
   (coffee machines) relative to the nonlicensing scenario.

AB How does a health club or credit counseling service market itself when
   its consumer becomes demotivated after a minor slipup? To examine this
   issue, we utilize a self-signaling model that accounts for the complex
   process in which a resolution seeker manages his self-control
   perceptions. Specifically, we employ a planner-doer model wherein a
   consumer oscillates between long-term resolution planning and short-term
   implementation: during each implementation juncture, the consumer must
   determine whether to lapse or use the program as planned, a decision
   that affects his self-control perceptions in subsequent periods of
   long-term resolution planning. Using this framework, we derive many
   significant marketing insights for self-improvement programs, products
   which assist the pursuit of long-term resolutions. First, we demonstrate
   that the seller tailors its contract strategy because of self-signaling,
   the process whereby the decision maker manages his self-control
   perceptions. Furthermore, we determine that the seller's program
   contract depends on the level of noise in self-signaling: when the
   consumer's program-use decisions reveal his general level of
   self-restraint, the seller imposes relatively high per-usage rates; on
   the other hand, the firm levies lowusage fees when implementation
   decisions depend on short-term fluctuations in self-control.
   Additionally, we examine program quality as a strategic decision. We
   determine that the firm offers additional frills when self-signaling is
   noisy and provides minimal benefits when self-signaling is more
   informative. Finally, we analyze program length as a marketing strategy
   and show that lengthy contracts transpire when usage decisions do not
   sufficiently reveal self-control.

   million in 2008 to 396 million in 2016. All the firms in this market
   offer consumers an option of purchasing either an individual plan or a
   family plan. Whereas a menu of individual plans can be thought of as a
   means to segment the market, the theoretical challenge is to understand
   how a firm stands to benefit from adding family plans to its product
   mix. In this paper, we use a game-theoretic framework to explore the
   role of family plans. Interestingly, we find that even when a family
   plan does not draw in any new consumers, a firm can still benefit from
   offering these plans. This occurs primarily because a family plan
   enables the firm to price discriminate more effectively. In particular,
   because some consumers can bundle themselves and join a family plan, the
   firm is able to charge a higher price to single high-valuation
   consumerswho are unable to be part of a family. Furthermore, the
   presence of a family plan can have a negative impact on the plan offered
   to single low-valuation consumers who now have to pay a higher overage
   price. We also show that not all family plans are profitable and that
   the profitability depends on the sizes of different types of families.

AB A recent development in online advertising has been the ability of
   advertisers to have their ads displayed exclusively on (a part of) a web
   page. We study this phenomenon in the context of both sponsored search
   advertising and display advertising. Ads are sold through auctions, and
   when exclusivity is allowed, the seller accepts two bids from
   advertisers, where one bid is for the standard display format in which
   multiple advertisers are displayed, and the other bid is for being shown
   exclusively (therefore they are called two-dimensional, or 2D,
   auctions). We identify two opposing forces at play in an auction that
   provides the exclusive placement option-allowing more flexible
   expression of preferences through bidding for exclusivity increases
   competition among advertisers, leading to higher bids, which increases
   the seller's revenue (between-advertiser competition effect), but it
   also gives advertisers the incentive to shade their bids for their
   nonpreferred outcomes, which decreases the seller's revenue
   (within-advertiser competition effect). Depending on which effect is
   stronger, the revenue may increase or decrease. We find that the 2D
   generalized second price (GSP2D) auction, which is an extension of the
   widely used generalized second price (GSP) auction and on which
   currently used auctions for exclusive placement are based, may lead to
   higher or lower revenue under different parametric conditions.
   Paradoxically, the revenue from allowing exclusive placement decreases
   as bidders have higher valuations for exclusive placement. We verify
   several key implications from our analysis of GSP2D using data from Bing
   for over 100,000 auctions. As a possible solution (applicable to both
   sponsored search and display advertising), we show that using VCG2D,
   which is the adaptation of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction for
   the 2D setting, guarantees weakly higher revenue when exclusive display
   is allowed. This is because it induces truthful bidding, which
   alleviates the problem of bid shading due to the within-advertiser
   competition effect.

AB Internet recommender systems are popular in contexts that include
   heterogeneous consumers and numerous products. In such contexts, product
   features that adequately describe all the products are often not readily
   available. Content-based systems therefore rely on user-generated
   content such as product reviews or textual product tags to make
   recommendations. In this paper, we develop a novel covariate-guided,
   heterogeneous supervised topic model that uses product covariates, user
   ratings, and product tags to succinctly characterize products in terms
   of latent topics and specifies consumer preferences via these topics.
   Recommendation contexts also generate big-data problems stemming from
   data volume, variety, and veracity, as in our setting, which includes
   massive textual and numerical data. We therefore develop a novel
   stochastic variational Bayesian framework to achieve fast, scalable, and
   accurate estimation in such big-data settings and apply it to a
   MovieLens data set of movie ratings and semantic tags. We show that our
   model yields interesting insights about movie preferences and makes much
   better predictions than a benchmark model that uses only product
   covariates. We show how our model can be used to target recommendations
   to particular users and illustrate its use in generating personalized
   search rankings of relevant products.

AB Individual demand for consumer packaged goods shows discrete jumps
   between zero and large quantities, under a marginal change in price.
   Ruling out multiple alternative explanations, this paper provides
   evidence from microdata in the yogurt category that these jumps are
   caused by consumer fixed purchasing costs per product. We formulate and
   estimate a model in which (1) such fixed costs limit the number of
   different products considered and (2) consumers use prices to screen a
   product in and out of their consideration set. Our structural estimation
   finds that the consumer incurs fixed costs of $0.81 to consider a
   product. These costs are increased by 280% if she has not purchased the
   product for a year and are decreased by 59% when the product is featured
   in the store; the dependence of fixed costs on information shifters
   suggests that these costs are incurred because of consideration.
   Consideration being scarce at the shelf, firms compete fiercely for
   customers: We simulate counterfactual markups in a world full of feature
   advertising and find that firms enjoy higher equilibrium markups because
   the provision of information softens competition for consideration.

AB I develop a simple dynamic oligopoly model for empirical work. A unique
   feature of the model is that any Markov-perfect equilibrium that
   survives some intuitive refinements can be quickly computed from
   low-dimensional contraction mappings in seconds. After computation, it
   is easy to check the uniqueness of the refined equilibrium. These
   results facilitate fast estimation using a full-solution approach and
   produce reliable counterfactual analysis. Model estimation at its
   minimum only requires panel data on firm presence, yet it quantifies
   important market primitives, such as toughness of competition and entry
   costs. I provide a step-by-step illustration of the estimation approach
   by applying it to the Dutch retail grocery industry, in which chain
   stores slowly replace local stores. A counterfactual simulation
   computing equilibrium under a large number of different primitive values
   shows that relaxing restrictions on chain-store entry will not only
   quicken the destruction of local stores, but also hurt chain stores'
   profits.

AB Firms traditionally rely on interviews and focus groups to identify
   customer needs for marketing strategy and product development.
   User-generated content (UGC) is a promising alternative source for
   identifying customer needs. However, established methods are neither
   efficient nor effective for large UGC corpora because much content is
   noninformative or repetitive. We propose a machine-learning approach to
   facilitate qualitative analysis by selecting content for efficient
   review. We use a convolutional neural network to filter out
   noninformative content and cluster dense sentence embeddings to avoid
   sampling repetitive content. We further address two key questions: Are
   UGC-based customer needs comparable to interview-based customer needs?
   Do the machine-learning methods improve customer-need identification?
   These comparisons are enabled by a custom data set of customer needs for
   oral care products identified by professional analysts using
   industry-standard experiential interviews. The analysts also coded
   12,000 UGC sentences to identify which previously identified customer
   needs and/or new customer needs were articulated in each sentence. We
   show that (1) UGC is at least as valuable as a source of customer needs
   for product development, likely more valuable, compared with
   conventional methods, and (2) machine-learning methods improve
   efficiency of identifying customer needs from UGC (unique customer needs
   per unit of professional services cost).

AB Usage-based insurance (UBI) is a recent auto insurance innovation that
   enables insurers to collect individual-level driving data, provide
   feedback on driving performance, and offer individually targeted price
   discounts based on each consumer's driving behavior. Using individual
   driving behavior (from sensor data) and other information for UBI
   adopters, we estimate the relationship from being enrolled and monitored
   (for up to 26 weeks) in the UBI program and changes in the driving
   behavior of UBI customers. The key results of our analysis show that
   after UBI adoption, the UBI users improve the safety of their driving,
   providing a meaningful benefit for the individual driver, the insurer,
   and society as a whole. While UBI customers decrease their daily average
   hard-brake frequency by an average of 21% after six months, their
   mileage driven does not decrease comparing week 26 to week 1. We also
   find heterogeneous effects across different demographic groups. For
   example, younger drivers improve their UBI scores more than older
   drivers after UBI adoption, and females show more improvement than
   males. Furthermore, we find evidence that negative feedback and economic
   incentives correlate with greater improvement in driving behavior. Our
   results suggest that by sharing private consumer information with the
   insurer, UBI can benefit consumers who become better drivers, as well as
   the entire society from improved road safety.

AB Channel coordination in search advertising is an important but
   complicated managerial decision for both manufacturers and retailers.
   Because of the highly concentrated market of search advertising, a
   manufacturer's and its retailers' ads can compete instead of
   complementing each other. We consider a manufacturer, who coordinates
   with its retailers by sharing a fixed percentage of each retailer's
   advertising cost and, at the same time, competes with its retailers and
   outside advertisers in search ad position auctions. Our model prescribes
   the optimal cooperative advertising strategies from the manufacturer's
   perspective. We find that different from cooperative advertising in
   traditional media, it can be optimal for a manufacturer to cooperate
   with only a subset of its retailers even if they are ex ante the same.
   This reflects the manufacturer's trade-off between higher demand and
   higher bidding cost caused by more intense competition. We also find
   that with two asymmetric retailers, the manufacturer should support the
   retailer with higher channel profit per click to get a higher position
   than the other retailer, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the
   participation-rate mechanism. The manufacturer should take a higher
   position than a retailer when its profit per click via direct sales
   exceeds the channel profit per click of the retailer. The main results
   still hold when we endogenize retail price competition or wholesale
   contracts.

AB Despite the growth of online retail, the majority of products are still
   sold offline, and the "touch-and-feel" aspect of physically examining a
   product before purchase remains important to many consumers. In this
   paper, we demonstrate that large discrepancies can exist between how
   consumers evaluate products when examining them "live" versus based on
   online descriptions, even for a relatively familiar product (messenger
   bags) and for utilitarian features. Therefore, the use of online
   evaluations in market research may result in inaccurate predictions and
   potentially suboptimal decisions by the firm. Because eliciting
   preferences by conducting large-scale offline market research is costly,
   we propose fusing data from a large online study with data from a
   smaller set of participants who complete both an online and an offline
   study. We demonstrate our approach using conjoint studies on two sets of
   participants. The group who completed both online and offline studies
   allows us to calibrate the relationship between online and offline
   partworths. To obtain reliable parameter estimates, we propose two
   statistical methods: a hierarchical Bayesian approach and a
   k-nearest-neighbors approach. We demonstrate that the proposed approach
   achieves better out-of-sample predictive performance on individual
   choices (up to 25% improvement), as well as aggregate market shares (up
   to 33% improvement).

AB We analyze multimarket interactions between firms that must invest
   limited budgets in value (surplus) creation and in competitive
   rent-seeking activities. Firms are horizontally differentiated on a line
   segment and compete for multiple markets and prizes that differ in the
   relative effectiveness of each firm's competitive rent-seeking spending.
   Each firm faces a dual trade-off: First, they must choose how much to
   invest in value creation versus how much to spend in rent-seeking
   competition. Second, they must decide on how to allocate resources
   across the different markets. When the market values are exogenous (and
   identical across markets), the intensity of competition is highest for
   the market in the middle, rather than in (advantaged) markets that are
   close or in (disadvantaged) markets that are closer to the rival.
   Counter to what one would expect, greater firm differentiation actually
   intensifies the competition in the middle markets. When firms
   endogenously invest in value creation, they invest more in value
   creation in closer markets and the investments decline toward the
   middle. This results in the most intense competition moving away from
   the middle to a market in each firm's turf. The analysis also provides a
   competitive perspective on the home-turf bias phenomenon.

AB Despite its immense popularity, the freemium business model remains a
   complex strategy to master and often a topic of heated debate. Adopting
   a generalized version of the screening framework, we ask when and why a
   firm should endogenously offer a zero price on its low-end product when
   users' product usages generate network externalities on each other. In
   the standard screening framework without network effects, freemium never
   emerges as optimal, and the firm always chooses the efficient price
   point for its low-end product. We show that even with network effects,
   freemium is typically not optimal. When network effects are identical
   across products ("symmetric"), the firm has greater incentive to expand
   its network size and may find it profitable to sell to the low-end
   customers. However, this does not lead to freemium as an equilibrium
   strategy. Instead, the firm should offer a low-end product to attract
   customers, while keeping its price positive. Freemium can only emerge if
   the high- and low-end products provide different levels of
   ("asymmetric") marginal network effects. In other words, the firm would
   set a zero price for its low-end product only if the high-end product
   provided larger utility gain from an expansion of the firm's user base.
   In contrast to conventional beliefs, a firm pursuing the freemium
   strategy might increase the baseline quality on its low-end product
   above the "efficient" level, which seemingly reduces differentiation.

AB Consumers may incur deliberation costs in learning about their
   valuations for new products. When the deliberation cost is not trivial,
   the retailer may set a low price to inhibit deliberation (regressive
   pricing) or choose a high price to induce deliberation (transgressive
   pricing). In a decentralized channel, we find that, first, the retailer
   is more likely to adopt the regressive pricing (versus transgressive
   pricing) when the wholesale price is lower. In response, the
   manufacturer sets a high (low) wholesale price to induce the
   transgressive (regressive) pricing when the deliberation cost is
   intermediate (high). Second, channel members can be misaligned in the
   incentive in investing in consumer empowerment. The ability to empower
   consumers and reduce their deliberation costs enhances the retailer's
   channel power and its share of channel profit. Finally, the manufacturer
   may offer a socially suboptimal product quality because a high quality
   can lead to excessive deliberation. These nontrivial effects of the
   deliberation cost underscore the importance of considering consumer
   deliberations in channel management. The insights are robust under a
   positive production cost, heterogeneous deliberation costs, continuous
   deliberation efforts, and a channel structure with multiple layers.

AB Measuring the causal effects of digital advertising remains challenging
   despite the availability of granular data. Unobservable factors make
   exposure endogenous, and advertising's effect on outcomes tends to be
   small. In principle, these concerns could be addressed using randomized
   controlled trials (RCTs). In practice, few online ad campaigns rely on
   RCTs and instead use observational methods to estimate ad effects. We
   assess empirically whether the variation in data typically available in
   the advertising industry enables observational methods to recover the
   causal effects of online advertising. Using data from 15 U.S.
   advertising experiments at Facebook comprising 500 million
   user-experiment observations and 1.6 billion ad impressions, we contrast
   the experimental results to those obtained from multiple observational
   models. The observational methods often fail to produce the same effects
   as the randomized experiments, even after conditioning on extensive
   demographic and behavioral variables. In our setting, advances in causal
   inference methods do not allow us to isolate the exogenous variation
   needed to estimate the treatment effects. We also characterize the
   incremental explanatory power our data would require to enable
   observational methods to successfully measure advertising effects. Our
   findings suggest that commonly used observational approaches based on
   the data usually available in the industry often fail to accurately
   measure the true effect of advertising.

AB Pricing managers at online retailers face a unique challenge. They must
   decide on real-time prices for a large number of products with
   incomplete demand information. The manager runs price experiments to
   learn about each product's demand curve and the profitmaximizing price.
   In practice, balanced field price experiments can create high
   opportunity costs, because a large number of customers are presented
   with suboptimal prices. In this paper, we propose an alternative dynamic
   price experimentation policy. The proposed approach extends multiarmed
   bandit (MAB) algorithms from statistical machine learning to include
   microeconomic choice theory. Our automated pricing policy solves this
   MAB problem using a scalable distribution-free algorithm. We prove
   analytically that our method is asymptotically optimal for any weakly
   downward sloping demand curve. In a series of Monte Carlo simulations,
   we show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared with
   balanced field experiments and standard methods in dynamic pricing from
   computer science. In a calibrated simulation based on an existing
   pricing field experiment, we find that our algorithm can increase
   profits by 43% during the month of testing and 4% annually.

AB Understanding the effects of contextual tactors is crucial in designing
   context-based marketing. This paper focuses on product recommendations
   and studies how time and crowd pressures two prominent contextual
   effects in the consumer behavior literature-can impact the effectiveness
   of recommendations. Measuring these effects is not straightforward
   because the joint distribution of consumer choice, time, and crowd
   pressures is rarely observed outside the laboratory and recommendations
   are often endogenously determined. We overcome these issues using data
   from an experiment conducted with vending machines in railway stations
   across Tokyo. The machines are equipped with a facial recognition system
   to make recommendations, and recommendations are changed exogenously in
   the experiment. This setup provides us with well-measured variables of
   the time and crowd pressures that affect the effectiveness of
   recommendations. After showing that recommendations increase the sales
   of both the recommended and nonrecommended products, we show that time
   pressures moderate the effectiveness of product recommendations for both
   recommended products directly and nonrecommended products indirectly.
   Crowd pressures weaken the direct effect on the recommended products,
   although its impact on the nonrecommended products is small and not
   robust in some cases. These results indicate that, when marketers make
   context-based recommendations, they should be mindful of the consumers
   under time pressure.

AB Television viewers are increasingly engaging in media-multitasking while
   watching programming. One prevalent multiscreen activity is the
   simultaneous consumption of television alongside social media chatter
   about the programming, an activity referred to as "social TV." Although
   online interactions with programming can result in a more engaged and
   committed audience, social TV activities may distract media
   multi-taskers from advertisements. These competing outcomes of social TV
   raise the question: are programs with high online social TV activity, so
   called "social shows," good for advertisers? In this research, we
   empirically examine this question by exploring the relationship among
   television advertising, social TV, online traffic, and online sales.
   Specifically, we investigate how the volume of program-related online
   chatter is related to online shopping behavior at retailers that
   advertise during the programs. We find that advertisements that air in
   programs with more social TV activity see increased ad responsiveness in
   terms of subsequent online shopping behavior. This result varies with
   the mood of the advertisement, with more affective advertisements-in
   particular, funny and emotional advertisements-seeing the largest
   increases in online shopping activity. Our results shed light on how
   advertisers can encourage online shopping activity on their websites in
   the age of multiscreen consumers.

AB When financially distressed firms have overwhelming debts, a prominent
   option for survival is to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We
   empirically study the effect of Chrysler's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing
   on the quantity sold by its competitors in the U.S. auto industry. The
   demand for competitors could increase because they may benefit from the
   distress of the bankrupt firm (competitive effect). By contrast,
   competitors could experience lower sales if the bankruptcy increases
   consumer uncertainty about their own viability (contagion effect). A
   challenge to measuring the impact of bankruptcies is the coincident
   decline in economic conditions stemming from the Great Recession and the
   potential effect of the "cash for clunkers" program (among other
   confounding factors). To identify the effect of the bankruptcy filing,
   we employ a regression-discontinuity-in-time design based on a temporal
   discontinuity in treatment (i.e., bankruptcy filing), along with an
   extensive set of control variables. Such a design is facilitated by a
   unique data set at the dealer-model-day level that allows us to compare
   changes in unit sales in close temporal vicinity of the filing. We find
   that unit sales for an average competitor decrease by 28% following
   Chrysler's bankruptcy filing. Several types of evidence suggest that
   this negative demand spillover effect is driven by a heightened consumer
   uncertainty about the viability of the bankrupt firm's rivals. For
   example, we show that the sales of competitors' vehicles that compete
   within the same segments as the bankrupt firm's vehicles or that provide
   lower value for money are affected more negatively in response to the
   Chrysler filing. We also observe more web search activity for Chrysler's
   competitors after the filing. Our findings are robust to different
   estimation strategies (global versus local), different functional forms,
   different estimation windows, the inclusion of various controls (e.g.,
   "cash for clunkers," incentives, advertising, inventory, recalls, price,
   and consumer confidence), the donut regression discontinuity approach, a
   potential serial correlation issue, a falsification exercise, and the
   inclusion of differential trends at various levels. Our study aims to
   inform policymakers and managers about unintended short-term demand
   consequences of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

AB Previous research demonstrates that stacked discounts increase retail
   revenue. For instance, a retailer should sell more products by offering
   "20% off, plus an extra 25% off" than by offering an economically
   equivalent single discount of "40% off." We conduct multimethodology
   research to investigate a potential downside of offering stacked
   discounts: Can stacked discounts disproportionately increase retailer
   costs from product returns? We incorporate insights from prior
   behavioral work and develop an analytical model to generate predictions
   about how stacked discounts affect retail sales and return performance.
   Next, we conduct a laboratory experiment to provide evidence for our
   theory in a controlled environment. Subsequently, we empirically test
   our predictions under real market conditions using six-year
   transactional data from promotional events at a national jewelry
   retailer. Finally, drawing upon the empirical estimates, we conduct a
   numerical study to assess the impact of stacked discounts on retail
   profitability. Our analytical model and the empirical results identify
   the inherent tradeoffs associated with stacked discounts and demonstrate
   the cost structures under which stacked discounts will decrease firm
   profitability despite an increase in initial sales. We conclude by
   discussing implications for retailers in assessing the impact of how
   they frame their price discounts.

   optimize advertising campaigns for new product launches based on lessons
   learned from an ex post analysis of prior campaigns. The tool builds on
   a distinct data collection approach combined with econometric modeling
   to produce advertising elasticities, which is the key information in the
   media mix optimization. The approach was implemented at Mercedes-Benz
   and applied to four major new car launches in Germany in 2012 and 2013.
   It revealed estimated savings of 15%-30% or EUR 2 million per campaign

AB The entry of flexible-capacity sharing economy platforms (e.g., Airbnb
   and Uber) has potentially changed the competitive landscape in
   traditional industries with fixed-capacity incumbents and volatile
   demand. Leveraging panel data on hotels and Airbnb, we study how the
   sharing economy fundamentally changes the way the industry accommodates
   demand fluctuations and how incumbent firms should strategically
   respond. The demand estimates suggest that Airbnb's flexible supply
   helps recover the lost underlying demand due to hotel seasonal pricing
   (i.e., higher prices during high-demand seasons) and even stimulates
   more demand in some cities. The counterfactual results suggest that some
   hotel types in some cities may benefit from conducting less seasonal
   pricing and even considering counter-seasonal pricing. Market conditions
   (e.g., seasonality patterns, hotel prices and quality, consumer
   composition, and Airbnb supply elasticity) play a crucial role in
   determining the impact of Airbnb on hotel sales and hotels' strategic
   response. Finally, recent Airbnb and policy changes (e.g., higher Airbnb
   hosting costs due to hotel taxes or lower Airbnb hosting costs due to
   third-party services and the "professionalism" of hosts) affect the
   competitive dynamics. The profits of high-end hotels are the most
   sensitive to the changes in Airbnb hosting costs. Airbnb's recent
   attempt to behave more like hotels can increase hotels' vulnerability to
   lower Airbnb hosting costs.

AB For information/digital products, the used goods market has been viewed
   as a threat by producers. However, it is not clear whether this view is
   justified because the used goods market also provides owners with an
   opportunity to sell their products. To investigate the impact of the
   used goods market on new goods sales, we collect a unique data set from
   the Japanese video game market. On the basis of the data, we develop and
   estimate a new dynamic structural model of consumers' buying and selling
   decisions. The estimation results show that potential buyers'
   consumption value from a game deteriorates by 50% from the release week
   to the second week, and game owners' consumption value deteriorates by
   23%-58% after the first week of ownership, and the rate depends on game
   characteristics. Examination of the cross-price elasticities suggests
   that the elasticities tend to be high especially when the used-game
   inventory at retailers is low, but they quickly decrease as the
   inventory is accumulated. Using the estimates, we quantify the impact of
   eliminating the used game market on publishers' profits and consumer
   welfare. We find that holding the new-copy price at the observed level,
   this policy would increase publishers' profits by 7.3% but reduce the
   consumer surplus by 0.9%, resulting in an overall decrease in social
   surplus by 0.3%. However, if firms adjust prices optimally, it would
   increase the profits by 26.8% and also increase the consumer surplus by
   1.4% owing to lower new game's prices. Overall, the social surplus
   increases by 2.7%.

AB Consumers often learn the weights they ascribe to product attributes
   ("preference weights") as they search. For example, after test driving
   cars, a consumer might find that he or she undervalued trunk space and
   overvalued sunroofs. Preference-weight learning makes optimal search
   complex because each time a product is searched, updated preference
   weights affect the expected utility of all products and the value of
   subsequent optimal search. Product recommendations, which take
   preference-weight learning into account, help consumers search. We
   motivate a model in which consumers learn (update) their preference
   weights. When consumers learn preference weights, it may not be optimal
   to recommend the product with the highest option value, as in most
   search models, or the product most likely to be chosen, as in
   traditional recommendation systems. Recommendations are improved if
   consumers are encouraged to search products with diverse attribute
   levels, products that are undervalued, or products for which
   recommendation-system priors differ from consumers' priors. Synthetic
   data experiments demonstrate that proposed recommendation systems
   outperform benchmark recommendation systems, especially when consumers
   are novices and when recommendation systems have good priors. We
   demonstrate empirically that consumers learn preference weights during
   search, that recommendation systems can predict changes, and that a
   proposed recommendation system encourages learning.

AB This paper studies probabilistic selling for vertically differentiated
   products, whereby consumers do not know the exact identity of a product
   until after making the purchase. An important feature of probabilistic
   selling overlooked by previous literature is that it changes the product
   line, which often determines consumers' choice context. Our work
   discovers the crucial role of context effects taking into account
   consumers' salient thinking behavior: consumers focus their limited
   attention on and hence overweight the salient attribute of a product in
   their perception, leading to context-dependent preferences. We show that
   probabilistic selling can improve the seller's profit with salient
   thinkers even when this strategy does not emerge with rational
   consumers. With salient thinking, the probabilistic product enables the
   seller to transform the consumers' choice context favorably and direct
   their attention to quality. Our findings demonstrate the importance of
   exploiting consumers' salient thinking behavior and suggest that
   probabilistic selling, as a context management tool, can be more
   beneficial than previously shown.

   a user's friends generally increases the likelihood for the user to
   adopt that color, conformity first decreases and then increases with the
   adoption rate of that choice, which ranges from 50% to 100%. In
   addition, users who are of a minority or lower socioeconomic status or

AB Advertisers are growing increasingly concerned about the ease with which
   traditional television advertising can be avoided. Product placement
   activities, where brands are visually and/or verbally incorporated into
   television and movies, have continued to grow. In contrast to television
   commercials that can be avoided by viewers, product placement is
   embedded in the programming itself and is more difficult to avoid.
   Despite its popularity, there is limited research in marketing that has
   investigated the impact of product placement. In this research, the
   authors investigate the relationship between product placement in
   television programs and the volume of social media activity and website
   traffic for the featured brand. Using data on nearly 3,000 product
   placements for 99 brands from the fall 2015 television season, the
   authors find that prominent product placement activities-especially
   verbal placements-are associated with increases in both online
   conversations and web traffic for the brand, with some evidence of
   decreasing returns at high levels of prominence. The authors also find
   that, for most placement modalities, television advertising occurring in
   close proximity to placement activities does not enhance these increases

AB Many customer service organizations (CSOs) reflect a tiered, or
   multilevel, organizational structure, which we argue imposes hassle
   costs for dissatisfied customers seeking high levels of redress. The
   tiered structure specifies that first-level CSO agents (e.g., call
   center operators) be restricted in their payout authority. Only by
   escalating a claim to a higher level (e.g., a manager), and incurring
   extra hassles, can a dissatisfied customer obtain more redress from the
   firm. We argue that the tiered structure helps the firm to control
   redress costs by (1) screening less severe claims so that such customers
   do not escalate their claims to a manager and (2) screening illegitimate
   claims. Our main result is that a firm can be more profitable if it uses
   a tiered CSO.

   activities by adapting the brand's positioning to the country image the
   brand targets. It introduces the concept of brand image-country image
   (BICI) fit, which measures the extent to which consumers in a specific
   country perceive a brand image as being congruent with their home
   country's image. Using more than 350,000 brand-respondent observations
   across three countries, we develop and empirically illustrate a
   multiattribute methodology for operationalizing BICI fit and provide
   robust evidence that BICI fit is positively associated with consumers'
   brand evaluations. A large number of validity and robustness tests
   support the proposed BICI fit metric and the findings derived from it.
   For example, we find that age, education, being female, and need for
   structure enhance the BICI fit effect, whereas materialism diminishes
   it. Furthermore, BICI fit matters more in categories that are closely
   tied to a local cultural context or that are characterized by high
   purchase risk. Given its multiattribute nature, the proposed BICI fit
   metric identifies concrete image attributes and thereby provides
   managers with an effective way to develop or revise LCC positioning

AB We quantify the effects of others' adoptions and word of mouth (volume
   and valence) on consumers' product adoption decisions. We differentiate
   between the effects of word of mouth and observed adoptions from friends
   (personal network) and the effects of word of mouth and observed
   adoptions from the whole community (community network). Understanding
   the relative importance of word of mouth and observed adoptions at each
   network level provides crucial guidance for companies regarding their
   information provision and platform design strategies. Our unique data
   come from an online anime (Japanese cartoon) platform containing
   individual-level data on users' networks, anime adoptions, forum posts,
   and ratings of anime series. Our results reveal that both word of mouth
   (volume and valence) and observed adoptions from the community network
   have significant positive effects on individual users' anime-watching
   decisions. Furthermore, this finding also holds true for word of mouth
   and observed adoptions coming from the personal network. Comparing the
   magnitudes of the effects of word of mouth and observed adoptions across
   both network levels, we find that word-of-mouth valence from the
   community network is the largest driver among the social learning forces
   we study. Thus our results show that word of mouth and observed
   adoptions provide unique and different information that individuals use
   in their anime-watching decisions and that the community network is the
   primary source of information driving anime adoptions.

AB Prior literature on pay-per-click advertising assumes that publishers
   know advertisers' click-through rates (CTRs). This information, however,
   is not available when a new advertiser first joins a publisher. The new
   advertiser's CTR can be learned only if its ad is shown to enough
   consumers, that is, the advertiser wins enough auctions. Because
   publishers use CTRs to calculate payments and allocations, the lack of
   information about a new advertiser can affect the advertisers' bids.
   Using a game-theory model, we analyze advertisers' strategies, their
   payoffs, and the publisher's revenue in a learning environment. Our
   results indicate that a new advertiser always bids higher (sometimes
   above valuation) in the beginning. The incumbent advertiser's strategy
   depends on its valuation and CTR. A strong incumbent increases its bid
   to deter the publisher from learning the new advertiser's CTR, whereas a
   weak incumbent decreases its bid to facilitate learning. Interestingly,
   the publisher may benefit from not knowing the new advertiser's CTR
   because its ignorance could induce advertisers to bid more aggressively.
   Nonetheless, the publisher's revenue sometimes decreases because of this
   lack of information. The publisher can mitigate this loss by lowering
   the reserve price of, offering advertising credit to, or boosting the
   bids of new advertisers.

AB We study consumers' purchase behavior on daily deal websites (e.g.,
   Groupon promotions) using individual clickstream data on the browsing
   history of new subscribers to Groupon between January and March 2011. We
   observe two patterns in the data. First, the probability that a given
   consumer clicks on a merchant in the emailed newsletter declines over
   time, which seems to be consistent with the notion of consumer
   "fatigue"-a phenomenon highlighted by the popular press. Second, the
   probability that the consumer makes a purchase conditional on clicking
   increases over time, which seems contrary to the notion of "fatigue." To
   reconcile these two observations, we propose a model that rationalizes
   these patterns and then use it to provide insights for companies in the
   daily deal industry. When consumers first subscribe to a daily deal
   website, they are unlikely to be fully informed about the quality of the
   deals offered on that site. The daily newsletter provides only the price
   and some limited information about that day's featured deal. To learn
   more about quality, consumers need to click on the emailed newsletter;
   this takes them to the deal's website, where they invest time and effort
   to learn about the deal's quality. Such a search for information is
   costly. Furthermore, consumers do not know about the quality of deals
   they may receive in the future. Given the cost of searching and the
   uncertainty about the quality of future deals, consumers are more likely
   to search early on (i.e., click on the newsletter) in their tenure. As
   they learn about the distribution of the quality of deals on Groupon,
   they require less searching, resulting in a decline in clicks over time.
   As learning accumulates, consumers are better at recognizing the
   position of a deal in the quality distribution of Groupon deals and are
   therefore more likely to purchase the clicked deals. This results in an
   increase in the conditional probability of purchasing. We formulate a
   dynamic model of search and Dirichlet learning based on the above
   characterization of consumer behavior. We show that the model is able to
   replicate patterns in the data. Next, we estimate the parameters of the
   model and provide insights for managers of daily deal websites based on
   our findings and policy simulations.

AB Price promotions are typically offered in groups on websites, mailings,
   and circulars, but little is known about how promotional offers in near
   proximity affect each other. Across two large-scale field experiments (N
   = 66,184) conducted on a multibrand coupon website, we find that when
   lead promotions offer high-value deals, consumers are more likely to
   print subsequent offers, a finding we call "lead offer spillover." In
   the first field experiment, doubling the value of three lead offers
   increased the printing of subsequent offers by 18% and redemptions by
   12%. In the second, doubling the value of a single lead offer increased
   subsequent offer prints by 12%. Additional analyses and experiments
   indicate that larger lead offers increase consumer search for subsequent
   offers and are not primarily driven by changes in evaluative judgments
   or complementarities between lead and subsequent offers.

AB This research studies the product line design problem when consumers are
   subject to perceptual errors in assessing their intrinsic preferences.
   If perceptual errors are driven by common variables, then a firm may use
   aggregate consumer data (e.g., conjoint studies or anonymous usage data)
   to deduce the errors and infer the consumer preferences. In this way, we
   develop microfoundations necessary to show when and how the firm can
   understand consumer preferences better than consumers themselves, a
   situation we call superior knowledge. But is superior knowledge ever
   unprofitable? How should the firm with superior knowledge design its
   product line? Do consumers receive more-relevant products or simply have
   more surplus extracted? Can data collection help consumers make better
   choices? Our results suggest that consumer's rational suspicions may
   prevent the firm from exploiting its superior knowledge. In addition,
   the burden of signaling may force the firm to offer efficient quality
   for its products. Therefore, allowing the firm to collect aggregate
   consumer data may be strictly Pareto improving.

AB This paper presents a methodology for identifying groups of products
   that exhibit similar patterns in demand and responsiveness to changes in
   price using store-level sales data. We use the concept of economic
   separability as the basis for establishing similarity between products
   and build a weakly separable model of aggregate demand. A common issue
   with separable demand models is that the partition of products into
   separable groups must be known a priori, which severely shrinks the set
   of admissible substitution patterns. We develop a methodology that
   allows the partition to be an estimated model parameter. In particular,
   we specify a log-linear demand system in which weak separability induces
   equality restrictions on a subset of cross-price elasticity parameters.
   An advantage of our approach is that we are able to find groups of
   separable products rather than just test whether a given set of groups
   is separable. Our method is applied to two aggregate, store-level data
   sets. We find evidence that the separable structure of demand can be
   inconsistent with category labels, which has implications for optimal
   category marketing strategies.

AB Marketers have recognized that the probability of a consumer's (or
   household's) purchase in a particular product category may be influenced
   by past purchases in the same category and also, purchases in other
   related categories. Past studies of crosscategory effects have focused
   on a limited number of product categories, and they have often ignored
   intertemporal effects in their analyses. Those studies have generally
   used multivariate logit or probit models, which are limited in their
   ability to analyze enormous data sets that contain consumer purchase
   records across a large number of categories and time periods. The
   availability of such enormous consumer shopping data sets and the value
   of analyzing the complex relationships across categories and over time
   (for example, for personalized promotions) suggest the need for
   computationally efficient modeling and estimation methods. Such models
   can capture associations among buying decisions across all product
   categories and over all time periods for which data are available, but
   they must also have a tractable and clear model structure that permits
   meaningful interpretation of the results. We explore the nature of
   intertemporal crossproduct patterns in an enormous consumer purchase
   data set using a model that adopts the structure of conditional
   restricted Boltzmann machines (CRBMs). Our empirical results demonstrate
   that our proposed approach using the efficient estimation algorithm
   embodied in the CRBM enables us to process very large data sets and
   capture the consumer decision patterns for both predictive and
   descriptive purposes that might not otherwise be apparent. In addition
   to persistent intertemporal within-category effects, we find that there
   are also significant intertemporal cross effects between product
   categories.

AB This paper investigates the impact of mobile hailing technology on taxi
   driving behaviors. A controversial feature of mobile hailing
   applications in China is the disclosure of not only pickup locations but
   also drop-off destinations before drivers accept offers. It provides
   taxi drivers two different mechanisms to improve their hourly earnings:
   reducing cruising time and selecting more profitable trips. We examine
   3.6-terabyte minute-by-minute geolocation data of 2,106 single-shift
   drivers in Beijing. A modified change-point model is proposed to infer
   the adoption decisions and estimate the changes in driving behaviors. We
   show that mobile hailing technology adoption is associated with an
   average increase of 6.8% in hourly earnings, equivalent to an extra CNY
   750 monthly income. A typical taxi driver greatly improves hourly
   earnings through trip selection in favor of longer trips rather than
   aiming for cruising-time reduction. We find that the relative importance
   of cruising-time reduction and trip selection depends on driver skills
   and market conditions. We do not find market expansions on the number of
   trips or working hours, but rather a redistribution of realized trips
   toward long distances.

   returns? In this paper, we model the relationship between a retailer's
   mobile app launch and the frequency, quantity, and monetary zulue of
   purchases in its online and offline channels, as well as product
   returns. We leverage data on a large retailer's launch of a mobile app
   and use a difference-in-differences approach. Our results show that app
   adopters buy 33% more frequently, buy 34% more items, and spend 37% more
   than non-adopters in the period after app introduction. At the same
   time, they return 35% more frequently, 35% more items, and 41% more in
   dollar value. Combined, app adopters spend 36% more in net monetary
   value. Furthermore, app adopters' purchases in both the online and
   offline channels increase after app launch. The time, location, and
   features of app use provide descriptive evidence of how the app aids
   shopping in other channels. App-linked shoppers (those who make a
   purchase within 48 hours of app use) use the app when they are close to
   the store of purchase and access the app for loyalty rewards, product
   details, and notifications. These insights offer important substantive
   implications.

AB Mobile users can create word of mouth (WOM) wherever they are and
   whenever they want to do so. This real-time creation process may be
   associated with differences in the content and consumption value of
   mobile versus nonmobile word of mouth. We analyze 275,362 reviews from
   117,827 reviewers describing their experiences at 134,976 restaurants as
   well as a dual platform subsample of 21,026 reviews written by 673
   reviewers who wrote at least four mobile and four nonmobile reviews. We
   also examine how the introduction of the mobile platform affected WOM
   consumption. We find that WOM content is more affective, more concrete,
   and less extreme when created on mobile devices. These differences in
   content (more affective, more concrete, and less extreme) vary in their
   relationships with the perceived consumption value of mobile content.
   Beyond the indirect relationship between platform and consumption value
   through content, reviews created on mobile devices are associated with
   lower consumption value. This direct relationship grows stronger over
   time. Although consumers initially value both real-time mobile content
   and nonmobile content, even after controlling for a large set of content
   and contextual variables, over time consumers value mobile reviews less
   than they do nonmobile reviews.

AB We study the relationship between online reviews and advertising
   spending in the hotel industry. Combining a data set of TripAdvisor
   reviews with other data sets describing these hotels' advertising
   expenditures, we show, first, that online ratings have a causal
   demand-side effect on ad spending. Second, this effect is negative:
   hotels with higher ratings spend less on advertising than hotels with
   lower ratings. This suggests that hotels treat TripAdvisor ratings and
   advertising spending as substitutes, not complements. Third, the
   relationship is stronger for independent hotels than for chains, and
   stronger in less differentiated markets than in more differentiated
   markets. The former suggests that a strong brand name continues to
   provide some immunity to reviews and the latter that the advertising
   response is stronger when ratings are more likely to be pivotal.
   Finally, we show that the relationship between online ratings and
   advertising has strengthened over time, just as TripAdvisor has become
   more popular, implying that firms respond to online reviews if and only
   if consumers respond to them.

AB To form expectations of product quality, consumers frequently rely on
   opinion leaders who presumably have better expertise in the category.
   But opinion leader recommendations are influenced by both the product
   quality and the idiosyncratic preferences of the opinion leader.
   Consequently, the followers need to form expectations of how much a
   recommendation is driven by the product quality versus by the product's
   idiosyncratic fit to the opinion leader. Since the opinion leader is
   likely able to select a better fitting version from a larger variety,
   the opinion leader's idiosyncratic fit depends on the product variety.
   We analyze how the product variety affects consumer inference of
   quality, and consequently, formulate recommendations of how the firm
   should adjust its product variety in the presence of opinion leaders. We
   find that the adjustment may be either upward or downward. Generally, it
   is upward if opinion leaders are more difficult to satisfy. However,
   when the optimal variety absent consideration of opinion leaders is
   infinite, the optimal variety given this consideration may be finite.
   Moreover, the firm's knowledge of the true quality may further increase
   the distortion of the optimal variety even when the equilibrium variety
   is pooling across the product qualities.

AB Many new products have several features that are not used by most
   consumers. One explanation for consumers buying products with features
   that they do not use is that consumers value features and ease of use
   differently at the point of purchase and at the time of usage. This
   behavior can be explained by consumer biases such as hyperbolic
   discounting. Some researchers claim that such consumer biases encourage
   firms to offer too many features at the cost of making products less
   user friendly. This paper examines how consumer biases such as
   hyperbolic discounting and naive expectations affect pricing, product
   design, firm profits, and welfare. We build a game theoretic model in
   which consumers need to invest in learning in order to use the
   additional features of a product. In our model, consumers use
   quasi-hyperbolic discounting, and some consumers have naive beliefs
   about their future learning behavior. Contrary to intuition, we show
   that hyperbolic discounting encourages firms to focus more on ease of
   learning rather than on investing in additional features. We also find
   that consumer biases do not always hurt consumers but can sometimes lead
   to improvement in consumer welfare. From a public policy perspective,
   our results suggest that educating consumers to reduce the number of
   overly optimistic consumers could be welfare reducing. We also show that
   firms can improve learning by making features complementary or by having
   a consistent design to encourage sequential learning of features. Our
   analysis also reveals that one approach to make consumers learn existing
   features may be to add more complementary features. We also investigate
   whether allowing consumers to choose between simple and feature-rich
   products would enhance welfare. We find that providing consumers with
   more choice can lead to reduced consumer welfare.

AB We consider the compensation design problem of a firm that hires a
   salesperson to exert effort to increase demand. We assume both demand
   and supply to be uncertain with sales being the smaller of demand and
   supply and assume that, if demand exceeds supply, then unmet demand is
   unobservable (demand censoring). Under single moral hazard (i.e., when
   the salesperson's effort is unobservable to the firm), we show that the
   optimal contract has an extreme convex form in which a bonus is provided
   only for achieving the highest sales outcome even if low realized sales
   are due to low realized supply (on which the salesperson has no
   influence). Under double moral hazard (i.e., when the firm can also take
   supply-related actions that are unobservable to the salesperson), we
   show that the optimal contract is smoother as it involves positive
   compensation for intermediate sales outcomes to assure the salesperson
   that the firm does not have an incentive to deviate to an action that
   hurts the agent; in fact, under certain conditions, the contract is
   concave in sales. We also determine conditions under which, if possible,
   the firm should postpone contracting until after supply is realized.

AB This paper studies how salespeople affect the choices of which products
   consumers choose, and from that, how a firm should set optimal
   commissions as a function of the appeal, substitutability, and profit
   margins of different products. We also examine whether firms are better
   off promoting products through sales incentives or price discounts. To
   achieve these goals, we develop a salesforce-driven consumer choice
   model to study how performance-based commissions incentivize a
   salesperson's service effort toward heterogeneous, substitutable
   products carried by a firm. The model treats the selling process as a
   joint decision by the salesperson and the consumer. It allows the
   salesperson's efforts to vary across different transactions, depending
   on the unique preferences of each consumer, and incorporates the effects
   of commissions and other marketing mix elements on the selling outcome
   in a unified framework. We estimate the model using data from a car
   dealership. We find that the optimal commissions should be lower for
   popular items and for items that are closer substitutes with other
   products. We also find that for the car industry we study, the cost of
   selling more cars using sales incentives is cheaper than the cost of
   selling the same number of cars using price discounts.

AB We develop a new approach using market-level data to model, identify,
   and estimate a dynamic discrete choice demand model for durable goods
   with continuous unobserved product-specific state variables. They are
   specified as serially correlated and correlated with the observed
   product characteristics, particularly price. We provide a method to
   estimate all model primitives, including the consumer's discount factor
   and the state transition distributions of unobserved product
   characteristics without the need to reduce the dimension of the state
   space or by other approximation techniques, such as discretizing state
   variables. We prove the identification of model primitives and provide
   an estimation algorithm in which the most computationally demanding step
   is a linear regression. Finally, we show how it can be implemented in an
   application in which we estimate the demand for smartphones.

AB Data brokers often u,e (mime browsing records to create digital consumer
   profiles that they sell to marketers as predefined audiences for ad
   targeting. However, this process is a "black box"-little is known about
   the reliability of the digital profiles that are created or of the
   audience identification provided by buying platforms. In this paper, we
   investigate using three field tests the accuracy of a variety of
   demographic and audience-interest segments. We examine the accuracy of
   more than 90 third-party audiences across 19 data brokers. Audience
   segments vary greatly in quality and are often inaccurate across leading
   data brokers. In comparison with random audience selection, the use of
   black box data profiles, on average, increased identification of a user
   with a desired single attribute by 0%-77%. Audience identification can
   be improved, on average, by 123% when combined with optimization
   software. However, given the high extra costs of targeting solutions and
   the relative inaccuracy, we find that third-party audiences are often
   economically unattractive except for higher-priced media placements.

AB Recently, as cannabis was legalized for recreational use in an
   increasing number of states, it has become more important to understand
   the effects of cannabis policies, especially on youth. Marketers of
   other recreational substances are also paying close attention to
   cannabis policy changes. Alcohol and tobacco companies typically view
   the cannabis industry as a potential threat and are often found among
   the opponents to its legalization. However, based on extant research,
   the treatment effects of recreational cannabis legalization (RCL) and
   its cross-commodity effects on the alcohol and tobacco industries remain
   inconclusive. Analyzing large-scale web-based behavioral data, we find
   that although RCL significantly increases cannabis search, the increase
   comes from adults only, but not youth. RCL also influences alcohol and
   tobacco industries asymmetrically: it reduces search volume and
   advertising effectiveness for alcohol but increases those for tobacco.
   Hence, cannabis appears to be a substitute for alcohol but not tobacco.

AB Empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are surging as new
   technologies with both business potential and customer pushback. This
   study exploits field experiment data on more than 6,200 customers who
   are randomized to receive highly structured outbound sales calls from
   chatbots or human workers. Results suggest that undisclosed chatbots are
   as effective as proficient workers and four times more effective than
   inexperienced workers in engendering customer purchases. However, a
   disclosure of chatbot identity before the machine-customer conversation
   reduces purchase rates by more than 79.7%. Additional analyses find that
   these results are robust to nonresponse bias and hang-ups, and the
   chatbot disclosure substantially decreases call length. Exploration of
   the mechanisms reveals that when customers know the conversational
   partner is not a human, they are curt and purchase less because they
   perceive the disclosed bot as less knowledgeable and less empathetic.
   The negative disclosure effect seems to be driven by a subjective human
   perception against machines, despite the objective competence of AI
   chatbots. Fortunately, such negative impact can be mitigated by a late
   disclosure timing strategy and customer prior AI experience. These
   findings offer useful implications for chatbot applications, customer
   targeting, and advertising in conversational commerce.

AB This paper considers the monetization of online marketplaces. These
   platforms trade off fees from advertising with commissions from product
   sales. Although featuring advertised products can make search less
   efficient (lowering transaction commissions), it incentivizes sellers to
   compete for better placements via advertising (increasing advertising
   fees). We consider this trade-off by modeling both sides of the
   platform. On the demand side, we develop a joint model of browsing
   (impressions), clicking, and purchase. On the supply side, we consider
   sellers' valuations and advertising competition under various fee
   structures (cost-per-mille, cost-per-click (CPC), and cost-per-action)
   and ranking algorithms. Using buyer, seller, and platform data from an
   online marketplace where advertising dollars affect the order of seller
   items listed, we explore various product-ranking and ad-pricing
   mechanisms. We find that sorting items below the fifth position by
   expected sales revenue while conducting a CPC auction in the top 5
   positions yields the greatest improvement in profits (181%) because this
   approach balances the highest valuations from advertising in the top
   positions with the transaction revenues in the lower positions.

AB Sports franchises derive significant portions of their revenues from
   season ticket holders. A development that may affect season ticket
   management is the growth of legal secondary markets. We develop a
   structural model that integrates both the supply and demand sides of the
   secondary market into season ticket buyers' ticket purchase and usage
   choices. We use a panel data set that combines season and single ticket
   purchase records with ticket usage data to investigate the value of
   secondary markets. We estimate that the secondary market increases the
   team's season ticket revenues by about $1 million per season. At the
   level of the individual season ticket customer, we estimate an increase
   in customer lifetime value ranging from $1,327 in the lowest quality
   seat tier to $2,553 in the highest. In terms of value to the customer,
   the average dollar value of having a secondary market is $138 per season
   ticket. Across segments, the secondary market provides the equivalent of
   a 4% discount in the premium seat tier versus an 11% discount in the
   economy seat tier. Whereas the secondary market creates more value in
   the premium-ticket tier segments, the secondary market has the most
   impact on behavior in the low price oriented segment.

AB Although TV advertising for traditional cigarettes has been banned since
   1971, advertising for e-cigarettes remains unregulated. The effects of
   e-cigarette ads have been heavily debated, but empirical analysis of the
   market has been limited. Analyzing both individual and aggregate data, I
   present descriptive evidence showing that e-cigarette advertising
   reduces demand for traditional cigarettes and that individuals treat
   e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes as substitutes. I then specify a
   structural model of demand for cigarettes that incorporates addiction
   and allows for heterogeneity across households. The model enables me to
   leverage the information content of both data sets to identify variation
   in tastes across markets and the state dependence induced on choice by
   addiction. Using the demand model estimates, I evaluate the impact of a
   proposed ban on e-cigarette television advertising. I find that in the
   absence of e-cigarette advertising, demand for traditional cigarettes
   would increase, suggesting that a ban on e-cigarette advertising may
   have unintended consequences.

AB In this paper, we investigate advertisers' budgeting and bidding
   strategies across multiple search platforms. We develop a model with two
   platforms and budget-limited advertisers that compete for advertising
   slots across platforms. When platform reserve prices are low and
   exogenous, we find that symmetric advertisers pursue asymmetric budget
   allocation strategies and partially differentiate: one advertiser
   allocates a share of its budget to platform A higher than A's share of
   user traffic and a share of its budget to platform B lower than B's
   share of user traffic, whereas the second advertiser does the reverse.
   This partial differentiation balances two forces: a demand force arising
   from a desire to be present on both platforms to obtain more clicks and
   a strategic force driven by a desire to be budget dominant on at least
   one platform to obtain clicks at a lower cost. We then show that the
   benefit from differentiation for advertisers diminishes if platforms
   strategically increase their reserve prices. At reserve prices that
   maximize platform revenues, advertisers allocate their budgets
   proportional to each platform's share of user traffic, and platforms
   fully appropriate these budgets.

AB Marketers often use A/B testing as a tool to compare marketing
   treatments in a test stage and then deploy the better-performing
   treatment to the remainder of the consumer population. Whereas these
   tests have traditionally been analyzed using hypothesis testing, we
   reframe them as an explicit trade-off between the opportunity cost of
   the test (where some customers receive a suboptimal treatment) and the
   potential losses associated with deploying a suboptimal treatment to the
   remainder of the population. We derive a closed-form expression for the
   profit-maximizing test size and show that it is substantially smaller
   than typically recommended for a hypothesis test, particularly when the
   response is noisy or when the total population is small. The common
   practice of using small holdout groups can be rationalized by asymmetric
   priors. The proposed test design achieves nearly the same expected
   regret as the flexible yet harder-to-implement multi-armed bandit under
   a wide range of conditions. We demonstrate the benefits of the method in
   three different marketing contexts-website design, display advertising,
   and catalog tests-in which we estimate priors from past data. In all
   three cases, the optimal sample sizes are substantially smaller than for
   a traditional hypothesis test, resulting in higher profit.

AB Choice-based conjoint (CBC) studies have begun to rely on simulators to
   forecast equilibrium prices for pricing, strategic product positioning,
   and patent/copyright valuations. Whereas CBC research has long focused
   on the accuracy of estimated relative partworths of attribute levels,
   predicted equilibrium prices and strategic positioning are surprisingly
   and dramatically dependent on scale: the magnitude of the partworths
   (including the price coefficient) relative to the magnitude of the error
   term. Although the impact of scale on the ability to estimate
   heterogeneous partworths is well known, neither the literature nor
   current practice address the sensitivity of pricing and positioning to
   scale. This sensitivity is important because (estimated) scale depends
   on seemingly innocuous market-research decisions such as whether
   attributes are described by text or by realistic images. We demonstrate
   the strategic implications of scale using a stylized model in which
   heterogeneity is modeled explicitly. If a firm shirks on the quality of
   a CBC study and acts on incorrectly observed scale, a follower, but not
   an innovator, can make costly strategic errors. Externally valid
   estimates of scale are extremely important. We demonstrate empirically
   that image realism and incentive alignment affect scale sufficiently to
   change strategic decisions and affect patent/copyright valuations by
   hundreds of millions of dollars.

AB Recent advances in advertising technology have lead to the development
   of "native advertising," which is a format of advertising that mimics
   the other nonsponsored content on the medium. Whereas advertisers have
   rapidly embraced the format on a variety of digital media, regulators
   have expressed serious concerns about whether this format materially
   deceives consumers because the advertising disclosure is incomplete or
   inappropriate. This has reignited a longstanding debate about the
   distinction between advertising and content in media markets, and how it
   affects consumers. This paper contributes to this debate by providing
   empirical evidence from a randomized experiment conducted on native
   advertising at a mobile restaurant-search platform. We experimentally
   vary the format of paid-search advertising, the extent to which ads are
   disclosed to over 200,000 users, and track their anonymized browsing
   behavior including clicks and conversions. The research design we
   propose uses comparisons of revealed preferences under experimentally
   manipulated treatment and control conditions to assess the potential for
   consumer confusion and deception. A design based on revealed preference
   speaks to the "material" standard of regulators, helps assess confusion
   while avoiding directly questioning consumers, and may be useful in
   other settings. Implementing the design, we find that native advertising
   benefits advertisers and detect no evidence of deception under typically
   used formats of disclosure currently used in the paid-search
   marketplace. Further investigation shows that the incremental
   conversions due to advertising are not driven by users clicking on the
   native ads. Rather, the benefits from advertising are driven by users
   seeing the ads and later clicking on the advertiser's "organic"
   listings. Thus, we find little support of native advertising tricking
   users into clicking and driving them to advertisers as typically feared;
   instead, users seem to view ads and deliberately evaluate the
   advertisers. Furthermore, mere exposure seems sufficient to produce most
   of the incremental effect of advertising.

AB We study consumer privacy choice in the context of online display
   advertising, where advertisers track consumers' browsing to improve ad
   targeting. In 2010, the American ad industry self-regulated by
   implementing the AdChoices program: consumers could opt out of online
   behavioral advertising via a dedicated website, which can be reached by
   clicking the overlaid AdChoices icons on ads. We examine the real-world
   uptake of AdChoices using transaction data from an ad exchange. Though
   consumers express strong privacy concerns in surveys, we find that only
   0.23% of American ad impressions arise from users who opted out of
   online behavioral advertising. We also find that opt-out user ads fetch
   52% less revenue on the exchange than comparable ads for users who allow
   behavioral targeting. These findings are broadly consistent with
   evidence from the European Union and Canada, where industry subsequently
   implemented the AdChoices program. We calculate that the inability to
   behaviorally target opt-out users results in a loss of about $858 in ad
   spending per American opt-out consumer, which is borne by publishers and
   the exchange. We find that opt-out users tend to be more technologically
   sophisticated, though opt-out rates are also higher in older and
   wealthier American cities. These results inform the privacy policy
   discussion by illuminating the real-world consequences of an opt-out
   privacy mechanism.
