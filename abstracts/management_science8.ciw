AB Although monitoring and regulation can be used to combat socially costly
   unethical conduct, their intended targets can often avoid regulation or
   hide their behavior. This surrenders at least part of the effectiveness
   of regulatory policies to firms' and individuals' decisions to
   voluntarily submit to regulation. We study individuals' decisions to
   avoid monitoring or regulation and thus enhance their ability to engage
   in unethical conduct. We conduct a laboratory experiment in which
   participants engage in a competitive task and can decide between having
   the opportunity to misreport their performance or having their
   performance verified by an external monitor. To study the effect of
   social factors on the willingness to be subject to monitoring, we vary
   whether participants make this decision simultaneously with others or
   sequentially, as well as whether the decision is private or public. Our
   results show that the opportunity to avoid being submitted to regulation
   produces more unethical conduct than situations in which regulation is
   either exogenously imposed or entirely absent.

AB Although it is intuitively plausible that a job seeker benefits by using
   contacts in her job search, the literature is plagued by theoretical
   disagreements and inconclusive empirical evidence. Single-firm studies
   consistently find that job seekers applying through referrals achieve
   better labor-market outcomes than job seekers applying without
   referrals, but the evidence from job-seeker studies is mixed. To solve
   this puzzle, we clarify the distinction between having social capital
   and using contacts as a search method. We present theoretical reasons to
   suggest that the lack of an association between a job seeker's social
   capital and whether or not she uses social networks to search for a job
   should not be taken to imply that job seekers who use social networks to
   search for jobs do not benefit from using contacts. We exploit a
   strategic research setting, the school-to-work transition of 291
   university graduates who engaged in 3,112 contemporaneous job searches,
   to show that although a job seeker's social capital may not affect
   whether or not she uses contacts to search for a job, using contacts as
   a job-search method does improve her job-search outcomes. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of our findings for the literature on job
   search and social networks.

AB Product launch-an event when a new product debuts for production in a
   plant-is an important phase in product development. But launches disrupt
   manufacturing operations, resulting in productivity losses. Using data
   from North American automotive plants from years 1999-2007, we estimate
   that a product launch entails an average productivity loss of 12%-15% at
   the plant level. This translates to a monetary loss of $42-$53 million
   per launch in lost productivity. We identify several ways to mitigate
   the decrease in productivity. Product (or mix) flexibility in the body
   shop is critical for reducing the productivity loss. A plant's past
   experiences with product launches as well as with manufacturing similar
   products (specifically, on the same platform as the launch product)
   temper the productivity losses even further. Nevertheless, there are
   subtle differences in the accrued learning with these two types of
   experiences: whereas the positive impact of platform experience persists
   over time, the learning accrued with launching other products in the
   same plant decays more quickly. Altogether, our results suggest that
   launching products at a flexible plant with appropriate platform
   experience could recover approximately $31 million per launch in lost
   productivity.

AB The problem of determining nurse staffing levels in a hospital
   environment is a complex task because of variable patient census levels
   and uncertain service capacity caused by nurse absenteeism. In this
   paper, we combine an empirical investigation of the factors affecting
   nurse absenteeism rates with an analytical treatment of nurse staffing
   decisions using a novel variant of the newsvendor model. Using data from
   the emergency department of a large urban hospital, we find that
   absenteeism rates are consistent with nurses exhibiting an aversion to
   higher levels of anticipated workload. Using our empirical findings, we
   analyze a single-period nurse staffing problem considering both the case
   of constant absenteeism rate (exogenous absenteeism) as well as an
   absenteeism rate that is a function of the number of nurses scheduled
   (endogenous absenteeism). We provide characterizations of the optimal
   staffing levels in both situations and show that the failure to
   incorporate absenteeism as an endogenous effect results in
   understaffing.

AB We study the time-varying nature of U.S. monetary policies summarized by
   the Taylor rule based on a continuous-time regime-switching term
   structure model. In this model, the spot rate follows the Taylor rule
   and government bonds at different maturities are priced by no arbitrage.
   We allow the coefficients of the Taylor rule and the dynamics of
   inflation and output gap to be regime dependent and estimate the model
   using government bond yields. We find that the Fed is proactive in
   controlling inflation in one regime and accommodative for growth in
   another. Moreover, proactive monetary policies are associated with more
   stable inflation and output gap and therefore could have contributed to
   the Great Moderation. Our analysis also highlights the importance of
   switching regimes for term structure modeling. Without the regimes,
   inflation and output can explain less than 50% of the variations of bond
   yields. With the regimes, the two variables can explain more than 80% of
   the variations of bond yields.

   the loan-based related party transactions (RPTs) including loan
   guarantees and intercorporate loans provided by the listed firm to the

   controller and its son firms provide more support to the listed firm in
   the form of non-loan-based RPTs. These findings directly show the

AB This paper studies an optimal procurement mechanism for a
   newsvendor-like problem where the buyer's (newsvendor's) purchase price
   of the supplies is not fixed, but determined through interaction with
   candidate suppliers. The buyer has priors on the suppliers' costs but
   does not know their costs exactly. Recent literature has shown how the
   buyer can implement the optimal procurement mechanism by announcing a
   revenue function (specifying a payment for each quantity the buyer may
   purchase), then auctioning off the supply contract with the specified
   revenue function. In this paper, we show that a simple modified version
   of the standard open-descending auction for a fixed quantity is also an
   optimal mechanism for obtaining supplies. What distinguishes this
   mechanism is its simplicity and familiarity for the
   suppliers-open-descending auctions are very easy to run and ubiquitous
   in practice, whereas auctioning supply contracts with a specified
   revenue function is much less observed and more difficult to explain to
   suppliers. Furthermore, we show that this simple mechanism can be easily
   generalized to ex ante asymmetric suppliers and a class of nonlinear
   production costs.

AB A defining property of the World Wide Web is a content site's ability to
   place virtually costless hyperlinks to third-party content as a
   substitute or complement to its own content. Costless hyperlinking has
   enabled new types of players, usually referred to as content
   aggregators, to successfully enter content ecosystems, attracting
   traffic and revenue by hosting links to the content of others. This, in
   turn, has sparked a heated controversy between content creators and
   aggregators regarding the legitimacy and costs/benefits of uninhibited
   free linking. To our knowledge, this work is the first to model the
   complex interplay between content and links in settings where a set of

   distill how hyperlinking affects the (a) incentives of content nodes to
   produce quality content versus link to third-party content, (b) profits
   of the various stakeholders, (c) average quality of content that becomes
   available to consumers, and (d) impact of content aggregators. Our

   was successful or unsuccessful. Although empirical studies have
   investigated the effects of success and failure in organizational
   learning, to date, the phenomenon has received little attention at the

   investigate how individuals learn from their own past experiences with

   empirical analyses, we use 10 years of data from 71 cardiothoracic
   surgeons who completed more than 6,500 procedures using a new technology
   for cardiac surgery. We find that individuals learn more from their own
   successes than from their own failures, but they learn more from the
   failures of others than from others' successes. We also find that
   individuals' prior successes and others' failures can help individuals
   overcome their inability to learn from their own failures. Together,
   these findings offer both theoretical and practical insights into how
   individuals learn directly from their prior experience and indirectly
   from the experiences of others.

   shown theoretically that underestimating the variance of demand causes
   orders to deviate from optimal in predictable ways. We provide two
   experiments supporting this theoretical link. In the first, we elicit
   the precision of each individual's beliefs and demonstrate that
   overprecision significantly correlates with order bias. We find that
   overprecision explains almost one-third of the observed ordering
   mistakes and that the effect of overprecision is robust to learning and
   other dynamic considerations. In the second, we introduce a new
   technique to exogenously reduce overprecision. We find that participants

   pay, greater emphasis on incentive-based compensation, and smaller pay
   gaps with U.S. firms. Using a sample of CEOs of UK firms and using both
   broad cross-sectional and narrow event-window tests, we find that
   capital market relationship in the form of a U.S. exchange listing is
   related to higher UK CEO pay; however, the effect is similar when UK
   firms have a listing in any foreign country, implying a foreign listing
   effect not unique to the United States. Product market relationships
   measured by the extent of sales in the United States by UK companies are
   associated with higher pay, greater use of U.S.-style pay arrangements,
   and a reduction in the U.S. UK pay gap. The product market effect is
   incremental to the effect of a U.S. exchange listing, the extent of the
   firm's non-U.S. foreign market interactions, and the characteristics of
   the executive. The U.S. UK CEO pay gap reduces in UK firms that make
   U.S. acquisitions. Furthermore, the firm's use of a U.S. compensation
   consultant increases the sensitivity of UK pay practices to U.S. product
   market relationships.

AB The importance of networks in labor markets is well known, and their
   job-segregating effects in organizations is a given. Conventional wisdom
   attributes this segregation to the homophilous nature of contact
   networks, and leaves little role for organizational influences. Yet
   employee referrals are necessarily initiated within a firm by employee
   referrers subject to organizational policies. We build theory regarding
   the role of referrers in the segregating effects of network recruitment.
   Using mathematical and computational models, we investigate how
   empirically documented referrer behaviors affect job segregation. We
   show that referrer behaviors can segregate jobs beyond the effects of
   homophilous network recruitment. Furthermore, and contrary to past
   understandings, we show that referrer behaviors can also mitigate most,
   if not all, of the segregating effects of network recruitment. Although
   largely neglected in previous labor market network scholarship,
   referrers are the missing links revealing opportunities for
   organizations to influence the effects of network recruitment.

AB We study a scenario in which a firm designs the compensation contract
   for a salesperson who exerts unobservable effort to increase the level

   level to be stocked. We use a newsvendor-type model in which actual
   sales depend on the realized demand but are limited by the inventory
   available, and unfulfilled demand cannot be observed. In this setup,
   under the optimal contract, the agent is paid a bonus for meeting a
   sales quota. Our key result is that it may be optimal for the firm to
   stock more than the first-best inventory level, because this enables the
   firm to obtain a more precise indicator of the salesperson's effort. The
   possibility of stockouts due to limited inventory also leads to several
   counterintuitive results, including the following: (i) relative to when
   stockouts are not considered, it may be optimal for the firm to pay a
   higher bonus even though limited inventory constrains sales; (ii) as
   inventory becomes more expensive, thereby forcing the firm to lower its
   inventory, the firm may nevertheless pay the agent a higher bonus; and
   (iii) if there is a lower probability that the agent's effort exertion
   leads to high demand, rather than lowering inventory due to the lower
   sales potential, the firm may increase inventory.

AB Are large menus better than small menus? Recent literature argues that
   individuals' apparent preference for smaller menus can be explained by
   their behavioral biases or informational limitations. These explanations
   imply that absent behavioral or informational effects, larger menus
   would be objectively better. However, in an important economic
   context-401(k) pension plans we find that larger menus are objectively
   worse than smaller menus, as measured by the maximum Sharpe ratio
   achievable. We propose a model in which menu setters differ in their
   ability to preselect the menu. We show that when the cost of increasing
   the menu size is sufficiently small, a lower-ability menu setter
   optimally offers more items in the menu than a higher-ability menu
   setter. Nevertheless, the menu optimally offered by a higher-ability
   menu setter remains superior. This results in a negative relation
   between menu size and menu quality: smaller menus are better than larger
   menus.

AB In evaluating opportunities, investors wish to identify key sources of

   are to each probabilistic input (e.g., revenues, growth, idiosyncratic
   risk parameters). We base our approach on measuring the distance between
   cumulative distributions (risk profiles) using a metric that is
   invariant to monotonic transformations. Thus, the sensitivity measure
   will not vary by alternative specifications of the utility function over
   the output. To measure separation, we propose using either Kuiper's
   metric or Kolmogorov-Smirnov's metric. We illustrate the advantages of
   our proposed sensitivity measure by comparing it with others, most
   notably, the contribution-to-variance measures. Our measure can be
   obtained as a by-product of a Monte Carlo simulation. We illustrate our
   approach in several examples, focusing on investment analysis
   situations.

AB Contrary to the common view that analysts are important information
   agents, intraday returns evidence shows that announcements of analysts'
   forecast revisions release little new information, on average. Further
   cross-sectional evidence from returns around the announcements confirms
   that revisions are virtually information free. Daily announcement
   returns used in the literature appear to overstate the analyst's role as
   information agent, because forecast announcements are often issued
   directly after reports of significant news about the followed firm. The
   evidence reveals a sequential relationship between events and news and
   forecast revisions indicative of analyst piggybacking, not prophecy.
   These new findings about the most sought-after analyst reports broaden
   significantly the evidence indicating that price reactions to analysts'

AB Four distinct theoretical programs have examined market entry decisions
   of multiunit firms, advancing different explanations for the
   relationship between a firm's likelihood of entry into a geographical
   market and the number of rivals that are already present in the target
   market. Within the strategy literature, theory of strategic interactions
   explains that firms will want to establish a foothold in markets where
   their multimarket competitors are scarce, but avoid markets where there
   are many multimarket competitors. Within economic geography, positive
   externalities such as increase in demand explain firms' desire to locate
   close to their rivals whereas negative externalities such as competition
   explain their desire to avoid them. Within the ecological tradition,
   density dependence theory explains this relationship in terms of
   legitimation of an organizational form in a particular market and
   subsequently increased competition for resources there. Within new
   institutional theory, the presence of rivals is seen as a signal that a
   particular market is suitable for entry. Although generally quoted and
   mentioned in the literature, these four explanations have not been
   sufficiently separated to indicate whether these four mechanisms all
   operate simultaneously or whether one of them might account for the
   often found inverse-U-shaped relationship. Distinguishing firms with
   different strategies and using various moderators, we test the four
   explanations jointly and demonstrate their scope of operation.

AB Firms can invest to disclose quality information about their products to
   consumers, but consumers are not always perfectly attentive to these
   disclosures. Indeed, technologies such as digital video recorders have
   increased the ease with which disclosures can be avoided by consumers.
   Although such inattention may result in a consumer missing information
   from one or more competing firms, consumers who have missed disclosures
   might decide to search for quality information to become fully informed
   before making a purchase decision. In this paper we incorporate consumer
   attentiveness, as well as the related endogenous search decision, into a
   model of quality disclosure. Our results suggest that firms should
   disclose less quality information as the share of partially informed
   consumers (informed about one firm but not the other) increases, or as
   consumer search costs increase. We also provide insights into the
   potential impact of consumer trends toward lower attentiveness and lower

AB How will consumption patterns for popular and "long-tail" products
   change when consumers move from brick-and-mortar to Internet markets? We
   address this question using customer-level panel data obtained from a
   national video rental chain as it was closing many of its local stores.
   These data allow us to use the closure of a consumer's local video store
   as an instrument, breaking the inherent endogeneity between channel
   choice and product choice. Our results suggest that when consumers move
   from brick-and-mortar to online channels, they are significantly more
   likely to rent "niche" titles relative to "blockbusters." This suggests
   that a significant amount of niche product consumption online is due to
   the direct influence of the channel on consumer behavior, not just due
   to selection effects from the types of consumers who decide to use the
   Internet channel or the types of products that consumers decide to
   purchase online.

AB Disruptive innovations introduce a new performance dimension into a
   product category, but often suffer from inferior performance on key
   performance dimensions of their existing substitutes. Hence, the
   followers of these innovations face an important decision to make: they
   must choose to improve the new technology either on the key performance
   dimension shared with the old technology or on the new performance
   dimension. This paper investigates which path firms should choose when
   they face such a dilemma in the absence of any cost or capability
   issues. In doing so, we integrate customer response into the theory of
   technological evolution and allow preferences on the product choices to
   be context dependent. We show that context-dependent preferences may
   encourage the follower to improve the new technology on the new
   performance dimension. Later, we extend our game to a dynamic one and
   show that the context-dependent preferences may cause the pioneer to
   innovate less.

AB Most legal systems in the world follow the principle of corporate
   personhood, which grants organizations the same legal status as natural
   persons. Although debate over the notion of corporate personhood has
   been fierce, whether and how this principle is applied in people's
   beliefs and intuitions has yet to be empirically examined. This work
   addresses the gap in the literature, in the context of formal contracts.
   While contracts are typically seen as either morally binding promises or
   morally neutral business instruments, the data presented here show that
   contracts of individuals are associated more strongly with promises than
   are contracts of organizations. As a result, breach of contract by an
   individual is seen as a moral transgression. The same behavior by an
   organization, however, is viewed more as a legitimate business decision.
   This paper also finds that contractual obligations should be phrased in
   "promise" terms to eliminate this person organization discontinuity.

AB We measure the effects of pre- and postrelease blog volume, blog
   valence, and advertising on the performance of 75 movies in 208
   geographic markets in the United States. We attribute the variation in
   blog effects across markets to differences in demographic
   characteristics of markets combined with differences across demographic
   groups in their access and exposure to blogs as well as their
   responsiveness conditional on access. We study the effects of prerelease
   factors on opening day box office performance and of pre- and
   postrelease factors on box office performance one month after release.
   Our estimation accounts for confounding factors in the measurement of
   these effects via the use of instrumental variables. We find
   considerable heterogeneity in the effects across consumer- and
   firm-generated media and across geographic markets, with gender, income,
   race, and age driving across-market differences. Release day performance
   is impacted most by prerelease blog volume and advertising, whereas
   postrelease performance is influenced by postrelease blog valence and
   advertising. Across markets, there is more variance in advertising and
   blog valence (postrelease) elasticities than there is in blog volume
   (prerelease) elasticities. We identify the top 20 markets in terms of
   their elasticities to each of these three instruments. Further, we
   classify markets in terms of their sensitivities across these three
   instruments to identify the most sensitive markets that studios can
   target with their limited release strategies. Finally, we characterize
   the extent to which studios could have improved their limited release
   strategies by identifying the overlap between the actual release markets
   and the most responsive ones. We find that at the time of first-release
   studios cover only 53% of the most responsive advertising markets and
   44% of the most responsive markets to prerelease blog volume in their

   about people's perceptions about influenza and the vaccination against
   it. Results suggest that the optimal magnitude of the incentives should
   be greater when less contagious seasonal strains of influenza are
   involved and greater for the nonelderly population rather than the

AB Companies frequently expand their production capacity through the

   performance of existing units is affected by the acquisition of another
   unit. The research focuses on three mechanisms: managerial distraction,
   resource transfer, and knowledge sharing. These mechanisms are studied
   in the context of existing units and acquired units with different
   levels of proximity and similarity between them. Using a detailed data
   set from an agribusiness company, empirical analysis shows that after an
   acquisition event there is a temporary decrease in the performance of
   existing units that are geographically proximate to the acquired unit.
   Data analysis also shows that after an acquisition event there is an
   increase in the performance of existing units that have similar
   characteristics to the acquired unit. In this latter case, the rate of
   increase in performance diminishes over time. This research demonstrates
   that the acquisition of an organizational unit can have differing
   dynamic effects on different parts of the organization.

AB Software producers are making greater use of customer error reporting to
   discover defects and improve the quality of their products. We study how
   software development differences among producers (e.g., varying levels
   of process maturity) and software class and functionality differences
   (e.g., operating system versus productivity software) affect how these
   producers coordinate software release timing and pricing to optimally
   harness error reporting contributions from users. In settings where
   prices are fixed, we characterize the optimal release time and
   demonstrate why in some cases it can actually be preferable to delay
   release when customer error reporting rates increase. The manner in
   which a firm's optimal release time responds to increases in software
   functionality critically hinges on whether the added functionality
   enhances or dilutes user error reporting; in both cases, the effect of
   added functionality on release timing can go in either direction,
   depending on both firm and product market characteristics. For example,
   when processing costs are relatively large compared with goodwill costs,
   firms with lower process maturity will release earlier when per-module
   error reporting contributions become diluted and release later when
   these contributions become enhanced. We also examine how a firm adapts
   price with changes in error reporting levels and software functionality,
   and finally, we provide implications of how beta testing influences
   release timing.

AB In this paper, we show that slotting fees can be part of an equilibrium
   solution if per-unit downstream margin is smaller than the per-unit
   upstream margin. In recent literature, a similar margin-based argument
   is made by Klein and Wright (2007), whereas intense downstream retail
   competition coupled with high upstream margin causes upstream
   manufacturers to offer slotting fees for promotional shelf space. In
   this paper, we generalize this argument and show that it is possible to
   have the margin-based argument without any downstream retail competition
   and competition between products within a retail chain. Interestingly we
   show that slotting fees will be larger if the products sold by a
   retailer are complements rather than substitutes. Using a model. of a
   channel bargaining game, we also provide the necessary and sufficient
   conditions for the existence of slotting fees and show that for
   contracts with slotting fees under full vertical coordination, upstream
   marginal cost functions need to be increasing. Broadly, our findings
   provide new insights into the strategic role of downstream product
   assortment on equilibrium-marketing-channel contracts with slotting

AB The simultaneous production of different outputs (coproducts) is
   observed in the chemical, material, mineral, and semiconductor
   industries among others. Often, as with microprocessors, the outputs
   differ in quality in the vertical sense and firms classify the output
   into different grades (products). We analyze product line design and
   production for a firm operating a vertical coproduct technology. We
   examine how the product line and profit are influenced by the production
   cost and output distribution of the technology. We prove that production
   cost influences product line design in a fundamentally different manner
   for coproduct technologies than for uniproduct technologies where the
   firm can produce products independently. For example, with coproducts,
   the size and length of the product line can both increase in the
   production cost. Contrary to the oft-held view that variability is bad,
   we prove the firm benefits from a more variable output distribution if
   the production or classification cost is low enough.

AB We analyze the implications of the decision to spawn or to retain a new
   product for the nature and evolution of the firm. In our model, a new
   product is spawned if the fit between the product and its parent firm
   organization is not adequate. We focus on the impact of the firm's
   history of spawning decisions on firm characteristics such as size,
   focus, profitability, and innovativeness, and analyze its role in
   shaping firm dynamics. In accordance with the empirical literature, our
   model predicts that older firms innovate less, spawn less, are more
   diversified and less profitable, and that firms with more valuable
   general or specialized resources innovate and spawn more. Echoing
   seemingly contradictory empirical findings, our model predicts that
   small, focused firms (large, diversified firms) innovate and spawn more,
   and are more profitable when sample heterogeneity is driven by the
   importance of organizational fit (the value of general resources).

AB This paper studies the design of group-buying mechanisms in a two-period
   game where cohorts of consumers I arrive at a deal and make sign-up
   decisions sequentially. A firm can adopt either a sequential mechanism
   where the firm discloses to second-period arrivals the number of
   sign-ups accumulated in the first period, or a simultaneous mechanism
   where the firm does not post the number of first-period sign-ups and
   hence each cohort of consumers faces uncertainty about another cohort's
   size and valuations when making sign-up decisions. Our analysis shows
   that, compared with the simultaneous mechanism, the sequential mechanism
   leads to higher deal success rates and larger expected consumer
   surpluses. This result holds for a multiperiod extension and when the
   firm offers a price discount schedule with multiple breakpoints.
   Finally, when the firm can manage the sequence of arrivals, it should
   inform the smaller cohort of consumers first.

AB When designing contests to motivate employees, should managers organize
   employees to compete in teams or as individuals? We develop a behavioral
   economics model that shows that if contestants are averse to being
   responsible for the team's loss, a team-based (TB) contest can yield
   higher effort than an individual-based (IB) contest. This prediction is
   contrary to those of standard economics models, which favor IB contests
   over TB contests. We test the competing predictions using laboratory
   economics experiments. The results show that when contestants do not
   know each other, average effort levels in the TB and TB contests are not
   different. When contestants are allowed to socialize with potential
   teammates before making effort decisions, TB contests yield higher
   effort relative to TB contests. We also show that the relative efficacy
   of TB contests is driven by contestants' aversion to letting their team
   down.

   sponsors and sponsors' competitors. In the 10-15 trading days after the
   onset of the scandal, the full portfolio of sponsors lost more than 2%
   of market value, with losses concentrated among the core three sponsors:
   Electronic Arts, Nike, and PepsiCo (Gatorade). Sponsors' day-by-day
   losses correlate strongly with Google search intensity regarding the
   endorsement-related impact of the scandal, as well as with qualitative
   indicators of "endorsement-related news." At least some sponsors' losses
   were competitors' gains, suggesting that endorsement deals are partially
   a business-stealing strategy. However, competitors who were themselves
   celebrity endorsement intensive fared relatively worse than those who
   were not endorsement intensive, and that difference also correlates day
   by day with news/search intensity regarding the scandal. It appears that
   the scandal sent a negative marketwide signal about the reputation risk
   associated with celebrity endorsements.

   experimentally the role of status-seeking behavior in sabotage and
   cheating activities aiming at improving one's performance ranking in a
   flat-wage environment. We find that average effort is higher when
   individuals are informed about their relative performance. However,
   ranking feedback also favors disreputable behavior. Some individuals do
   not hesitate to incur a cost to improve their rank by sabotaging others'
   work or by increasing artificially their own performance. Introducing
   sabotage opportunities has a strong detrimental effect on performance.
   Therefore, ranking incentives should be used with care. Inducing group
   identity discourages sabotage among peers but increases in-group

AB This paper investigates how institutions governing the employment
   relationship influence firms' adaptation to environmental changes. After
   the Berlin Wall fell, migration from East Germany accounted for an
   abrupt increase in the supply of a key resource-labor-in the West. I
   study responses to this disruption among firms in the economically
   important machinery and equipment industry. I find that western firms
   adapted to migration by increasing employment unless they were
   affiliated with a works council, an institution that limits the firm's
   autonomy in managing its workforce. I also find evidence of
   institution-contingent responses to migration in two areas of firm
   strategy: vertical boundaries and the focus on exploration versus
   exploitation. The results suggest that "hybrid" (i.e., less
   hierarchical) governance institutions increase adaptation costs. The
   results also indicate that such adaptation costs have implications for
   multiple aspects of firm decision making that are nominally beyond the
   scope of those governance institutions.

AB This paper documents that mutual funds "herd" (trade together) into
   stocks with consensus sell-side analyst upgrades, and herd out of stocks
   with consensus downgrades. This influence of analyst recommendation
   changes on fund herding is stronger for downgrades, and among managers
   with greater career concerns. These findings indicate that
   career-concerned managers are incentivized to follow analyst
   information, and that managers have a greater tendency to herd on
   negative stock information, given the greater reputational and
   litigation risk of holding losing stocks. Furthermore, starting in the
   mid-1990s (when aggregate mutual fund equity ownership is significantly
   higher), stocks traded by career-concerned herds of fund managers in
   response to analyst recommendation changes experience a significant
   same-quarter price impact, followed by a sharp subsequent price
   reversal. Our evidence suggests that analyst recommendation revisions
   induce herding by career-concerned fund managers, and that this type of
   trading has become price destabilizing with the increasing level of
   mutual fund ownership of stocks.

AB In a market context, a status effect occurs when actors are accorded
   differential recognition for their efforts depending on their location
   in a status ordering, holding constant the quality of these efforts. In
   practice, because it is very difficult to measure quality, this ceteris
   paribus proviso often precludes convincing empirical assessments of the
   magnitude of status effects. We address this problem by examining the
   impact of a major status-conferring prize that shifts actors' positions
   in a prestige ordering. Specifically, using a precisely constructed
   matched sample, we estimate the effect of a scientist becoming a Howard
   Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator on citations to articles
   the scientist published before the prize was awarded. We do find
   evidence of a postappointment citation boost, but the effect is small
   and limited to a short window of time. Consistent with theories of
   status, however, the effect of the prize is significantly larger when
   there is uncertainty about article quality, and when prize winners are
   of (relatively) low status at the time of election to the HHMI
   Investigator Program.

AB This paper formalizes and adapts the well-known concept of Pareto
   efficiency in the context of the popular robust optimization (RO)
   methodology for linear optimization problems. We argue that the
   classical RO paradigm need not produce solutions that possess the
   associated property of Pareto optimality, and we illustrate via examples
   how this could lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance in
   practice. We provide a basic theoretical characterization of Pareto
   robustly optimal (PRO) solutions and extend the RO framework by
   proposing practical methods that verify Pareto optimality and generate
   solutions that are PRO. Critically important, our methodology involves
   solving optimization problems that are of the same complexity as the
   underlying robust problems; hence, the potential improvements from our
   framework come at essentially limited extra computational cost. We
   perform numerical experiments drawn from three different application
   areas (portfolio optimization, inventory management, and project
   management), which demonstrate that PRO solutions have a significant
   potential upside compared with solutions obtained using classical RO
   methods.

   each viewer is interested in a limited set of topics and that her
   utility only comes from the "most interesting" news she observes. The
   key questions we address are as follows: (a) Should firms adopt designs
   that facilitate the delivery of more information in their news
   programmes? (b) Does the decision of firms to implement such strategies
   depend on the complexity of the news programme (i.e., the number of news
   stories covered in the news product)? (c) How do such strategies
   influence competition? We show that firms may or may not benefit by
   providing better-designed news. The incentive to do this is strongly
   affected by the complexity of the news product and the intensity of

   research in marketing. I propose a dynamic investment-based model to
   understand the impact of advertising expenditures on stock returns and
   firm value. In addition, by interpreting advertising expenditures as an
   investment in brand capital, the approach in this paper provides a novel
   way to measure brand equity grounded in economic theory. Using the Euler
   equations from the firm's maximization problem, I derive closed-form
   expressions for the firm's equilibrium stock returns and market value,
   which depend on observable firm characteristics. I test the model's
   predictions by the generalized method of moments and data from a large
   cross section of publicly traded firms. The model is able to match
   simultaneously the pattern of average stock returns and firm values of
   portfolios sorted on advertising expenditures that standard asset
   pricing models cannot. The estimation results also show that brand
   equity accounts for a substantial fraction of firm market value (about
   23%), and that this value varies substantially across industries.
   Implications of the findings for research at the intersection of
   marketing and finance are discussed.

   price booms and busts. Particular attention is given to the interplay
   between imperfect information about real economic activity, including
   supply, demand, and inventory accumulation, and speculative activity in
   oil markets. Furthermore, I present new evidence that there were
   economically and statistically significant effects of investor flows on
   futures prices, after controlling for returns in the United States and
   emerging-economy stock markets, a measure of the balance sheet
   flexibility of large financial institutions, open interest, the
   futures/spot basis, and lagged returns on oil futures. The largest

AB We study how corporate governance affects firm value through the
   decision of whether to fire or retain the chief executive officer (CEO).
   We present a model in which weak governance-which prevents shareholders
   from controlling the board-protects inferior CEOs from dismissal, while
   at the same time insulates the board from pressures by biased or
   uninformed shareholders. Whether stronger governance improves
   retain/replace decisions depends on which of these effects dominates. We
   use our theoretical framework to assess the effect of governance on the
   quality of firing and hiring decisions using data on the CEO dismissals
   of large U.S. corporations during 1994-2007. Our findings are most
   consistent with a beneficent effect of weak governance on CEO dismissal
   decisions, suggesting that insulation from shareholder pressure may
   allow for better long-term decision making.

   believed to be an important mechanism by which IT-related innovations
   diffuse throughout the economy. We use a newly developed source of
   employee microdata-an online resume database-to model IT workers'
   mobility patterns. We find that firms derive significant productivity
   benefits from the IT investments of other firms from which they hire IT
   labor. Our estimates indicate that over the last two decades,
   productivity spillovers from the IT investments of other firms
   transmitted through this channel have contributed 20%-30% as much to
   productivity growth as firms' own IT investments. Moreover, we find that
   the productivity benefits of locating near other IT-intensive firms can
   primarily be explained by the mobility of technical workers within the
   region. Our results are unique to the flow of IT workers among firms,
   not other occupations, which rules out some alternative explanations
   related to the similarity of firms that participate in the same labor

   the takeover is positive and larger for peer firms with higher capital

AB How do firms respond to entry in multi-sided markets? We address this
   question by studying the impact of Craigslist, a website providing
   classified-advertising services, on local U.S. newspapers. We exploit
   temporal and geographical variation in Craigslist's entry to show that
   newspapers with greater reliance on classified-ad revenue experience a
   larger drop in classified-ad rates after Craigslist's entry. The impact
   of Craigslist's entry on the classified-ad side appears to propagate to
   other sides of the newspapers' market. On the subscriber side, these
   newspapers experience an increase in subscription prices, a decrease in
   circulation, and an increase in differentiation from each other. On the
   display-ad side, affected newspapers experience a decrease in display-ad
   rates. We also find evidence that affected newspapers are less likely to
   make their content available online. Finally, we estimate that
   Craigslist's entry leads to $5.0 billion (year 2000 dollars) in savings
   to classified-ad buyers during 2000-2007.

AB A method for computing forward-looking market risk premium is developed
   in this paper. We first derive a theoretical expression that links
   forward-looking risk premium to investors' risk aversion and
   forward-looking volatility, skewness, and kurtosis of cumulative return.
   In addition, investors' risk aversion is theoretically linked to
   volatility spread, defined as the gap between the risk- neutral
   volatility deduced from option data and the physical return volatility
   exhibited by return data. The volatility spread formula serves as the
   basis for using the generalized method of moments to estimate investors'
   risk aversion. We adopt the generalized autoregressive conditional
   heteroskedasticity model for the physical return process and estimate
   the model using the S&P 500 daily index returns and then deduce the
   forward-looking variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the corresponding
   cumulative return. The forward-looking risk premiums are estimated
   monthly over the sample period of 2001-2010, and all are found to be
   positive. Furthermore, two asset pricing tests are conducted. First,
   change in forward-looking risk premiums is negatively related to the S&P
   500 holding period return, reflecting that an increase in discount rate
   reduces current stock prices. Second, market illiquidity positively
   affects forward-looking risk premium, indicating that forward-looking
   risk premium contains an illiquidity risk premium component.

AB The well-known economic theory predicts that consumer price will fall
   after a horizontal merger when the amount of marginal cost reduction
   from operating synergies exceeds the premerger markup of a merging firm.
   However, when a horizontal merger occurs in a multitier decentralized
   supply chain where a finite number of firms compete at each tier, we
   show that this result holds only when a merger occurs at the tier that
   acts as the leader in the supply chain. In this supply chain, a
   horizontal merger at any other tier will decrease consumer price when
   the cost reduction exceeds a certain threshold that is larger than the
   premerger markup. Moreover, this threshold is increasing as the supply
   chain gets longer and can be substantially larger than the premerger
   markup. When accounting for subsequent entry after a merger in long-run
   equilibrium, contrary to a common belief, a larger synergy from a merger
   does not necessarily benefit consumers more.

AB When manufacturers do not have sufficient capacity to meet demand and
   cannot increase prices, they have to determine other methods to allocate
   goods among retailers. A common allocation mechanism is based on a
   retailer's sales history: a retailer that has ordered larger quantities
   in the past should get a greater allocation than a retailer that has
   historically ordered smaller quantities. This mechanism, known as a
   turn-and-earn allocation rule, is commonly used in many industries such
   as automobiles, microprocessors, video game consoles, etc. The existing
   literature has considered the effect of turn-and-earn allocation rules
   when a manufacturer sells a single product. However, when we consider a
   product line, it is not clear whether the manufacturer is better off
   basing its allocation on the sales history of the entire product line or
   solely on the sales history of the product in short supply. In
   particular, a shortage of one product can lead retailers and consumers
   to move toward other products in the line. This, in turn, can have an
   effect on the manufacturer's optimal allocation mechanism. We examine
   this issue by developing a model of a supplier selling two substitutable
   goods through two retailers. Within this setup, we introduce a general
   turn-and-earn allocation rule that allows the entire sales history to
   influence allocation levels. Counter to previous work, we show that
   certain turn-and-earn rules not only help the manufacturer but can also
   help the retailer and increase total supply chain profits.

AB In a repeat business context, past experiences with a service provider
   affect customers' decisions to renew their contract. How should a
   strategic firm manage customized service over time to maximize the
   long-term value from each customer relationship? We propose a dynamic
   model that relies on behavioral theories and empirical evidence to
   capture the effect of past service experiences on service quality
   expectations, customer satisfaction, and retention. Although firms can
   benefit from managing service expectations at the beginning of a
   relationship, we find that varying service in the long run is not
   optimal. Behavioral regularities explain the structure of optimal
   service policies and limit the value of responsive service. Loss
   aversion expands the range of optimal constant policies; however, if
   satisfying experiences are more salient, then firms should constantly
   vary service levels. Loyal or high-margin customers need not warrant
   better service; those who anchor less on past service experiences
   do-provided that retention is improved by better past experiences. The
   effect of customer memory on service levels is determined by whether
   habituation or rather goodwill drives defection decisions.

   whether a penalty is imposed for a wrong answer and the salience of the

   there is a penalty for wrong answers, women answer significantly fewer
   questions than men. We see no differences in knowledge of the material
   or confidence in the test takers, and differences in risk preferences
   explain less than half of the observed gap. Making the evaluative aspect
   of the test more salient does not impact the gender gap. We show that,

AB Prior literature has shown that, for a symmetric information setting,
   supplier encroachment into a reseller's market can mitigate double
   marginalization and benefit both the supplier and the reseller. This
   paper extends the investigation of supplier encroachment to the
   environment where the reseller might be better informed than the
   supplier. We find that the launch of the supplier's direct channel can
   result in costly signaling behavior on the part of the reseller, in
   which he reduces his order quantity when the market size is small. Such
   a downward order distortion can amplify double marginalization. As a
   result, in addition to the "win-win" and "win-lose" outcomes for the
   supplier and the reseller, supplier encroachment can also lead to
   "lose-lose" and "lose-win" outcomes, particularly when the reseller has
   a significant efficiency advantage in the selling process and the prior
   probability of a large market is low. We further explore the
   implications of those findings for information management in supply
   chains. Complementing the conventional understanding, we show that with
   the ability to encroach, the supplier may prefer to sell to either a
   better informed or an uninformed reseller in different scenarios. On the
   other hand, as a result of a supplier developing encroachment
   capability, a reseller either may choose not to develop an advanced
   informational capability or may become more willing to find a means of
   credibly sharing his information.

AB We introduce an alternative to the popular linear opinion pool for
   combining individual probability forecasts. One of the well-known
   problems with the linear opinion pool is that it can be poorly
   calibrated. It tends toward underconfidence as the crowd's diversity
   increases, i.e., as the variance in the individuals' means increases. To
   address this calibration problem, we propose the exterior-trimmed
   opinion pool. To form this pool, forecasts with low and high means, or
   cumulative distribution function (cdf) values, are trimmed away from a
   linear opinion pool. Exterior trimming decreases the pool's variance and
   improves its calibration. A linear opinion pool, however, will remain
   overconfident when individuals are overconfident and not very diverse.
   For these situations, we suggest trimming away forecasts with moderate
   means or cdf values. This interior trimming increases variance and
   reduces overconfidence. Using probability forecast data from U.S. and
   European Surveys of Professional Forecasters, we present empirical
   evidence that trimmed opinion pools can outperform the linear opinion
   pool.

AB Many firms today manage their existing customers differentially based on
   profit potential, providing fewer incentives to less profitable
   customers and firing unprofitable customers. Although researchers and
   industry experts advocate this practice, results have been mixed. We
   examine this practice explicitly accounting for competition and find
   that some conventional prescriptions may not always hold. We analyze a
   setting where customers differ in their cost to serve. We find that when
   a firm can discriminate among its customers but the rival cannot,
   customer base composition influences the rival's poaching behavior.
   Consequently, even though a low-cost customer is more profitable when
   viewed in isolation, a high-cost customer may be strategically more
   valuable by discouraging poaching. Therefore, contrary to conventional
   advice, it can be profitable for a firm to retain unprofitable
   customers. Moreover, some customers may become more valuable to retain
   and receive better incentives when they are less profitable. We further
   show that, in competitive settings, traditional customer lifetime value
   metrics may lead to poor retention decisions because they do not account
   for the competitive externality that actions toward some customers
   impose on the cash flows from other customers. Our results suggest that
   firms may need to evolve from a segmentation mindset, which views each
   customer in isolation, to a customer portfolio mindset, which recognizes
   that the value of different customers is interlinked.

AB This study develops optimal transfer pricing schemes that manage
   software reuse in incremental software development, namely, a
   development regime wherein users begin utilizing parts of the system
   that are released to them even before the system is entirely completed.
   In this setting, conflicts can arise between developers and users from
   divergent interests concerning the release of functionalities in the
   project. The release of functionalities is influenced by reuse, i.e.,
   the effort spent by the development team to write code that can be
   reused within the same project or in future projects. For example, the
   development team may choose to spend extra effort to make certain
   portions of the system reusable because doing so could reduce the effort
   needed to develop the entire system. However, the additional effort
   spent on reuse could delay the release of certain critical
   functionality, making such a strategy suboptimal for the users. Thus,
   optimal reuse decisions for developers and users could be different. In
   addition, from the firm's perspective, reuse decisions must not only
   balance the objectives of developers and users for the current project,
   but reuse effort may be spent to benefit future projects. Our study also
   highlights the fact that reuse may not always be beneficial for the
   firm. To this end, we consider different instances of the user-developer
   conflict and provide transfer pricing schemes that operate under
   information asymmetry and achieve two key properties: firm-level
   optimality and truth revelation.

   Nevertheless, the majority of principals were reluctant to change their
   mind and adopt the agent's proposal. Our results suggest that the
   ability to change one's own mind is an important dimension of managerial
   success.

AB Price delegation to the salesforce is a practice widely adopted by
   firms. This paper examines the relationship between price delegation and
   managerial profits using a laboratory economics experiment. A novel
   feature of our experiment is that we study how varying the relationship
   organization of the sales manager and salesperson to allow for (1)
   requests by the salesperson for the manager to choose price delegation,
   and for (2) the manager to award a small bonus after observing the
   salesperson's decisions, can affect behavior. The results show that,
   contrary to the theoretical prediction, managers choose price delegation
   frequently and salespeople respond reciprocally, leading to higher
   manager profits under price delegation. Moreover, this behavior
   increases when requests and bonuses are allowed. We show that a
   behavioral economics model that incorporates positive reciprocity can
   explain these results well.

AB In this paper, we study how social planners should exploit social
   comparisons to pursue their objectives. We consider two modes of social
   comparison, referred to as behind-averse and ahead-seeking behaviors,
   depending on whether individuals experience a utility loss from
   underperforming or a utility gain from overperforming relative to their
   peers. Modeling social comparison as a game between players, we find
   that ahead-seeking behavior leads to output polarization, whereas
   behind-averse behavior leads to output clustering. A social planner can
   mitigate these effects in two ways: (i) by providing the full reference
   distribution of outputs instead of an aggregate reference point based on
   the average output and (ii) by assigning players into uniform rather
   than diverse reference groups. Social planners may thus need to tailor
   the reference structure to the predominant mode of social comparison and
   their objective. A performance-focused social planner may set the
   reference structure so as to maximize the output of either the top or
   the bottom player depending on whether she puts greater marginal weight
   to larger or smaller outputs. When the social planner also cares about
   utility, she faces a dilemma because performance optimization may not be
   aligned with utility maximization. Inevitably, the social planner will
   have to confront equity issues because better performance may not
   reflect greater effort or greater ability.

   demand more money for relinquishing owned goods than one is willing to
   pay for the same goods-fails to emerge when sellers are not fully
   depleted of their endowment. This finding is incompatible with prospect
   theory's account of the effect as stemming primarily from aversion to
   loss relative to the individual's current state. We suggest a new
   account of the endowment effect as reflecting the human aversion to
   "giving it all up" rather than simply an aversion to incurring any loss
   relative to the status quo. Experiments 1 and 2 show the effect
   employing a pricing paradigm. Experiment 3 examines what constitutes

AB A unique challenge in information security outsourcing is that neither
   the outsourcing firm nor the managed security service provider (MSSP)
   perfectly observes the outcome, the occurrence of a security breach, of
   prevention effort. Detection of security breaches often requires
   specialized effort. The current practice is to outsource both prevention
   and detection to the same MSSP. Some security experts have advocated
   outsourcing prevention and detection to different MSSPs. We show that
   the former outsourcing contract leads to a significant disincentive to
   provide detection effort. The latter contract alleviates this problem
   but introduces misalignment of incentives between the firm and the MSSPs
   and eliminates the advantages offered by complementarity between
   prevention and detection functions, which may lead to a worse outcome
   than the current contract. We propose a new contract that is superior to
   these two on various dimensions.

AB Stock returns unexplained by "fundamentals," such as cash flow news, are
   more likely to reverse in the short run than those linked to fundamental
   news. Making novel use of analyst forecast revisions to measure cash
   flow news, a simple enhanced reversal strategy generates a risk-adjusted
   return four times the size of the standard reversal strategy.
   Importantly, isolating the component of past returns not driven by
   fundamentals provides a cleaner setting for testing existing theories of
   short-term reversals. Using this approach, we find that both liquidity
   shocks and investor sentiment contribute to the observed short-term
   reversal, but in different ways: Specifically, the reversal profit is
   attributable to liquidity shocks on the long side because fire sales
   more likely demand liquidity, and it is attributable to investor
   sentiment on the short side because short-sale constraints prevent the
   immediate elimination of overvaluation.

   we examine the pricing implications of informed trading in corporate
   bonds and its ability to predict corporate defaults. We find that
   microstructure measures of information asymmetry seem to capture adverse
   selection in corporate bond trading reasonably well. We demonstrate that
   information asymmetry in bond trading has explanatory power for
   corporate bond yield spreads, and this result holds after controlling
   for the transaction costs of liquidity, credit risk, and other
   traditional bond pricing factors. Furthermore, information asymmetry can
   help forecast corporate defaults after conditioning on other default
   prediction variables. Such forecasting ability of informed bond trading
   is especially useful for private firms because the bond market
   constitutes the only venue for informed traders to exploit their
   information advantages.

AB This paper develops a new way to help solve difficult linear and
   nonlinear discrete-optimization decision models more efficiently by
   introducing a problem-difficulty metric that uses the concept of entropy
   from information theory. Our entropy metric is employed to devise rules
   for problem partitioning within an implicit enumeration method, where
   branching is accomplished based on the subproblem complexity. The only
   requirement for applying our metric is the availability of (upper)
   bounds on branching subproblems, which are often computed within most
   implicit enumeration methods such as branch-and-bound (or
   cutting-plane-based) methods. Focusing on problems with a relatively
   small number of constraints, but with a large number of variables, we
   develop a hybrid partitioning and enumeration solution scheme by
   combining the entropic approach with the recently developed improved
   surrogate constraint (ISC) method to produce the new method we call
   ISCENT. Our computational results indicate that ISCENT can be an order
   of magnitude more efficient than commercial solvers, such as CPLEX, for
   convex instances with no more than eight constraints. Furthermore, for
   nonconvex instances, ISCENT is shown to be significantly more efficient
   than other standard global solvers.

AB This paper examines how the optimal investment in the capacity of
   flexible and nonflexible resources is affected by financial leverage
   and, conversely, how a firm's resource flexibility affects its optimal
   capital structure. We consider a two-product firm that invests in the
   optimal capacity of product-flexible and product-dedicated resources in
   the presence of demand uncertainty. Before investing in capacity, the
   firm issues the optimal amount of debt, trading off the tax benefit and
   lower transaction cost of debt financing against the cost of financial
   distress and the agency cost associated with leverage. We show that in
   the presence of debt, resource flexibility has benefits in addition to
   reducing the mismatch between supply and demand. Namely, resource
   flexibility mitigates the shareholder-debtholder agency conflict as well
   as the risk of costly default. Most interestingly, we show that resource
   flexibility mitigates the underinvestment problem because it reduces the
   probability that a firm will go bankrupt with some of its capacity being
   fully utilized. When lenders anticipate that a firm will choose a
   relatively flexible capacity mix, they should provide more favorable
   credit terms, to which the firm should respond by issuing more debt. The
   main empirical predictions are that resource flexibility is negatively
   related to the cost of borrowing and positively related to debt.

AB The integration of systems for pricing and revenue management must trade
   off potential revenue gains against significant practical and technical
   challenges. This dilemma motivates us to investigate the value of
   coordinating decisions on prices and capacity allocation in a stylized
   setting. We propose two pairs of sequential policies for making static
   decisions-on pricing and revenue management-that differ in their degree
   of integration (hierarchical versus coordinated) and their pricing
   inputs (deterministic versus stochastic). For a large class of
   stochastic, price-dependent demand models, we prove that these four
   heuristics admit tractable solutions satisfying intuitive sensitivity
   properties. We further evaluate numerically the performance of these
   policies relative to a fully coordinated model, which is generally
   intractable. We find it interesting that near-optimal performance is
   usually achieved by a simple hierarchical policy that sets prices first,
   based on a nonnested stochastic model, and then uses these prices to
   optimize nested capacity allocation. This tractable policy largely
   outperforms its counterpart based on a deterministic pricing model.
   Jointly optimizing price and allocation decisions for the high-end
   segment improves performance, but the largest revenue benefits stem from
   adjusting prices to account for demand risk.

   place manipulative orders, reducing the credibility of preplay

AB Price experimentation is an important tool for firms to find the optimal
   selling price of their products. It should be conducted properly, since
   experimenting with selling prices can be costly. A firm, therefore,
   needs to find a pricing policy that optimally balances between learning
   the optimal price and gaining revenue. In this paper, we propose such a
   pricing policy, called controlled variance pricing (CVP). The key idea
   of the policy is to enhance the certainty equivalent pricing policy with
   a taboo interval around the average of previously chosen prices. The
   width of the taboo interval shrinks at an appropriate rate as the amount
   of data gathered gets large; this guarantees sufficient price
   dispersion. For a large class of demand models, we show that this
   procedure is strongly consistent, which means that eventually the value
   of the optimal price will be learned, and derive upper bounds on the
   regret, which is the expected amount of money lost due to not using the
   optimal price. Numerical tests indicate that CVP performs well on
   different demand models and time scales.

AB In practice, some well-established service providers (sellers) offer
   one-time experiences or product demonstrations for the services that
   have been introduced to the market for years. Such activities, labeled
   as seller-induced learning, not only help the consumers learn more about
   themselves but also exploit the consumers by elaborating on the consumer
   heterogeneity. When the seller-induced learning completely resolves the
   consumers' valuation uncertainty, it can facilitate a more sophisticated
   price discrimination scheme and may give rise to a relatively more
   efficient allocation. Nevertheless, if there is residual valuation
   uncertainty, the seller may abandon the seller-induced learning to avoid
   the exacerbated ex post cannibalization. We show that an exploding offer
   shall sometimes be offered in conjunction with the seller-induced
   learning to encourage immediate purchases when uncertainty arises in
   only some consumers. We identify regimes under which the seller-induced
   learning is charged at a strictly positive price. Under these regimes,
   the seller need not sacrifice the ex post efficiency upon inducing
   consumer learning. Therefore, our result indicates that the
   seller-induced learning may eliminate the conflict between rent
   extraction and efficiency initiatives. However, quality distortion
   prevails when the seller provides an identical menu for all the
   consumers or the free seller-induced learning.

   for the heterogeneous life span faced by consumers of different ages,
   and hence measure adoption costs more accurately. Moreover, our
   framework can recover the monetary value of total adoption costs. To
   estimate our model, we use an Italian panel data set, which contains
   information on consumers' adoption decisions for ATM cards, and their
   cash withdrawal patterns before and after adoption. Our results suggest
   that one could significantly overestimate adoption costs for the elderly
   when ignoring their shorter life span. Our policy experiments show that
   a sign-up bonus targeted to the elderly could be much more effective if
   implemented as a limited-time offer rather than a permanent offer.
   Interestingly, if the sign-up bonus is permanent, younger consumers may

AB Most real-world optimization problems are multiobjective by nature,
   involving noncomparable objectives. Many of these problems can be
   formulated in terms of a set of linear objective functions that should
   be simultaneously optimized over a class of linear constraints. Often
   there is the complicating factor that some of the variables are required
   to be integral. The resulting class of problems is named multiobjective
   mixed integer programming (MOMIP) problems. Solving these kinds of
   optimization problems exactly requires a method that can generate the
   whole set of nondominated points (the Pareto-optimal front). In this
   paper, we first give a survey of the newly developed branch and bound
   methods for solving MOMIP problems. After that, we propose a new branch
   and bound method for solving a subclass of MOMIP problems, where only
   two objectives are allowed, the integer variables are binary, and one of
   the two objectives has only integer variables. The proposed method is
   able to find the full set of nondominated points. It is tested on a
   large number of problem instances, from six different classes of MOMIP
   problems. The results reveal that the developed biobjective branch and
   bound method performs better on five of the six test problems, compared
   with a generic two-phase method. At this time, the two-phase method is
   the most preferred exact method for solving MOMIP problems with two
   criteria and binary variables.

AB Frequent product introductions emphasize the importance of product
   rollover strategies. With single rollover, when a new product is
   introduced, the old product is phased out from the market. With dual
   rollover, the old product remains in the market along with the new
   product. Anticipating the introduction of the new product and the
   potential markdown of the old product, strategic customers may delay
   their purchases. We study the interaction between product rollover
   strategies and strategic customer purchasing behavior and find that
   single rollover is more valuable when the new product's innovation is
   low and the number of strategic customers is high. Interestingly and
   counter to intuition, the firm may have to charge a lower price for the
   old product as well as receive a lower profit with a higher value
   disposal (outside) option for the old product under single rollover.
   Facing a market composed of both strategic and myopic customers, the
   firm does not necessarily reduce the stocking level as more myopic
   customers become strategic.

   However, in a unique symmetric experiment that isolates the effect of
   market origin, we find evidence for the opposite: Although solutions
   provided by problem solvers from analogous markets show lower potential
   for immediate use, they demonstrate substantially higher levels of
   novelty. Also, compared to established novelty drivers, this effect
   appears highly relevant from a managerial perspective: we find that
   including problem solvers from analogous markets versus the target
   market accounts for almost two-thirds of the well-known effect of
   involving lead users instead of average problem solvers. This effect is
   further amplified when the analogous distance between the markets
   increases, i.e., when searching in far versus near analogous markets.
   Finally, results indicate that the analogous market effect is
   particularly strong in the upper tail of the novelty distribution, which
   again underscores the effect's practical importance. All of this
   suggests that it might pay to systematically search across firm-external
   sources of innovation that were formerly out of scope for most managers.

AB Personalization is becoming ubiquitous on the World Wide Web. Such
   systems use statistical techniques to infer a customer's preferences and
   recommend content best suited to him (e.g., "Customers who liked this
   also liked ..."). A debate has emerged as to whether personalization has
   drawbacks. By making the Web hyperspecific to our interests, does it
   fragment Internet users, reducing shared experiences and narrowing media
   consumption? We study whether personalization is in fact fragmenting the
   online population. Surprisingly, it does not appear to do so in our
   study. Personalization appears to be a tool that helps users widen their
   interests, which in turn creates commonality with others. This increase
   in commonality occurs for two reasons, which we term volume and
   product-mix effects. The volume effect is that consumers simply consume
   more after personalized recommendations, increasing the chance of having
   more items in common. The product-mix effect is that, conditional on
   volume, consumers buy a more similar mix of products after
   recommendations.

AB Top management structures in large U.S. firms have changed significantly
   since the mid-1980s. The size of the executive team-the group of
   managers reporting directly to the CEO-doubled during this period. This
   growth was driven primarily by an increase in functional managers rather
   than general managers, a phenomenon we term "functional centralization."
   Using panel data on senior management positions, we show that changes in
   the structure of the executive team are tightly linked to changes in
   firm diversification and information technology investments. These
   relationships depend crucially on the function involved; those closer to
   the product ("product" functions, e.g., marketing and R&D) behave
   differently from functions further from the product ("administrative"
   functions, e.g., finance, law, and human resources). We argue that this
   distinction is driven by differences in the information-processing
   activities associated with each function and apply this insight to
   refine and extend existing theories of centralization. We also discuss
   the implications of our results for organizational forms beyond the
   executive team.

AB Data obtained from monthly Gallup/UBS surveys from 1998 to 2007 and from
   a special supplement to the Michigan Surveys of Consumer Attitudes and
   Behavior, run in 22 monthly surveys between 2000 and 2005, are used to
   analyze stock market beliefs and portfolio choices of household
   investors. We show that the key variables found to be positive
   predictors of actual stock returns in the asset-pricing literature are
   also highly correlated with investor's subjective expected returns, but
   with the opposite sign. Moreover, our analysis of the microdata
   indicates that subjective expectations of both risk and returns on
   stocks are strongly influenced by perceptions of economic conditions. In
   particular, when investors believe macroeconomic conditions are more
   expansionary, they tend to expect both higher returns and lower
   volatility. This is difficult to reconcile with the canonical view that
   expected returns on stocks rise during recessions to compensate
   household investors for increased exposure or sensitivity to
   macroeconomic risks. Finally, the relevance of these investors'
   subjective expectations is supported by the finding of a significant
   link between their expectations and portfolio choices. In particular, we
   show that portfolio equity positions tend to be higher for those
   respondents that anticipate higher expected returns or lower
   uncertainty.

   patent citations. We construct a firm-year panel data set of all venture
   capital-backed biotechnology firms founded between 1980 and 2000,

   self-selection into exit mode by using coarsened exact matching, and in
   two additional ways: (1) comparing firms that filed for an IPO (or
   announced a merger) with those not completing the transaction for
   reasons unrelated to innovation, and (2) using an instrumental variables
   approach. We find that innovation quality is highest under private
   ownership and lowest under public ownership, with acquisition
   intermediate between the two. Together with a set of within-exit mode
   analyses, these results are consistent with the proposition that
   information confidentiality mechanisms shape innovation outcomes. The
   results are not explained by inventor-level turnover following exit

AB We test whether the well-documented high returns of private equity
   sponsors result from wealth transfers from other financial claimants and
   counterparties and from a focus on short-term profits at the expense of
   long-term value. Debt investors who finance buyouts, as well as buyers
   of private equity portfolio companies, represent the two potential
   sources of wealth transfers. However, we find that, on average, public
   companies benefit when they buy financial sponsors' portfolio companies,
   experiencing positive abnormal returns upon the announcement of the
   acquisition and long-run posttransaction abnormal returns
   indistinguishable from zero. We further find that large portfolio
   company payouts to private equity on average have no relation to future
   portfolio company distress, suggesting that debt investors are not
   suffering systematic wealth losses either. However, we find some
   evidence of wealth transfers from both strategic buyers and debt
   investors in some special situations. Finally, we find that portfolio
   companies invest no differently than a matched sample of public control
   firms, even when they are not profitable, an observation inconsistent
   with short-termism.

AB We present a simple model for decision making under uncertainty building
   on dual-process theories from psychology, and use it to illustrate a
   possible component of intuitive decision making of particular relevance
   for managerial settings. Decisions are the result of the interaction
   between two decision processes. The first one captures optimization
   based on Bayesian updating of beliefs. The second corresponds to a form
   of reinforcement learning capturing the tendency to rely on past
   performance. The model predicts that (i) in the case of conflict between
   the two processes, correct responses are associated with longer response
   times, but (ii) if both processes are aligned, errors are slower.
   Furthermore, (iii) response times in the case of conflict are longer
   than in the case of alignment. We confirm the predictions of the model
   in an experiment using a paradigm where an associative win-stay,
   lose-shift process conflicted with rational belief updating.

AB Recent financial studies often assume that agents have Epstein-Zin
   preferences-preferences that require agents to care about when
   uncertainty is resolved. Under this "recursive-preference" framework,
   the preference for uncertainty resolution is entirely determined by an
   agent's preferences for risk and intertemporal substitution. To test the
   implications of this model, this paper presents an experiment designed
   to elicit subject preferences on risk, time, intertemporal substitution,
   and uncertainty resolution. Results reveal that most subjects prefer
   early resolution of uncertainty and have relative risk aversion greater
   than the reciprocal of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution,
   consistent with the predictions by recursive preferences. Subjects are
   classified in a finite mixture model by their risk, time, and
   intertemporal-substitution parameters. Regression results show that
   types predicted by the Epstein-Zin model to prefer early resolution
   choose early resolution with 20%-50% higher probability.

AB After the completion of a merger and acquisition (M&A) transaction, the
   target firm is delisted, but some analysts who covered it retain
   coverage of the merged firm. We hypothesize that this decision is based
   on two factors: the analyst's ability to cover the merged firm and his
   or her assessment of the M&A deal. Consistent with these hypotheses, we
   find that the remaining target analysts provide more accurate earnings
   forecasts and more optimistic stock recommendations and growth forecasts
   for the merged firms than do the remaining acquirer analysts. We also
   find that a higher percentage of target analysts choosing to cover the
   merged firm is associated with better operating and long-term stock
   performance of that firm, but we do not find this relation with acquirer
   analysts. Our results extend the literature by showing that target
   analysts' coverage decisions reveal valuable information about a merged

   market segments. The model assumes that there are increasing returns to
   investment in a segment, for example, as a result of word-of-mouth or
   learning curve effects. I derive three key results: (1) Under certain
   conditions there is a unique equilibrium in which firms that are only
   slightly different focus all of their investment in different segments,
   causing small random differences to expand into large permanent
   differences. (2) If, on the other hand, sufficiently large random shocks
   are possible, firms over time repeatedly change their strategies,
   switching focus from one segment to another. (3) A firm might want to
   reduce its own assets in the smaller segment in order to entice its
   competitor to shift focus to this segment.

AB When bidders incur a cost to learn their valuations, bidder entry can
   impact auction performance. Two common selling mechanisms in this
   environment are an English auction and a sequential bidding process.
   Theoretically, sellers should prefer the auction, because it generates
   higher expected revenues, whereas bidders should prefer the sequential
   mechanism, because it generates higher expected bidder profits. We
   compare the two mechanisms in a controlled laboratory environment,
   varying the entry cost, and find that, contrary to the theoretical
   predictions, average seller revenues tend to be higher under the
   sequential mechanism, whereas average bidder profits are approximately
   the same. We identify three systematic behavioral deviations from the
   theoretical model: (1) in the auction, bidders do not enter 100% of the
   time; (2) in the sequential mechanism, bidders do not set preemptive
   bids according to the predicted threshold strategy; and (3) subsequent
   bidders tend to overenter in response to preemptive bids by first
   bidders. We develop a model of noisy bidder-entry costs that is
   consistent with these behaviors, and we show that our model organizes
   the experimental data well.

AB The main advantage of a procurement combinatorial auction (CA) is that
   it allows suppliers to express cost synergies through package bids.
   However, bidders can also strategically take advantage of this
   flexibility, by discounting package bids and "inflating" bid prices for
   single items, even in the absence of cost synergies; the latter behavior
   can hurt the performance of the auction. It is an empirical question
   whether allowing package bids and running a CA improves performance in a
   given setting. In this paper, we develop a structural estimation
   approach that estimates the firms' cost structure using bidding data and
   use these estimates to evaluate the performance of the auction. To
   overcome the computational difficulties arising from the large number of
   bids observed in large-scale CAs, we propose a novel simplified model of
   bidders' behavior based on pricing package characteristics. We apply our
   method to the Chilean school meals auction, in which the government
   procures half a billion dollars' worth of meal services every year and
   bidders submit thousands of package bids. Our estimates suggest that
   bidders' cost synergies are economically significant in this application
   (similar to 5%), and the current CA mechanism achieves high allocative
   efficiency (similar to 98%) and reasonable margins for the bidders
   (similar to 5%). Overall, this work develops the first practical tool to
   evaluate the performance of large-scale first-price CAs commonly used in
   procurement settings.

   study the effects of economic incentives on volunteer activities. The
   experiment was designed to assess local and short-term effects as well
   as spatial and temporal substitution, heterogeneity, and spillovers.
   Subjects offered $5, $10, and $15 gift cards to give blood were more
   likely to donate and more so for the higher reward values. The
   incentives also led to spatial displacement and a short-term shift in
   the timing of donation activity, but they had no long-term effects. Many
   of the effects were also heterogeneous in the population. We also
   detected a spillover effect whereby informing some individuals of
   rewards through official ARC channels led others who were not officially
   informed to be more likely to donate. Thus, the effect of incentives on
   prosocial behavior includes not only the immediate local effects but
   also spatial displacement, social spillovers, and dramatic
   heterogeneity. We discuss the implications of these findings for

AB Recent studies, mostly from prosocial settings, suggest that monetary
   rewards may crowd out effort exertion by economic agents. We design a
   field experiment with data entry workers to investigate the extent of
   such crowding-out effects in a labor market. Using simple variations in
   the job description of a task, we induce a natural work setting under
   the work frame and emphasize social preference under the social frame.
   We find that crowding out of labor participation critically depends on
   framing-whereas small monetary rewards reduce the participation rate
   under the social frame, the participation rate is nondecreasing in the
   wage rate under the work frame. Moreover, among the workers who
   participate in the task, those who receive a positive wage perform a
   considerably higher amount of work than those who are paid zero wage
   under either frame. Thus, there is weak evidence of crowding out only
   when the task is explicitly given a prosocial flavor and not under a
   regular work setting. Furthermore, emphasizing social preference in the
   labor market in such a way reduces the overall labor supply and seems to
   have an adverse effect on the quality of work.

AB Marketing variables that are included in consumer discrete choice models
   are often endogenous. Extant treatments using likelihood-based
   estimators impose parametric distributional assumptions, such as
   normality, on the source of endogeneity. These assumptions are
   restrictive because misspecified distributions have an impact on
   parameter estimates and associated elasticities. The normality
   assumption for endogeneity can be inconsistent with some marginal cost
   specifications given a price-setting process, although they are
   consistent with other specifications. In this paper, we propose a
   heterogeneous Bayesian semiparametric approach for modeling choice
   endogeneity that offers a flexible and robust alternative to parametric
   methods. Specifically, we construct centered Dirichlet process mixtures
   (CDPM) to allow uncertainty over the distribution of endogeneity errors.
   In a similar vein, we also model consumer preference heterogeneity
   nonparametrically via a CDPM. Results on simulated data show that
   incorrect distributional assumptions can lead to poor recovery of model
   parameters and price elasticities, whereas the proposed semiparametric
   model is able to robustly recover the true parameters in an efficient
   fashion. In addition, the CDPM offers the benefits of automatically
   inferring the number of mixture components that are appropriate for a
   given data set and is able to reconstruct the shape of the underlying
   distributions for endogeneity and heterogeneity errors. We apply our
   approach to two scanner panel data sets. Model comparison statistics
   indicate the superiority of the semiparametric specification and the
   results show that parameter and elasticity estimates are sensitive to
   the choice of distributional forms. Moreover, the CDPM specification
   yields evidence of multimodality, skewness, and outlying observations in
   these real data sets.

AB The use of global suppliers has increased considerably over the last
   three decades. Operations management theory establishes that global
   sourcing requires more units of inventory, but since these units are
   often procured at a lower cost from global suppliers the capital
   invested in inventory and the consequent financial burden may increase
   or decrease with global sourcing. This study provides rigorous
   firm-level empirical evidence that links the global sourcing practices
   of public U. S. firms and their inventory investments. We process bill
   of lading manifests (customs forms) to extract information on over half
   a million sea shipments from global suppliers to U. S. public firms and
   link this information with quarterly financial data from the Compustat
   database. We provide stylized facts on the participation of different
   firms and sectors in global trade. Using a simultaneous equation model,
   we find that an increase in global sourcing results in an increase in
   inventory investment. A 10% shift in sourcing from domestic to global
   suppliers increases the inventory investment by 8.8% for an average firm
   in our sample. We also find that increasing the number of suppliers can
   mitigate this increase in inventory investment: for example, going from
   single to dual sourcing reduces inventory investment by about 11%. We
   illustrate the use of our estimates to identify the impact of changing
   global sourcing strategy on inventory investment and operational
   performance metrics.

AB Motivated by the recent backshoring trend, this paper studies a sourcing
   game where competing firms may choose between efficient sourcing (e. g.,
   sourcing from overseas) and responsive sourcing (e. g., sourcing from a
   home country). Efficient sourcing usually provides a cost advantage,
   whereas responsive sourcing allows a firm to obtain more accurate demand
   information when making procurement decisions. By characterizing the
   equilibrium outcome, we find some interesting results driven by the
   strategic interaction between the firms. First, a firm may still use
   efficient sourcing in equilibrium even when the cost advantage
   associated with efficient sourcing does not exist. This is because the
   firm can dampen competition by reducing the correlation between its own
   demand information and the competitor's. Second, a cost hike in
   efficient sourcing (e. g., the rising labor cost in Asia) may benefit
   all the firms in the industry. The reason is that the cost hike may
   alleviate competition by inducing a new equilibrium sourcing structure.
   This paper also sheds some light on the recent backshoring trend. First,
   our analysis indicates that more firms will shift from efficient
   sourcing to responsive sourcing in equilibrium (i.e., backshore) if the
   market size shrinks, the demand becomes more volatile, or the sourcing
   costs rise simultaneously. Second, a firm's backshoring behavior reduces
   the competition on the cost dimension, but it also has an ambiguous
   informational impact on the other firms in the market. In particular,
   some firms may benefit from increased correlation of their demand
   information under Cournot competition with substitutable products.
   Overall, the backshoring behavior can be beneficial to all the firms
   sticking to their original sourcing strategies under certain conditions.

AB We study dynamic price competition in an oligopolistic market with a mix
   of substitutable and complementary perishable assets. Each firm has a
   fixed initial stock of items and competes in setting prices to sell them
   over a finite sales horizon. Customers sequentially arrive at the
   market, make a purchase choice, and then leave immediately with some
   likelihood of no purchase. The purchase likelihood depends on the time
   of purchase, product attributes, and current prices. The demand
   structure includes time-variant linear and multinomial logit demand
   models as special cases. Assuming deterministic customer arrival rates,
   we show that any equilibrium strategy has a simple structure, involving
   a finite set of shadow prices measuring capacity externalities that
   firms exert on each other: equilibrium prices can be solved from a
   one-shot price competition game under the current-time demand structure,
   taking into account capacity externalities through the time-invariant
   shadow prices. The former reflects the transient demand side at every
   moment, and the latter captures the aggregate supply constraints over
   the sales horizon. This simple structure sheds light on dynamic revenue
   management problems under competition, which helps capture the essence
   of the problems under demand uncertainty. We show that the equilibrium
   solutions from the deterministic game provide precommitted and
   contingent heuristic policies that are asymptotic equilibria for its
   stochastic counterpart, when demand and supply are sufficiently large.

AB Theory posits that managerial holdings of debt ("inside debt") align
   managers' incentives with those of outside debtholders. Executive
   pensions, consisting of rank-and-file (RAF) plans and supplemental
   executive retirement plans (SERPs), and other deferred compensation
   (ODC) have debt-like payoffs, and could therefore function as inside
   debt. However, whereas SERPs are often unfunded and unsecured, RAF plans
   are funded and secured to some extent, and ODC may be invested in equity
   and withdrawn flexibly before retirement. Special arrangements in
   executive debt-like compensation could hence weaken or even nullify any
   incentive-alignment effect. We find that higher CEO debt-like
   compensation leads to lower promised yield and fewer covenants in a
   sample of loans originated in 2006-2008. This effect is driven entirely
   by benefits accrued under SERPs, consistent with SERPs more closely
   resembling risky corporate debt; balances accrued under RAF and ODC
   plans do not provide similar effects. Furthermore, promised yields are
   lower when debt-like compensation claims can be withdrawn only after
   outside debt claims are expected to settle. Our findings persist after
   accounting for endogeneity using state personal income tax rates as an
   instrument for CEOs' willingness to defer compensation. Overall, the
   evidence suggests that executive debt-like compensation is only
   effective at resolving stockholder-debtholder conflicts when its payoffs
   are truly debt-like and that lenders' perceptions are affected not only
   by the magnitude of debt-like compensation but also by its seniority.

AB We examine the relationship between investment banks' initial public
   offering (IPO) market shares and their prior IPO underpricing in the new
   IPO market for China-based companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. To
   gain expertise in Chinese business practices, investment banks have the
   incentive to obtain business in this new IPO market by providing high
   offer prices to the issuer, leading to less underpricing and less money
   on the table. We hypothesize and find that the less an investment bank
   underprices China-based company IPOs, the greater its subsequent market
   share of China-based company IPOs in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
   Furthermore, this relationship is driven by a bank's initial China-based
   company IPO deals. These results suggest that in new IPO markets,
   investment banks' initial market shares, obtained through lower
   underpricing, help them grow their market shares in later periods,
   possibly through the expertise gained in the initial business.

   compare our dynamic model with a static chance-constrained model, a

   a pseudo-dynamic approach and show that significant cost savings can be
   achieved at high service levels using our model.

AB In an experimental newsvendor setting, we investigate three phenomena:
   level behavior-the decision maker's average ordering tendency;
   adjustment behavior-the tendency to adjust period-to-period order
   quantities; and observation bias-the tendency to let the degree of
   demand feedback influence order quantities. We find that, in three of
   four conditions, the portion of mismatch cost that results from
   adjustment behavior exceeds the portion of mismatch cost caused by level
   behavior. Observation bias is studied through censored demand feedback,
   a situation that arguably represents most newsvendor settings. When
   demands are uncensored, subjects tend to order below the normative
   quantity when they face high margin and above the normative quantity
   when they face low margin, but in neither case do they order beyond mean
   demand (the pull-to-center effect). Censoring in general leads to lower
   quantities, magnifying the below-normative-level behavior when they face
   high margin but partially counterbalancing the above-normative-level
   behavior when they face low margin, violating the pull-to-center effect
   in both cases.

   product demand and diffusion, creating effective viral marketing, and
   designing "network interventions" to promote positive social change. But
   several statistical challenges make it difficult to econometrically
   identify peer influence in networks. Though some recent studies use
   experiments to identify influence, they have not investigated the social
   or structural conditions under which influence is strongest. By randomly
   manipulating messages sent by adopters of a Facebook application to
   their 1.3 million peers, we identify the moderating effect of tie
   strength and structural embeddedness on the strength of peer influence.
   We find that both embeddedness and tie strength increase influence.
   However, the amount of physical interaction between friends, measured by
   coappearance in photos, does not have an effect. This work presents some
   of the first large-scale in vivo experimental evidence investigating the
   social and structural moderators of peer influence in networks. The

   on purchase conversion by capturing the dynamic interactions among
   advertisement clicks themselves. It is motivated by the observation that
   certain advertisement clicks may not result in immediate purchases, but
   they stimulate subsequent clicks on other advertisements, which then
   lead to purchases. We develop a novel model based on mutually exciting
   point processes, which consider advertisement clicks and purchases as
   dependent random events in continuous time. We incorporate individual
   random effects to account for consumer heterogeneity and cast the model
   in the Bayesian hierarchical framework. We construct conversion
   probability to properly evaluate the conversion effects of online
   advertisements. We develop simulation algorithms for mutually exciting
   point processes to compute the conversion probability and for
   out-of-sample prediction. Model comparison results show the proposed
   model outperforms the benchmark models that ignore exciting effects
   among advertisement clicks. Using a proprietary data set, we find that
   display advertisements have relatively low direct effect on purchase
   conversion, but they are more likely to stimulate subsequent visits
   through other advertisement formats. We show that the commonly used
   measure of conversion rate is biased in favor of search advertisements
   and underestimates the conversion effect of display advertisements the
   most. Our model also furnishes a useful tool to predict future purchases
   and advertisement clicks for the purpose of targeted marketing and
   customer relationship management.

   implementation of this project is associated with a reduction in online
   sales and an increase in store sales and traffic. These results can be
   explained by two simultaneous phenomena: (1) additional store sales from
   customers who use the BOPS functionality and buy additional products in
   the stores (cross-selling effect) and (2) the shift of some customers
   from the online to the brick-and-mortar channel and the conversion of
   noncustomers into store customers (channel-shift effect). We explain
   these channel-shift patterns as an increase in "research online,
   purchase offline" behavior enabled by BOPS implementation, and we
   validate this explanation with evidence from the change of cart
   abandonment and conversion rates of the brick-and-mortar and online

   management literature that analyzes the impact of sharing inventory

AB In 2013, the global mobile app market was estimated at over US$50
   billion and is expected to grow to $150 billion in the next two years.
   In this paper, we build a structural econometric model to quantify the
   vibrant platform competition between mobile (smartphone and tablet) apps
   on the Apple iOS and Google Android platforms and estimate consumer
   preferences toward different mobile app characteristics. We find that
   app demand increases with the in-app purchase option wherein a user can
   complete transactions within the app. On the contrary, app demand
   decreases with the in-app advertisement option where consumers are shown
   ads while they are engaging with the app. The direct effects on app
   revenue from the inclusion of an in-app purchase option and an in-app
   advertisement option are equivalent to offering a 28% price discount and
   increasing the price by 8%, respectively. We also find that a price
   discount strategy results in a greater increase of app demand in Google
   Play compared with Apple App Store, and app developers can maximize
   their revenue by providing a 50% discount on their paid apps. Using the
   estimated demand function, we find that mobile apps have enhanced
   consumer surplus by approximately $33.6 billion annually in the United
   States, and we discuss various implications for mobile marketing
   analytics, app pricing, and app design strategies.

AB we analyze a large, detailed operational data set from a restaurant
   chain to shed new light on how workload (defined as the number of tables
   or diners that a server simultaneously handles) affects servers'
   performance (measured as sales and meal duration). We use an exogenous
   shock-the implementation of labor scheduling software-and time-lagged
   instrumental variables to disentangle the endogeneity between demand and
   supply in this setting. We show that servers strive to maximize sales
   and speed efforts simultaneously, depending on the relative values of
   sales and speed. As a result, we find that, when the overall workload is
   small, servers expend more and more sales efforts with the increase in
   workload at a cost of slower service speed. However, above a certain
   workload threshold, servers start to reduce their sales efforts and work
   more promptly with the further rise in workload. In the focal restaurant
   chain, we find that this saturation point is currently not reached and,
   counterintuitively, the chain can reduce the staffing level and achieve
   both significantly higher sales (an estimated 3% increase) and lower
   labor costs (an estimated 17% decrease).

AB Managers and researchers alike have long recognized the importance of
   corporate textual risk disclosures. Yet it is a nontrivial task to
   discover and quantify variables of interest from unstructured text. In
   this paper, we develop a variation of the latent Dirichlet allocation
   topic model and its learning algorithm for simultaneously discovering
   and quantifying risk types from textual risk disclosures. We conduct
   comprehensive evaluations in terms of both conventional statistical fit
   and substantive fit with respect to the quality of discovered
   information. Experimental results show that our proposed method
   outperforms all competing methods, and could find more meaningful topics
   (risk types). By taking advantage of our proposed method for measuring
   risk types from textual data, we study how risk disclosures in 10-K
   forms affect the risk perceptions of investors. Different from prior
   studies, our results provide support for all three competing arguments
   regarding whether and how risk disclosures affect the risk perceptions
   of investors, depending on the specific risk types disclosed. We find
   that around two-thirds of risk types lack informativeness and have no
   significant influence. Moreover, we find that the informative risk types
   do not necessarily increase the risk perceptions of investors-the
   disclosure of three types of systematic and liquidity risks will
   increase the risk perceptions of investors, whereas the other five types
   of unsystematic risks will decrease them.

   elasticities for songs and albums. We then develop a structural model of
   consumer demand to estimate welfare under various policy relevant
   counterfactual scenarios. This approach represents an early application
   of the "big data" management paradigm within the media industries and
   provides managers with detailed guidance on optimal pricing and
   marketing strategies for digital music. Our results show that tiered
   pricing coupled with reduced album pricing increases revenue to the
   labels by 18% relative to uniform pricing policies traditionally
   preferred by digital marketplaces while also increasing consumer surplus
   by 23%. Thus, optimal tiered pricing can yield a Pareto improvement over
   the prior status quo. Additionally, our results indicate that even
   without tiered pricing, unbundling albums outperforms "album-only"
   pricing policies that dominated the era of physical CD/cassette sales.

AB Game attendance resulting from ticket sales is the single largest
   revenue stream for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. We propose a
   general multiple distributed lag framework following the Koyck family of
   models for estimating MLB attendance drivers and focus specifically on
   the differential direct and carryover effects of in-game promotions. By
   setting various model constraints, the proposed framework incorporates
   different forms of serial correlation and promotion-specific dynamic
   effects. Using information model-selection heuristics, we select an
   optimal model of attendance drivers for the Pittsburgh Pirates'
   2010-2012 MLB seasons. We demonstrate that our newly proposed model with
   an unrestricted serial correlation structure performs best. We find that
   although kids promotions have the highest direct effect on attendance,
   giveaway and entertainment promotions have substantial carryover effects
   and the largest total effects. We use our results to optimize the
   Pirates' promotional schedule and find that a reallocation of resources
   across promotional categories can increase profits between 39% and 88%.

AB In this paper, we study the properties of a recently proposed class of
   semiparametric discrete choice models (referred to as the marginal
   distribution model (MDM)), by optimizing over a family of joint error
   distributions with prescribed marginal distributions. Surprisingly, the
   choice probabilities arising from the family of generalized extreme
   value models of which the multinomial logit model is a special case can
   be obtained from this approach, despite the difference in assumptions on
   the underlying probability distributions. We use this connection to
   develop flexible and general choice models to incorporate consumer and
   product level heterogeneity in both partworths and scale parameters in
   the choice model. Furthermore, the extremal distributions obtained from
   the MDM can be used to approximate the Fisher's information matrix to
   obtain reliable standard error estimates of the partworth parameters,
   without having to bootstrap the method. We use simulated and empirical
   data sets to test the performance of this approach. We evaluate the
   performance against the classical multinomial logit, mixed logit, and a
   machine learning approach that accounts for partworth heterogeneity. Our
   numerical results indicate that MDM provides a practical semiparametric
   alternative to choice modeling.

AB Motivated by the availability of real-time data on customer
   characteristics, we consider the problem of personalizing the assortment
   of products for each arriving customer. Using actual sales data from an
   online retailer, we demonstrate that personalization based on each
   customer's location can lead to over 10% improvements in revenue
   compared to a policy that treats all customers the same. We propose a
   family of index-based policies that effectively coordinate the real-time
   assortment decisions with the back-end supply chain constraints. We
   allow the demand process to be arbitrary and prove that our algorithms
   achieve an optimal competitive ratio. In addition, we show that our
   algorithms perform even better if the demand is known to be stationary.
   Our approach is also flexible and can be combined with existing methods
   in the literature, resulting in a hybrid algorithm that brings out the
   advantages of other methods while maintaining the worst-case performance
   guarantees.

AB In this paper, we describe both applied and analytical work in
   collaboration with a large multistate gas utility. The project addressed
   a major operational resource allocation challenge that is typical to the
   industry. We study the resource allocation problem in which some of the
   tasks are scheduled and known in advance, and some are unpredictable and
   have to be addressed as they appear. The utility has maintenance crews
   that perform both standard jobs (each must be done before a specified
   deadline) as well as respond to emergency gas leaks (that occur randomly
   throughout the day and could disrupt the schedule and lead to
   significant overtime). The goal is to perform all the standard jobs by
   their respective deadlines, to address all emergency jobs in a timely
   manner, and to minimize maintenance crew overtime. We employ a novel
   decomposition approach that solves the problem in two phases. The first
   is a job scheduling phase, where standard jobs are scheduled over a time
   horizon. The second is a crew assignment phase, which solves a
   stochastic mixed integer program to assign jobs to maintenance crews
   under a stochastic number of future emergencies. For the first phase, we
   propose a heuristic based on the rounding of a linear programming
   relaxation formulation and prove an analytical worst-case performance
   guarantee. For the second phase, we propose an algorithm for assigning
   crews that is motivated by the structure of an optimal solution. We used
   our models and heuristics to develop a decision support tool that is
   being piloted in one of the utility's sites. Using the utility's data,
   we project that the tool will result in a 55% reduction in overtime
   hours.

AB Website morphing infers latent customer segments from clickstreams and
   then changes websites' look and feel to maximize revenue. The
   established algorithm infers latent segments from a preset number of
   clicks and then selects the best "morph" using expected Gittins indices.
   Switching costs, potential website exit, and all clicks prior to
   morphing are ignored. We model switching costs, potential website exit,
   and the (potentially differential) impact of all clicks to determine
   when to morph for each customer. Morphing earlier means more customer
   clicks are based on the optimal morph; morphing later reveals more about
   the customer's latent segment. We couple this within-customer
   optimization to between-customer expected Gittins index optimization to
   determine which website "look and feel" to give to each customer at each
   click. We evaluate the improved algorithm with synthetic data and with a
   proof-of-feasibility application to Japanese bank card loans. The
   proposed algorithm generalizes the established algorithm, is feasible in
   real time, performs substantially better when tuning parameters are
   identified from calibration data, and is reasonably robust to
   misspecification.

AB Mobile technologies enable marketers to target consumers by time and
   location. This study builds on a large-scale randomized experiment of
   short message service (SMS) texts sent to 12,265 mobile users. We draw
   on contextual marketing theory to hypothesize how different combinations
   of mobile targeting determine consumer responses to mobile promotions.
   We identify that temporal targeting and geographical targeting
   individually increase sales purchases. Surprisingly, the sales effects
   of employing these two strategies simultaneously are not
   straightforward. When targeting proximal mobile users, our findings
   reveal a negative sales-lead time relationship; sending same-day mobile
   promotions yields an increase in the odds of consumer purchases compared
   with sending them two days prior to the promoted event. However, when
   targeting nonproximal mobile users, there is an inverted-U, curvilinear
   relationship. Sending one-day prior SMSs yields an increase in the odds
   of consumer purchases by 9.5 times compared with same-day SMSs and an
   increase in the odds of consumer purchases by 71% compared with two-day
   prior SMSs. These results are robust to unobserved heterogeneity,
   alternative estimation models, bootstrapped resamples, randomization
   checks, consumer mobile usage behavior, and segmentation of consumer
   scenarios. In addition, we conducted follow-up surveys to delve into the
   psychological mechanisms explaining the findings in our field
   experiment. In line with consumer construal arguments, consumers who
   received SMSs close (far) in time and location formed a more (less)
   concrete mental construal, which in turn, increased their involvement
   and purchase intent. These findings suggest that understanding the when,
   where, and how of mobile targeting strategies is crucial. Marketers can
   save money by carefully designing their mobile targeting campaigns.

AB Academic research relies extensively on macroeconomic variables to
   forecast the U.S. equity risk premium, with relatively little attention
   paid to the technical indicators widely employed by practitioners. Our
   paper fills this gap by comparing the predictive ability of technical
   indicators with that of macroeconomic variables. Technical indicators
   display statistically and economically significant in-sample and
   out-of-sample predictive power, matching or exceeding that of
   macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, technical indicators and
   macroeconomic variables provide complementary information over the
   business cycle: technical indicators better detect the typical decline
   in the equity risk premium near business-cycle peaks, whereas
   macroeconomic variables more readily pick up the typical rise in the
   equity risk premium near cyclical troughs. Consistent with this
   behavior, we show that combining information from both technical
   indicators and macroeconomic variables significantly improves equity
   risk premium forecasts versus using either type of information alone.
   Overall, the substantial countercyclical fluctuations in the equity risk
   premium appear well captured by the combined information in technical
   indicators and macroeconomic variables.

AB Movie producers and exhibitors make various decisions requiring an
   understanding of moviegoer's preferences at the local level. Two
   examples of such decisions are exhibitors' allocation of screens to
   movies and producers' allocation of advertising across different regions
   of the country. This study presents a predictive model of local demand
   for movies with two unique features. First, arguing that consumers'
   political tendencies have an unutilized predictive power for marketing
   models, we allow consumers' heterogeneity to depend on their voting
   tendencies. Second, instead of relying on the commonly used genre
   classifications to characterize movies, we estimate latent movie
   attributes. These attributes are not determined a priori by industry
   professionals but rather reflect consumers' perceptions, as revealed by
   their moviegoing behavior. Box-office data over five years from 25
   counties in the U.S. Midwest provide support for this model. First,
   consumers' preferences are related to their political tendencies. For
   example, we find that counties that voted for congressional Republicans
   prefer movies starring young, Caucasian, female actors over those
   starring African American, male actors. Second, perceived attributes
   provide new insights into consumers' preferences. For example, one of
   these attributes is the movie's degree of seriousness. Finally, and most
   importantly, the two improvements proposed here have a meaningful impact
   on forecasting error, decreasing it by 12.6%.

AB In this paper, we study the effects of three different kinds of search
   engine rankings on consumer behavior and search engine revenues: direct
   ranking effect, interaction effect between ranking and product ratings,
   and personalized ranking effect. We combine a hierarchical Bayesian
   model estimated on approximately one million online sessions from
   Travelocity, together with randomized experiments using a real-world
   hotel search engine application. Our archival data analysis and
   randomized experiments are consistent in demonstrating the following:
   (1) A consumer-utility-based ranking mechanism can lead to a significant
   increase in overall search engine revenue. (2) Significant interplay
   occurs between search engine ranking and product ratings. An inferior
   position on the search engine affects "higher-class" hotels more
   adversely. On the other hand, hotels with a lower customer rating are
   more likely to benefit from being placed on the top of the screen. These
   findings illustrate that product search engines could benefit from
   directly incorporating signals from social media into their ranking
   algorithms. (3) Our randomized experiments also reveal that an "active"
   personalized ranking system (wherein users can interact with and
   customize the ranking algorithm) leads to higher clicks but lower
   purchase propensities and lower search engine revenue compared with a
   "passive" personalized ranking system (wherein users cannot interact
   with the ranking algorithm). This result suggests that providing more
   information during the decision-making process may lead to fewer
   consumer purchases because of information overload. Therefore, product
   search engines should not adopt personalized ranking systems by default.
   Overall, our study unravels the economic impact of ranking and its

AB This paper examines the effects on equity home bias of two mechanisms
   adopted by Euronext when it was formed by the merger of four European
   countries' stock exchanges in 2002. The two structural mechanisms are
   the integration of trading platforms across the four predecessor
   exchanges and the creation of named segments of the integrated exchange
   on which firms could voluntarily list by precommitting to enhanced
   disclosure and transparency. Employing a difference-in-differences
   research design using other European Union companies as a control group,
   we document that the integration of the Euronext market was associated
   with a reduction in home bias for firms listed on the named segments of
   the Euronext exchange, but not for the nonsegment Euronext firms. Our
   results suggest that the reduction in transaction costs from the
   integration of the trading platforms did not make the nonsegment
   Euronext firms more attractive to the specific investors for whom the
   transaction costs were reduced. On the other hand, the decrease in
   information costs due to the precommitments to enhanced transparency
   made the segment firms more attractive to all categories of foreign
   investors, consistent with the information costs hypothesis.

AB To stay abreast of current supply-market pricing, it is common for
   procurement managers to frequently organize auctions among a pool of
   qualified suppliers (the supply base). Sole awards can alienate losing
   suppliers and cause them to defect from the supply base. To maintain the
   supply base and thereby control the high costs of finding and qualifying
   new suppliers, buyers often employ split awards, which in turn inflate
   purchase costs. This results in a trade-off that we investigate in an
   infinite-horizon stationary setting in which the relative cost position
   of each supplier is randomly drawn in every period. We characterize the
   optimal split award that minimizes long-run costs (purchasing and
   qualification) and show that maintaining a constant supply-base
   size-using a "qualify-up-to" policy-is optimal for the buyer. We find
   that neither the extent of multisourcing nor the buyer's value of split
   awards compared with winner-take-all auctions are monotonic in the
   qualification cost and that split-award auctions can increase ex ante
   system, buyer, and supplier benefits simultaneously. To our knowledge,
   this is the first paper studying split-award auctions for supply-base
   maintenance, and it will hopefully galvanize further research on this
   important topic.

   to both positive and negative reputation and will therefore respond to
   visibility by signaling that they are an '' average altruism type ''
   relative to their audience. We formalize our hypotheses about ''
   wallflower '' behavior in a theoretical model. Our experimental results
   show that instead of uniformly increasing contributions, visibility
   draws contributions toward the middle of others' contributions. As a
   result, visibility is associated with higher levels of giving only in
   scenarios where others are giving a large amount. We also observe
   heterogeneity in reputation concerns: wallflower behavior is
   particularly strong for women and can be observed in several different
   settings.

AB We study the multiperiod pricing problem of a service firm with capacity
   levels that vary over time. Customers are heterogeneous in their arrival
   and departure periods as well as valuations, and are fully strategic
   with respect to their purchasing decisions. The firm's problem is to set
   a sequence of prices that maximizes its revenue while guaranteeing
   service to all paying customers. We provide a dynamic programming based
   algorithm that computes the optimal sequence of prices for this problem
   in polynomial time. We show that due to the presence of strategic
   customers, available service capacity at a time period may bind the
   price offered at another time period. This phenomenon leads the firm to
   utilize the same price in multiple periods, in effect limiting the
   number of different prices that the service firm utilizes in optimal
   price policies. Also, when customers become more strategic ( patient for
   service), the firm offers higher prices. This may lead to the
   underutilization of capacity, lower revenues, and reduced customer
   welfare. We observe that the firm can combat this problem if it has an
   ability, beyond posted prices, to direct customers to different service
   periods.

AB M any scholars have argued that systems for treating waste impede
   organizations from preventing waste in the first place. They theorize
   that end-of-pipe (EOP) treatment diminishes the incentive to avoid
   creating waste in the production process and obscures the information
   necessary to devise prevention techniques. This prediction has been
   widely accepted, influencing both policy and practice, despite both a
   lack of supporting empirical evidence and the existence of a
   counterprediction. In this paper, we use data describing U.S.
   manufacturing establishments from 1991 to 2005 to test the connection
   between EOP treatment and waste reduction. Our findings show that EOP
   treatment is associated with an initial jump in reported waste, followed
   by ongoing reduction. We analyze these results by exploring mechanisms
   that may drive this relationship. For practitioners, our paper provides
   critical guidance about strategies for reducing waste. For scholars of
   environmental management, our paper provides new insight on when
   facilities accomplish "source reduction" of process waste. For broader
   management theories of operations and organizational design, our
   analysis provides new insight on boundary conditions for extrapolation
   from existing theories. Finally, our paper provides new guidance for the
   formulation of effective regulatory policy.

   (time/money) comparison of the elicited components (at the individual

AB Policy makers have embraced financial education as a necessary antidote
   to the increasing complexity of consumers' financial decisions over the
   last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of
   financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in
   168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to
   improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in
   financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples.
   Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large
   interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on
   behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational
   studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with
   financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find
   that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically
   when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in
   prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to
   control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date
   has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger
   effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for
   financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward.
   We suggest a real but narrower role for "just-in-time" financial
   education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude
   with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect
   the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and
   regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior.

AB Organizations can create volume flexibility-the ability to increase

   of flexible labor resources (e.g., part-time and temporary workers, as
   compared to full-time workers). Although organizations are increasingly
   using these resources, the relationship between flexible labor resources
   and financial performance has not been examined empirically in the
   service setting. We use two years of archival data from 445 stores of a
   large retailer to study this relationship. We hypothesize and find that
   increasing the labor mix of temporary or part-time workers shows an
   inverted U-shaped relationship with sales and profit while temporary
   labor mix has a U-shaped relationship with expenses. Thus, although
   flexible labor resources can create volume flexibility for a firm along
   multiple dimensions, it is possible to have too much of a good thing.

AB The density, size, and location of stores in a retailer's network
   influences both the retailer's and the consumers' costs. With stores few
   and far between, consumers must travel a long distance to shop, whereas
   shopping trips are shorter with a dense network of stores. The layout of
   the retail supply chain is of interest to retailers who have emission
   reduction targets and urban planners concerned with sprawl. Are small
   local shops preferred over large, "big-box" retailers? A model of the
   retail supply chain is presented that includes operating costs (such as
   fuel and rent for floor space) as well as a cost for environmental
   externalities associated with carbon emissions. A focus on exclusively
   minimizing operating costs may substantially increase emissions (by 67%
   in one scenario) relative to the minimum level of emissions. A price on
   carbon is an ineffective mechanism for reducing emissions. The most
   attractive option is to improve consumer fuel efficiency-doubling the
   fuel efficiency of cars reduces long-run emissions by about one-third,
   whereas an improvement in truck fuel efficiency has a marginal impact on
   total emissions.

   show that a simple, objective measure of pre-IPO media coverage is

   coverage, and institutional investor ownership. Our results are robust
   to additional controls for size, to using abnormal or excess media, and
   to an instrumental variable approach. We also find that pre-IPO media
   coverage is negatively related to future expected returns, measured by
   the implied cost of capital. In all, we find a long-term role for media

AB This paper discusses the interaction between revenue management and
   customer relationship management for a firm that operates in a customer
   retention situation but faces limited capacity. We present a dynamic
   programming model for how the firm balances investments in customer
   acquisition and retention, as well as retention across multiple customer
   types. We characterize the optimal policy and discuss how the policy
   changes depending on capacity limitations. We then contrast the modeling
   results with those of a behavioral experiment in which subjects acted as
   managers making acquisition and retention decisions. In the modeling
   part of the paper, we introduce a concept of the value of an incremental
   customer (VIC), and show that when capacity is unlimited, VIC equals
   customer lifetime value (CLV), but when capacity is limited, VIC is much
   smaller and changes dynamically depending on the number of customers and
   their mix. As a result, the optimal spending is constant and depends on
   CLV for the firms with unlimited capacity, but changes dynamically and
   is generally unrelated to CLV when capacity is limited. In the
   experimental part, we introduce a concept of conditional optimality for
   the analysis of state-dependent decisions. Applying this concept to our
   data, we document a number of decision biases, specifically the
   subjects' tendency to overspend on retaining high-value customers and
   underspend on lower-value customers retention and acquisition. We show
   that providing CLV information exacerbates these biases and leads to a
   loss of net revenue when capacity is limited, but providing information
   about the marginal costs of acquisition and retention eliminated these
   biases and increases net revenue.

AB We examine a prevalent form of client-agent interaction through a
   feedback-giving game. In this game, a client undertakes a nontrivial
   task and is compensated based on her task performance, which is only
   made known to her when the client-agent interaction ends. Meanwhile, her
   performance is disclosed to an agent, who must then give the client
   feedback on her performance. Upon receiving the feedback, the client
   reports her happiness level, which in turn determines the agent's
   payoff. In eight studies involving 928 subjects, we vary the way the
   agent's cash earnings depend on the client's reported happiness. When we
   make the agent's earnings proportional to the client's reported
   happiness, the agent inflates his feedback, and the client reports a
   higher level of happiness (than that reported in a control condition
   where the agent always provides honest feedback). We show that neither
   the agent nor the client behaves altruistically in their reporting. The
   client reports being happier because she overestimates her performance
   and mistakenly believes that the agent's feedback is genuine. The agent
   stops inflating his feedback when doing so no longer benefits him.
   Finally, our main findings are shown to be robust with respect to
   several factors, including making the agent's feedback consequential in
   affecting the client's payoff. In summary, we show that the agent
   behaves opportunistically, and the client's overconfidence of her own
   performance is what makes this strategy successful.

   sentiments and past market returns are related to time-series variations
   in the slope of the implied volatility smile of stock options, but they
   have little impact on the prices of index options. The pricing impact is
   more pronounced in options with a higher concentration of
   unsophisticated investors and those with higher delta hedging costs. Our
   results provide evidence that factors not related to fundamentals also
   impact security prices.

   experiment on Taskcn, a large Chinese crowdsourcing site using
   mechanisms with features of an all-pay auction. In our study, we
   systematically vary the size of the reward as well as the presence of a
   soft reserve, or early high-quality submission. We find that a higher
   reward induces significantly more submissions and submissions of higher
   quality. In comparison, we find that high-quality users are
   significantly less likely to enter tasks where a high-quality solution
   has already been submitted, resulting in lower overall quality in
   subsequent submissions in such soft reserve treatments.

   heavily overweighted by active funds out-perform their underweighted
   counterparts by more than 7% per year, after adjustments for their
   loadings on the market, size, value, and momentum factors. This large
   premium dissipates quickly as the consensus view becomes publicly
   available. These results are consistent with the notion that informed
   investing by active mutual funds enhances the informativeness of stock
   prices. In addition, active mutual funds invest only a small portion of
   fund assets in high alpha stocks, in accordance with the consensus view
   that active mutual funds on average fail to outperform passive

AB Reputation systems that rely on voluntary feedback from traders are
   important in creating and sustaining trust in markets. Feedback
   nevertheless is a public good, and providing it is often costly. We
   combine theory with a laboratory experiment to study the effect of a
   seller precommitment mechanism: Sellers have an option to commit by
   providing a rebate to reduce the buyer's feedback reporting cost before
   making purchasing decisions. Our theory predicts that this mechanism
   induces noncooperative sellers to cooperate in the listed-price market.
   Using a buyer-seller trust game with a unilateral feedback scheme, we
   find that the seller's rebate decision has a significant impact on the
   buyer's purchasing decision via signaling the seller's cooperative type.
   More importantly, market efficiency under the precommitment mechanism
   increases with the probability that sellers will provide a rebate.
   Compared with the no rebate mechanism market, more efficient trades can
   be achieved when the sellers offer a rebate to the buyers in the market
   with the rebate mechanism, even when the rebate does not cover the full
   cost of feedback reporting.

   average, government bond funds exhibit significantly positive timing

   based on public information can explain the documented positive timing
   ability-namely, the average government bond fund has neutral or even

AB W e study theoretically and empirically the consumption of access
   services. We demonstrate that consumption is affected by contract
   structure (pay-per-use versus three-part tariffs) even if the optimal
   consumption plans are identical. We find that, although there is
   extensive individual heterogeneity, on average, consumers' choices
   follow a structure that is similar to a nearly optimal heuristic and
   correctly react to imbalances between the number of free calls and call
   opportunities remaining. However, consumers use the free units too
   quickly, leading to overconsumption and lost surplus. These errors are
   partially driven by mistaken beliefs about the value distribution. We
   also measure subjects' willingness to pay for a contract with free
   access units, and we find that nearly half of subjects are willing to
   pay at least the full per-unit price, with a substantial fraction
   willing to overpay. In response, the optimal firm strategy offers a
   three-part tariff at a very small discount, which increases revenue by
   8%-14% compared to only offering a pay-per-use contract.

AB The extended Kalman filter, which linearizes the relationship between
   security prices and state variables, is widely used in fixed-income
   applications. We investigate whether the unscented Kalman filter should
   be used to capture nonlinearities and compare the performance of the
   Kalman filter with that of the particle filter. We analyze the cross
   section of swap rates, which are mildly nonlinear in the states, and cap
   prices, which are highly nonlinear. When caps are used to filter the
   states, the unscented Kalman filter significantly outperforms its
   extended counterpart. The unscented Kalman filter also performs well
   when compared with the much more computationally intensive particle
   filter. These findings suggest that the unscented Kalman filter may be a
   good approach for a variety of problems in fixed-income pricing.

AB This paper formulates and solves the selection problem for a portfolio
   of credit swaps. The problem is cast as a goal program that entails a
   constrained optimization of preference-weighted moments of the portfolio
   value at the investment horizon. The portfolio value takes account of
   the exact timing of protection premium and default loss payments, as
   well as any mark-to-market profits and losses realized at the horizon.
   The constraints address collateral and solvency requirements, initial
   capital, position limits, and other trading constraints that credit swap
   investors often face in practice. The multimoment formulation
   accommodates the complex distribution of the portfolio value, which is a
   nested expectation under risk-neutral and actual probabilities. It also
   generates computational tractability. Numerical results illustrate the
   features of optimal portfolios. In particular, we find that credit swap
   investment constraints can have a significant impact on optimal
   portfolios, even for simple investment objectives. Our problem
   formulation and solution approach extend to corporate bond portfolios
   and mixed portfolios of corporate bonds and credit derivatives.

   organization than to those without friends. I test and find support for
   this hypothesis in a study of entry-level professionals in business and

   receive job offers from organizations if they had a friend employed
   there than if they did not. The implications of this study for research

AB W e develop a formal model to understand the selection and influence

   Consistent with the model's predictions, we find that U.S. venture
   capitalists (VCs) are more likely to select start-ups with coethnic
   executives for investment, particularly when the probability of the
   start-up's success appears low. Ethnic proximity between VCs and the
   start-ups they invest in is positively related to performance, measured
   by the probability of the companies' successful exit through
   acquisitions and initial public offerings (IPOs) and net income after
   IPO. Two-stage regression estimates suggest that these positive
   performance outcomes are largely due to influence, that is, superior
   communication and coordination between coethnic VCs and start-up
   executives after the investment. To the extent that VCs expect to work
   better with coethnic start-ups, they invest in coethnic ventures that
   are of lower observable quality than noncoethnic ventures.

AB Consumers often consider delaying a purchase strategically, anticipating
   that prices might decrease. Combining two unique data sources from the
   air-travel industry (posted fare data and booking data), we use a
   structural model to estimate the fraction of strategic consumers in the
   population, assuming different levels of sophistication in consumers'
   perception of future prices: perfect foresight and weak-and strong-form
   rational expectations. We find that 5.2% to 19.2% of the population is
   strategic across markets, measured by the first and third quartiles. Our
   intermarket analysis indicates that shorter trips with more attractive
   outside options are populated with more strategic consumers. Using a
   nonparametric approach, we further find that most strategic consumers
   arrive either at the beginning of the booking horizon or close to
   departure. Finally, our counterfactual analysis shows that, contrary to
   conventional wisdom, the presence of strategic consumers does not
   necessarily hurt revenues. Rather, the impact varies by market.
   Commitment to a nondecreasing pricing strategy is more likely to benefit
   business markets than leisure markets, or it could even hurt leisure
   markets. Intermarket analysis shows that city pairs with lower Internet
   penetration, higher average price, and shorter distances tend to benefit
   more from such commitment as well.

AB We propose a dynamic structural model that illuminates the economic
   mechanisms shaping individual behavior and outcomes on crowdsourced
   ideation platforms. We estimate the model using a rich data set obtained
   from IdeaStorm.com, a crowdsourced ideation initiative affiliated with
   Dell. We find that, on IdeaStorm.com, individuals tend to significantly
   underestimate the costs to the firm for implementing their ideas but
   overestimate the potential of their ideas in the initial stages of the
   crowdsourcing process. Therefore, the "idea market" is initially
   overcrowded with ideas that are less likely to be implemented. However,
   individuals learn about both their abilities to come up with
   high-potential ideas as well as the cost structure of the firm from peer
   voting on their ideas and the firm's response to contributed ideas. We
   find that individuals learn rather quickly about their abilities to come
   up with high-potential ideas, but the learning regarding the firm's cost
   structure is quite slow. Contributors of low-potential ideas eventually
   become inactive, whereas the high-potential idea contributors remain
   active. As a result, over time, the average potential of generated ideas
   increases while the number of ideas contributed decreases. Hence, the
   decrease in the number of ideas generated represents market efficiency
   through self-selection rather than its failure. Through counterfactuals,
   we show that providing more precise cost signals to individuals can
   accelerate the filtering process. Increasing the total number of ideas
   to respond to and improving the response speed will lead to more idea
   contributions. However, failure to distinguish between high-and
   low-potential ideas and between high-and low-ability idea generators
   leads to the overall potential of the ideas generated to drop
   significantly.

AB We are interested in whether preventing resale of tickets benefits the
   capacity providers for sporting and entertainment events. Common wisdom
   suggests that ticket resale is harmful to event organizers' revenues,
   and event organizers have tried to prevent resale of tickets. For
   instance, Ticketmaster recently proposed paperless (nontransferrable)
   ticketing, which would severely limit the opportunity to resell tickets.
   We consider a model that allows resale from both consumers and
   speculators with different transaction costs for each party.
   Surprisingly, we find that this wisdom is incorrect when event
   organizers use fixed pricing policies; in fact, event organizers benefit
   from reductions in consumers' (and speculators') transaction costs of
   resale. Even when multiperiod pricing policies are used, we find that an
   event organizer may still benefit from ticket resale if his capacity is
   small. Although paperless ticketing is suggested as a way to reduce
   ticket resale and prevent speculators from buying tickets, our results
   suggest that it may reduce the capacity providers' revenues in many
   situations. Instead, we propose ticket options as a novel ticket pricing
   mechanism. We show that ticket options (where consumers would initially
   buy an option to buy a ticket and then exercise at a later date)
   naturally reduce ticket resale significantly and result in significant
   increases in event organizers' revenues. Furthermore, since a consumer
   only risks the option price (and not the whole ticket price) if she
   cannot attend the event, options may face less consumer resistance than
   paperless tickets.

   sales increase. We study the contract form in equilibrium and the effect
   that sales targets have on the profit split between the providers and
   the broker. We show that in equilibrium, contracts require positive
   sales targets that can be best described as a mechanism for the larger
   provider to profit at the expense of the smaller provider. The effect of
   sales targets is different when commission margins are exogenous and the
   providers compete by setting targets. In this case, it is the low-margin
   provider who benefits from sales targets at the expense of the broker,
   who in this context resists the imposition of targets.

AB I analyze the impact of a firm's environmental profile on its cost of

   analysts' earnings estimates, I find that investors demand significantly
   higher expected returns on stocks excluded by environmental screens
   (such as hazardous chemical, substantial emissions, and climate change
   concerns) compared to firms without such environmental concerns. Lenders
   also charge a significantly higher interest rate on the bank loans
   issued to firms with these environmental concerns. I provide evidence
   that the environmental profile of a firm is not simply proxying for an
   omitted component of its default risk. Further, firms with these
   environmental concerns have lower institutional ownership and fewer
   banks participate in their loan syndicate than firms without such
   environmental concerns. These results suggest that exclusionary socially

   varies considerably across partitions formed by the differential
   implications of the pecking order, market timing, and trade-off theories

AB Critics of short selling argue that short sellers amplify price declines

   Contrary to this viewpoint, we find that increases in short interest for
   firms following a price decline are associated with measures of
   overpricing based on financial statement analysis. Our results extend to
   short-selling activity following marketwide declines. We also find
   evidence consistent with the profitability of short selling following
   price declines being driven by valuation-based positions. Overall, our
   findings suggest short sellers primarily undertake valuation-based
   strategies following price declines and have implications for

AB We find that inventory productivity strongly predicts future stock
   returns among a sample of publicly listed U. S. retailers during the
   period from 1985 to 2010. A zero-cost portfolio investment strategy,
   which consists of buying from the two highest and selling from the two
   lowest quintiles formed on inventory turnover, earns more than 1%
   average monthly abnormal return benchmarked to the Fama-French-Carhart
   four-factor model. Our results are robust to different measures of
   inventory productivity, distinct from the well-known firm
   characteristics known to generate abnormal returns, and not driven by a
   particular subsample period. A longitudinal analysis of portfolio
   returns over longer holding periods shows that although inventory
   productivity is predictive of stock returns, its information dissipates
   about one to two years after release.

AB The popularity of New Year's resolutions suggests that people are more
   likely to tackle their goals immediately following salient temporal
   landmarks. If true, this little-researched phenomenon has the potential
   to help people overcome important willpower problems that often limit
   goal attainment. Across three archival field studies, we provide
   evidence of a "fresh start effect." We show that Google searches for the
   term "diet" (Study 1), gym visits (Study 2), and commitments to pursue
   goals (Study 3) all increase following temporal landmarks (e. g., the
   outset of a new week, month, year, or semester; a birthday; a holiday).
   We propose that these landmarks demarcate the passage of time, creating
   many new mental accounting periods each year, which relegate past
   imperfections to a previous period, induce people to take a big-picture
   view of their lives, and thus motivate aspirational behaviors.

AB A key concern about counterfeits and weak intellectual property
   protection is that they may hamper innovation by displacing legitimate
   sales. This paper combines a natural policy experiment with randomized
   lab experiments to estimate the heterogeneous impacts of counterfeiting
   on the sales and consumer purchase intent related to branded products of
   various quality levels. I collect new product-line-level panel data
   (1993-2004) on Chinese shoe companies. I identify heterogeneous effects
   of counterfeit entry on sales of authentic products of three quality
   tiers, finding that counterfeits have both advertising effects for a
   brand and substitution effects for authentic products, additionally the
   effects linger for some years. The advertising effect dominates the
   substitution effect for high-end authentic product sales, and the
   substitution effect outweighs the advertising effect for low-end product
   sales. The positive effect of counterfeits is most pronounced for
   high-fashion products (such as women's high-leg boots and dress shoes),
   shoes tailored to young customers, and high-end products of brands not
   yet well-known at the time of counterfeiter entry.

AB We consider the problem of choosing, from a set of N potential
   stock-keeping units (SKUs) in a retail category, K SKUs to be carried at
   each store to maximize revenue or profit. Assortments can vary by store,
   subject to a maximum number of different assortments. We view a SKU as a
   set of attribute levels and also model possible substitutions when a
   customer's first choice is not in the assortment. We apply maximum
   likelihood estimation to sales history of the SKUs currently carried by
   the retailer to estimate the demand for attribute levels and
   substitution probabilities, and from this, the demand for any potential
   SKU, including those not currently carried by the retailer. We specify
   several alternative heuristics for choosing SKUs to be carried in an
   assortment. We apply this approach to optimize assortments for three
   real examples: snack cakes, tires, and automotive appearance chemicals.
   A portion of our recommendations for tires and appearance chemicals were
   implemented and produced sales increases of 5.8% and 3.6%, respectively,
   which are significant improvements relative to typical retailer annual
   comparable store revenue increases. We also forecast sales shares of 1,
   11, and 25 new SKUs for the snack cake, tire, and automotive appearance
   chemical applications, respectively, with mean absolute percentage
   errors (MAPEs) of 16.2%, 19.1%, and 28.7%, which compares favorably to
   the 30.7% MAPE for chain sales of two new SKUs reported by Fader and
   Hardie (1996).

AB Whether and how trust and trustworthiness differ between a collectivist
   society, e. g., China, and an individualistic one, e. g., the United
   States, generates much ongoing scientific debate and bears significant
   practical values for managing cross-country transactions. We
   experimentally investigate how supply chain members' countries of
   origin-China versus the United States-affect trust, trustworthiness, and
   strategic information sharing behavior in a cross-country supply chain.
   We consider a two-tier supply chain in which the upstream supplier
   solicits demand forecast information from the retailer to plan
   production; but the retailer has an incentive to manipulate her forecast
   to ensure abundant supply. The levels of trust and trustworthiness in
   the supply chain and supplier's capability to determine the optimal
   production quantity affect the efficacy of forecast sharing and the
   resulting profits. We develop an experimental design to disentangle
   these three aspects and to allow for real-time interactions between
   geographically distant and culturally heterogeneous participants. We
   observe that, when there is no prospect for long-term interactions, our
   Chinese participants consistently exhibit lower spontaneous trust and
   trustworthiness than their U. S. counterparts do. We quantify the
   differences in trust and trustworthiness between the two countries, and
   the resulting impact on supply chain efficiency. We also show that
   Chinese individuals exhibit higher spontaneous trust toward U. S.
   partners than Chinese ones, primarily because they perceive that
   individuals from the United States are more trusting and trustworthy in
   general. This positive perception toward U. S. people is indeed
   consistent with the U. S. participants' behavior in forecast sharing. In
   addition, we quantify that a Chinese supply chain enjoys a larger
   efficiency gain from repeated interactions than a U. S. one does, as the
   prospect of building a long-term relationship successfully sustains
   trust and trustworthiness by Chinese partners. We advocate that
   companies can reinforce the positive perception of westerners held by
   the Chinese population and commit to long-term relationships to
   encourage trust by Chinese partners. Finally, we also observe that both
   populations exhibit similar pull-to-center bias when solving a decision
   problem under uncertainty (i.e., the newsvendor problem).

AB In countries that bear the heaviest burden of malaria, most patients
   seek medicine for the disease in the private sector. Because the
   availability and affordability of recommended malaria drugs provided by
   the private-sector distribution channel is poor, donors (e. g., the
   Global Fund) are devoting substantial resources to fund subsidies that
   encourage the channel to improve access to these drugs. A key question
   for a donor is whether it should subsidize the purchases and/or the
   sales of the private-sector distribution channel. We show that the donor
   should only subsidize purchases and should not subsidize sales. We
   characterize the robustness of this result to four key assumptions: the
   product's shelf life is long, the retailer has flexibility in setting
   the price, the retailer is the only level in the distribution channel,
   and retailers are homogeneous.

   lower future returns. This paper shows that the negative relation
   between turnover and future returns is stronger for firms with

AB Recent years have seen extensive investigation of the information
   aggregation properties of markets. However, relatively little is known
   about conditions under which a market will aggregate the private
   information of rational risk-averse traders who optimize their
   portfolios over time; in particular, what features of a market encourage
   traders to ultimately reveal their private information through trades?
   We consider a market model involving finitely many informed risk-averse
   traders interacting with a market maker. Our main result identifies a
   basic asymptotic smoothness condition on prices in the market that
   ensures information is aggregated as long as portfolios converge;
   furthermore, under this assumption, the allocation achieved is ex post
   Pareto efficient. Asymptotic smoothness is fairly mild: it requires
   that, eventually, infinitesimal purchases or sales should see the same
   per-unit price. Notably, we demonstrate that, under some mild
   conditions, algorithmic markets based on cost functions (or,
   equivalently, markets based on market scoring rules) aggregate the
   information of traders.

AB T his paper studies the effect of limited information in a sequential
   search setting where a single selection is to be made from a set of
   random potential options. We consider both a full-information problem,
   where the decision maker observes the exact value of each option as she
   searches, and a partial-information problem, in which the decision maker
   only learns the rank of the current option relative to the options that
   have already been observed. We develop a model that allows for a sharp
   contrast between search behavior in the two information settings, both
   theoretically and empirically. We present the results of an experiment
   that tests, and supports, the key prediction of our model
   analysis-limited information induces longer search. Our data further
   suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmarks in both
   informational settings. Importantly, subjects in our partial-information
   conditions are prone to stop prematurely during early stages of the
   search process and to suboptimally continue the search during late
   stages. We propose a simple model that succinctly captures the interplay
   of two symmetric choice and judgment biases that have asymmetric (but
   opposing) effects on the length of search.

AB This paper studies the impact of an electronic medical record (EMR)
   system on the productivity of physicians. Physicians influence a vast
   majority of treatment decisions and are central to the care delivery
   process; thus, it is important to understand how EMRs may impact the
   nature of their work. Our research builds on prior literature on
   physician productivity, IT productivity, and task-technology fit theory.
   We use a unique panel data set comprising 87 physicians specializing in
   internal medicine, pediatrics, and family practice, located in 12
   primary care clinics of an academic healthcare system in the western
   United States. We employ the Arellano-Bond system generalized method of
   moments estimation technique on our data set, which contains 3,186
   physician-month productivity observations collected over 39 months. We
   find that productivity drops sharply immediately after technology
   implementation and recovers partly over the next few months. The
   ultimate, longer-term impact depends on physician specialty. The net
   impact of the EMR system is more benign on internal medicine physicians
   than on pediatricians and family practitioners. We postulate that the
   fit provided by an EMR system to the task requirements of physicians of
   various specialties may be key to disentangling the productivity
   dynamics. Our research finds that on one hand, present-day EMR systems
   do not produce the kind of productivity gain that could lead to
   substantial savings in healthcare; at the same time, EMRs do not cause a
   major productivity loss on a sustained basis, as many physicians fear.

   offered assortment, which limit the number of products and the total
   space consumption of the products offered in each nest, respectively. We
   show that the optimal assortment under cardinality constraints can be
   obtained efficiently by solving a linear program. The assortment
   optimization problem under space constraints is NP-hard. We show how to
   obtain an assortment with a performance guarantee of 2 under space
   constraints. This assortment also provides a performance guarantee of
   1/(1 - is an element of) when the space requirement of each product is

   to offer to customers, as well as the prices of the offered products.

   science-based code of hygiene involving compliance with local health
   regulations or (2) a context-activated code of authenticity involving
   conformity to cultural norms. We propose that violations of the hygiene
   code recede in importance when the authenticity code is activated. This
   claim is supported by empirical analyses of 442,086 online consumer

   umpires are more likely to overrecognize quality by expanding the strike
   zone, and less likely to underrecognize quality by missing pitches in
   the strike zone for high-status pitchers. Ambiguity and the pitcher's
   reputation as a "control pitcher" moderate the effect of status on

AB In this paper we experimentally investigate how the allocation of
   inventory risk in a two-stage supply chain affects channel efficiency
   and profit distribution. We first evaluate two common wholesale price
   contracts that differ in which party incurs the risk associated with
   unsold inventory: a push contract in which the retailer incurs the risk
   and a pull contract in which the supplier incurs the risk. Our
   experimental results show that a pull contract achieves higher channel
   efficiency than that of a push contract, and that behavior
   systematically deviates from the standard theory in three ways: (1)
   stocking quantities are set too low, (2) wholesale prices are more
   favorable to the party stocking the inventory, and (3) some contracts
   are erroneously accepted or rejected. To account for these systematic
   regularities, we extend the existing theory and structurally estimate a
   number of behavioral models. The estimates suggest that a combination of
   loss aversion with errors organizes our data remarkably well. We apply
   our behavioral model to the advance purchase discount (APD) contract,
   which combines features of push and pull by allowing both parties to
   share the inventory risk, in a separate experiment as an out-of-sample
   test, and we find that it accurately predicts channel efficiency and
   qualitatively matches decisions. Two practical implications of our work
   are that (1) the push contract performs close to standard theoretical
   benchmarks, which implies that it is robust to behavioral biases, and
   (2) the APD contract weakly Pareto dominates the push contract;
   retailers are better off and suppliers are no worse off under the APD
   contract.

AB The central prediction of the current paper is that manufacturer price
   advertising may be a less effective tool for influencing demand than
   retailer price advertising. We manipulate the source of a price
   advertisement in an experiment run on a sample of pickup truck owners.
   Manufacturer price advertising leads to lower indicators of potential
   demand than dealer price advertising, even among consumers who are
   experienced with the brand. An econometric analysis of pickup truck
   sales, price, and advertising data shows that this effect is large
   enough to detect in market data. Manufacturer and dealer price
   advertising both increase the demand intercept and the responsiveness of
   demand to price, but the effects of dealer price advertising are larger.
   Although dealer price advertising is more effective than manufacturer
   price advertising, manufacturer price advertising may still be useful to
   reduce channel conflict.

   sustainability policies by 1993-termed as high sustainability
   companies-exhibit by 2009 distinct organizational processes compared to
   a matched sample of companies that adopted almost none of these
   policies-termed as low sustainability companies. The boards of directors
   of high sustainability companies are more likely to be formally
   responsible for sustainability, and top executive compensation
   incentives are more likely to be a function of sustainability metrics.
   High sustainability companies are more likely to have established
   processes for stakeholder engagement, to be more long-term oriented, and
   to exhibit higher measurement and disclosure of nonfinancial
   information. Finally, high sustainability companies significantly
   outperform their counterparts over the long term, both in terms of stock

   attitudes fluctuate over time following the violation of an internalized
   norm. We report the results of two experiments in which people who first
   made an immoral choice were then more likely to donate to charity than
   those who did not. In addition, those who knew that a donation
   opportunity would follow the potentially immoral choice behaved more
   unethically than those who did not know. We interpret this increase in
   charitable behavior as being driven by a temporal increase in guilt
   induced by past immoral actions. We term such behavior conscience
   accounting and discuss its importance in charitable giving and in the
   identification of social norms in choice behavior through time
   inconsistency.

AB Participants in dictator games frequently avoid learning whether their
   choice to maximize their own earnings will help or hurt the recipient
   and then choose selfishly, exploiting the "moral wiggle room" provided
   by their ignorance. However, this is found in an environment in which
   the dictator must actively learn the true payoffs, so inaction means
   ignorance. Does this effect persist when one must actively choose either
   to be ignorant or to be informed or when one must actively choose to
   remain ignorant? In fact, whereas 45% of dictators remain ignorant when
   one must click to become informed, this drops to 25% when one must click
   in either case and to 3% when one must click to remain ignorant.
   Although the exploitation of moral wiggle room is not merely an
   artifact, it is, much like social behavior itself, subject to
   environmental and psychological factors that may reinforce or undermine
   its impact.

AB We consider Cournot competition in the presence of congestion effects.
   Our model consists of several service providers with differentiated
   services, each competing for users who are sensitive to both price and
   congestion. We distinguish two types of congestion effects, depending on
   whether spillover costs exist, that is, where one service provider's
   congestion cost increases with the other providers' output level. We
   quantify the efficiency of an unregulated oligopoly with respect to the
   optimal social welfare with tight upper and lower bounds. We show that,
   when there is no spillover, the welfare loss in an unregulated oligopoly
   is limited to 25% of the social optimum, even in the presence of highly
   convex costs. On the other hand, when spillover cost is present, there
   does not exist a constant lower bound on the efficiency of an
   unregulated oligopoly, even with affine cost. We show that the
   efficiency depends on the relative magnitude between the marginal
   spillover cost and the marginal benefit to consumers.

AB Motivated by retailers' frequent introduction of new items to refresh
   product lines and maintain their market shares, we present the
   assortment packing problem in which a firm must decide, in advance, the
   release date of each product in a given collection over a selling
   season. Our formulation models the trade-offs among profit margins,
   preference weights, and limited life cycles. A key aspect of the problem
   is that each product is short-lived in the sense that, once introduced,
   its attractiveness lasts only a few periods and vanishes over time. The
   objective is to determine when to introduce each product to maximize the
   total profit over the selling season. Even for two periods, the
   corresponding optimization problem is shown to be NP-complete. As a
   result, we study a continuous relaxation of the problem that
   approximates the problem well, when the number of products is large.
   When margins are identical and product preferences decay exponentially,
   its solution can be characterized: it is optimal to introduce products
   with slower decays earlier. The structural properties of the relaxation
   also help us to develop several heuristics, for which we establish
   performance guarantees. We test our heuristics with data on sales and
   release dates of women's handbags from an accessories retailer. The
   numerical experiments show that the heuristics perform very well and can
   yield significant improvements in profitability.

AB We present a model of optimal allocation to liquid and illiquid assets,

   increased and state-dependent risk aversion and reduces the allocation
   to both liquid and illiquid risky assets. Uncertainty about the length
   of the illiquidity interval, as opposed to a deterministic nontrading
   interval, is a primary determinant of the cost of illiquidity. We allow
   market liquidity to vary from "normal" periods, when all assets are
   fully liquid, to "illiquidity crises," when some assets can only be
   traded infrequently. The possibility of a liquidity crisis leads to
   limited arbitrage in normal times. Investors are willing to forgo 2% of
   their wealth to hedge against illiquidity crises occurring once every 10

AB Empirical evidence suggests that information leakage in capital markets

   informed trader (e. g., a well-informed insider) to voluntarily leak
   information about an asset's value to one or more independent traders.
   Our model shows that, although leaking information dissipates the
   insider's information advantage about the asset's value, it enhances his
   information advantage about the asset's execution price relative to
   other informed traders. The profit impact of these two effects are
   countervailing. When there are a sufficient number of other informed
   traders, the profit impact from enhanced information dominates. Hence,
   the insider has incentives to leak some of his private information. We
   label this rational information leakage and discuss its implications for
   the regulation of insider trading.

AB It is widely acknowledged that the 2007 mortgage crisis was preceded by
   a broad deterioration in underwriting diligence. This paper shows that
   this deterioration varied by the industry affiliation of mortgage
   lenders. Loans issued by homebuilders and stand-alone lenders were
   significantly less likely to default than loans issued by depository
   banks and affiliates of major financial institutions. I argue that
   homebuilders and stand-alone lenders had the least financial capacity to
   hold mortgages, and their resulting need to sell loans quickly on the
   secondary market forced them to issue safer loans. Tests of other
   explanations, including differences in information and incentives to
   avoid foreclosure externalities, receive little support. This study
   highlights a novel means by which firm boundaries influence firm
   adaptation to changing market conditions by defining the boundaries of
   the internal capital markets and hence the relative constraints of
   constituent units.

AB Competitive positioning is a central, yet understudied, topic in
   strategy. Understanding positioning requires understanding two distinct
   mappings: how underlying policies are transformed into positions, and
   how positions are transformed into market performance. A complete
   treatment of positioning requires incorporating organizational design in
   the presence of policy interdependence; consumer choice in the presence
   of trade-offs among multiple product attributes; and competitive
   interactions among firms. We develop a model that integrates these
   elements. We show that in a multiattribute setting, trade-offs have
   critical, nonmonotonic effects on a range of strategy questions
   including the relationship between positions that are operationally
   efficient and those that remain viable in the face of competition as
   well as the concentration of market share in the industry. Of particular
   interest are implications for firm heterogeneity. We show that increases
   in business policy interdependence can decrease positioning
   heterogeneity among firms in an industry, depending on the nature of
   trade-offs. We also show that the relationship between strategy
   heterogeneity and positioning heterogeneity is moderated by the extent
   of policy interdependence.

AB It is clear from the growing role of ad exchanges in the real-time sale
   of advertising slots that Web publishers are considering a new
   alternative to their more traditional reservation-based ad contracts. To
   make this choice, the publisher must trade off, in real-time, the
   short-term revenue from ad exchange with the long-term benefits of
   delivering good spots to the reservation ads. In this paper we formalize
   this combined optimization problem as a multiobjective stochastic
   control problem and derive an efficient policy for online ad allocation
   in settings with general joint distribution over placement quality and
   exchange prices. We prove the asymptotic optimality of this policy in
   terms of any arbitrary trade-off between the quality of delivered
   reservation ads and revenue from the exchange, and we show that our
   policy approximates any Pareto-optimal point on the
   quality-versus-revenue curve. Experimental results on data derived from
   real publisher inventory confirm that there are significant benefits for
   publishers if they jointly optimize over both channels.

   are jointly determined, we show that integration protects assets in

   financial flexibility. We show that increases in standard measures of

   firms, whereas increases in product market competition (e. g., the risk
   of competitive preemption) predict exploitation by incumbents. We also
   show that alliances organized as licensing agreements or revenue-sharing

AB Refining is indispensable to almost every natural-resource-based
   commodity industry. It involves a series of complex processes that
   transform inputs with a wide range of quality characteristics into
   refined finished products sold to end markets. In this paper, we take
   the perspective of a profit-maximizing refiner that considers upgrading
   its existing simple refinery to include intermediate-conversion
   flexibility, i.e., the capability of converting heavy intermediate
   components to light ones. We present a stylized two-stage stochastic
   programming model of a petroleum refinery to investigate the value
   drivers of conversion flexibility and the impact of input and output
   market conditions on its economic potential. Conversion flexibility adds
   value to refineries by either transforming a nonprofitable situation
   into a profitable one (referred to as purchase benefit) or improving
   profitability of an already profitable situation (referred to as unit
   revenue benefit). In a real-data-calibrated numerical study, we find the
   value of conversion flexibility (VoC) to be significant, accounting for
   40% of the expected profit with conversion, and the purchase benefit and
   unit revenue benefit are equally important. Contrary to the intuition
   that, as a recourse action, conversion offers higher value for greater
   input price volatility, we find that VoC may decrease in input price
   volatility as a result of the differential impacts of increasing price
   volatility on the purchase benefit and the unit revenue benefit.
   Refineries also vary in their range flexibility, i.e., the ability to
   accommodate a narrow or wide range of inputs of different quality
   levels. Whether the range flexibility increases or decreases the value
   of conversion flexibility is affected by the direction in which the
   refinery expands its processing range and the heaviness of crude oils.

AB We study learning in a dynamic setting where identical copies of a good
   are sold over time through a sequence of second-price auctions. Each
   agent in the market has an unknown independent private valuation that
   determines the distribution of the reward she obtains from the good; for
   example, in sponsored search settings, advertisers may initially be
   unsure of the value of a click. Though the induced dynamic game is
   complex, we simplify analysis of the market using an approximation
   methodology known as mean field equilibrium (MFE). The methodology
   assumes that agents optimize only with respect to long-run average
   estimates of the distribution of other players' bids. We show a
   remarkable fact: In a mean field equilibrium, the agent has an optimal
   strategy where she bids truthfully according to a conjoint valuation.
   The conjoint valuation is the sum of her current expected valuation,
   together with an overbid amount that is exactly the expected marginal
   benefit of one additional observation about her true private valuation.
   Under mild conditions on the model, we show that an MFE exists, and that
   it is a good approximation to a rational agent's behavior as the number
   of agents increases. Formally, if every agent except one follows the MFE
   strategy, then the remaining agent's loss on playing the MFE strategy
   converges to zero as the number of agents in the market increases. We
   conclude by discussing the implications of the auction format and design
   on the auctioneer's revenue. In particular, we establish the revenue

AB Using stock price reactions to sudden deaths of top executives as a
   measure of expected contribution to shareholder value, we examine the
   relationship between executive pay and managerial contribution to
   shareholder value. We find, first, that the managerial labor market is
   characterized by positive sorting: managers with high perceived
   contributions to shareholder value obtain higher pay. The executive
   pay-contribution relationship is stronger for professional executives
   and for executives with high compensation. We estimate, second, that an
   average top executive (chief executive officer) appears to retain 71%
   (65%) of the marginal rent from the firm-manager relationship. We
   examine, third, how the executive pay-contribution relationship varies
   with individual, firm, and industry characteristics. Overall, our
   results are informative for the ongoing discussion about the level of
   executive compensation.

AB In markets where buyers and suppliers negotiate, supplier costs, buyer
   willingness to pay, and competition determine only a range of potential
   prices, leaving the final price dependent on other factors (e. g.,
   negotiating skill), which I call bargaining ability. I use a model of
   buyer demand and buyer-supplier bargaining, combined with detailed data
   on prices and quantities at the buyer-supplier relationship level, to
   estimate firm-bargaining abilities in the context of the coronary stent
   industry where different hospitals (buyers) pay different prices for the
   exact same product from the same supplier. I estimate that (1) variation
   in bargaining abilities explains 79% of this price variation, (2)
   bargaining ability has a large firm-specific component, and (3) changes
   in the distribution of bargaining abilities over time suggest learning
   as an important channel influencing bargaining ability.

   conflicting theoretical models have been used to explain how these
   communities respond to this tension. We conducted a case study of how
   one online coproduction community-the nine-year history of the Wikipedia
   article on autism-handles this tension. We find that the nature of the
   change-retain tension and the community's response to it fluctuates
   considerably over the life of the community. These changes bear striking
   similarities to processes associated with traditional software
   development life cycles, despite the absence of traditional control
   mechanisms. What initially appear to be conflicts in the extant
   literature actually describe different roles and production focus at the
   different stages of development. Disruptive events signal the need for
   the community to shift production focus, which often involves members
   joining and leaving the production process, rather than adopting new
   roles.

   number of recommendations given by adopters, number of social ties) to
   improve the aggregate penetration forecasts made by extant diffusion
   models. We capture social interactions through an individual-level
   hazard rate in such a way that the resulting aggregate penetration
   process is available in closed form and nests extant diffusion models.
   The parameters of the model may be estimated by combining early
   aggregate penetration data with social interactions data collected from
   a sample of consumers in as few as one time period. We illustrate our
   approach by applying it to the mixed influence model (Bass model) and
   the more recent asymmetric influence model. A field study conducted in
   collaboration with a consumer packaged goods company and a marketing
   research company confirms that incorporating social interactions data
   using the proposed approach has the potential to result in improved
   aggregate penetration forecasts in managerially relevant settings.

   restricts sellers to either developing the ideas fully (to sell them
   later) or abandoning them. In contrast, experienced sellers can attract
   buyers at any stage, and they sell worse ideas sooner and better ideas
   later. These results have important managerial implications for buyers

   While the prevailing theory of disruptive innovation suggests that this

AB This work examines the process of admission to a hospital's intensive
   care unit (ICU). ICUs currently lack systematic admission criteria,
   largely because the impact of ICU admission on patient outcomes has not
   been well quantified. This makes evaluating the performance of candidate
   admission strategies difficult. Using a large patient-level data set of
   more than 190,000 hospitalizations across 15 hospitals, we first
   quantify the cost of denied ICU admission for a number of patient
   outcomes. We use hospital operational factors as instrumental variables
   to handle the endogeneity of the admission decisions and identify
   important specification issues that are required for this approach to be
   valid. Using the quantified cost estimates, we then provide a simulation
   framework for evaluating various admission strategies' performance. By
   simulating a hospital with 21 ICU beds, we find that we could save about
   $1.9 million per year by using an optimal policy based on observables
   designed to reduce readmissions and hospital length of stay. We also
   discuss the role of unobserved patient factors, which physicians may
   discretionarily account for when making admission decisions, and show
   that including these unobservables could result in a more than threefold
   increase in benefits compared to just optimizing the policy over the
   observable patient factors.

AB We study a firm's optimal pricing policy under commitment. The firm's
   objective is to maximize its long-term average revenue given a steady
   arrival of strategic customers. In particular, customers arrive over
   time, are strategic in timing their purchases, and are heterogeneous
   along two dimensions: their valuation for the firm's product and their
   willingness to wait before purchasing or leaving. The customers'
   patience and valuation may be correlated in an arbitrary fashion. For
   this general formulation, we prove that the firm may restrict attention
   to cyclic pricing policies, which have length, at most, twice the
   maximum willingness to wait of the customer population. To efficiently
   compute optimal policies, we develop a dynamic programming approach that
   uses a novel state space that is general, capable of handling arbitrary
   problem primitives, and that generalizes to finite horizon problems with
   nonstationary parameters. We analyze the class of monotone pricing
   policies and establish their suboptimality in general. Optimal policies
   are, in a typical scenario, characterized by nested sales, where the
   firm offers partial discounts throughout each cycle, offers a
   significant discount halfway through the cycle, and holds its largest
   discount at the end of the cycle. We further establish a form of
   equivalence between the problem of pricing for a stream of heterogeneous
   strategic customers and pricing for a pool of heterogeneous customers
   who may stockpile units of the product.

   both from consumer purchases as well as from disclosing consumer
   information in a secondary market. Consumers choose which firm to
   patronize and how much personal information to provide it with. We show
   that firms maximize profits by focusing on a single revenue source and
   competing at the extensive rather than the intensive margin,
   outperforming competitors by attracting a larger customer base. We also
   show that competition drives the provision of services with a low level
   of consumer information disclosure (high level of privacy), but higher
   competition intensity in the marketplace need not improve privacy when
   consumers exhibit low willingness to pay. Our findings are relevant to

   additional arrival to the queue leads to an increase in abandonment
   probability equivalent to a 25-minute or 5-minute increase in wait time,
   respectively. We also show that patients are sensitive to being "jumped"

   visual queue elements is not currently accounted for in most queuing

   center. We assume that there is an infinite supply of outbound work to

   We propose a logarithmic safety staffing rule, combined with a threshold
   control policy, ensuring that agents' utilization is very close to one
   at all times, but that there are practically always idle agents present.
   Specifically, we prove that it is possible to have almost all inbound

AB We examine the role of general counsel (GC) in firms' financial
   reporting quality. GCs have a broad oversight role within the firm,
   including keeping the firm in compliance with laws and regulations and
   dealing with potential violations with respect to financial reporting.
   Several high-profile U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
   investigations have resulted in lawsuits or indictments against GCs for
   perpetrating financial fraud and caused many to ask: where were the
   gatekeepers? As such, we examine the conditions under which GCs may
   stray from their primary role as gatekeepers. Mainly, we empirically
   investigate claims that compensation can impair the independence or
   compromise the professional judgment of a GC. We measure the level of
   compensation using the GC's presence or absence in the top five officers
   of the firm by compensation. Results are consistent with GCs straying
   from their role as gatekeepers, to some extent, when highly compensated
   in a manner similar to the CEO and CFO. In particular, firms with highly
   compensated GCs have lower financial reporting quality and more
   aggressive accounting practices, including management of the litigation
   reserve. However, the results also show that highly compensated GCs play
   an important gatekeeping role in keeping the firm in compliance with
   generally accepted accounting principles. Thus, highly compensated GCs
   appear to tolerate moderately aggressive behavior but constrain it such
   that it would not result in violation of securities laws and jeopardize
   their standing within the firm.

AB We implement a gym-attendance incentive intervention and elicit
   subjects' predictions of their postintervention attendance. We find that
   subjects greatly overpredict future attendance, which we interpret as
   evidence of partial naivete with respect to present bias. We find a
   significant postintervention attendance increase, which we interpret as
   habit formation, and which subjects appear not to predict ex ante. These
   results are consistent with a model of projection bias with respect to
   habit formation. Neither the intervention incentives, nor the small
   posttreatment incentives involved in our elicitation mechanism, appear
   to crowd out existing intrinsic motivation. The combination of naivete
   and projection bias in gym attendance can help to explain limited
   take-up of commitment devices by dynamically inconsistent agents, and
   points to new forms of contracts. Alternative explanations of our
   results are discussed.

AB Intermediaries can choose between functioning as a marketplace (in which
   suppliers sell their products directly to buyers) or as a reseller (by
   purchasing products from suppliers and selling them to buyers). We model
   this as a decision between whether control rights over a noncontractible
   decision variable (the choice of some marketing activity) are better
   held by suppliers (the marketplace mode) or by the intermediary (the
   reseller mode). Whether the marketplace or the reseller mode is
   preferred depends on whether independent suppliers or the intermediary
   have more important information relevant to the optimal tailoring of
   marketing activities for each specific product. We show that this
   trade-off is shifted toward the reseller mode when marketing activities
   create spillovers across products and when network effects lead to
   unfavorable expectations about supplier participation. If the reseller
   has a variable cost advantage (respectively, disadvantage) relative to
   the marketplace, then the trade-off is shifted toward the marketplace
   for long-tail (respectively, short-tail) products. We thus provide a
   theory of which products an intermediary should offer in each mode. We
   also provide some empirical evidence that supports our main results.

AB We introduce a simple solution to help consumers manage choices between
   healthy and unhealthy food options: vice-virtue bundles. Vice-virtue
   bundles are item aggregates with varying proportions of both vice and
   virtue, holding overall quantity constant. Four studies compare choice
   and perceptions of differently composed vice-virtue bundles relative to
   one another and to pure vice and pure virtue options. Although multiple
   consumer segments can be identified, results suggest that people overall
   tend to prefer vice-virtue bundles with small (1 4) to medium (12)
   proportions of vice rather than large (3 4) proportions of vice.
   Moreover, people generally rate vice-virtue bundles with small vice
   proportions as healthier but similarly tasty as bundles with larger vice
   proportions. For most individuals, choice patterns are different from
   those predicted by variety-seeking accounts alone. Instead, these
   findings provide evidence of asymmetric effectiveness of small vice and
   virtue proportions at addressing taste and health goals, respectively.

AB We analyze a dynamic bargaining game in which a seller and a buyer
   negotiate over quantity and payment to trade for a product. Both firms
   are impatient, and they make alternating offers until an agreement is
   reached. The buyer is privately informed about his type, which can be
   high or low: the high type's demand is stochastically larger than the
   low type's. In the dynamic negotiation process, the seller can screen,
   whereas the buyer can signal information through their offers, and the
   buyer has an endogenous and type-dependent reservation profit. With
   rational assumptions on the seller's belief structure, we characterize
   the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the bargaining game. Interestingly,
   we find that both quantity distortion and information rent may be
   avoided depending on the firms' relative patience, and the seller may
   reach an agreement with either the high type or the low type first, or
   with both simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore our model to
   characterize the effect of demand forecasting accuracy on firm
   profitability. We find that improved demand forecast benefits the buyer
   but hurts the seller when the buyer's forecasting accuracy is low.
   However, once the buyer's forecasting accuracy exceeds a threshold, both
   firms will benefit from further improvement of the forecast. This
   observation makes an interesting contrast to previous findings based on
   the one-shot principal-agent model, in which improvement of forecasting
   accuracy mostly leads to a win-lose outcome for the two firms, and the
   buyer has an incentive to improve his forecasting accuracy only when it
   is extremely low.

AB Compensation not only provides incentives to an existing manager but
   also affects the type of manager attracted to the firm. This paper
   examines the dual incentive and sorting effects of performance pay in a
   simple contracting model of endogenous participation. Unless the manager
   is highly risk averse, sorting dampens optimal pay-performance
   sensitivity (PPS) because PPS beyond a nominal amount transfers
   unnecessary (information) rent to the manager. This helps explain why
   empirical estimates of PPS are much lower than predictions from models
   of moral hazard alone. The model also predicts that sorting under
   asymmetric information causes the firm to turn away more candidates than
   would be efficient; PPS increases in the cost of hiring the manager and
   in the manager's outside option, but decreases in output risk,
   information risk, and managerial risk aversion; and the firm becomes
   more selective in hiring as either the manager's outside option, the
   cost of hiring, risk aversion, output risk, or information risk
   increases.

AB Prior literature finds that long-lasting changes in firms' disclosure
   policies and information environment affect the cost of equity.
   Information asymmetry, however, also changes during the fiscal quarter.
   Firms disclose information periodically, and in between disclosure
   dates, traders can obtain private information, and adverse-selection
   risk increases. Such temporary increases in information asymmetry are
   usually considered to be diversifiable or too small to impact expected
   stock returns. In addition, investors may postpone trades or sell other
   assets in their portfolio on high information asymmetry days. We,
   however, find that returns increase significantly on days during the
   fiscal quarter when adverse-selection risk is high and liquidity low.
   Consistent with theory, we show that temporary asymmetry affects returns
   when investors demand liquidity and market makers bear risk for carrying
   capacity and providing it.

AB We examine if and how incumbent firms respond to entry and entry threats
   using nonprice modes of competition. Our analysis focuses on airline
   service quality. We find that incumbent on-time performance (OTP)
   actually worsens in response to entry, and even entry threats, by
   Southwest Airlines. Since Southwest is both a top-performing airline in
   OTP and a low-cost carrier (LCC), we conjecture that this response by
   incumbents may be due to a cost-cutting strategy that allows for intense
   postentry price competition along with preentry deterrence, or it may be
   due to a postentry differentiation strategy along with preentry
   accommodation. Further analysis of entry and entry threats by other
   airlines is inconclusive, providing evidence that is partially
   consistent with both hypotheses. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of
   worsening OTP can only be observed when the (potential) entrant is a LCC
   (Southwest, Jet Blue, and AirTran).

   such aggregates by eliminating poorly performing individuals from the

   performance relative to the group and use positive contributors to build
   a weighting model for aggregating forecasts. In Study 1, we analyze
   1,233 judges forecasting almost 200 current events to illustrate the
   superiority of our model over unweighted models and models weighted by
   measures of absolute performance. In Study 2, we replicate our findings
   by using economic forecasts from the European Central Bank and show how
   the method can be used to identify smaller crowds of the top positive
   contributors. We show that the model derives its power from identifying
   experts who consistently outperform the crowd.

AB We propose an approach for estimating customer preferences for a set of
   substitutable products using only sales transactions and product
   availability data. The underlying demand framework combines a general,
   nonparametric discrete choice model with a Bernoulli process of arrivals
   over time. The choice model is defined by a discrete probability mass
   function (pmf) on a set of possible preference rankings of alternatives,
   and it is compatible with any random utility model. An arriving customer
   is assumed to purchase the available option that ranks highest in her
   preference list. The problem we address is how to jointly estimate the
   arrival rate and the pmf of the rank-based choice model under a maximum
   likelihood criterion. Since the potential number of customer types is
   factorial, we propose a market discovery algorithm that starts with a
   parsimonious set of types and enlarge it by automatically generating new
   types that increase the likelihood value. Numerical experiments confirm
   the potential of our proposal. For a realistic data set in the
   hospitality industry, our approach improves the root mean square errors
   between predicted and observed purchases computed under independent
   demand model estimates by 67%-93%.

   These formulations are obtained by exploiting hidden convexity of the

   are given, the problem can be reformulated as a second-order cone
   program. Based on the structural properties of this formulation, under a
   mild condition, we derive the optimal time allowances in closed form and
   prove that it is optimal to sequence jobs in increasing order of job

AB When senior managers make the critical decision of whether to assign

   dictates the resource level ( top-down) and one that delegates the
   resource decision and gives up control in favor of more precise
   information ( bottom-up). We investigate this choice and vary the amount
   of information asymmetry between stakeholders, the "penalty for failure"
   imposed upon project managers, and how challenging the initiative is for
   the firm. We find that no single decision process is the "best."
   Bottom-up processes are beneficial for more challenging initiatives.
   Increased organizational penalties may prompt the firm to choose a
   narrower scope and deter the approval of profitable initiatives. Such
   penalties, however, enable an effective decision process known as

AB The "law of one price" states that if prices for the same or highly

   price differences. However, several frictions prevent traders from doing
   this, including lack of information about prices and difficulty trading
   across locations. Electronic commerce has the potential to reduce these
   frictions by increasing price visibility and lowering transaction costs.
   We analyze this by studying how the diffusion of an electronic channel
   affected geographic trading patterns and price dispersion in the
   wholesale used vehicle market from 2003 to 2008. We find that buyers
   used the channel to shift their demand geographically to exploit price
   differences, which reduced geographic price dispersion. We find that the

   we find little evidence that this led to reduced geographic price

AB Consumers who are close to one another in a social network often make

   homophily or social influence, as well as common exogenous factors.
   Latent homophily means consumers who are connected to one another are
   likely to have similar characteristics and product preferences. Social
   influence refers to the ability of one consumer to directly influence
   another consumer's decision based upon their communication. We present
   an empirical study of purchases of caller ring-back tones using data
   from an Asian mobile network that predicts consumers' purchase timing
   and choice decisions. We simultaneously measure latent homophily and
   social influence, while also accounting for exogenous factors.
   Identification is achieved due to our dynamic, panel data structure and
   the availability of detailed communication data. We find strong
   influence effects and latent homophily effects in both the purchase
   timing and product choice decisions of consumers.

AB This paper examines probabilistic selling (PS) as an
   inventory-management mechanism, paying special attention to the impact
   of the timing of product assignment to buyers of probabilistic goods. In
   practice, sellers tend to offer probabilistic products only after major
   demand uncertainty has been resolved. By deferring product assignments,
   a firm is able to obtain more information about demand for each specific
   product before deciding which product to assign to consumers. However,
   our analysis demonstrates that PS can be an effective
   inventory-management mechanism even if the firm allocates products
   before knowing which product will be more popular and, thus, scarcer.
   Interestingly, we show that it can be more profitable for the firm to
   allocate products to consumers before, rather than after, learning the
   true demand for a product because, although early allocation imposes
   higher inventory costs (as a result of larger required inventory
   levels), it also enables the firm to charge higher prices. Our results
   also reveal that, when introducing probabilistic goods, the firm should
   order less inventory (relative to the case where probabilistic goods are
   not offered) if costs are very low but more inventory otherwise.
   Finally, we show that PS, as an inventory-management mechanism, can
   create a win-win situation, both improving profit and increasing social
   welfare.

   observing each subject's portfolio choice in two different contexts that
   differ only by the presence or absence of an actuarially neutral
   background risk. Our main result is that most of the subjects are risk
   vulnerable: 81% chose a less risky portfolio when exposed to background
   risk. More precisely, 47% invested a strictly smaller amount in the
   risky asset, whereas 34% were indifferent. Furthermore, contrasting the
   predictions provided by competing decision-theoretic models, we conclude
   that expected utility theory best fits our experimental data.

AB We present a theoretical account of the origin of the shapes of utility,
   probability weighting, and temporal discounting functions. In an
   experimental test of the theory, we systematically change the shape of
   revealed utility, weighting, and discounting functions by manipulating
   the distribution of monies, probabilities, and delays in the choices
   used to elicit them. The data demonstrate that there is no stable
   mapping between attribute values and their subjective equivalents.
   Expected and discounted utility theories, and also their descendants
   such as prospect theory and hyperbolic discounting theory, simply assert
   stable mappings to describe choice data and offer no account of the
   instability we find. We explain where the shape of the mapping comes
   from and, in describing the mechanism by which people choose, explain
   why the shape depends on the distribution of gains, losses, risks, and
   delays in the environment.

AB Data on inventors and assignees of patents are used to analyze the
   mobility of semiconductor inventors. Exploiting data on the origins of
   semiconductor producers with larger sales, we argue that the higher
   mobility of semiconductor inventors in Silicon Valley is in great part
   due to the entry of spinoffs there. Our empirical evidence suggests that
   spinoff entry promoted mobility in Silicon Valley even before the
   industry was clustered there. Agglomeration economies and the ban on
   noncompete covenants may influence spinoff entry, but spinoffs promote
   mobility even in the absence of those conditions. Because most of the
   greater inventor mobility in Silicon Valley corresponds to inventors
   moving from incumbents to recent entrants, the benefits that arise from
   greater mobility rates will be disproportionately reaped by new firms.

AB In using the generalized second-price (GSP) auction to sell advertising
   slots, a search engine faces several challenges. Advertisers do not
   truthfully bid their valuations, and the valuations are uncertain.
   Furthermore, advertisers are budget constrained. In this paper we
   analyze a stylized model of the first-page bid estimate (FPBE) mechanism
   first developed by Google and demonstrate its advantages in dealing with
   these challenges. We show why and when the FPBE mechanism yields higher
   profits for the search engine compared with the traditional GSP auction
   and the GSP auction with advertiser-specific minimum bid. In the event
   that a high-valuation advertiser is budget constrained, the search
   engine can use the FPBE mechanism to alter the listing order with the
   intent of keeping the high-valuation advertiser in the auction for a
   longer time. The resulting increase in the search engine's profits is
   not necessarily at the expense of the advertisers because the combined
   profits of the advertisers and the search engine increase.

AB Databases play a central role in evidence-based innovations in business,
   economics, social, and health sciences. In modern business and society,
   there are rapidly growing demands for constructing analytically valid
   databases that also are secure and protect sensitive information to meet
   customer and public expectations, to minimize financial losses, and to
   comply with privacy regulations and laws. We propose new data
   perturbation and shuffling (DPS) procedures, named MORE, for this
   purpose. As compared with existing DPS methods, MORE can substantially
   increase the utility of secure databases without increasing disclosure
   risk. MORE is capable of preserving important nonmonotonic relationships
   among attributes, such as the inverted-U relationship between
   competition and innovation. Maintaining such relationships is often the
   key to determining optimal levels of policy and managerial
   interventions. MORE does not require data to be of particular types or
   have particular distributional shapes. Instead, it provides unified,
   flexible, and robust algorithms to mask general types of confidential
   variables with arbitrary distributions, thereby making it suitable for
   general-purpose data masking. Since MORE nests the commonly used
   generalized linear models as special cases, a much wider range of
   statistical analyses can be conducted by using the secure databases with
   results similar to those achieved by using the original databases.
   Unlike existing DPS approaches that typically require a joint model for
   all variables, MORE requires no modeling of nonconfidential variables
   and thus further increases the robustness of secure databases.
   Evaluation of MORE through Monte Carlo simulation studies and empirical
   applications demonstrates that it performs better than existing
   data-masking methods.

AB A retailer's assortment decision results from a process of
   give-and-take, during which the retailer may bid manufacturers against
   one another, and the terms of trade offer plenty of flexibility for
   allocating the profit among the retailer and manufacturers. We adopt a
   bargaining framework to capture such an assortment selection process. We
   investigate the properties of the profit allocations that could emerge
   in a decentralized supply chain. In our model, the retailer engages in
   simultaneous bilateral negotiations with all manufacturers. Our model
   and analysis produce managerial insights that could not be obtained in
   the absence of a bargaining perspective on assortment planning. For
   example, we find that when a manufacturer improves its product, such
   improvements not only benefit the retailer but might even benefit
   competing manufacturers. In fact, even improvements to out-of-assortment
   products can increase the profits of the retailer and certain
   in-assortment manufacturers. Hence, our results suggest that a
   manufacturer can benefit from collaborating with judiciously chosen
   competitors.

AB We consider a seller who can sell her product over two periods, advance
   and spot. The seller has private information about the product quality,
   which is unknown to customers in advance and publicly revealed in spot.
   The question we consider is whether the seller has an incentive to
   signal quality in advance and, if so, how she can convey a credible
   signal of product quality. We characterize the seller's signaling
   strategy and find that rationing of capacity in the advance period is an
   effective tool of signaling product quality. We find that the
   high-quality seller can distinguish herself by allocating less capacity
   than the low-quality seller in the advance period. We show that this
   signaling mechanism exists whenever advance selling would be optimal for
   both the high-quality and low-quality sellers if quality were known by
   the consumers. Interestingly, the seller's ability to ration (rationing
   flexibility) sometimes disadvantages the seller; this effect is
   independent of product quality.

AB A country's human capital and economic productivity increasingly depend
   on the Internet as a result of its expanding role in providing
   information and communications. This has prompted a search for ways to
   increase Internet adoption and narrow its disparity across countries-the
   global "digital divide." Previous work has focused on demographic,
   economic, and infrastructure determinants of Internet access that are
   difficult to change in the short run. Internet content increases
   adoption and can be changed more quickly; however, the magnitude of its
   impact, and therefore its effectiveness as a policy and strategy tool,
   has until now been unknown. Quantifying the role of content is
   challenging because of feedback (network effects) between content and
   adoption: more content stimulates adoption, which in turn increases the
   incentive to create content. We develop a methodology to overcome this
   endogeneity problem. We find a statistically and economically
   significant effect, implying that policies promoting content creation
   can substantially increase adoption. Because it is ubiquitous, Internet
   content is also useful to effect social change across countries. Content
   has a greater effect on adoption in countries with more disparate
   languages, making it a useful tool to overcome linguistic isolation. Our
   results offer guidance for policymakers on country characteristics that
   influence adoption's responsiveness to content and for Internet firms on
   where to expand internationally and how to quantify content investments.

   But what is the most efficient tool for microenterprise development? We
   study this question in a developing country context (Tanzania), where
   microenterprises are the source of employment for more than half of the
   labor force, and we report from a field experiment that jointly
   investigated the importance of a human capital intervention (business
   training) and a financial capital intervention (business grant). Using
   data from three survey rounds, a lab experiment, and administrative
   records of the microfinance institution, we present evidence on business
   performance, management practices, happiness, business knowledge, and
   noncognitive abilities. Our study demonstrates strong effects of the
   combination of the two interventions on male entrepreneurs, while the
   effects on female entrepreneurs are much more muted. The results suggest
   that long-term finance is an important constraint for microfinance
   entrepreneurs, but that business training is essential to transform
   financial capital into productive investments. Our study also points to
   the need for more comprehensive measures to promote the businesses of

AB We consider a multiperiod single product pricing problem with an unknown
   demand curve. The seller's objective is to adjust prices in each period
   so as to maximize cumulative expected revenues over a given finite time
   horizon; in doing so, the seller needs to resolve the tension between
   learning the unknown demand curve and maximizing earned revenues. The
   main question that we investigate is the following: How large of a
   revenue loss is incurred if the seller uses a simple parametric model
   that differs significantly (i.e., is misspecified) relative to the
   underlying demand curve? We measure performance by analyzing the price
   trajectory induced by this misspecified model and quantifying the
   magnitude of revenue losses (as a function of the time horizon) relative
   to an oracle that knows the true underlying demand curve. The "price of
   misspecification" is expected to be significant if the parametric model
   is overly restrictive. Somewhat surprisingly, we show (under reasonably

AB The transportation sector's carbon footprint and dependence on oil are
   of deep concern to policy makers in many countries. Use of all-electric
   drive trains is arguably the most realistic medium-term solution to
   address these concerns. However, motorist anxiety induced by an electric
   vehicle's limited range and high battery cost have constrained consumer
   adoption. A novel switching-station-based solution is touted as a
   promising remedy. Vehicles use standardized batteries that, when
   depleted, can be switched for fully charged batteries at switching
   stations, and motorists only pay for battery use. We build a model that
   highlights the key mechanisms driving adoption and use of electric
   vehicles in this new switching-station-based electric vehicle system and
   contrast it with conventional electric vehicles. Our model employs
   results from repairable item inventory theory to capture
   switching-station operation; we embed this model in a behavioral model
   of motorist use and adoption. Switching-station systems effectively
   transfer range risk from motorists to the station operator, who, through
   statistical economies of scale, can better manage it. We find that this
   transfer of risk can lead to higher electric vehicle adoption than in a
   conventional system, but it also encourages more driving than a
   conventional system does. We calibrate our models with motorist behavior
   data, electric vehicle technology data, operation costs, and emissions
   data to estimate the relative effectiveness of the two systems under the
   status quo and other plausible future scenarios. We find that the system
   that is more effective at reducing emissions is often less effective at
   reducing oil dependence, and the misalignment between the two objectives
   is most severe when the energy mix is coal heavy and has advanced
   battery technology. Increases in gasoline prices (by imposition of
   taxes, for instance) are much more effective in reducing carbon
   emissions, whereas battery-price-reducing policy interventions are more
   effective for reducing oil dependence. Taken together, our results help
   a policy maker identify the superior system for achieving the desired
   objectives. They also highlight that policy makers should not conflate
   the dual objectives of oil dependence and emissions reductions as the
   preferred system, and the policy interventions that further that system
   may be different for the two objectives.

   find that independent directors socially connected to their firms'
   senior executives earn significantly higher returns than unconnected
   independent directors in stock sales transactions. The network effect on
   independent directors' trading profitability is stronger in firms with
   higher information asymmetry and with more powerful executives. In
   addition, the trading returns of independent directors previously
   unconnected with firm executives increase after the arrival of a
   connected executive and drop after the connected executive leaves the
   firm. Moreover, the net stock sales by connected directors predict
   future negative news for up to three quarters. As a comparison, the
   trading returns of connected and unconnected independent directors do
   not differ significantly in stock purchases. Taken together, our results
   suggest that social connections help independent directors gain access

   information "clumped together" rather than piecewise. We conduct a
   controlled lab experiment where subjects participate in a lottery and
   can choose between different resolutions of uncertainty (clumped or
   piecewise) and analyze which kind of resolution is preferred. Two
   additional treatments allow us to get a quantitative measure of
   subjects' preferences over different information structures. Our data
   provide little support for a systematic aversion to piecewise
   information on the aggregate level. In additional treatment conditions,
   we demonstrate the robustness of our findings and explore potential
   explanations.

AB Do hospitals experience safety tipping points as utilization increases,
   and if so, what are the implications for hospital operations management?
   We argue that safety tipping points occur when managerial escalation
   policies are exhausted and workload variability buffers are depleted.
   Front-line clinical staff is forced to ration resources and, at the same
   time, becomes more error prone as a result of elevated stress hormone
   levels. We confirm the existence of safety tipping points for
   in-hospital mortality using the discharge records of 82,280 patients
   across six high-mortality-risk conditions from 256 clinical departments
   of 83 German hospitals. Focusing on survival during the first seven days
   following admission, we estimate a mortality tipping point at an
   occupancy level of 92.5%. Among the 17% of patients in our sample who
   experienced occupancy above the tipping point during the first seven
   days of their hospital stay, high occupancy accounted for one in seven
   deaths. The existence of a safety tipping point has important
   implications for hospital management. First, flexible capacity expansion
   is more cost-effective for safety improvement than rigid capacity,
   because it will only be used when occupancy reaches the tipping point.
   In the context of our sample, flexible staffing saves more than 40% of
   the cost of a fully staffed capacity expansion, while achieving the same
   reduction in mortality. Second, reducing the variability of demand by
   pooling capacity in hospital clusters can greatly increase safety in a
   hospital system, because it reduces the likelihood that a patient will
   experience occupancy levels beyond the tipping point. Pooling the
   capacity of nearby hospitals in our sample reduces the number of deaths
   due to high occupancy by 34%.

AB This paper investigates the mechanism through which short selling of a
   bank's stocks can trigger the failure of the bank. In the model,
   creditors, who learn information from stock prices, will grow
   increasingly unsure about the bank's true fundamentals in facing noisier
   stock prices; thus a run on the bank is more likely because of
   creditors' concave payoff. Understanding this, speculators conduct short
   selling beforehand to amplify (il)liquidity and add noise to stock
   prices, triggering a bank run, and subsequently profit from the bank's
   failure. We show that short-selling attacks on a bank involve two runs:
   the aggressive run among speculators and the conservative run among
   creditors. These two runs interact and reinforce each other, with
   compound feedback loops that drastically increase the probability of the
   collapse of the bank. We discuss policy implications of the model.

AB We investigate the impact of delegating decision making to information
   technology (IT) on an important human decision bias-the sunk cost
   effect. To address our research question, we use a unique data set
   containing actual market transaction data for approximately 7,000
   pay-per-bid auctions. In contrast with the laboratory experiments of
   previous related studies, our research presents the unique advantage of
   investigating the effects of IT-enabled automated bidding agents on the
   occurrence of a decision bias in real market transactions. We identify
   normatively irrational decision scenarios and analyze consumer behavior
   in these situations. Our findings show that participants with a higher
   behavioral investment are more likely to violate the assumption of
   normative economic rationality because of the sunk cost effect. More
   importantly, we observe that the delegation of auction participation,
   i.e., actual bidding, to IT significantly reduces the occurrence of the
   sunk cost effect in subsequent decisions made by the same individual. We
   can attribute this reduction to the comparably lower behavioral
   investments incurred by auction participants who delegate their bidding
   to IT. In particular, by mitigating different contributors of behavioral
   investments, delegating to IT reduces the likelihood of the occurrence
   of the sunk cost effect by more than 50%.

AB Ad exchanges are emerging Internet markets where advertisers may
   purchase display ad placements, in real time and based on specific
   viewer information, directly from publishers via a simple auction
   mechanism. Advertisers join these markets with a prespecified budget and
   participate in multiple second-price auctions over the length of a
   campaign. This paper studies the competitive landscape that arises in ad
   exchanges and the implications for publishers' decisions. The presence
   of budgets introduces dynamic interactions among advertisers that need
   to be taken into account when attempting to characterize the bidding
   landscape or the impact of changes in the auction design. To this end,
   we introduce the notion of a fluid mean-field equilibrium (FMFE) that is
   behaviorally appealing and computationally tractable, and in some
   important cases, it yields a closed-form characterization. We establish
   that an FMFE approximates well the rational behavior of advertisers in
   these markets. We then show how this framework may be used to provide
   sharp prescriptions for key auction design decisions that publishers
   face in these markets. In particular, we show that ignoring budgets, a
   common practice in this literature, can result in significant profit
   losses for the publisher when setting the reserve price.

AB Modeling consumer heterogeneity helps practitioners understand market
   structures and devise effective marketing strategies. In this research
   we study finite mixture specifications for modeling consumer
   heterogeneity where each regression coefficient has its own finite
   mixture-that is, an attribute finite mixture model. An important
   challenge of such an approach to modeling heterogeneity lies in its
   estimation. A proposed Bayesian estimation approach, based on recent
   advances in reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, can
   estimate parameters for the attribute-based finite mixture model,
   assuming that the number of components for each finite mixture is a
   discrete random variable. An attribute specification has several
   advantages over traditional, vector-based, finite mixture
   specifications; specifically, the attribute mixture model offers a more
   appropriate aggregation of information than does the vector
   specification facilitating estimation. In an extensive simulation study
   and an empirical application, we show that the attribute model can
   recover complex heterogeneity structures, making it dominant over
   traditional (vector) finite mixture regression models and a strong
   contender compared to mixture-of-normals models for modeling
   heterogeneity.

AB This paper studies competition between firms whose "products" (content)
   are generated by their customers (users). Video sharing sites, social
   networks, online games, etc. all rely heavily on user-generated content
   and have been growing significantly in the last decade. We model a
   Hotelling style market in which consumers have heterogeneous tastes
   along a circular city. In a first step, we consider two ex ante
   identical firms whose offerings entirely depend on user-generated
   content. Consumers contribute content to the firm they join and benefit
   from the content provided by the others, their valuation being higher
   the closer the content contributor is to the content consumer (i.e.,
   there are local network effects). In such a setting, we show that ex
   ante identical firms can acquire differentiated market positions that
   spontaneously emerge from user-generated content. Moreover, such
   differentiation may take interesting patterns, wherein a firm
   simultaneously attracts multiple distinct consumer segments that are
   isolated from each other. Greater segregation, measured by the number of
   disjoint segments in each platform, reduces consumer valuation for
   content, but interestingly, it intensifies firm competition. We show
   that this insight can help us refine the set of possible equilibria. In
   a second step, we consider firms that explicitly differentiate their
   offerings by generating some content on their own. We show that
   user-generated content may strengthen or defeat firms' intended
   positioning (i.e., firms attract consumers located opposite to their
   chosen positions) and consumer surplus may be higher in the latter case.
   Finally, we allow multihoming by consumers and show that the previous
   equilibrium patterns remain valid, but in most equilibria, a subset of
   consumers (located between rival firms' core clienteles) are
   multihomers. More multihoming consumers imply reduced differentiation
   and higher degree of platform competition. We relate these findings to
   anecdotal evidence and explore their strategic implications for
   competing firms relying on user-generated content.

AB We address the contested state of theory and the mixed empirical
   evidence on the relationship between turbulence and vertical scope by
   studying how turbulence affects the benefits of commitment from
   integrated development of components and the benefits of flexibility
   from sourcing components externally. We show that increasing turbulence
   first increases but then decreases the relative value of vertical
   integration. Moderate turbulence reduces the value of flexibility by
   making supplier selection more difficult and increases the value of
   commitment by mitigating the status quo bias of integrated structures.
   Both effects improve the value of integration. Higher levels of
   turbulence undermine the adaptive benefits of commitment, but have a
   less adverse effect on flexibility, making nonintegration more
   attractive. We also show how complexity and uneven rates of turbulence
   moderate the nonmonotonic relationship between turbulence and
   integration.

AB Online crowdfunding has received a great deal of attention as a
   promising avenue to fostering entrepreneurship and innovation. Because
   online settings bring increased visibility and traceability of
   transactions, many crowdfunding platforms provide mechanisms that enable
   a campaign contributor to conceal his or her identity or contribution
   amount from peers. We study the impact of these information (privacy)
   control mechanisms on crowdfunder behavior. Employing a randomized
   experiment at one of the world's largest online crowdfunding platforms,
   we find evidence of both positive (e.g., comfort) and negative (e.g.,
   privacy priming) causal effects. We find that reducing access to
   information controls induces a net increase in fund-raising, yet this
   outcome results from two competing influences-treatment increases
   willingness to engage with the platform (a 4.9% increase in the
   probability of contribution) and simultaneously decreases the average
   contribution (a $5.81 decline). This decline derives from a publicity
   effect, wherein contributors respond to a lack of privacy by tempering
   extreme contributions. We unravel the causal mechanisms that drive the
   results and discuss the implications of our findings for the design of
   online platforms.

AB We consider a supply chain with one buyer and two suppliers who are
   subject to disruptions and whose likelihoods of disruption are their
   private information. In such a setting, does the buyer benefit from
   engaging the services of a better-informed procurement service provider
   (PSP) compared to procuring directly from the suppliers? Intuition might
   suggest that hiring a PSP is always the right choice because the PSP's
   knowledge of the supply base improves supplier selection and management.
   On the other hand, earlier studies prove that using a PSP purely for its
   superior knowledge about supply costs is always worse for a buyer than
   contracting with the suppliers directly. Our answer to this research
   question is more nuanced. Contrary to the findings of earlier studies,
   we find that the buyer may benefit from using a PSP. We identify,
   quantify, and explain all of the benefits and the costs of using a PSP,
   and describe conditions under which the benefits exceed the costs. The
   benefits of using a PSP are derived when one supplier is of high
   reliability and the other is of low reliability, from a reduction of
   informational costs due to implicit supplier collusion facilitated by
   the PSP and an improvement of supply availability. The costs of using a
   PSP are derived when both suppliers are of low reliability, from the
   loss of direct control over the supplier's production actions, which
   leads to reduced supply availability and increased informational costs,
   and from the PSP facilitating implicit supplier collusion. Comparative
   statics analysis indicates that using the PSP is valuable only if the
   buyer diversifies with some supplier-type combinations but not others,
   and that hiring a PSP is not a solution to the problem of an unreliable
   supply base.

AB We develop and test a rigorous theoretical account of firm global
   sourcing decisions, distinguishing the antecedents of offshore
   integration from those of offshore outsourcing. Although traditional
   theories of global sourcing focus on lowering costs, we argue that as
   high-performing firms seek to develop new capabilities by tapping into
   foreign knowledge, they will increasingly turn to offshore integration
   to reap colocation benefits and overcome expropriation challenges. By
   contrast, offshore outsourcing will be preferred by less profitable
   firms seeking to tap into low-cost inputs, especially as investments in
   information technology lower monitoring costs. Empirical analysis of a
   comprehensive panel of cross-border product transfers by U.S.
   manufacturing multinational corporations from 1989 to 2004 reveals
   support for these arguments. Our study thus highlights the effect of
   foreign knowledge seeking on global sourcing and helps explain recent

AB In a stochastic interdiction game a proliferator aims to minimize the

   interdictor endeavors to maximize the project duration by delaying some
   of the project tasks. We formulate static and dynamic versions of the
   interdictor's decision problem where the interdiction plan is either
   precommitted or adapts to new information revealed over time,
   respectively. The static model gives rise to a stochastic program,
   whereas the dynamic model is formalized as a multiple optimal stopping
   problem in continuous time and with decision-dependent information.
   Under a memoryless probabilistic model for the task durations, we prove
   that the static model reduces to a mixed-integer linear program, whereas
   the dynamic model reduces to a finite Markov decision process in
   discrete time that can be solved via efficient value iteration. We then
   generalize the dynamic model to account for uncertainty in the outcomes
   of the interdiction actions. We also discuss a crashing game where the
   proliferator can use limited resources to expedite tasks so as to
   counterbalance the interdictor's efforts. The resulting problem can be

AB In reverse auctions, buyers often retain the right to bargain further
   concessions from the winners. The optimal form of such procurement is an
   English auction followed by an auctioneer's option to engage in
   ultimatum bargaining with the winners. We study behavior and performance
   in this procurement format using a laboratory experiment. Sellers
   closely follow the equilibrium strategy of exiting the auction at their
   costs and then accepting strictly profitable offers. Buyers generally
   exercise their option to bargain according to their equilibrium
   strategy, but their take-it-or-leave-it offers vary positively with
   auction prices when they should be invariant. We explain this deviation
   by modeling buyers' subjective posteriors regarding the winners' costs
   as distortions of the Bayesian posteriors, calculated using a
   formulation similar to a commonly used probability weighting function.
   We further test the robustness of the experimental results and the

AB We study the nonstandard optimal exercise policy associated with
   relevant capital investment options and with the prepayment option of
   widespread collateralized-borrowing contracts like the gold loan. Option
   exercise is optimally postponed not only when moneyness is insufficient,
   but also when it is excessive. We extend the classical optimal exercise
   properties for American options. Early exercise of an American call with
   a negative underlying payout rate can occur if the option is moderately
   in the money. We fully characterize the existence, the monotonicity, the
   continuity, the limits, and the asymptotic behavior at maturity of the
   double free boundary that separates the exercise region from the double
   continuation region. We find that the finite-maturity nonstandard policy
   conspicuously differs from the infinite-maturity one.

AB Using hand-collected data, we document the details of the ex ante
   severance contracts and the ex post separation pay given to S&P 500
   chief executive officers (CEOs) upon departing from their companies. We
   analyze what determines whether or not a CEO receives separation pay in
   excess of the amount specified in the severance contract. We find that
   discretionary separation pay is given to about 40% of departing CEOs and
   is, on average, $8 million, which amounts to close to 242% of a CEO's
   annual compensation. We investigate the determinants of discretionary
   separation pay and find, for example, that discretionary separation pay
   positively correlates with weak internal governance in cases of
   voluntary CEO turnover but not when the CEO is forced out. We also find
   that discretionary pay is higher when the CEO has a noncompete clause in
   her ex ante severance contract. Event study analysis suggests that
   shareholders benefit from discretionary separation pay in forced
   turnovers but not in voluntary ones. Our overall results help to shed
   light on the complex role of discretionary separation pay in the
   bargaining game between boards and departing executives.

   examine strategy changes made by professional basketball coaches. We
   find that they are more likely to revise their strategy after a loss
   than a win-even for narrow losses, which are uninformative about team
   effectiveness. This increased strategy revision following a loss occurs
   even when a loss was expected and even when failure is due to factors

AB Prominent decision-making theories propose that individuals (should)
   evaluate alternatives by combining gains and losses in an additive way.
   Instead, we suggest that individuals seek to maximize the rate of
   exchange between positive and negative outcomes and thus combine gains
   and losses in a multiplicative way. Sensitivity to gain-loss ratio
   provides an alternative account for several existing findings and
   implies a number of novel predictions. It implies greater sensitivity to
   losses and risk aversion when expected value is positive, but greater
   sensitivity to gains and risk seeking when expected value is negative.
   It also implies more extreme preferences when expected value is positive
   than when expected value is negative. These predictions are independent
   of decreasing marginal sensitivity, loss aversion, and probability
   weighting-three key properties of prospect theory. Five new experiments
   and reanalyses of two recently published studies support these
   predictions.

AB Current branding literature investigates the spillover effects and
   extension effects due to the introduction of product extensions.
   However, no study so far has evaluated the aggregate market impact of
   these effects across different brand development strategies or accounted
   for the strategic decision to introduce the extension. It is important
   to examine the above given the significant investments and the high
   failure rates associated with the introduction of new product
   extensions. In this study, we develop an analytical framework that
   derives revenue outcome due to an extension introduction as a function
   of spillover and extension effects. We empirically estimate the above
   effects through a Bayesian endogenous switching model that jointly
   models market shares of the extension and its parent brand along with
   the strategic decision to introduce the extension and the endogeneity in
   prices. By using a data set that covers 155 extensions introduced across
   20 U.S. geographic markets, we obtain several new generalizable
   empirical insights. Our results show that spillover effects are higher
   for brand extensions, whereas line extensions benefit through larger
   extension effects. We find that vertically differentiating a line
   extension in terms of increased quality mitigates its negative spillover
   effects. The addition of a new brand name (i.e., sub-branding) lowers
   spillover effects for line extensions, whereas it increases the market
   performance for brand extensions. Our findings provide several strategic
   implications for manufacturers to successfully introduce and manage
   product extensions.

AB Advances in digital technologies have led to an increasing concern about
   piracy for providers of digital content (e.g., e-books, games, music,
   software, videos). Yet controversies exist over the influence of
   copyright protection on firm profitability. The objective of this paper
   is to provide an alternative rationale for the growing anti-protection
   trend and to investigate optimal copyright enforcement and quality
   provision in a monopoly setting. The proposed economic mechanism centers
   on the influence of copyright protection on consumer search when
   consumers can get to know the firm's actions (e.g., price, quality) only
   after costly search. We show that more stringent copyright protection
   can induce the consumers to rationally expect lower ex post surplus,
   thus exerting a negative strategic effect on the consumers' willingness
   to search. This strategic effect may outweigh the positive main effect
   on the relative attractiveness of the authorized versus the pirated
   product, which can hence explain the optimality of incomplete and even
   zero copyright protection policies in markets where consumer prepurchase
   search is important (e.g., information goods, digital products). It is
   also because of this strategic effect that the firm may provide lower
   quality as copyright enforcement increases. Interestingly, quality
   unobservability can moderate this strategic effect and thus lead to an
   increasing incentive for copyright protection.

AB Pay what you want (PWYW) can be an attractive marketing strategy to
   price discriminate between fair-minded and selfish customers, to fully
   penetrate a market without giving away the product for free, and to
   undercut competitors that use posted prices. We report on laboratory
   experiments that identify causal factors determining the willingness of
   buyers to pay voluntarily under PWYW. Furthermore, to see how
   competition affects the viability of PWYW, we implement markets in which
   a PWYW seller competes with a traditional seller. Finally, we endogenize
   the market structure and let sellers choose their pricing strategy. The
   experimental results show that outcome-based social preferences and
   strategic considerations to keep the seller in the market can explain
   why and how much buyers pay voluntarily to a PWYW seller. We find that
   PWYW can be viable on a monopolistic market, but it is less successful
   as a competitive strategy because it does not drive traditional
   posted-price sellers out of the market. Instead, the existence of a
   posted-price competitor reduces buyers' payments and prevents the PWYW
   seller from fully penetrating the market. When given the choice, most
   sellers opt for setting a posted price rather than a PWYW pricing
   strategy. We discuss the implications of these results for the use of
   PWYW as a marketing strategy.

AB We develop a model based on asymmetric information (adverse selection)
   that provides a rational explanation for the persistent use of royalties
   alongside equity in university technology transfer. The model shows how
   royalties, through their value-destroying distortions, can act as a
   screening tool that allows a less-informed principal, such as the
   university's Technology Transfer Office (TTO), to elicit private
   information from the more informed spin-off. We also show that
   equity-royalty contracts outperform fixed-fee-royalty contracts because
   they cause fewer value-destroying distortions. Furthermore, we show that
   our main result is robust to problems of moral hazard. Beside the
   coexistence result, the model also offers explanations for the empirical
   findings that equity generates higher returns than royalty and that TTOs
   willing to take equity in lieu of fixed fees are more successful in
   creating spin-offs.

AB In this paper, I elicit risk attitudes of U.S. executives by calibrating
   a subjective option valuation model for option exercising data (1996 to
   2008), yielding approximately 65,000 values of relative risk aversion
   (RRA) for almost 7,000 executives. The observed behavior is generally
   consistent with moderate risk aversion and a median (mean) RRA close to
   one (three). Values are validated for chief executive officers (CEOs) by
   testing theory-based predictions on the influence of individual
   characteristics on risk preferences such as gender, marital status,
   religiosity, and intelligence. Senior managers such as CEOs, presidents,
   and chairpersons of the boards of directors are significantly less risk
   averse than non-senior executives. RRA heterogeneity is strongly
   correlated with sector membership and firm-level variables such as size,
   performance, and capital structure. Alternative factors influencing
   option exercises are tested for their influence on RRA values.

   capabilities may affect their technology strategy. However,
   technology-capability misalignment may exist outside the firm boundary
   as well. In this paper, I build on mainstream product innovation
   concepts to predict when market leaders will adopt certain business
   process innovations. I then test these predictions in a large data set
   on early e-business adoption, leveraging its novel insight into focal
   firms, their markets, and their customers. I find market leaders were
   significantly more likely to embrace new information technology-enabled
   practices-except when customer adjustment costs were a significant
   concern. These findings highlight the strategic significance of external

AB In a procurement context, it can be quite costly for a buyer when the
   winning seller underestimates the cost of a project and then defaults on
   the project midway through completion. The average bid auction is one
   mechanism intended to help address this problem. This format involves
   awarding the contract to the bidder who has bid closest to the average
   of the bids submitted. We compare the performance of this mechanism with
   the standard low price mechanism to determine how successful the average
   bid format is in preventing bidder losses as well as its impact on the
   price paid by the buyer. We find the average bid mechanism to be more
   successful than expected because, surprisingly, bidding behavior remains
   similar between the average bid and low price auctions. We provide an
   explanation for the bidding behavior in the average bid auction that is
   based on subjects having problems processing signals near the extremes
   of the distribution.

AB Consider a retailer using sponsored search marketing together with
   dynamic pricing. The retailer's bid on a search keyword affects the
   retailer's rank among the search results. The higher the rank, the
   higher the customer traffic and the customers' willingness to pay will
   be. Thus, the question arises: When a retailer bids higher to attract
   more customers, should the accompanying price also decrease (to
   strengthen the bid's effect on demand) or increase (to take advantage of
   higher willingness to pay)? We find that the answer depends on how fast
   the retailer increases its bid. In particular, as the end of the season
   approaches, the optimal bid exhibits smooth increases followed by big
   jumps. The optimal price increases only when the optimal bid increases
   sharply, including the instances where the bid jumps up. Such big jumps
   arise, for example, when the customer traffic is an S-shaped function of
   the retailer's bid.

   the dividend-price ratio for such changes resolves several issues with
   respect to the predictability of stock market returns: the adjusted
   dividend-price ratio is less persistent, in-sample evidence for
   predictability is more pronounced, there is greater parameter stability
   in the predictive regression (particularly during the 1990s), and there
   is evidence of out-of-sample predictability.

AB We conduct a series of experiments that simulate trading in financial
   markets. We find that the information content of the order flow varies
   with the strength of subjects' prior beliefs about fundamentals. The
   presence of intrinsic uncertainty about the asset's fundamentals reduces
   informational efficiency. This originates from subjects' risk attitudes
   and biases in the way some subjects update their beliefs. The behavior
   of approximately 63% of the subjects is consistent with the expected
   utility maximization. These subjects are either risk averse (52%) or
   risk loving (11%). About 22% of the subjects display non-Bayesian
   updating of beliefs: underconfidence emerges for weak prior beliefs, and
   confirmation bias occurs for strong prior beliefs. Non-Bayesian belief
   updating reduces market efficiency when subjects' prior beliefs are weak
   and increases it when the prior beliefs are strong.

AB Electronic commerce allows bidders to find and participate in auctions
   regardless of location. This reduction in bidders' search costs has
   important effects on bidders' participation patterns and sellers'
   revenue. The "demand expansion" effect occurs when reduced search costs
   allow bidders to participate in more auctions. The "demand distribution"
   effect occurs when reduced search costs allow bidders to distribute
   themselves more evenly across auctions. We focus on the latter effect by
   modeling when a more even distribution of bidder participation across
   auctions increases seller revenue. We apply our analytical insights to
   65,718 sequential auctions (comprising over 10 million vehicles) in the
   wholesale used vehicle market. We show that reduced search costs can
   increase seller revenue by smoothing the distribution of bidder
   participation across auctions, even if the aggregate amount of bidder
   participation remains constant. This contributes new results to the
   auction theory literature and generates novel insights for sellers
   seeking increased revenue.

AB This study examines 171 brand licensing announcements and subsequent
   changes in the licensor firms' shareholder values using the event study
   method. We find that although brand licensing announcements lead to
   positive abnormal returns on average, nearly 44% of the announcements in
   our sample are followed by negative abnormal returns. We argue that
   investors react more favorably to a brand licensing announcement when
   they believe (i) the brand has greater ability to stimulate licensee
   product sales (and thus generate higher royalties for the licensor) and
   (ii) the licensor firm has greater ability to limit licensee opportunism
   (and thus limit brand dilution and its adverse effect on sales of other
   products marketed under the brand name). In line with our hypotheses
   related to a brand's ability to stimulate licensee product sales, the
   study's findings suggest that investors react more favorably to
   announcements involving brands with greater brand fit and greater brand
   breadth. However, investors appear to react less favorably to
   announcements involving brands with higher advertising investments. In
   line with our hypotheses related to a licensor firm's ability to limit
   licensee opportunism, the study's findings suggest that investors react
   more favorably to announcements involving larger licensors; however,
   investors' reactions do not appear to be influenced by licensor firms'
   licensing experience.

AB This paper provides empirical evidence on the performance effects and
   choice of appointments of supply chain and operations management
   executives (SCOMEs). The analysis is based on a sample of 681 SCOME
   appointments that were publicly announced during the 2000-2011 period.
   We find that the stock market reaction is positive on the day of the
   announcement. Categorizing the SCOME appointments as new or old and
   insider or outsider, we find that the market reaction for newly created
   SCOME positions is positive. The market also reacts more positively when
   a SCOME is an outsider rather than an insider. The strongest positive
   reaction is observed when outsiders are hired for newly created SCOME
   positions. We find evidence of both poor stock price performance and
   poor operating performance in the period preceding the appointment of
   new SCOMEs. New SCOME appointments are not followed by an immediate
   improvement in stock price and operating performance. However, there is
   no further decline in performance, suggesting that the decline observed
   in the preappointment period does not continue after the new SCOME is
   appointed. We also find that the likelihood of a SCOME being an outsider
   is greater for firms that are smaller, operate in more concentrated
   industries, and have experienced poor prior performance.

AB We investigate the effects of a movie star on the movie's opening week
   theater allocations and box office revenue. Because the pairing of a
   star and a movie involves a bilateral matching process between the
   studio and the star, the star (hence the nonstar) movie samples are
   nonrandom and the star variable is potentially endogenous. To assess the
   star as well as movie characteristics effects, we utilize a switching
   model to account for endogenous assignment of stars and nonstars into
   respective movie samples. In addition to controlling for selection
   biases, the endogenous switching model generates managerially relevant
   insights into the factors that influence a star's assignment to a movie.
   Additionally, because the star and nonstar movie characteristics (e.g.,
   movie budget, distribution, genre, etc.) are often systematically
   different, we counterfactually estimate the theater allocations and
   revenues that nonstars (stars) would have generated had they acted in
   movies endowed with the same characteristics as the star (nonstar)
   movies. The decomposition analysis, conducted at different quantiles of
   theater and revenue distributions, shows that the presence of a star has
   a much stronger effect on theater allocations than the movie
   characteristics have. However, the revenue difference is entirely
   contributed by the differences in the characteristics of the star and
   nonstar movies. Thus, the star effects on revenue come indirectly
   through the theater allocations as well as from the characteristics of
   the movies in which they participate.

   among participants in scientific projects. We then use the annual

AB We study a model of a firm managing its inventory of a single product by
   sourcing supplies from two supply sources, a regular supplier who offers
   a lower unit cost and a longer lead time than a second, emergency,
   supplier. A practically implementable policy for such a firm is a
   tailored base-surge (TBS) policy [Allon G, Van Mieghem JA (2010) Global
   dual sourcing: Tailored base-surge allocation to near-and offshore
   production. Management Sci. 56(1):110-124] to manage its inventory.
   Under this policy, the firm procures a constant quantity from the
   regular supplier in every period and dynamically makes procurement
   decisions for the emergency supplier. Allon and Van Mieghem describe
   this practice as using the regular supplier to meet a base level of
   demand and the emergency supplier to manage demand surges, and they
   conjecture that this practice is most effective when the lead time
   difference between the two suppliers is large. We confirm these
   statements in two ways. First, we show the following analytical result:
   when demand is composed of a base demand random component plus a surge
   demand random component, which occurs with a certain small probability,
   the best TBS policy is close to optimal (over all policies) in a
   well-defined sense. Second, we also numerically investigate the cost
   effectiveness of the best TBS policy on a test bed of problem instances.
   The emphasis of this investigation is the study of the effect of the
   lead time difference between the two suppliers. Our study reveals that
   the cost difference between the best TBS policy and the optimal policy
   decreases dramatically as the lead time of the regular supplier
   increases. On our test bed, this cost difference decreases from an
   average (over the test bed) of 21% when the lead time from the regular
   supplier is two periods (the emergency supplier offers instant delivery)
   to 3.5% when that lead time is seven periods.

AB The dynamic assignment of patients to exam days in order to manage daily
   variations in demand and capacity is a long-standing open research area
   in appointment scheduling. In particular, the dynamic assignment of
   advance appointments has been considered to be especially challenging
   because of its high dimensionality. We consider a canonical model of
   dynamic advance scheduling with two patient classes: an urgent demand
   class, which must be served on the day of arrival, and a regular demand
   class, which can be served at a future date. Patients take the earliest
   appointments offered and do not differentiate among providers. We derive
   a surprising characterization of an optimal policy and an algorithm to
   compute the policy exactly and efficiently. These are, to our knowledge,
   the first analytical results for the dynamic advance assignment of
   patients to exam days. We introduce the property of successive
   refinability, which allows advance schedules to be easily computable and
   under which there is no cost to the system to making advance commitments
   to patients. We allow multiple types of capacity to be considered and
   both demand and capacity to be nonstationary and stochastic.

AB We analyze a model of industry evolution where the number of active
   submarkets is endogenously determined by pioneering innovation from
   incumbents and entrants. Incumbent pioneers enjoy an advantage of
   additional pioneering innovation via a dynamic capability that takes the
   form of an improved technology for innovation in young submarkets.
   Entrants are motivated in part by a desire to acquire the dynamic
   capability. We show that dynamic capabilities increase total innovation,
   but whether the capability confers an advantage in terms of marginal or
   average cost is important in determining how the impact of dynamic
   capabilities is distributed across incumbent and entrant innovation
   rates. We complement the existing literature-that focuses on exogenous
   arrival of submarkets or the steady state of a model with constant
   submarkets-by describing how competition, free entry, and the dynamic
   capability of incumbents drive the evolution of an industry. The shift
   from immature to mature submarkets can lead to a shakeout in firm
   numbers, and it eventually leads to a reduction in total dynamic
   capabilities in an industry.

AB We introduce an auction design framework for large markets with hundreds
   of items and complex bidder preferences. Such markets typically lead to
   computationally hard allocation problems. Our new framework consists of
   compact bid languages for sealed-bid auctions and methods to compute
   second-price rules such as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves or bidder-optimal,
   core-selecting payment rules when the optimality of the allocation
   problem cannot be guaranteed. To demonstrate the efficacy of the
   approach for a specific, complex market, we introduce a compact bidding
   language for TV advertising markets and investigate the resulting
   winner-determination problem and the computation of core payments. For
   realistic instances of the respective winner-determination problems,
   very good solutions with a small integrality gap can be found quickly,
   although closing the integrality gap to find marginally better solutions
   or prove optimality can take a prohibitively large amount of time. Our
   subsequent adaptation of a constraint-generation technique for the
   computation of bidder-optimal core payments to this environment is a
   practically viable paradigm by which core-selecting auction designs can
   be applied to large markets with potentially hundreds of items. Such
   auction designs allow bidders to express their preferences with a low
   number of parameters, while at the same time providing incentives for
   truthful bidding. We complement our computational experiments in the
   context of TV advertising markets with additional results for volume
   discount auctions in procurement to illustrate the applicability of the
   approach in different types of large markets.

AB The feasibility of using field experiments to optimize marketing
   decisions remains relatively unstudied. We investigate category pricing
   decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand
   elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are
   required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main
   result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure,
   we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are
   required: the number of experiments required may grow just
   logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially
   have important implications for the application of field experiments.
   Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically
   feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number
   of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms
   can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it
   feasible to use field experiments to set prices. We illustrate how to
   accomplish this using either a sample of historical data or a pilot set
   of experiments. We also discuss how to evaluate whether field
   experiments can help optimize other marketing decisions, such as
   selecting which products to advertise or promote.

AB The presence of workers who reciprocate higher wages with greater effort
   can have important consequences for firms and labor markets. Knowledge
   about the extent and determinants of reciprocal effort choices is,
   however, incomplete. We investigate the role of fairness perceptions and
   social preferences in a field experiment in which workers were hired for
   a one-time job. We show that workers who perceive being underpaid at the
   base wage increase their performance if the hourly wage increases,
   whereas those who feel adequately paid or overpaid at the base wage do
   not change their performance. Moreover, we find that only the workers
   who display reciprocity in a choice experiment show reciprocal effort
   responses in the field. The workers who lack reciprocity in the choice
   experiment do not respond to the wage increase, even if they feel
   underpaid at the base wage. Our findings suggest that fairness
   perceptions and social preferences are key in workers' performance
   response to wage increases. In our study, the wage increase affects
   effort mainly through the removal of perceived unfairness, i.e., the
   elimination of negative reciprocity toward the firm, rather than
   positive reciprocity. These results are the first direct evidence of the
   fair-wage effort hypothesis in the field and also help interpret
   previous contradictory findings in the literature.

AB Contributing to a social cause can be an important driver for workers in
   the public and nonprofit sectors as well as in firms that engage in
   corporate philanthropy or other corporate social responsibility
   policies. This paper compares the effectiveness of a social incentive
   that takes the form of a donation received by a charity of the subject's
   choice to a financial incentive. We find that social incentives lead to
   a 13% rise in productivity, regardless of their form (lump sum or
   related to performance) or strength. The response is strong for subjects
   with low initial productivity (30%), whereas high-productivity subjects
   do not respond. When subjects can choose the mix of incentives, half
   sacrifice some of their private compensation to increase social
   compensation, with women more likely to do so than men. Furthermore,
   offering subjects some discretion in choosing their own payment schemes
   leads to a substantial improvement in performance. Comparing social
   incentives to equally costly increases in private compensation for
   low-productivity subjects reveals that the former are less effective in
   increasing productivity, but the difference is small and not
   statistically significant.

AB This paper formulates a model in which a firm simultaneously chooses its
   organizational structure and product position. The firm's production is
   knowledge intensive, requiring employees to solve problems. A vertical
   hierarchy, in which workers refer unsolved problems to managers
   facilitates the acquisition and leveraging of managers' superior
   knowledge. I show that a larger span of control is complementary to the
   provision of high-value products. Moreover, this complementarity is
   sustained when employees acquire sufficient knowledge and is further
   strengthened when the firm enhances its capability of communicating
   knowledge. The model yields testable implications concerning (1) the fit
   between a firm's product position and span of control, (2) the effect of
   information technology on product innovations and skill-biased
   organizational changes, and (3) the heterogeneity in hierarchical
   structure and human resource management in professional service firms.

AB Demonstrating compelling causal evidence of the existence and strength
   of peer-to-peer influence has become the holy grail of modern research
   in online social networks. In these networks, it has been consistently
   demonstrated that user characteristics and behavior tend to cluster both
   in space and in time. There are multiple well-known rival mechanisms
   that compete to be the explanation for this observed clustering. These
   range from peer influence to homophily to other unobservable external
   stimuli. These multiple mechanisms lead to similar observational data,
   yet have vastly different policy implications. In this paper, we present
   a novel randomized experiment that tests the existence of causal peer
   influence in the general population-one that did not involve subject
   recruitment for experimentation-of a particular large-scale online
   social network. We utilize a unique social feature to exogenously induce
   adoption of a paid service among a group of randomly selected users, and
   in the process develop a clean exogenous randomization of treatment and
   control groups. A variety of nonparametric, semiparametric, and
   parametric approaches, ranging from resampling-based inference to
   ego-level random effects to logistic regression to survival models,
   yield close to identical, statistically and economically significant
   estimates of peer influence in the general population of a freemium
   social network. Our estimates show that peer influence causes more than
   a 60% increase in odds of buying the service due to the influence coming
   from an adopting friend. In addition, we find that users with a smaller
   number of friends experience stronger relative increase in the adoption
   likelihood due to influence from their peers as compared to the users
   with a larger number of friends. Our nonparametric resampling
   procedure-based estimates are helpful in situations of networked data
   that violate independence assumptions. We establish that peer influence
   is a powerful force in getting users from free to premium levels, a
   known challenge in freemium communities.

AB B Companies are increasingly drawing on their user communities to
   generate promising ideas for new products, which are then marketed as
   "user-designed" products to the broader consumer market. We demonstrate
   that nonparticipating, observing consumers prefer to buy from
   user-rather than designer-driven firms because of an enhanced
   identification with the firm that has adopted this user-driven
   philosophy. Three experimental studies validate a newly proposed social
   identification account underlying this effect. Because consumers are
   also users, their social identities connect to the user-designers, and
   they feel empowerment by vicariously being involved in the design
   process. This formed connection leads to preference for the firm's
   products. Importantly, this social identification account also
   effectively predicts when the effect does not materialize. First, we
   find that if consumers feel dissimilar to participating users, the
   effects are attenuated. We demonstrate that this happens when the
   community differs from consumers along important demographics (i.e.,
   gender) or when consumers are nonexperts in the focal domain (i.e., they
   feel that they do not belong to the social group of participating
   users). Second, the effects are attenuated if the user-driven firm is
   only selectively rather than fully open to participation from all users
   (observing consumers do not feel socially included). These findings
   advance the emerging theory on user involvement and offer practical
   implications for firms interested in pursuing a user-driven philosophy.

AB This paper examines the role of firms' sociopolitical reputations, as
   proxied by their perceived engagement in socially responsible practices,
   in public policy makers' decisions to grant access in the policy-making
   process. I argue that policy makers' dependencies, motivations, and
   decision-making processes lead them to evaluate firms by using
   sociopolitical reputation as a differentiating heuristic. I hypothesize
   that firms that construct stronger sociopolitical reputations will be
   granted greater access and that firms' existing political activity and
   policy makers' partisanship will moderate this relationship. I test
   these hypotheses using an 11-year panel on congressional testimony,
   reputation, and political and financial characteristics for the S&P 500
   and find support for all three. These findings support the existence of
   a sociopolitical dimension to firms' reputations that affects how public
   policy makers evaluate firms, demonstrating that corporate social
   responsibility pays political benefits.

AB In many markets, it is common for headquarters to create a price list
   but grant local salespeople discretion to negotiate prices for
   individual transactions. How much (if any) pricing discretion
   headquarters should grant is a topic of debate within many firms. We
   investigate this issue using a unique data set from an indirect lender
   with local pricing discretion. We estimate that the local sales force
   adjusted prices in a way that improved profits by approximately 11% on
   average. A counterfactual analysis shows that using a centralized,
   data-driven pricing optimization system could improve profits even
   further, up to 20% over those actually realized. This suggests that
   centralized pricing-if appropriately optimized-can be more effective
   than field price discretion. We discuss the implications of these
   findings for auto lending and other industries with similar pricing
   processes.

AB Prior studies on performance-based contracting (PBC) for after-sales
   services have highlighted its advantages over traditional resource-based
   contracting (RBC), when products are established and their reliability
   is known to all parties. We develop a game theoretic model to
   investigate how these insights are affected when the vendor is privately
   informed about the reliability of a newly developed product. A novel
   feature of our model is the interaction between reliability signaling
   (private information) and the vendor's discretionary investment in
   spares inventory (private action), which arises naturally in the setting
   we consider. We find that this interaction leads to contrasting
   equilibrium outcomes under the two contracts: RBC induces the vendor to
   focus on inventory savings, leading to underinvestment in spares,
   whereas PBC induces the vendor to focus on reliability signaling,
   achieved through overinvestment in inventory. As a result, neither
   contract is efficient. We investigate two means to mitigate this
   inefficiency, but either approach has caveats: (a) making inventory
   verifiable removes the trade-off between reliability signaling and
   inventory investment, but results in diverging contract preferences
   between the vendor and the buyer; (b) pooling inventories across
   multiple buyers saves inventory costs but it also hinders reliability
   signaling, potentially exacerbating inefficiency.

AB This paper examines the interaction between venture risk, product market
   competition, and the entrepreneur's choice between bank financing and
   venture capital (VC) financing. Under bank financing, a debt-type
   contract emerges as optimal, which allows the entrepreneur to retain
   full control of the venture and thus yields strong effort incentives, as
   long as the entrepreneur can service the debt repayment; however, this
   leads to liquidation in the case of default, making the venture's
   success quite sensitive to exogenous, even temporary, shocks that may
   hinder debt repayment. Under VC financing, an equity-type contract
   emerges as optimal. Although it is not sensitive to exogenous shocks,
   this contract requires the entrepreneur to share a fraction of the rents
   with the financier, thus yielding lower effort incentives for the
   entrepreneur. There exists a threshold level of venture risk such that
   bank financing is optimal if and only if venture risk is below that
   threshold. Product market competition increases the value of stronger
   entrepreneurial incentives and thus increases the maximum level of risk
   the entrepreneur is willing to take before switching from bank financing
   to VC financing. This is a robust result that is shown to hold in
   various models of competition, including the Hotelling, Salop,
   Dixit-Stiglitz, and Cournot-to-Bertrand switch.

AB We explore theoretically and experimentally the general equilibrium

   the investor-manager relationship is nonexclusive. Our theory predicts
   that competition forces managers to promise portfolios that mimic
   Arrow-Debreu (AD) securities, which investors then combine to fit their
   preferences. A weak version of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
   obtains, where state prices (relative to state probabilities) implicit
   in prices of traded securities will be inversely ranked to aggregate
   wealth across states. Our experiment broadly corroborates the price and
   choice predictions of the theory. However, price quality deteriorates
   when only a few managers attract most of the available wealth. Wealth
   concentration increases because funds flow toward managers who offer
   portfolios closer to replicating AD securities (as in the theory), but
   also because funds flow to managers who had better performance in the
   immediate past (an observation unrelated to the theory).

AB Probabilistic selling-the sale of synthetic products consisting of a
   lottery between two distinct goods-has been extensively analyzed in
   horizontal markets. In this research, we investigate probabilistic
   selling in quality-differentiated markets. This is an important new
   dimension of inquiry because of the widespread prevalence of
   quality-differentiated markets as well as significant differences in the
   preference structure across these markets. In fact, this latter
   consideration casts doubt as to whether probabilistic selling will even
   emerge in quality-differentiated markets. We find that probabilistic
   selling emerges in quality-differentiated markets as a way to profitably
   dispose excess capacity; moreover, probabilistic selling remains viable
   even under endogenous quality choice. In addition, in markets where
   sellers employ "strong" quality differentiation, the introduction of an
   intermediate probabilistic good actually causes closer quality levels in
   a product line and enhances consumer welfare. In contrast, in markets
   where sellers employ "weak" quality differentiation, the introduction of
   an intermediate probabilistic good increases quality separation and
   degrades consumer welfare. Overall, we view our contribution as one of
   characterizing the optimality, implementation, and policy implications
   of probabilistic selling in quality-differentiated markets.

AB One explanation advanced for the persistent gender pay differences in
   labor markets is that women avoid salary negotiations. By using a
   natural field experiment that randomizes nearly 2,500 job seekers into
   jobs that vary important details of the labor contract, we are able to
   observe both the extent of salary negotiations and the nature of
   sorting. We find that when there is no explicit statement that wages are
   negotiable, men are more likely to negotiate for a higher wage, whereas
   women are more likely to signal their willingness to work for a lower
   wage. However, when we explicitly mention the possibility that wages are
   negotiable, these differences disappear completely. In terms of sorting,
   we find that men, in contrast to women, prefer job environments where
   the "rules of wage determination" are ambiguous. This leads to the
   gender gap being much more pronounced in jobs that leave negotiation of
   wage ambiguous.

AB Research and development (R&D) projects face significant organizational
   challenges, especially when the different units who run these projects
   compete among each other for resources. In such cases, information
   sharing among the different units is critical, but it cannot be taken
   for granted. Instead, individual units need to be incentivized to not
   only exert effort in evaluating their projects, but also to truthfully
   reveal their findings. The former requires an emphasis on individual
   performance, whereas the latter relies on the existence of a common goal
   across the organization. Motivated by this commonly observed tension, we
   address the following question: How should a firm balance individual and
   shared incentives, so that vital information is both acquired, and
   equally importantly, disseminated to the entire organization? Our model
   captures two key characteristics of R&D experimentation: information is
   imperfect and it is also costly. Our analysis yields several important
   implications for the design of such incentive schemes and the management
   of R&D portfolios.

AB This paper studies two types of threshold-induced effects: a surge of
   new sign-ups around the time when the thresholds of group-buying deals
   are reached, and a stronger positive relation between the number of new
   sign-ups and the cumulative number of sign-ups before the thresholds are
   reached than afterward. This empirical study uses a data set that
   records the intertemporal cumulative number of sign-ups for group-buying
   deals in 86 city markets covered by Groupon, during a period of 71 days
   when Groupon predominantly used "a deal a day" format for each local
   market and posted the number of sign-ups in real time. We find that the
   first type of threshold effect is significant in all product categories
   and in all markets. The second type of threshold effect varies across
   product categories and markets. Our results underscore the importance of
   considering product and market characteristics in threshold design
   decisions for online group buying.

   Total worker compensation increases at different rates depending on the

AB We run a series of controlled field experiments on eBay where buyers are
   rewarded for providing feedback. Our results provide little support for
   the hypothesis of buyers' rational economic behavior: the likelihood of
   feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also,
   the speed of feedback, bid levels, and the number of bids are all
   insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent
   with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower transaction quality leads to a
   higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such
   negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured
   by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the
   likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent
   with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the sellers' "good deeds"
   (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more
   favorable feedback. As a result, sellers can "buy" feedback, but such
   feedback is likely to be biased.

AB Branding decisions are critical for the success of new products. Prior
   research on branding and brand extension has primarily focused on how
   branding influences consumers' perceptions of product quality. However,
   consumers of conspicuous goods care not only about product quality but
   also about the profile of its users. For example, high-end consumers
   prefer an exclusive brand. On the other hand, low-end consumers may find
   a brand more attractive if high-end consumers use it. In this paper, we
   analyze how social effects and market structure can influence the
   branding of conspicuous goods. Consistent with intuition, our
   theoretical analysis shows that a monopolist would prefer not to use
   umbrella branding when consumers' desire for uniqueness is high. By
   contrast, in a competitive market, umbrella branding is more profitable
   than individual branding when consumers have a high level of desire for
   uniqueness. We also identify conditions in which it is optimal for
   marketers of conspicuous goods to adopt either an individual branding
   strategy or asymmetric branding strategies. Furthermore, competing firms
   may offer umbrella branding even when both firms may be better off if
   they could commit to using individual branding. Finally, we extend the
   model to consider a market where consumers' product preference is not
   related to social status. Again, if consumers are sufficiently snobbish,
   competing firms earn more profits by adopting an umbrella branding
   strategy instead of an individual branding strategy.

AB After decades of offshoring production across the world, companies are
   rethinking their global networks. Local sourcing is receiving more
   attention, but it remains challenging to balance the offshore sourcing
   cost advantage against the increased inventories, because of its longer
   lead time, and against the cost and (volume) flexibility of each
   source's capacity. To guide strategic allocation in this global network
   decision, this paper establishes reasonably simple prescriptions that
   capture the key drivers. We adopt a conventional discrete-time inventory
   model with a linear control rule that smoothes orders and allows an
   exact and analytically tractable analysis of single-and dual-sourcing
   policies under normal demand. Distinguishing features of our model are
   that it captures each source's lead time, capacity cost, and flexibility
   to work overtime. We use Lagrange's inversion theorem to provide exact
   and simple square-root bound formulae for the strategic sourcing
   allocations and the value of dual sourcing. The formulae provide
   structural insight on the impact of financial, operational, and demand
   parameters, and a starting point for quantitative decision making. We
   investigate the robustness of our results by comparing the smoothing
   policy with existing single-and dual-sourcing models in a simulation
   study that relaxes model assumptions.

AB We examine the impact of consumer valuation interdependence and capacity
   on a firm's optimal selling strategies. We consider a seller who can
   offer a single product to consumers twice, in advance and in spot.
   Consumers choose whether and when to buy, but if they buy in advance,
   they are uncertain about their own valuations. Whether they buy in
   advance or in spot, consumers' valuations are realized in the spot
   period and they may range from fully independent to perfectly
   correlated, creating markets with different characteristics of aggregate
   demand for the seller. Facing these consumers, the seller chooses a
   portion of the total capacity to offer in advance and prices in both
   periods. We describe how the optimal strategy and benefits of advance
   selling depend on the interdependence of consumer valuation, as well as
   capacity level and other market parameters. We find that a change in
   valuation interdependence can lead to dramatically different policies
   for the seller. For example, when individual valuations are highly
   diverse and the consumer population is large, the seller must offer a
   discount during advance selling but may limit the advance sales. On the
   other hand, when valuations are highly correlated, the seller can charge
   a premium price during advance selling. For the same valuation
   interdependence, the qualitative nature of the optimal strategy changes
   with available capacity.

AB Adaptive base stock policy is a well-known tool for managing inventories
   in nonstationary demand environments. This paper presents empirical
   tests of this policy using aggregate, firm-level data. First, we extend
   a single-item adaptive base stock policy in previous literature to a
   multi-item case. Second, we transform the policy derived for the
   multi-item case to a regression model that relates firm-level inventory
   purchases to firm-level sales and changes in sales forecasts. We focus
   on two research questions: Can the adaptive base stock policy explain
   cross-sectional ordering behaviors under sales growth? To the extent
   that the adaptive base stock policy fails to explain ordering behaviors
   under sales growth, are there frictions that explain such a finding? Our
   empirical results demonstrate disparities in ordering behaviors between
   firms experiencing high and moderate sales growth. Contrary to
   theoretical prediction, this implies that inventory purchases are a
   function of not only current sales and changes in sales forecast but
   also past sales growth. As potential explanations for this departure
   from theoretical prediction, we show that both future demand dynamics
   and inventory holding risks depend on past sales growth. In addition, we
   find that firms' inventory holding risks may also be affected by
   purchasing constraints imposed by supply chain contracts. Our results
   provide managerial implications for practitioners and inform future
   theoretical research.

AB Entrepreneurial ventures rely not only on founders but also on
   "joiners"-start-up employees who are attracted to entrepreneurship, but
   who do not want to be founders themselves. Drawing on both preference
   and contextual theories of entrepreneurship, we examine how individuals'
   interest in being a founder, a joiner, or neither forms prior to the
   first career transition. We find that although individuals with founder
   and joiner interests share similar preferences for entrepreneurial job
   attributes such as autonomy and risk, their preferences for these
   attributes also differ in significantly meaningful ways. Contextual
   factors such as norms, role models, and opportunities exhibit very
   different relationships with founder and joiner interests. Most
   interestingly, our results suggest that preferences and context
   interrelate in unique ways to shape different entrepreneurial interests.
   In particular, an interest in being a founder is most strongly
   associated with individuals' preferences for entrepreneurial job
   attributes, whereas contextual factors do little to shape a founder
   interest in individuals who lack these preferences. An interest in being
   a joiner, on the other hand, is associated with both preferences and
   context, and this relationship is most pronounced for individuals with
   preferences that predispose them toward entrepreneurship. This study
   highlights joiners as a distinct type of entrepreneurial actor and
   demonstrates the importance of considering the interplay between
   preferences and context in the study of entrepreneurship.

AB We evaluate the out-of-sample performance of a long-term investor who
   follows an optimized dynamic trading strategy. Although the dynamic
   strategy is able to benefit from predictability out-of-sample, a
   short-term investor using a single-period market timing strategy would
   have realized an almost identical performance. The value of
   intertemporal hedge demands in strategic asset allocation appears
   negligible. The result is caused by the estimation error in predicting
   the predictors. A myopic investor only needs to predict one-period-ahead
   expected returns, but hedge demands also require accurate predictions of
   the predictor variables. To reduce the problem of errors in optimized
   portfolio weights, we consider Bayesian procedures. Myopic and dynamic
   portfolios are similarly affected by such modifications, and differences

AB In this paper, we shed new light on the role of monetary policy in asset
   pricing by examining the case in which investors have heterogeneous
   expectations about future monetary policy. This case is realistic
   because central banks are typically less than perfectly open about their
   intentions. Accordingly, surveys of economists reveal that they
   frequently disagree in their expectations. Under heterogeneity in
   beliefs, investors place speculative bets against each other on the
   evolution of the money supply, and as a result the sharing of wealth in
   the economy evolves stochastically. Employing a continuous-time
   equilibrium model, we show that these fluctuations majorly affect the
   prices of all assets, as well as inflation. Our model could help explain
   some empirical puzzles. In particular, we find that the volatility of
   bond yields and stock market volatility could be significantly increased
   by the heterogeneity in beliefs, a conclusion supported by our empirical
   analyses.

   prior ratings by strangers ("crowd") versus friends. We find evidence of
   both herding and differentiation behavior in crowd ratings wherein
   users' ratings are influenced positively or negatively by prior ratings
   depending on movie popularity. In contrast, friends' ratings always
   induce herding. Further, the presence of social networking reduces the
   likelihood of herding on prior ratings by the crowd. Finally, we find
   that an increase in the number of friends who can potentially observe a

   findings raise questions about the reliability of ratings as unbiased

   overeating, smoking, drinking). As an important implication of our
   results, we also demonstrate that those lower (higher) in self-control
   show relatively less (more) interest in products and lifestyle changes
   reducing consequences (e.g., a pill that heals liver damage from

   prevents liver damage from drinking). We also explore several possible
   underlying processes for the observed effect and discuss the theoretical

AB This paper examines how firm investments in technology-based employee
   monitoring impact both misconduct and productivity. We use unique and
   detailed theft and sales data from 392 restaurant locations from five
   firms that adopt a theft monitoring information technology (IT) product.
   We use difference-in-differences models with staggered adoption dates to
   estimate the treatment effect of IT monitoring on theft and
   productivity. We find significant treatment effects in reduced theft and
   improved productivity that appear to be primarily driven by changed
   worker behavior rather than worker turnover. We examine four mechanisms
   that may drive this productivity result: economic and cognitive
   multitasking, fairness-based motivation, and perceived increases of
   general oversight. The observed productivity results represent
   substantial financial benefits to both firms and the legitimate
   tip-based earnings of workers. Our results suggest that employee
   misconduct is not solely a function of individual differences in ethics
   or morality, but can also be influenced by managerial policies that can
   benefit both firms and employees.

AB This paper examines how a firm's financial distress and the legal
   environment regarding the ease of bankruptcy reorganization can alter
   product market competition and supplier-buyer relationships. We identify
   three effects-predation, bail-out, and abetment-that can change firms'
   behavior from their actions in the absence of financial distress. The
   predation effect increases competition before potential bankruptcy as
   the nondistressed competitor behaves as if it has some first-mover
   advantage that could benefit a supplier with price control. The bail-out
   effect reflects the supplier's incentive to grant the distressed firm
   concessions to preserve competition, improving supply chain efficiency
   and providing support for the exclusivity rule in Chapter 11 of the
   United States Bankruptcy Code when the supplier and the distressed firm
   are financially linked. The abetment effect is that the supplier may
   deliberately abet the competitor's predation, leading to increased
   operational disadvantages for the distressed firm before bankruptcy.
   Together these effects stress that a firm's bankruptcy potential can
   hurt its competitors and benefit its suppliers/customers. They also
   provide guidelines for firms' operational decisions in such situations,
   a rationale for observed firm actions surrounding bankruptcies, and
   motivation for policies supporting reorganization and relaxing broad
   enforcement of nondiscriminatory pricing regulations.

AB Gender differences in the willingness to compete have been identified as
   one important factor in explaining gender differences in labor markets
   and within organizations. We present three experiments with a total of
   1,570 subjects, ages three to 18 years, to investigate the origins of
   this gender gap. In a between-subjects design we find that boys are more
   likely to compete than girls as early as kindergarten and that this gap
   prevails throughout adolescence. Re-examining the behavior of 316
   subjects in a within-subjects design two years later, we show that these
   gender differences also largely persist over a longer time period and
   can thus be considered stable. Controlling for subjects' abilities in
   the different tasks, their risk attitudes, and expected performance, the
   gender gap in the willingness to compete is estimated in the range of
   10-20 percentage points. We discuss the implications of our findings for
   policy interventions and organizational management.

AB This paper shows that the gender and age of the wage setter are crucial
   determinants of the disparity in wages between sexes. We document our
   findings using a data set on compensation of corporate officers that is
   uniquely suited for this analysis because officer wages are set by chief
   executive officers (CEOs). We show that CEOs pay officers of the
   opposite gender less than officers of their own gender, even when
   controlling for job characteristics. Older and male CEOs exhibit the
   greatest propensity to differentiate on the basis of sex. Female
   officers receive smaller raises if the firm is headed by a man. Our
   results suggest that CEO gender and age are economically more important
   determinants of officer compensation than are firm stock performance,
   stock volatility, or return on assets.

AB Online consumers are uncertain about subjective product quality (e.g.,
   fit and feel of clothing and texture of materials) because of the
   absence of experiential information. In this paper, we examine the
   dynamic change of the products purchased online over time in the
   presence of this type of uncertainty. Using individual-level transaction
   data, we find that consumers purchase products with a high degree of
   product uncertainty as their online shopping experiences help them
   better estimate product quality. Our results also show that the average
   and highest prices of market baskets decrease (around 1%) when online
   shopping experience increases (10%). This implies that online consumers
   are reluctant to buy expensive products with only digitally transferred
   information, whereas they tend to purchase more of the cheaper products
   online along with their accumulated online shopping experience. We also
   verify the interaction effects of product uncertainty and product price
   on online consumers' purchase decision. When online consumers buy
   products priced under $50, they readily buy products with a high degree
   of product uncertainty regardless of their online shopping experience.
   But consumers are unlikely to buy expensive products online if there is
   a high degree of product uncertainty, even when they have accumulated
   much online shopping experience. In addition, we find that online
   vendors can effectively overcome product-level uncertainty by taking
   advantage of retailer reputation in the physical world and through the
   use of digitized video commercials. Our study on the dynamics in the set
   of products purchased online expands the understanding of consumer
   purchase behavior under uncertainty.

AB Private interest groups lobby politicians to influence public policy.
   However, little is known about how lobbying influences the policy
   decisions made by federal agencies. We study this through examining
   lobbying by advocacy groups associated with rare diseases for funding by
   the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world's largest funder of
   biomedical research. Disease group lobbying for NIH funding has been
   controversial, with critics alleging that it distorts public funding
   toward research on diseases backed by powerful groups. Our data reveal
   that lobbying is associated with higher political support, in the form
   of congressional "soft earmarks" for the diseases. Lobbying increases
   with disease burden and is more likely to be associated with changes in
   NIH funding for diseases with higher scientific opportunity, suggesting
   that it may have a useful informational role. Only special grant
   mechanisms that steer funding toward particular diseases, which comprise
   less than a third of the NIH's grants, are related to earmarks. Thus,
   our results suggest that lobbying by private groups influences federal
   funding for biomedical research. However, the channels of political
   influence are subtle, affect a small portion of funding, and may not
   necessarily have a distortive effect on public science.

AB This paper offers evidence from three different samples consistent with

   significant reductions in small trade participation in the stock market.
   California-based discount brokerage clients and German discount
   brokerage clients are significantly less likely to trade during weeks
   with larger lottery prizes in the California and German lotteries,
   respectively. Variation in lottery prizes affects speculative trading in
   more lottery-like securities such as individual stocks and options, but
   not trading in bonds and mutual funds. Trading that is likely associated
   with long-term savings motives, such as trading in retirement accounts,
   does not respond to lottery jackpots, either. The negative relation
   between trading activity and jackpots is stronger for individuals who
   are more likely to play the lottery.

AB Motivated by extant theories of herding behavior, this paper empirically
   identifies contrarian mutual funds as those trading most frequently
   against the crowd. We find that contrarian funds generate superior
   performance both when they trade against and with the herd, indicating
   that they possess superior private information. Furthermore, contrarians
   do not trade in a particularly correlated fashion with each other,
   consistent with these funds having disparate information. Our fund-level
   contrarian measure is largely unrelated to existing measures of fund
   strategy uniqueness, as both contrarian and herding funds score highly
   on such measures. Building on our finding of superior alphas for
   contrarian funds, we construct a stock-level contrarian score that
   reflects the aggregate stock selection information possessed by
   contrarian managers. This stock-level contrarian score significantly
   predicts stock returns after controlling for measures of stock-level
   herding, as well as a battery of return-predictive investment signals
   documented in prior studies.

   FoFs offer access to a diversified portfolio of funds that would be
   costly for constrained investors to manage on their own. Although we
   find only limited evidence that FoFs exhibit skill when selecting hedge
   funds, we find strong evidence that FoFs make skillful termination
   decisions. After FoFs divest from a hedge fund, those hedge funds
   subsequently underperform and fail more often. Our evidence indicates
   that FoFs learn and skillfully process information about their portfolio
   funds after they become investors, enabling them to forecast poor future

   an instrument to measure individual differences in the propensity to
   exhibit the bias blind spot that is unidimensional, internally
   consistent, has high test-retest reliability, and is discriminated from
   measures of intelligence, decision-making ability, and personality
   traits related to self-esteem, self-enhancement, and self-presentation.
   The scale is predictive of the extent to which people judge their
   abilities to be better than average for easy tasks and worse than
   average for difficult tasks, ignore the advice of others, and are
   responsive to an intervention designed to mitigate a different
   judgmental bias. These results suggest that the bias blind spot is a

   of egocentric cognition, and has unique effects on judgment and

AB In this paper, we analyze the optimal introduction timing of a seller's
   products targeted at segments that differ in their willingness to pay
   for quality. Past studies suggest that an introduction sequence of a
   high-quality product followed by a lower-quality version of the product
   may mitigate the cannibalization effects of the low-quality product on
   profits from the high-quality product. We show that if customers who
   value quality more possess an outside option such as a substitute
   product, as may be the case with replacement buyers, a seller may find
   it optimal to follow a low-quality product with a higher-quality one,
   the latter being targeted at replacement buyers. Furthermore, the
   ability of the seller to commit to future qualities accentuates the
   sequential increase in quality in the presence of such buyers. Thus, we
   show that conditions other than uncertainty or technological
   improvements occurring over time may justify a seller adopting a
   strategy of sequentially increasing quality.

AB Adaptive estimation methods have become a popular tool for capturing and
   forecasting changing conditions in dynamic environments. Although
   adaptive models can provide superior one-step-ahead forecasts, their
   application to multiperiod forecasting is challenging when the
   underlying parameter variation process is not correctly specified. The
   authors propose a methodology based on the Chebyshev approximation
   method (CAM), which provides a parsimonious substitute for the
   measurement updating process in the forecasting period, to help
   forecasters improve multiperiod accuracy in the case of parameter
   variation misspecification. In two empirical applications concerning the
   sales growth of new brands, CAM exhibits superior forecasting
   performance compared to a variety of benchmarks. CAM's properties are
   further explored through extensive simulations, which suggest that the
   proposed method is more likely to increase forecast accuracy when
   parameter variation is more systematic but misspecified because of
   uncertainty regarding its exact functional form.

AB Product-harm crises (recalls) carry negative product information that

   negative impact of product-harm crises may differ across recall events
   depending on media coverage of the event, crisis severity, and
   consumers' prior beliefs about product quality. We develop a state space
   model to capture the dynamics in brand preference, advertising
   effectiveness, and consumer response to product recalls; integrate it
   with a random coefficient demand model; and estimate it using a unique
   data set containing 35 automobile brands, 193 auto sub-brands, and 359
   recalls during 1997-2002. Our results reveal that consumers respond more
   negatively to product recalls with greater media attention, more severe
   consequences, and higher perceived product quality. Furthermore, they
   show that sub-brand advertising effectiveness declines by a greater
   amount than parent-brand advertising and the decline in effectiveness of
   the recalled sub-brand's advertising spills over to other sub-brands
   under the same parent brand.

AB Much research suggests that social networks affect individual and
   organizational success. However, a strong assumption underlying this
   research is that network structure is not reducible to the individual
   attributes of social actors. In this article, we test this assumption by
   examining whether interacting with random peers causes exogenous growth
   of a person's network. Using three years of network data for students at
   an Indian college, we evaluate the effect of peers on network growth. We
   find strong evidence that interacting with random, but well-connected,
   roommates causes significant growth of a focal student's network.
   Further, we find that this growth also implies an increase in how close
   an actor moves to a network's center and whether that actor is likely to
   serve as a network bridge. Fundamentally, our results demonstrate that
   exogenous factors beyond individual agency-i. e., random peers-can shape
   network structure. Our results also provide a useful model for causally
   identifying the determinants of network structure and dynamics.

AB This study examines the effect of shareholder proposals related to

   Specifically, I focus on CSR proposals that pass or fail by a small
   margin of votes. The passage of such "close call" proposals is akin to a
   random assignment of CSR to companies and hence provides a
   quasi-experiment to study the effect of CSR on performance. I find that
   the adoption of close call CSR proposals leads to positive announcement
   returns and superior accounting performance, implying that these
   proposals are value enhancing. When I examine the channels through which
   companies benefit from CSR, I find that labor productivity and sales
   growth increase after the vote. Finally, I document that close call CSR
   proposals differ from non-close proposals along several dimensions.
   Accordingly, although my results imply that adopting close call CSR
   proposals is beneficial to companies, they do not necessarily imply that
   CSR proposals are beneficial in general.

AB Which, if any, of a firm's inventions should it patent? Should it patent
   at all? Many companies engaged in an innovation race seek a patenting
   strategy that balances protection of their intellectual property against
   the knowledge spillovers resulting from disclosure requirements. Not
   much is known about factors that determine the patenting strategy best
   able to resolve this trade-off. Although scholars in various management,
   economics, and engineering disciplines have researched patents and
   patenting regimes, little work has addressed the normative issues that
   pertain to forming an appropriate firm-level patenting strategy. We
   develop an inventory of real-life patenting strategies and integrate
   them into a coherent framework. Our simulation model characterizes the
   optimal patenting choices for different environmental and firm-level
   contingencies while capturing the dynamics between competing firms. We
   identify the firm's research and development strategy as the most
   salient determinant of its optimal patenting strategy. Our research
   contributes to establishing a contingency theory of patenting
   strategies.

AB Although much research emphasizes the importance of venture technical
   competence for venture success and, therefore, the importance of venture
   technical competence in venture capitalist (VC) investment decisions, we
   know little about why some VCs may be better than others at assessing
   the technical competence of ventures. We gathered unique and proprietary
   data from 33 VCs and 308 ventures that sought Series A funding from
   those VCs. We show that VC assessment of ventures predicts VC
   investment, and venture technical competence predicts subsequent venture
   failure. This means that VCs that overassess ventures are more likely to
   invest in firms that are more likely to fail. We then show that higher
   VC technical competence leads to lower errors in assessment, but that
   greater similarity between the VC and venture in technical competence
   leads to higher assessments, ceteris paribus. We thus conclude that VC
   competence enhances the accuracy of VC assessments, but similarity in
   technical competence between VCs and ventures may lead to positive
   assessment bias.

AB The technological transformation and automation of digital content

   automation has also led to requirements for standardization of
   content-delivery formats. This paper examines how the memorability of
   banner advertising changed with the introduction of new standards
   regularizing its format. Using data from randomized field tests, we find
   evidence that for most ads, ad effectiveness falls as the use of
   standard formats rises. The decline is smaller when a standardized ad
   appears to be more original (such as ads created by an ad agency).
   Therefore, a likely explanation is that increased use of a standard
   format makes it harder for basic ads to distinguish themselves from
   their competition because the ad format commands less attention.

   these benefits of colocation persist throughout the time period we study
   (1994-2007), which is surprising, given the rapid development of
   information and communication technologies during that time. These
   benefits are particularly enhanced for manufacturing plants operating
   with processes that involve a high level of tacit process knowledge and
   that belong to large firms. Our findings highlight the importance of
   matching organizational design with process and firm characteristics in

AB If the price of a stock differs from its intrinsic value by a random
   noise, then value stocks are more likely to have negative noise; they
   are thus more likely undervalued and have higher expected return than
   justified by risk. The same intuition applies to small capitalization
   stocks. We formally verify and explore this intuition by using a
   standard noise-in-price model. This intuition is different from the
   Jensen's inequality effect studied by Blume and Stambaugh [Blume ME,
   Stambaugh RF (1983) Biases in computed returns: An application to the
   size effect. J. Financial Econom. 12(3):387-404]. Our model is
   parsimonious: the value premium as well as size premium are computed in
   closed form and depend on only four parameters: mean of stock return,
   volatility of stock return, volatility of the price-to-dividend ratio,
   and noise volatility. We emphasize that only a moderate volatility of
   price noise is needed to generate the observed value premium. However,
   the model cannot generate the observed size premium.

AB We experimentally explore the effect of performance information and
   production uncertainties on (i) subjective entitlements derived from the
   production process and (ii) bargaining over the jointly produced
   surplus. We hypothesize that performance information and details of the
   production process affect entitlements, which in turn influence
   bargaining behavior. We find that, without performance information,
   subjective entitlements are mostly mutually consistent, and bargaining
   mainly ends with an equal split. In stark contrast, negotiators derive
   strong, mutually inconsistent, subjective entitlements when there is
   performance information. These subjective entitlements affect opening
   proposals, concessions, and bargaining duration and lead to asymmetric
   agreements. Moreover, given performance information, endogenous
   variations in entitlements influence bargaining, suggesting an
   independent role of subjective entitlements. Production uncertainties
   influence bargaining, especially when performance information is
   present, but do not substantially mitigate the effect of entitlements.
   Theoretical bargaining models allowing for reference points or fairness
   principles can partly account for the empirical results. Yet, important
   aspects are left unexplained and our results suggest ways for extending
   these models.

   from sending more performance-relevant messages. Our results are

AB We develop and implement a Bayesian semiparametric model of demand under
   interproduct competition that enables us to assess the respective
   contributions of brand-SKU (stock keeping unit) hierarchy and
   interproduct similarity to explaining and predicting demand. To
   incorporate brand-SKU hierarchy effects, we use Bayesian hierarchical
   clustering inherent in a nested Dirichlet process to simultaneously
   partition brands, and SKUs conditional on brands, into groups of
   "similarity clusters." We examine cluster memberships and postprocess
   the Markov chain Monte Carlo output to infer cluster properties by
   accounting for parameter uncertainty. Our proposed approach lends to a
   spatial competition interpretation in latent attribute space and helps
   uncover the extent to which competition across SKUs in the latent
   attribute space is local or global. In a related vein, we discuss the
   implications of well-defined groups of similar SKUs as subcategory or
   submarket boundaries in latent attribute space. We empirically test our
   model using aggregate beer category sales data from a midsize U.S.
   retail chain. We find that branding hierarchy effects dominate those
   from product similarity. We find that the model partitions the 15 brands
   in the data into 4 brand clusters and the 96 SKUs into 25 SKU clusters
   conditional on brand cluster membership. In estimating a set of models
   of spatial interproduct competition, we find that SKU competition is
   more local than global in that only subsets of products compete within
   groups of comparable products. Finally, we discuss the substantive
   implications of our results.

AB We investigate the roles of the level and variability in quality in
   driving customer retention for a new service. We present model-free
   evidence that whereas high average quality helps in retaining customers,
   high variability leads to higher termination rates. Apart from these
   main effects, we use model-free evidence to document the presence of (a)
   an interaction effect between average service quality and its
   variability on termination rates, (b) customer learning about service
   quality over time, and (c) a slower rate of learning among households
   that experience high variability. We postulate a mechanism involving
   risk aversion and learning, which can induce this interaction effect,
   and test this against several alternative explanations. We show that it
   is important to consider variability in quality while inferring the
   impact of improvements to average quality-ignoring the interaction
   effect between average quality and variability leads to an 18%-64%
   (5%-31%) overestimation (underestimation) of quality improvement
   elasticities among high-variability (low-variability) households. Given
   that responsiveness to quality decreases with variability, it is better
   for the firm to focus quality improvement efforts on customers
   experiencing low variability; increasing average quality by 1% lowers
   termination by 1.1% for low-variability households, but only by 0.41%
   for high-variability households.

   was associated with a significantly larger decline in the probability of
   raising continuation financing for these non-IT companies in comparison
   to others. This does not appear to be driven by unobservable company
   characteristics such as company quality or IT relatedness; for the same

   investors with greater Internet exposure were significantly less likely
   to continue to participate in follow-on rounds.

AB We provide an empirical and theoretical assessment of the value of
   information sharing in a two-stage supply chain. The value of downstream
   sales information to the upstream firm stems from improving upstream
   order fulfillment forecast accuracy. Such an improvement can lead to
   lower safety stock and better service. Based on the data collected from
   a consumer packaged goods company, we empirically show that, if the
   company includes the downstream sales data to forecast orders, the
   improvement in the mean squared forecast error ranges from 7.1% to 81.1%
   across all studied products. Theoretical models in the literature,
   however, suggest that the value of information sharing should be zero
   for over half of our studied products. To reconcile the gap between the
   literature and the empirical observations, we develop a new theoretical
   model. Whereas the literature assumes that the decision maker strictly
   adheres to a given inventory policy, our model allows him to deviate,
   accounting for private information held by the decision maker, yet
   unobservable to the econometrician. This turns out to reconcile our
   empirical findings with the literature. These "decision deviations" lead
   to information losses in the order process, resulting in a strictly
   positive value of downstream information sharing. Furthermore, we
   empirically quantify and show the significance of the value of
   operations knowledge-the value of knowing the downstream replenishment
   policy.

AB We develop and estimate a dynamic structural framework to analyze the
   social-media content creation and consumption behavior of employees
   within an enterprise. We focus, in particular, on employees' blogging
   behavior. The model incorporates two key features that are ubiquitous in
   blogging forums: users face (1) a trade-off between blog posting and
   blog reading; and (2) a trade-off between work-related and
   leisure-related content. We apply the model to a unique data set
   comprising the complete details of the blog posting and reading behavior
   of employees over a 15-month period at a Fortune 1000 IT services and
   consulting firm. Despite getting a higher utility from work-related
   blogging, employees nevertheless publish a significant number of leisure
   posts. This is partially because the creation of leisure posts has a
   significant positive spillover effect on the readership of work posts.
   Counterfactual experiments demonstrate that leisure-related blogging has
   positive spillovers for work-related blogging, and hence a policy of
   abolishing leisure-related content creation can inadvertently have
   adverse consequences on work-related content creation in an enterprise
   setting. When organizations restrict leisure blogging, the sharing of
   online work-related knowledge decreases and this in turn can also reduce
   employee performance rating. Overall, blogging within enterprises by
   employees during their work day can have positive long-term benefits for
   organizations.

AB Market-based theories predict that differences in CEO skills lead to
   potentially large differences in pay, but it is challenging to quantify
   the CEO skill premium in pay. In a first step toward overcoming this
   empirical challenge, we code detailed biographical information for a
   large sample of CEOs for a panel of S&P 1500 firms between 1993 and 2005
   to identify specific reputational, career, and educational credentials
   that are indicative of skills. Newly appointed CEOs earn up to a 5% or
   $280,000 total pay premium per credential decile, which is concentrated
   among CEOs with better reputational and career credentials, those with
   the very best credentials, and those who run large firms. Consistent
   with the unique economic mechanism of market-based theories, CEO
   credentials have a positive impact on firm performance. The performance
   differential for newly appointed CEOs is up to 0.5% per credential
   decile and is also concentrated among CEOs with better reputational and
   career credentials and those at large firms. Credentials are positively
   correlated with unobserved CEO heterogeneity in pay and performance,
   which further validates our hypothesis that boards use them as publicly
   observable signals of otherwise hard-to-gauge CEO skills. In all, our
   results offer direct evidence in support of market-based explanations of
   the overall rise in CEO pay.

   spread: the difference in the misvaluation of the most overvalued and

   reinforcing the hypothesis that it proxies for the level of mispricing

AB We conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of queue management
   on patients' average wait time and length of stay (LOS). Using an
   emergency department's (ED) patient-level data from 2007 to 2010, we
   find that patients' average wait time and LOS are longer when physicians
   are assigned patients under a pooled queuing system with a fairness
   constraint compared to a dedicated queuing system with the same fairness
   constraint. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find the
   dedicated queuing system is associated with a 17% decrease in average
   LOS and a 9% decrease in average wait time relative to the control
   group-a 39-minute reduction in LOS and a four-minute reduction in wait
   time for an average patient of medium severity in this ED. Interviews
   and observations of physicians suggest that the improved performance
   stems from the physicians' increased ownership over patients and
   resources that is afforded by a dedicated queuing system, which enables
   physicians to more actively manage the flow of patients into and out of
   ED beds. Our findings suggest that the benefits from improved flow
   management in a dedicated queuing system can be large enough to overcome
   the longer wait time predicted to arise from nonpooled queues. We
   conduct additional analyses to rule out alternate explanations for the
   reduced average wait time and LOS in the dedicated system, such as
   stinting and decreased quality of care. Our paper has implications for
   healthcare organizations and others seeking to reduce patient wait time
   and LOS without increasing costs.

   Democratic ideology that emphasizes equal rights, labor rights, and
   environmental protection. However, firms with a Democratic culture are
   more likely to be the subject of litigation related to securities fraud
   and intellectual property rights violations than are Republican firms,
   whose party ideology stresses self-reliance, property rights, market

   both types of firms experience similar announcement reaction, which
   suggests that the observed relationship between political culture and

AB The aim of this paper is to test the effectiveness of wage-irrelevant
   goal-setting policies in a laboratory environment. In our design,
   managers can assign a goal to their workers by setting a certain level
   of performance on the work task. We establish our theoretical
   conjectures by developing a model in which assigned goals act as
   reference points to workers' intrinsic motivation. Consistent with our
   model, we find that managers set goals that are challenging but
   attainable for a worker of average ability. Workers respond to these
   goals by increasing effort and performance and by decreasing on-the-job
   leisure activities with respect to the no-goal-setting baseline.
   Finally, we study the interaction between goal setting and monetary
   rewards and find, in line with our theoretical model, that goal setting
   is most effective when monetary incentives are strong. These results
   suggest that goal setting may produce intrinsic motivation and increase
   workers' performance beyond what is achieved by using solely monetary
   incentives.

   consumer actions to avoid advertising impose externalities on other

   context of the U.S. Do Not Call (DNC) registry by exploiting the
   exogenous timing of the enforcement of the registry. Supported by
   multiple robustness tests, and validation and falsification exercises,
   we conclude that consumer DNC registrations imposed externalities on
   other consumers. An increase in the first wave of registrations by 1%
   was associated with a 3.1% increase in subsequent registrations. This
   effect was stronger in larger and more educationally or racially
   heterogeneous markets. The externality was possibly due to unregistered
   consumers being more receptive to telemarketing and telemarketers
   increasing calls to them. Our results suggest that managers should
   facilitate consumer opt-out, especially in larger and more educationally

   then analyze the strategic version of this setup with two competing
   firms, provide a general characterization, and show that in many cases
   both firms want to expose themselves to risk, as long as the risks are
   not too positively correlated. This is the case for many linear demand
   and constant marginal cost settings (monopolies, differentiated Bertrand
   firms, or differentiated Cournot firms selling substitutes) where the

AB This paper studies the supply management of a primary input, where this
   input gives rise to multiple products in fixed proportions. My objective
   is twofold. First, I study fixed proportions technology under demand
   uncertainty in comparison with the flexible and dedicated technologies.
   I show that fixed proportions technology has a cost-pooling value over
   dedicated technology, which is larger than the capacity-pooling value of
   flexible technology over dedicated technology. I identify the critical
   role that demand correlation plays with the fixed proportions
   technology: in contrast to the capacity-pooling value, which decreases
   in demand correlation, the cost-pooling value increases in demand
   correlation. Second, focusing on the fixed proportions technology, I
   study supply management in the presence of contract and spot markets. I
   investigate how the optimal supply management strategy should respond to
   changing market uncertainties, and the differences in this response
   based on the contract type. I find that when the exercise price of the
   contract is high, a higher contract market dependence is the best
   response to the increasing demand correlation or spot price variability.
   However, a lower contract market dependence is the best response to the
   same when the exercise price is low. Managerially, these results are
   important because they imply that the supply management strategy adopted
   as a response to a change in the business environment should differ
   depending on the contract type. My results have implications about the
   new product strategy and the procurement contract choice of the
   processors in the agricultural industries.

AB The real option management of commodity conversion assets gives rise to
   intractable Markov decision processes (MDPs), in part because of the use
   of high-dimensional models of commodity forward curve evolution, as
   commonly done in practice. Focusing on commodity storage, we identify a
   deficiency of approximate linear programming (ALP), which we address by
   developing a novel approach to derive relaxations of approximate linear
   programs. We apply our approach to obtain a class of tractable ALP
   relaxations, also subsuming an existing method. We provide theoretical
   support for the use of these ALP relaxations rather than their
   associated approximate linear programs. Applied to existing natural gas
   storage instances, our ALP relaxations significantly outperform their
   corresponding approximate linear programs. Our best ALP relaxation is
   both near optimal and competitive with, albeit slower than,
   state-of-the-art methods for computing heuristic policies and lower
   bounds on the value of commodity storage, but is more directly
   applicable for dual (upper) bound estimation than these methods. Our
   approach is potentially relevant for the approximate solution of MDPs
   that arise in the real option management of other commodity conversion
   assets, as well as the valuation of real and financial options that
   depend on forward curve dynamics.

   outstanding debt over any given time horizon. The model integrates a
   variety of information sources, including historical repayment data,
   account-specific, and time-varying macroeconomic covariates, as well as
   scheduled account-treatment actions. Two model-identification methods
   are examined, based on maximum-likelihood estimation and the generalized
   method of moments. The latter allows for an operational-statistics
   approach, combining model estimation and performance optimization by
   tailoring the estimation error to business-relevant loss functions. The
   DCS framework is applied to a large set of account-level repayment data.
   The improvements in classification and prediction performance compared
   to standard bank-internal scoring methods are found to be significant.

   the same choices for themselves as for others. In contrast, when losses
   are possible, we find that the two types of choices differ. In
   particular, we find that subjects who make choices for themselves take
   less risk than those who decide for others when losses loom. This
   finding is consistent with an interpretation of loss aversion as a bias

AB With scarce empirical support, prior literature argues that managers
   tend to withhold good news and promote bad news to preserve their
   bargaining power against labor unions. This paper provides empirical
   evidence of this rarely supported argument. Using comprehensive
   firm-level data from South Korea, where labor unions have a long
   tradition of making credible threats, we find that overall disclosure
   frequency is negatively related to labor union strength, and that this
   relation is more pronounced in firms with good news. We also find that
   firms with strong labor unions withhold good news during the labor
   negotiation period and release it in a gradual fashion afterward and
   that this pattern is more prominent than that of firms with weak or no
   unions, implying that managers time news disclosures according to
   bargaining schedules to achieve better outcomes in labor negotiations.

   studies in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America from 1970

   dimensions. Long-lasting, exclusive, and synergy-creating bank
   relationships are associated with higher credit volume and lower loan
   rates. These benefits are more likely in the United States and in
   countries where bank competition is high. They are not related to the
   importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in an economy,
   suggesting that prevalence of relationship lending does not necessarily

AB Information technology (IT) implementation is a major organizational
   change event that substantially disrupts an employee's work environment.
   We develop a model of technology adaptation behaviors that employees
   perform to cope with a new IT that causes such disruptions. Our model
   posits technology adaptation behaviors as a key linking mechanism
   between IT implementation and employee job outcomes, thus offering a
   holistic nomological network of technology adaptation behaviors. Two
   field studies conducted over a period of six months, with four waves of
   data collection each, in two organizations (N = 211 and N = 181)
   implementing two different ITs, supported the model. We found that
   employees performed four different technology adaptation
   behaviors-exploration-to-innovate, exploitation, exploration-to-revert,
   and avoidance-based on whether they appraised an IT as an opportunity or
   a threat and whether they had perceptions of control over an IT.
   Employees' experiential engagements (i.e., user participation and
   training effectiveness) and psychological engagements (i.e., user
   involvement and management support) during the implementation jointly
   determined their appraisal of an IT. Finally, we found that technology
   adaptation behaviors influenced changes in two key job outcomes, job
   performance and job satisfaction.

AB Viral products and ideas are intuitively understood to grow through a
   person-to-person diffusion process analogous to the spread of an
   infectious disease; however, until recently it has been prohibitively
   difficult to directly observe purportedly viral events, and thus to
   rigorously quantify or characterize their structural properties. Here we
   propose a formal measure of what we label "structural virality" that
   interpolates between two conceptual extremes: content that gains its
   popularity through a single, large broadcast and that which grows
   through multiple generations with any one individual directly
   responsible for only a fraction of the total adoption. We use this
   notion of structural virality to analyze a unique data set of a billion
   diffusion events on Twitter, including the propagation of news stories,
   videos, images, and petitions. We find that across all domains and all
   sizes of events, online diffusion is characterized by surprising
   structural diversity; that is, popular events regularly grow via both
   broadcast and viral mechanisms, as well as essentially all conceivable
   combinations of the two. Nevertheless, we find that structural virality
   is typically low, and remains so independent of size, suggesting that
   popularity is largely driven by the size of the largest broadcast.
   Finally, we attempt to replicate these findings with a model of
   contagion characterized by a low infection rate spreading on a
   scale-free network. We find that although several of our empirical
   findings are consistent with such a model, it fails to replicate the
   observed diversity of structural virality, thereby suggesting new
   directions for future modeling efforts.

   retailer. Our analysis shows that the retailer's incentive to share
   information strongly depends on nonlinear production cost, competition
   intensity, and whether the retailer can offer a contract to charge a
   payment for the information. Without information contracting, the
   retailer has an incentive to share information for free when production
   economy is large but has no incentive to do so when there is production
   diseconomy. With information contracting, the retailer has an incentive
   to share information when either production diseconomy/economy is large
   or competition is intense. We characterize the conditions under which
   the retailer shares information with none, one, or both of the
   manufacturers. We also show that the retailer prefers to sell
   information sequentially rather than concurrently to the manufacturers,
   whereas the manufacturers' preferences are reversed.

AB One key factor contributing to emergency department (ED) overcrowding is
   prolonged waiting time for admission to inpatient wards, also known as
   ED boarding time. To gain insights into reducing this waiting time, we
   study operations in the inpatient wards and their interface with the ED.
   We focus on understanding the effect of inpatient discharge policies and
   other operational policies on the time-of-day waiting time performance,
   such as the fraction of patients waiting longer than six hours in the ED
   before being admitted. Based on an empirical study at a Singaporean
   hospital, we propose a novel stochastic processing network with the
   following characteristics to model inpatient operations: (1) A patient's
   service time in the inpatient wards depends on that patient's admission
   and discharge times and length of stay. The service times capture a
   two-time-scale phenomenon and are not independent and identically
   distributed. (2) Pre- and post-allocation delays model the extra amount
   of waiting caused by secondary bottlenecks other than bed
   unavailability, such as nurse shortage. (3) Patients waiting for a bed
   can overflow to a nonprimary ward when the waiting time reaches a
   threshold, where the threshold is time dependent. We show, via
   simulation studies, that our model is able to capture the inpatient flow
   dynamics at hourly resolution and can evaluate the impact of operational
   policies on both the daily and time-of-day waiting time performance. In
   particular, our model predicts that implementing a hypothetical policy
   can eliminate excessive waiting for those patients who request beds in
   mornings. This policy incorporates the following components: a discharge
   distribution with the first discharge peak between 8 A.M. and 9 A.M. and
   26% of patients discharging before noon, and constant-mean allocation
   delays throughout the day. The insights gained from our model can help
   hospital managers to choose among different policies to implement
   depending on the choice of objective, such as to reduce the peak waiting
   in the morning or to reduce daily waiting time statistics.

   more and have higher-quality innovations than firms that use other

   one possible reason for this finding is the greater flexibility and
   tolerance to experimentation associated with arm's length financing. I
   find support for this hypothesis by showing that firms with more arm's
   length financing have greater volatility of innovative output, and are
   more likely to innovate in new technological areas. Furthermore,
   focusing only on bank financing, I demonstrate that firms have more
   novel innovations if they borrow from multiple banks, use predominantly
   credit lines, and have less intense covenants. I address potential
   endogeneity concerns by using instrumental variable analysis, and by
   showing that innovation increases significantly after new public debt

AB Although volatile marketing spending, as opposed to even-level spending,
   may improve a brand's financial performance, it can also increase the
   volatility of performance, which is not a desirable outcome. This
   article analyzes how revenue and cash-flow volatility are influenced by
   own and competitive marketing spending volatility, by the level of
   marketing spending, by the responsiveness to own marketing spending, and
   by competitive response. From market response theory, we derive
   propositions about the influence of these variables on revenue and
   cash-flow volatility. In addition, we extend the Dorfman-Steiner theorem
   to derive the optimal level and volatility of expenditures if volatility
   effects are taken into account. Based on a large sample of 99
   pharmaceutical brands in four clinical categories and four European
   countries, we test for the empirical relevance of the propositions and
   assess the magnitude of the different sources of marketing-induced
   performance volatility. We find broad support for the predicted
   volatility effects. Volatility elasticities are significant and may be
   as large as 1.10 for cash-flow variance with respect to marketing
   responsiveness. The findings imply that common volatility-increasing
   marketing practices such as price promotions or volatile advertising
   plans may be effective at the top line, but they could turn out to be
   ineffective after all costs are taken into account. Optimal marketing
   volatility needs to trade off sales effectiveness and extra costs
   resulting from marketing volatility.

   comparison with an inspection good duopoly. Several results are reached.
   First, the firms may reward repeat purchase when the probability of a
   high value is relatively low and when the high-low value difference is
   large; otherwise, they may engage in poaching. Second, BPD frequently
   increases each firm's total profits, even in the poaching equilibrium.
   These results contrast with the inspection good duopoly, and the driver
   is that consumers' period 2 product preference depends on their realized

   increase or decrease firm profits without BPD, and it weakly increases
   firm profits with BPD, relative to the inspection good duopoly.

AB This paper studies the flexible versus dedicated technology choice and

   uncertainty in the presence of budget constraints. The firm operates
   under a capital budget for financing the capacity investment, and an
   operating budget, which is uncertain in the capacity investment stage,
   for financing the production. We investigate how the tightening of the
   capital budget and a lower financial flexibility in the production stage
   (the likelihood of having a sufficient operating budget) shape the
   optimal technology choice. We find that the dominant regime is one where
   dedicated technology should be adopted for a larger investment cost
   range, and thus, is the best response to the tighter capital budget,
   whereas flexible technology is the best response to lower financial
   flexibility. We identify the key roles that the capacity intensity (the
   ratio of unit capacity cost to total unit capacity and production cost)
   of each technology and the pooling value of operating budget with
   dedicated technology, which brings this technology closer to flexible
   technology in terms of the resource network's flexibility, play in a
   budget-constrained environment. Managerially, our results underline that
   in the presence of financial constraints, firms should manage technology
   adoption together with plant location, which shapes capacity intensity,
   or product portfolio, which shapes financial flexibility.

AB The multiarmed bandit problem is a popular framework for studying the
   exploration versus exploitation trade-off. Recent applications include
   dynamic assortment design, Internet advertising, dynamic pricing, and
   the control of queues. The standard mathematical formulation for a
   bandit problem makes the strong assumption that the decision maker has a
   full characterization of the joint distribution of the rewards, and that
   "arms" under this distribution are independent. These assumptions are
   not satisfied in many applications, and the out-of-sample performance of
   policies that optimize a misspecified model can be poor. Motivated by
   these concerns, we formulate a robust bandit problem in which a decision
   maker accounts for distrust in the nominal model by solving a worst-case
   problem against an adversary ("nature") who has the ability to alter the
   underlying reward distribution and does so to minimize the decision
   maker's expected total profit. Structural properties of the optimal
   worst-case policy are characterized by using the robust Bellman (dynamic
   programming) equation, and arms are shown to be no longer independent
   under nature's worst-case response. One implication of this is that
   index policies are not optimal for the robust problem, and we propose,
   as an alternative, a robust version of the Gittins index. Performance
   bounds for the robust Gittins index are derived by using structural
   properties of the value function together with ideas from stochastic
   dynamic programming duality. We also investigate the performance of the
   robust Gittins index policy when applied to a Bayesian webpage design
   problem. In the presence of model misspecification, numerical
   experiments show that the robust Gittins index policy not only
   outperforms the classical Gittins index policy, but also substantially
   reduces the variability in the out-of-sample performance.

AB In some competitions, performance evaluation includes a substantial

   judges may infer quality that is not directly observed and/or make
   conservative choices to assuage accountability concerns. We examine
   these issues in the context of the Olympic Games, comparing
   country-level performance outcomes across Olympic sports. We find that
   past performance is predictive of current performance in all sports, but
   the effect is stronger in subjective outcome sports versus objective
   outcome sports. That is, past performance is a better predictor of
   future performance in sports where external judges and referees can
   influence the outcomes. We find the same pattern in individual boxing
   matches, with past country-level performance having a stronger effect on
   subjective boxing outcomes (judges' decisions) than objective boxing

AB The security market line accords with the capital asset pricing model by
   taking on an upward slope in pessimistic sentiment periods, but is
   downward sloping during optimistic periods. We hypothesize that this
   finding obtains because periods of optimism attract equity investment by
   unsophisticated, overconfident, traders in risky opportunities (high
   beta stocks), whereas such traders stay along the sidelines during
   pessimistic periods. Thus, high beta stocks become overpriced in
   optimistic periods, but during pessimistic periods, noise trading is
   reduced, so that traditional beta pricing prevails. Unconditional on
   sentiment, these effects offset each other. Although rational
   explanations cannot completely be ruled out, analyses using earnings
   expectations, fund flows, the probability of informed trading, and order
   imbalances do provide evidence that noise traders are more bullish about
   high beta stocks when sentiment is optimistic, whereas investor behavior
   appears to accord more closely with rationality during pessimistic
   periods, supporting our hypothesis.

AB In this paper, we study the impact of consumer-generated quality
   information (e.g., consumer reviews) on a firm's dynamic pricing
   strategy in the presence of strategic consumers. Such information is
   useful, not only to the consumers that have not yet purchased the
   product but also to the firm. The informativeness of the
   consumer-generated quality information depends, however, on the volume
   of consumers who share their opinions and, thus, depends on the initial
   sales volume. Hence, via its initial price, the firm not only influences
   its revenue but also controls the quality information flow over time.
   The firm may either enhance or dampen the quality information flow via
   increasing or decreasing initial sales. The corresponding pricing
   strategy to steer the quality information flow is not always intuitive.
   Compared to the case without consumer-generated quality information, the
   firm may reduce the initial sales and lower the initial price.
   Interestingly, the firm may get strictly worse off due to the
   consumer-generated quality information. Even when the firm benefits from
   consumer-generated quality information, it may prefer less accurate
   information. Consumer surplus can also decrease due to the
   consumer-generated quality information, contrary to the conventional
   wisdom that word of mouth should help consumers. We examine extensions
   of our model that incorporate capacity investment, firm's private
   information about quality, alternative updating mechanisms, as well as
   multiple sales periods, and show that our insights are robust.

AB Extant theory claims a firm's information environment impacts the choice
   between debt and equity financing. However, empirical evidence
   supporting this contention is limited. We evaluate this relation within
   the context of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD), which prohibited the
   use of selective disclosure. We find that firms with high proprietary
   costs of public disclosure are more likely to resort to debt financing
   following the passage of Reg FD. This relation is not sensitive to
   whether a firm has relied on selective disclosure in the pre-Reg FD
   regime. We also evaluate changes in firm disclosure policy and find that
   firms that adopted an expansive public disclosure policy are more likely
   to turn to equity financing. Overall, our evidence is consistent with
   the pecking order theory: firms with deteriorated firm information
   environments increase their use of less information-sensitive debt,
   whereas firms with improved information environments favor the use of
   equity financing.

AB We examine how ex ante financial distress risk affects CEO compensation.
   To disentangle the joint effects of performance on compensation and
   distress risk, we focus our analyses on new CEOs. Our results indicate
   that financial distress risk affects compensation through two channels.
   First, new CEOs receive significantly more compensation when financial
   distress risk is higher. This finding is consistent with CEOs receiving
   a compensation premium for bearing this risk since CEOs experience large
   personal costs if their firms later become financially distressed.
   Second, financial distress risk is associated with the incentives
   provided to new CEOs; distress risk is positively associated with
   pay-performance sensitivity and equity-based compensation and is
   negatively associated with cash bonuses. Further, financial distress
   risk is positively associated with pay-risk sensitivity for new CEOs.
   These findings suggest that financial distress risk alters the nature of
   the agency relationship in ways that lead firms to provide CEOs with
   more equity-based incentives. We also build on research that finds a
   positive relation between forced turnover risk and CEO compensation. Our
   analyses suggest the compensation effects of forced turnover risk appear
   to be mainly attributable to financial distress risk. Overall, our
   results indicate financial distress risk is an economically important
   determinant of new CEO compensation packages.

   simultaneously chooses to inspect or not inspect. The unique equilibrium
   of the stage game is in mixed strategies with positive probabilities of
   shirking/inspecting while combined payoffs are maximized when the
   employee works and the employer does not inspect. We examine the effects
   of allowing the employer discretion to sanction or reward the employee
   after observing stage game payoffs. When employers have limited
   discretion, and can only apply sanctions and/or rewards following an
   inspection, we find that both instruments are equally effective in
   reducing shirking and increasing joint earnings. When employers have
   discretion to reward and/or sanction independently of whether they
   inspect, we find that rewards are more effective than sanctions. In
   treatments where employers can combine sanctions and rewards, employers
   rely mainly on rewards, and outcomes closely resemble those of

AB Although binding reverse auctions have attracted a good deal of interest
   in the academic literature, in practice, dynamic nonbinding reverse
   auctions are the norm in procurement. In those, suppliers submit price
   quotes and can respond to quotes of their competitors during a live
   auction event. However, the lowest quote does not necessarily determine
   the winner. The buyer decides after the contest, taking further supplier
   information into account, on who will be awarded the contract. We show,
   both theoretically and empirically, that this bidding format enables
   suppliers to collude, thus leading to noncompetitive prices.

AB We provide a rationale for the recent burst in the amount of
   collaborative activities among firms selling complementary products,
   highlighting factors that may result in a lower profitability for such
   firms overall. To this end, we examine a game-theoretic model in which
   firms can collaborate with producers of complementary goods to enhance
   the quality of the systems formed by their components. Collaboration
   makes it cheaper to enhance such quality, so building innovation
   ecosystems results in firms investing more than if collaboration were
   impossible. In markets reaching saturation, firms are trapped in a
   prisoner's dilemma: the greater investments create more value, but this
   does not translate into greater value capture because the value created
   relative to competitors does not change. We also examine the (dis)
   advantages for a firm of having open or closed interfaces for the
   component it sells when the environment is competitive as well as how
   this is related to the endogenous emergence of two-sided platforms.

   examine a game theoretic duopoly investment model in which (i) a firm
   can learn about the profitability of the investment by observing the
   performance of the first mover and (ii) externalities exist between the
   investments of two firms. We find a region of a war of attrition between
   the two firms in which the interplay between externalities and learning
   gives rise to counterintuitive effects on investment strategies and
   payoffs. In particular, we find that, contrary to the conventional war
   of attrition where an increase in benefits for the follower generally
   delays the first move, an increase in the rate of learning-which tends
   to benefit the follower-can hasten the first investment.

AB The existing theoretical literature provides little justification for a
   corporate debt subsidy. We illustrate the welfare benefit of this
   subsidy and study how the social costs and benefits change with the
   duration of industry distress. In our model, two firms engage in
   socially wasteful competition for survival in a declining industry.
   Firms differ on two dimensions: exogenous productivity and endogenously
   chosen amount of debt financing, resulting in a two-dimensional war of
   attrition. Debt financing increases incentives to exit, which, although
   costly for the firm, is socially beneficial. These benefits decline as
   industry distress shortens. Our normative model sheds light on why the
   debt tax subsidy still persists around the world. Analogously, the model
   can also rationalize a seemingly ad hoc feature of the U.S. tax system,
   which subsidizes the conflict of interest between debt and equity
   regarding firm liquidation.

AB We study a seller's optimal pricing and inventory strategies when
   behavioral (nonpecuniary) motives affect consumers' purchase decisions.
   In particular, the seller chooses between two pricing strategies,
   markdown or everyday low price, and determines the optimal prices and
   inventory level. Two salient behavioral motives that impact consumers'
   purchase decisions and the seller's optimal strategies are anticipated
   regret and misperception of product availability. Regret arises when a
   consumer initially chooses to wait but encounters stockout later, or
   when the consumer buys the product at the high price but realizes that
   the product is still available at the markdown price. In addition,
   consumers often perceive the product's future availability to be
   different than its actual availability. We determine and quantify that
   both regret and availability misperception have significant operational
   and profit implications for the seller. For example, ignoring these
   behavioral factors can result in up to 10% profit losses. We contrast
   the roles of consumers' strategic (pecuniary) motives with their
   behavioral (nonpecuniary) motives in affecting purchase, pricing, and
   inventory decisions. The presence of the behavioral motives reinstates
   the profitability of markdown over everyday low price, in sharp contrast
   to prior studies of only strategic motives that suggest the contrary. We
   characterize how and why strategic versus behavioral motives affect
   decisions in distinctive manners. In doing so, this paper also
   introduces and determines the behavioral benefits of pricing in
   leveraging consumers' behavioral regularities. We advocate that tactics
   that may intensify consumers' misperception of availability, such as
   disclosing low inventory levels, can have a far-reaching impact on
   improving the seller's profit.

AB Multiple sourcing with quick response has been recognized as a useful
   tool to manage demand risk for short-life-cycle goods. However, general
   wisdom has traditionally ignored the effect of these practices on
   supplier incentives. In this paper we find that, when suppliers make
   pricing decisions, dual sourcing does not always lead to higher supply
   chain efficiency or buyer profits as compared to single sourcing. This
   loss takes place when suppliers commit to prices up front, before any
   possible forecast change, but not when they delay the price quotes after
   demand forecasts have been updated. Specifically, with up-front price
   commitment, dual sourcing leads to inflation of supplier prices because
   expensive suppliers will still receive part of the business if they are
   sufficiently quick. Thus, when supplier prices are endogenous, double
   marginalization may offset the additional buyer profit enabled by higher
   ordering flexibility. In contrast, with delayed price quotes, a buyer
   will find dual sourcing beneficial because single sourcing locks it into
   a monopolistic supplier that extracts most of the available rent.

AB Purchase shares of major national brands in consumer packaged-goods
   industries vary substantially across stores, both between geographic
   markets and across stores within markets. We measure the relationship
   between the variation in national-brand purchase shares and five
   store-specific marketing mix factors: prices, assortment shares,
   features, displays, and promotion intensity. We do this by first
   demonstrating the extent to which purchase shares of the top two
   national brands across six different categories vary across markets,
   accounts (defined as chain-market interactions) and stores: market-level
   variation accounts for approximately 30% of the weekly purchase share
   variation across stores, whereas account-level and store-level variation
   explain an additional 13% and 5% of the variation, respectively. We then
   measure the extent to which assortment, pricing, feature, display, and
   promotion activities affect the purchase shares of the top national
   brands. We find that price and assortment share are the two most
   important point-of-sale factors in determining a brand's purchase share.
   We also examine how the proximity to a brand's city of origin, the
   assortment share of a store's private label, the extent of retail
   competition, and the demographics of the store's neighborhood affect the
   purchase share's sensitivity to the point-of-sale marketing mix,
   revealing several subtle effects. Finally, we measure the extent to
   which the variation in top national-brand purchase shares is explained
   by these five factors. We find that, on average, approximately 56% of
   the variation in national-brand purchase shares can be attributed to
   these five factors. These results demonstrate the potential importance
   of trade marketing on a brand's purchase shares.

   unique data set of past experience, successes, and pairwise interactions
   between members of production teams of 1,123 movies and employ dynamic
   panel data estimation methods. Three unique insights emerge.
   Interactions between the producer and other team members have a greater
   effect on revenues than other repeated pairs for which consumers might
   have preferences. In many instances, repeated interactions with current
   team members are more revenue enhancing than individual successes in
   past movies. In fact, repeated interactions between team members improve
   current revenues even if such interactions were unsuccessful. We discuss
   theoretical explanations for these results and the managerial

AB Even though epidemiological evidence links specific workplace stressors
   to health outcomes, the aggregate contribution of these factors to
   overall mortality and health spending in the United States is not known.
   In this paper, we build a model to estimate the excess mortality and
   incremental health expenditures associated with exposure to the
   following 10 workplace stressors: unemployment, lack of health
   insurance, exposure to shift work, long working hours, job insecurity,
   work-family conflict, low job control, high job demands, low social
   support at work, and low organizational justice. Our model uses input
   parameters obtained from publicly accessible data sources. We estimated
   health spending from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and joint
   probabilities of workplace exposures from the General Social Survey, and
   we conducted a meta-analysis of the epidemiological literature to
   estimate the relative risks of poor health outcomes associated with
   exposure to these stressors. The model was designed to overcome
   limitations with using inputs from multiple data sources. Specifically,
   the model separately derives optimistic and conservative estimates of
   the effect of multiple workplace exposures on health, and uses
   optimization to calculate upper and lower bounds around each estimate,
   which accounts for the correlation between exposures. We find that more
   than 120,000 deaths per year and approximately 5%-8% of annual
   healthcare costs are associated with and may be attributable to how U.S.
   companies manage their work forces. Our results suggest that more
   attention should be paid to management practices as important
   contributors to health outcomes and costs in the United States.

AB What explains variability in norms of cooperation across organizations
   and cultures? One answer comes from the tendency of individuals to
   internalize typically successful behaviors as norms. Different
   institutional structures can cause different behavioral norms to be
   internalized. These norms are then carried over into atypical situations
   beyond the reach of the institution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
   such spillovers. First, we immerse subjects in environments that do or
   do not support cooperation using repeated prisoner's dilemmas.
   Afterwards, we measure their intrinsic prosociality in one-shot games.
   Subjects from environments that support cooperation are more prosocial,
   more likely to punish selfishness, and more trusting in general.
   Furthermore, these effects are most pronounced among subjects who use
   heuristics, suggesting that intuitive processes play a key role in the
   spillovers we observe. Our findings help to explain variation in
   one-shot anonymous cooperation, linking this intrinsically motivated
   prosociality to the externally imposed institutional rules experienced
   in other settings.

AB To investigate the opportunity for hospitals to achieve better care at
   lower cost, we examine two key process quality measures, conformance
   quality and experiential quality, and two measures of performance,
   readmission rate and cost per discharge. Conformance quality represents
   a hospital's level of adherence to evidence-based standards of care,
   whereas experiential quality represents the level of interaction between
   hospital's caregivers and patients. Analyzing six years of data from
   3,474 U.S. acute care hospitals, we find that combining conformance and
   experiential quality results in lower readmission rates. However,
   conformance quality and experiential quality each independently increase
   cost per discharge, which suggests that a readmissions-costs trade-off
   is unavoidable. To investigate this further, we conduct post hoc
   analyses by distinguishing between the granular elements of experiential
   quality (EQ) based on task type: response-focused EQ and
   communication-focused EQ. Response-focused EQ measures caregivers'
   ability to respond to patient's explicit needs, whereas
   communication-focused EQ measures caregivers' ability to engage in
   meaningful conversations with the patient. We find that combining
   communication-focused EQ with conformance quality reduces readmission
   rates. Moreover, as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving
   communication-focused EQ decreases, indicating complementarity.
   Response-focused EQ in combination with conformance quality also results
   in reduced readmission rates. However, as conformance quality increases,
   the cost of improving response-focused EQ also increases, suggesting
   that these dimensions might compete for resources. Taken together, our
   results suggest that hospital administrators can mitigate the trade-off
   between reducing readmissions and controlling costs by prioritizing
   communication-focused EQ over response-focused EQ.

AB We consider a monopolistic firm selling two substitutable products to a
   stream of sequential arrivals whose purchase decisions can be influenced
   by earlier purchases. Before demand realizes, the firm faces a
   newsvendor problem for the two products with economies of scale in
   production for each. When consumers are responsive to others' decisions,
   social influence amplifies demand uncertainty, leading to a lower profit
   for the firm. We propose three solutions for the firm to better cope
   with or even benefit from social influence: influencer recruitment and a
   reduced product assortment either before demand realization (ex ante) or
   under production postponement (ex post). First, the firm can offer
   promotional incentives to recruit consumers as influencers. We reveal an
   operational benefit of influencer marketing that a very small fraction
   of such influencers is sufficient to diminish sales' unpredictability.
   Second, as the potential substitutability between products increases due
   to social influence, the firm may leverage the increased
   substitutability and enjoy lower cost in production by reducing product
   assortment before demand realization. Last, under production
   postponement, the firm can take advantage of the way that social
   influence results in demand herding and reduce product varieties by
   reacting to preorder information.

AB Electricity cannot yet be stored on a large scale, but technological
   advances leading to cheaper and more efficient industrial batteries make
   grid-level storage of electricity surpluses a natural choice. Because
   electricity prices can be negative, it is unclear how the presence of
   negative prices might affect the storage policy structure known to be
   optimal when prices are only nonnegative, or even how important it is to
   consider negative prices when managing an industrial battery. For fast
   storage (a storage facility that can both be fully emptied and filled up
   in one decision period), we show analytically that negative prices can
   substantially alter the optimal storage policy structure, e.g., all else
   being equal, it can be optimal to empty an almost empty storage facility
   and fill up an almost full one. For more typical slow grid-level
   electricity storage, we numerically establish that ignoring negative
   prices could result in a considerable loss of value when negative prices
   occur more than 5% of the time. Negative prices raise another
   possibility: rather than storing surpluses, a merchant might buy
   negatively priced electricity surpluses and dispose of them, e.g., using
   load banks. We find that the value of such a disposal strategy is
   substantial, e.g., about $118 per kilowatt-year when negative prices
   occur 10% of the time, but smaller than that of the storage strategy,
   e.g., about $391 per kilowatt-year using a typical battery. However,
   devices for disposal are much cheaper than those for storage. Our
   results thus have ramifications for merchants as well as policy makers.

AB We document that the strength of negatively reciprocal inclinations
   affects workers' reaction to unfair treatment. We exploit unique matched
   survey and administrative data on male public sector employees in the
   Netherlands and compare the job motivation of employees born in 1950,
   who faced a substantial retrenchment of their pension rights resulting
   from a pension reform in 2006, to that of slightly older employees who
   remained entitled to more generous pension benefits. Job motivation is
   significantly lower among negatively reciprocal employees who were
   affected by the reform. The adverse effect on job motivation is stronger
   for negative reciprocal employees born very shortly after the cutoff
   date of January 1, 1950, as well as for those with many unaffected
   colleagues, who perceive the policy change as being more unfair. The
   treatment effect is stronger among workers who are more likely to hold
   their employer accountable for the drop in their pension rights.

AB We explore sell-side debt analysts' contributions to the efficiency of
   securities markets. We document that debt returns lag equity returns
   less when debt research coverage exists, which is consistent with debt
   analysts facilitating the process by which available information is
   impounded in debt prices. The effect of debt research on the debt
   market's lag is incremental to, but comparable in magnitude to, hedge
   fund ownership's effect. No such effect exists for credit rating
   agencies. We also find that the dissemination of debt reports has an
   immediate effect on return volatility in both markets, which is
   consistent with debt analysts providing new information to securities
   markets. Increased return covariation suggests that this information
   impacts the pricing of debt and equity in the same direction. A large
   percentage of debt reports do not induce any immediate debt market
   return reaction but do induce an equity return reaction, which is
   consistent with new information being provided despite the absence of a
   debt market reaction. Finally, there is a systematic variation in the
   debt market's trading and return reactions to debt research. Timely
   reports and those by high-reputation brokers induce a quicker trading
   response, thus enhancing liquidity, whereas only timely reports induce a
   greater return response. This study illuminates the institutional
   underpinnings of debt market efficiency, and it has important
   implications for information content tests in the debt market, where
   trading is limited.

AB Postgrant validity challenges at patent offices rely on the private

   We hypothesize that incentives to bring postgrant validity challenges
   are reduced when many firms benefit from revocation of a patent and when
   firms are caught up in patent thickets. Using data on opposition to
   patents at the European Patent Office we show that opposition decreases
   in fields in which many others profit from patent revocations. Moreover,
   in fields with a large number of mutually blocking patents, the
   incidence of opposition is sharply reduced, particularly among large
   firms and firms that are caught up directly in patent thickets. These
   findings indicate that postgrant patent review may not constitute an
   effective correction device for erroneous patent grants in technologies
   affected by either patent thickets or highly dispersed patent ownership.

   funds. Hedge fund firms can choose to simultaneously offer a fund of
   hedge funds. Similarly, fund of hedge funds firms can simultaneously
   offer a hedge fund. We find that although superior past performance and
   larger size drive the decision to become simultaneous for hedge fund
   firms, past flows drive the decision for fund of hedge funds firms. The
   effects of simultaneity are also different. When hedge fund firms start
   funds of hedge funds, we find evidence of value creation, driven by
   better management of economies of scale and cross learning. In contrast,
   fund of hedge funds firms starting hedge funds destroy value due to
   expansion beyond core competencies and agency problems. We find that
   firms learn about their competencies in the two business lines and
   discontinue underperforming simultaneity arrangements to focus on the
   business where they perform better.

AB We propose to measure growth opportunities by firms' exposure to
   idiosyncratic volatility news. Theoretically, we show that the value of
   a growth option increases in idiosyncratic volatility but its response
   to volatility of aggregate shocks can be either positive or negative
   depending on option moneyness. Empirically, we show that price
   sensitivity to variation in idiosyncratic volatility carries significant
   information about firms' future investment and growth even after
   controlling for conventional proxies of growth options such as
   book-to-market and other relevant firm characteristics. Consistent with
   our theoretical arguments, we also find that firm' exposure to aggregate
   volatility, while priced, does not help predict their future growth.
   Option-intensive firms identified using our idiosyncratic
   volatility-based measure earn a lower premium than do firms that rely
   more heavily on assets in place.

   funds follow similar strategies resulting in crowded equity positions
   that destabilize markets. Inconsistent with this assertion, we find that
   hedge fund equity portfolios are remarkably independent. Moreover, when
   hedge funds do buy and sell the same stocks, their demand shocks are, on
   average, positively related to subsequent raw and risk-adjusted returns.
   Even in periods of extreme market stress, we find no evidence that hedge
   fund demand shocks are inversely related to subsequent returns. Our

   monitoring costs interact to affect optimal team size and workers'
   incentive contracts. Team size increases with project risk, decreases
   with profitability, and decreases with monitoring costs as a proportion
   of output. Our predictions are consistent with empirical evidence that
   firm-specific risk has increased over time, average corporate earnings
   have declined, and firms' organizational structures have also flattened.
   The predicted effects of monitoring costs on team size are supported by
   evidence that improvements in information technology likely to lower
   monitoring costs lead to larger teams. Further, firms with relatively
   more intangible assets, where monitoring costs are likely to be higher,
   are smaller. Optimal incentive intensities decrease with risk and
   increase with profitability. The endogenous determination of team size
   accentuates the positive effects of a decline in risk and an increase in
   profitability on incentives.

   we find a robust, monotonic, positive relationship between store brand
   loyalty and store loyalty by using multiple loyalty metrics and data
   from multiple retailers and by controlling for alternative factors that
   can influence store loyalty. Second, we take advantage of a natural
   experiment involving a store closure and find that the attrition in

   prior to store closure. Together, our results are consistent with
   evidence for the store differentiation role of store brands.

AB This paper presents an empirical study of the impact of Walmart
   supercenter conversion on consumer shopping behavior. By using a
   difference-in-difference estimator, we find that Walmart gains 41% in
   weekly revenue from the conversion. Decomposing the revenue gains into
   components attributable to store visits and per-visit expenditures, we
   find that the majority of these gains were due to larger expenditures,
   with a much smaller impact from store visits. By contrast, among
   competing retailers, grocery stores experience the most significant loss
   (20% weekly revenue) mostly from fewer store visits, with a much smaller
   impact attributable to per-visit expenditure. Taken together, these
   findings show that consumers may benefit from reduced shopping costs by
   making fewer overall trips and increasing their Walmart basket sizes. In
   addition, we find that overall revenue gains for Walmart from conversion
   outweigh the small cannibalization loss at the existing Walmart
   supercenters located farther away. Finally, from category-level
   analyses, we find evidence of increases in category-level spending in
   preexisting categories in the converted supercenter. However, we also
   find that positive demand externality is more pronounced in food
   categories, mainly as a result of increased purchase incidence. We
   discuss the implications of our findings for academics and retail
   managers.

AB Nonprofit organizations use direct-mail marketing to cultivate one-time
   donors and convert them into recurring contributors. Cultivated donors
   generate much more revenue than new donors, but also lapse with time,
   making it important to steadily draw in new cultivations. The
   direct-mail budget is limited, but better-designed mailings can improve
   success rates without increasing costs. We propose an empirical model to
   analyze the effectiveness of several design approaches used in practice,
   based on a massive data set covering 8 0 6 million direct-mail
   communications with donors to the American Red Cross during 2009-2011.
   We find evidence that mailed appeals are more effective when they
   emphasize disaster preparedness and training efforts over post-disaster
   cleanup. Including small cards that affirm donors' identity as Red Cross
   supporters is an effective strategy, whereas including gift items such
   as address labels is not. Finally, very recent acquisitions are more
   likely to respond to appeals that ask them to contribute an amount
   similar to their most recent donation, but this approach has an adverse
   effect on donors with a longer history. We show via simulation that a
   simple design strategy based on these insights has potential to improve
   success rates from 5.4% to 8.1%.

AB Suppose customers arrive at an observable queueing system for service
   with a utility function of reward and waiting cost. The self-(customer)
   decision is whether to queue or balk, and the social (system
   administrator) goal is to maximize the profit of the whole system.
   Whereas the self-optimal policy is relatively easy to obtain, the
   socially optimal policy, which is of more practical importance, often
   requires a tedious and ad hoc analysis as a result of external effects.
   We will introduce a simple and general approach to determine the optimal
   admission policy. The main idea of this approach is to consider a
   special rule that admits an extra customer who is served only by the
   surplus capacity and bears all the increased waiting time and thus
   incurs no external cost. The approach applies in principle to queues
   with exponential service. In fact, for such queues, a marginal analysis
   based on this rule will explore the properties of the optimal social
   policy and lead to a general procedure for deriving the optimal
   threshold.

AB Health information exchanges (HIEs) are healthcare information
   technology efforts designed to foster coordination of patient care
   across the fragmented U.S. healthcare system. Their purpose is to
   improve efficiency and quality of care through enhanced sharing of
   patient data. Across the United States, numerous states have enacted
   laws that provide various forms of incentives for HIEs and address
   growing privacy concerns associated with the sharing of patient data. We
   investigate the impact on the emergence of HIEs of state laws that
   incentivize HIE efforts and state laws that include different types of
   privacy requirements for sharing healthcare data, focusing on the impact
   of laws that include requirements for patient consent. Although we
   observe that privacy regulation alone can result in a decrease in
   planning and operational HIEs, we also find that, when coupled with
   incentives, privacy regulation with requirements for patient consent can
   actually positively impact the development of HIE efforts. Among all
   states with laws creating HIE incentives, only states that combined
   incentives with consent requirements saw a net increase in operational
   HIEs; HIEs in those states also reported decreased levels of privacy
   concern relative to HIEs in states with other legislative approaches.
   Our results contribute to the burgeoning literature on health
   information technology and the debate on the impact of privacy
   regulation on technology innovation. In particular, they show that the
   impact of privacy regulation on the success of information technology
   efforts is heterogeneous: both positive and negative effects can arise
   from regulation, depending on the specific attributes of privacy laws.

AB Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool that holds
   producers financially responsible for the post-use collection,
   recycling, and disposal of their products. Many EPR implementations are
   collective-a large collection and recycling network (CRN) handles
   multiple producers' products in order to benefit from scale and scope
   economies. The total cost is then allocated to producers based on
   metrics such as their return shares by weight. Such weight-based
   proportional allocation mechanisms are criticized in practice for not
   taking into account the heterogeneity in the costs imposed by different
   producers' products. The consequence is cost allocations that impose
   higher costs on certain producer groups than they can achieve
   independently. This may lead some producers to break away from
   collective systems, resulting in fragmented systems with higher total
   cost. Yet cost efficiency is a key legislative and producer concern. To
   address this concern, this paper develops cost allocation mechanisms
   that induce participation in collective systems and maximize cost
   efficiency. The cost allocation mechanisms we propose consist of
   adjustments to the widely used return share method and include the
   weighing of return shares based on processing costs and the rewarding of
   capacity contributions to collective systems. We validate our
   theoretical results using Washington state EPR implementation data and
   provide insights into how these mechanisms can be implemented in
   practice.

AB Operational failures persist, in part because employees work around them
   without engaging in actions to prevent recurrence. To break this cycle,
   we investigate the impact of work design factors on responses to
   operational failures. We use hospital nurses as subjects in a laboratory
   experiment, where, unknown to them, two medication administration
   supplies are missing. We observe their real-time responses to the two
   failures and whether they contribute an improvement idea. We randomly
   assign half of the participants to an experiment location far away from
   a satellite pharmacy where the missing supplies can be obtained
   ("difficult condition"), and the other half are located near the
   satellite pharmacy ("easy condition"). Both conditions contain risky,
   against-policy supplies that can be used to complete the work tasks,
   giving participants a choice between policy-compliant workarounds and
   risky, against-policy workarounds. In the first study, we find that
   participants in the difficult condition are more likely to contribute
   improvement ideas but are less likely to use policy-compliant

   participants in the difficult condition who have high access to the

   when they have low access. Our results suggest that hospitals can
   increase communication about operational failures by deliberately making
   it difficult to work around them while simultaneously providing a high
   level of access to process owners. Otherwise, nurses encountering
   operational failures are likely to resort to against-policy workarounds,
   a behavior observed in practice.

AB We show that cognitive ability influences mutual fund choice: high-IQ
   investors avoid funds with high management fees. Two competing stories
   can explain this phenomenon. One is that high-IQ consumers benefit less
   from costly services, as they find it easier to make informed financial
   decisions without external help. The alternative story is that these
   investors are less likely to overpay for the services they receive
   because they are either better judges of value or more capable of
   discerning the price charged for these services. A comprehensive data
   set of Finnish males' fund holdings supports both stories: consistent
   with the first story, high-IQ investors tend to avoid funds sold via
   expensive service-intensive channels and prefer a mix of equity and bond
   funds to expensive readily packaged balanced funds. Consistent with the
   alternative story, IQ and fees are inversely correlated, even after
   controlling for many fund services, including any operating at the fund
   family level.

AB The long-run abnormal returns following both stock repurchases and
   seasoned equity offerings disappear for the events in 2003-2012. The
   disappearance is associated with the changing market environment:
   increased institutional investment, decreased trading costs, improved
   liquidity, and enhanced regulations on corporate governance and
   information disclosure. In response to the more efficient pricing of
   stocks, firms become less opportunistic in stock repurchases and
   offerings. Recent events of stock repurchases and offerings are
   motivated more by business-operating reasons than to exploit mispricing.
   Both external market factors and internal firm factors contribute to the
   disappearance of the postevent abnormal returns. Our findings on the
   recent events contrast with those of earlier studies and shed light on
   how the changing market environment affects both asset pricing and

AB Using a gift-exchange experiment, we show that the ability of
   reciprocity to overcome incentive problems inherent in principal-agent
   settings is greatly reduced when the agent's effort is distorted by
   random shocks and transmitted imperfectly to the principal.
   Specifically, we find that gift exchange contracts without shocks
   encourage effort and wages well above standard predictions. However, the
   introduction of random shocks reduces wages and effort, regardless of
   whether the shocks can be observed by the principal. Moreover, the
   introduction of shocks significantly reduces the probability of
   fulfilling the contract by the agent, the payoff of the principal, and
   total welfare. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that random shocks
   place an important bound on the ability of gift exchange to overcome
   principal-agent problems.

   buyers is related to the timing of licensing. Furthermore, the effect
   differs by the type of competitor. We then describe a class of models

AB Given the recent concern on "big governments" and rising budget deficits
   in the United States and European nations, there has been a fundamental
   economic debate on the proper boundary and role of governments in a
   society. Inspired by this debate, we study the relationship between
   information technology (IT) and government size. Drawing on a broad
   range of the literature from multiple disciplines such as information
   systems, industrial organization, and political sciences, we present
   several theoretical mechanisms that explain the impact of IT on
   government expenditures. Using a variety of data on IT spending and
   state government expenditures, we find that greater IT investments made
   by a state chief information officer (CIO) are associated with lower
   state government spending. It is estimated that on average, a $1
   increase in state CIO budgets is associated with a reduction of as much
   as $3.49 in state overall expenditures. This study contributes to the
   literature by identifying a key technological factor that affects
   government spending and showing that IT investments can be a means to
   restrain government growth.

   products. We study strategic incentives of an intermediary in the design
   of its search environment as a means to ease search costs. An important
   aspect of our analysis is that consumers optimally decide how many
   sellers to evaluate and how deeply (e.g., number of attributes) to
   evaluate each of them. We find that the equilibrium search environment
   embeds sufficiently high search costs to prevent consumers from
   evaluating too many sellers, but not too high to cause them to evaluate
   sellers' products at partial depth.

AB In live broadcasting, the break lengths available for commercials are
   not always fixed and known in advance (e.g., strategic and injury
   time-outs are of variable duration in live sports transmissions).
   Broadcasters actively manage their advertising revenue by jointly
   optimizing sales and scheduling policies. We characterize the optimal
   dynamic schedule in a simplified setting that incorporates stochastic
   break durations and advertisement lengths of 15 and 30 seconds. The
   optimal policy is a "greedy" look-ahead rule that accounts for the
   remaining number of breaks; in this setting, there is no value to
   perfect information at the scheduling stage, and hence knowing the
   duration of all breaks would not change the schedule. We present
   heuristics to help solve scheduling problems of even greater complexity.
   The performance of these heuristics under various scenarios is tested by
   running simulations calibrated using industry data. The simple greedy
   heuristic is shown to perform well except when revenues are concave in
   ad length, in which case the look-ahead aspect of the optimal schedule
   becomes more important. Finally, we recommend ways for broadcasters to
   balance their portfolio of booked ads by determining the optimal
   overbooking level and mix of ads as a function of their associated
   revenues generated and penalties incurred.

AB Until the end of the 20th century it was common that cities organized,
   financed, and managed their own public transportation systems. More
   recently (in Italy mainly during the last decade), many countries
   liberalized the service provision of public transportation. Although
   offering local public transportation is a political and financial duty
   of governments, the service provision is outsourced to a private
   operator, while the government retains a control position, given to a
   regulatory agency. This is a common scheme not only in transportation.
   In close collaboration with the public transportation agency of the city
   of Bologna, Italy, we designed a methodology to optimize some aspects of
   the contractual relationship between that agency and the bus operator.
   We focus on the fines specified by the contract when the operator fails
   to comply with the service level it has agreed to provide, and on a
   procedure to measure that service level. Our approach has the advantage
   that it aligns the incentives of both parties to the benefit of bus
   riders. We model the agency-operator relationship as a multistage game
   and find its equilibrium to establish the best operating regime. The
   game-theoretical approach provides expressions for the fines that the
   operator should be charged if it does not satisfy the contracted
   services, and for the optimal agency's budget to devote to control
   activities. Second, to check the compliance of the operator with the
   schedule specified by the contract in a resource-efficient way, we
   compute how to position the agency's employees to verify if buses are
   running according to the specifications of the contract. This is
   achieved by counting bus services and by checking other quality
   indicators. We formulate this NP-hard problem as a mixed integer linear
   program and propose an algorithm to solve it that is effective in
   providing itineraries for the controllers working for the agency.

AB This study considers a basic inventory management problem with nonzero
   fixed order costs under interval demand uncertainty. The existing robust
   formulations obtained by applying well-known robust optimization
   methodologies become computationally intractable for large problem
   instances due to the presence of binary variables. This study resolves
   this intractability issue by proposing a new robust formulation that is
   shown to be solvable in polynomial time when the initial inventory is
   zero or negative. Because of the computational efficiency of the new
   robust formulation, it is implemented on a folding-horizon basis,
   leading to a new heuristic for the problem. The computational results
   reveal that the new heuristic is not only superior to the other
   formulations regarding the computing time needed, but also outperforms
   the existing robust formulations in terms of the actual cost savings on
   the larger instances. They also show that the actual cost savings
   yielded by the new heuristic are close to a lower bound on the optimal
   expected cost.

AB Social scientists have long considered what mechanisms underlie repeated
   exchange. Three mechanisms have garnered the majority of this attention:
   formal contracts, relational contracts, and relationally embedded social
   ties. Although each mechanism has its virtues, all three exhibit a
   common limitation: an inability to fully explain the continuation and
   stability of intertemporal exchange between individuals and
   organizations in the face of change. Drawing on extensive quantitative
   data on approximately 450,000 microfinance loans made by a microfinance
   institution in Mexico from 2004 to 2008 that include random assignment
   of loan officers, this research proposes the concept of "relational
   styles" to help explain how repeated exchange is possible in the face of
   personnel change. We define relational styles as systematically
   reoccurring patterns of interaction employed by social actors within and
   across exchange relationships-in this paper, between microfinance
   clients and loan officers. We show that relational styles that are
   consistent facilitate a clear understanding of expectations and thus
   exchange. We also demonstrate that consistency in the relational styles
   followed by successive loan officers mitigates the negative impact of a
   broken loan officer-client tie. This paper thus proposes and empirically
   tests a social mechanism based on relational styles that often
   accompanies relational embeddedness, but which may also serve as a
   partial substitute for it.

AB This paper studies government subsidies for green technology adoption
   while considering the manufacturing industry's response. Government
   subsidies offered directly to consumers impact the supplier's production
   and pricing decisions. Our analysis expands the current understanding of
   the price-setting newsvendor model, incorporating the external influence
   from the government, who is now an additional player in the system. We
   quantify how demand uncertainty impacts the various players (government,
   industry, and consumers) when designing policies. We further show that,
   for convex demand functions, an increase in demand uncertainty leads to
   higher production quantities and lower prices, resulting in lower
   profits for the supplier. With this in mind, one could expect consumer
   surplus to increase with uncertainty. In fact, we show that this is not
   always the case and that the uncertainty impact on consumer surplus
   depends on the trade-off between lower prices and the possibility of
   underserving customers with high valuations. We also show that when
   policy makers such as governments ignore demand uncertainty when
   designing consumer subsidies, they can significantly miss the desired
   adoption target level. From a coordination perspective, we demonstrate
   that the decentralized decisions are also optimal for a central planner
   managing jointly the supplier and the government. As a result, subsidies
   provide a coordination mechanism.

AB We examine operational and incentive issues that conspire to reduce the
   quality of milk-via deliberate adulteration by milk farmers-acquired by
   competing collection intermediaries in developing countries. Broadly
   speaking, three main forces in the milk supply chain lead to the low
   quality of milk: high testing costs, harmful competition among stations,
   and free-riding among farmers. The goal of this study is to provide
   recommendations that address the quality problem with minimal testing.
   Interestingly, some intuitive interventions-such as providing stations
   with better infrastructure (e.g., storage and refrigeration facilities)
   or subsidizing testing costs-could hurt the quality of milk in the
   presence of competition. To save testing costs we utilize mixed testing,
   where the milk combined from multiple farmers is tested once. However,
   mixed testing makes the system vulnerable to free-riding among farmers.
   We counter free-riding by applying a credible threat of individual
   testing (although not its actual use in equilibrium). We then propose
   two interventions to combat the harmful competition among stations. The
   novelty of our proposals lies in utilizing the force of competition to
   solve a problem created by competition. The incentives in our proposals
   provide a new tool for the stations to compete and convert the harmful
   effect of competition (quality reduction) into a beneficial one (quality
   improvement), resulting in a socially desirable equilibrium outcome: all
   the farmers provide high-quality milk and each competing station
   conducts only one mixed test and no further testing.

AB We study the alliance formation strategy among suppliers in a framework
   with one downstream firm and n upstream suppliers. Each supplier faces
   an exogenous random shock that may result in an order default. Each of
   them also has access to a recourse fund that can mitigate this risk. The
   suppliers can share the fund resources within an alliance, but they need
   to equitably allocate the profits of the alliance among the partners. In
   this context, suppliers need to decide whether to join larger alliances
   that have better chances of order fulfillment or smaller ones that may
   grant them higher profit allocations. We first analytically characterize
   the exact coalition-proof Nash-stable coalition structures that would
   arise for symmetric complementary or substitutable suppliers. Our
   analysis reveals that it is the appeal of default risk mitigation,
   rather than competition reduction, that motivates cooperation. In
   general, a riskier and/or less fragmented supply base favors larger
   alliances, whereas substitutable suppliers and customer demands with
   lower pass-through rates result in smaller ones. We then characterize
   the stable coalition structures for an asymmetric supplier base. We
   establish that grand coalition is more stable when the supplier base is
   more homogeneous in terms of their risk levels, rather than divided
   among a few highly risky suppliers and other low-risk ones. Going one
   step further, our investigation of endogenous recourse fund levels for
   the suppliers demonstrates how financing costs affect suppliers'
   investments in risk-reducing resources and, consequently, their
   coalition formation strategy. Last, we discuss model generalizations and
   show that, in general, our insights are quite robust.

AB Financial institutions use risk measures to calculate the marginal
   capital cost when expanding the exposure to a certain risk within their
   portfolio. We reverse this approach by calculating the marginal cost
   based on economic fundamentals for a profit-maximizing firm and then by
   identifying the risk measure delivering the correct marginal cost. The
   resulting measure depends on context. Whereas familiar measures can be
   recovered in some circumstances, other circumstances yield unfamiliar
   forms. In all cases, the risk preferences of the institution's claimants
   determine how the correct risk measure must weight various default

AB Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and advanced cancer is
   often treated with combinations of multiple chemotherapy drugs. In this
   work, we develop models to predict the outcomes of clinical trials
   testing combination chemotherapy regimens before they are run and to
   select the combination chemotherapy regimens to be tested in new phase
   II and phase III clinical trials, with the primary objective of
   improving the quality of regimens tested in phase III trials compared to
   current practice. We built a database of 414 clinical trials for
   advanced gastric cancer and use it to build statistical models that
   attain an out-of-sample R-2 of 0.56 when predicting a trial's median
   overall survival (OS) and an out-of-sample area under the curve (AUC) of
   0.83 when predicting if a trial has unacceptably high toxicity. We
   propose models that use machine learning and optimization to suggest
   regimens to be tested in phase II and phase III trials. Though it is
   inherently challenging to evaluate the performance of such models
   without actually running clinical trials, we use two techniques to
   obtain estimates for the quality of regimens selected by our models
   compared with those actually tested in current clinical practice. Both
   techniques indicate that the models might improve the efficacy of the
   regimens selected for testing in phase III clinical trials without
   changing toxicity outcomes. This evaluation of the proposed models
   suggests that they merit further testing in a clinical trial setting.

AB Gender bias in the evaluation of job candidates has been demonstrated in
   business, government, and academia, yet little is known about how to
   overcome it. Blind evaluation procedures have been proven to
   significantly increase the likelihood that women musicians are chosen
   for orchestras, and they are employed by a few companies. We examine a
   new intervention to overcome gender bias in hiring, promotion, and job
   assignments: an "evaluation nudge" in which people are evaluated jointly
   rather than separately regarding their future performance. Evaluators
   are more likely to base their decisions on individual performance in
   joint than in separate evaluation and on group stereotypes in separate
   than in joint evaluation, making joint evaluation the profit-maximizing
   evaluation procedure. Our work is inspired by findings in behavioral
   decision research suggesting that people make more reasoned choices when
   examining options jointly rather than separately and is compatible with
   a behavioral model of information processing.

AB For many consumer-intensive (i.e., business-to-consumer) services,
   delivering memorable customer experiences is a source of competitive
   advantage. Yet there are few guidelines available for designing service
   encounters with a focus on customer satisfaction. In this paper, we show
   how experiential services should be sequenced and timed to maximize the
   satisfaction of customers who are subject to memory decay and
   acclimation. We find that memory decay favors positioning the highest
   service level near the end, whereas acclimation favors maximizing the
   gradient of service level. Together, they maximize the gradient of
   service level near the end. Although memory decay and acclimation lead
   to the same design individually, they can act as opposing forces when
   considered jointly. Overall, our analysis suggests that short
   experiences should have activities scheduled as a crescendo and duration
   allocated primarily to the activities with the highest service levels,
   whereas long experiences should have activities scheduled in a U-shaped
   fashion and duration allocated primarily to activities with the lowest
   service level so as to ensure a steep gradient at the end.

AB Newly public companies tend to exhibit abnormally high accruals in the
   year of their initial public offering (IPO). Although the prevailing
   view in the literature is that these accruals are caused by
   opportunistic misreporting, we show that these accruals do not appear to
   benefit managers and instead result from the normal economic activity of
   newly public companies. In particular, and in contrast to the notion
   that managers benefit from inflating accruals through an inflated issue
   price, inflated post-IPO equity values, and increased insider trading
   profits, we find no evidence of a relation between abnormal accruals and
   these outcomes. Instead, consistent with these accruals resulting from
   normal economic activity, we find that these accruals are attributable
   to the investment of IPO proceeds in working capital and that
   controlling for the amount of IPO proceeds invested in working capital
   produces a more powerful accrual-based measure of misreporting.

AB Most major health institutions recommend women to undergo repeat
   mammography screening for early diagnosis of breast cancer, the leading
   cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. Although the proportion of
   women who ever had a mammogram is increasing, a majority of women do not
   get repeat mammograms. This paper analyzes the role of heterogeneity in
   women's adherence on optimal mammography screening recommendations. We
   develop a dynamic modeling framework that considers imperfect and
   heterogeneous adherence to screening recommendations. We carefully
   calibrate our model and solve it using real data. Unlike the existing
   breast cancer screening guidelines, our results suggest that adherence
   and heterogeneity in women's adherence behaviors should be explicitly
   considered. In particular, we find that when screening strategies are
   optimized assuming average adherence for everyone, the effect on
   patients with already low adherence would be relatively small, but
   patients with high adherence would be adversely affected. Considering
   imperfect and heterogeneous adherence in the population, our model
   suggests (1) given the current low adherence rates, an aggressive
   screening policy such as annual screening between the ages of 40 and 79
   should be promoted to the general population; (2) screening strategies
   may be adjusted in clinical practice based on women's adherence, and
   screening intervals can be extended to two years for women with a
   history of high adherence; and (3) if the screening patterns change in
   the long run and most regular screeners adopt the most recent U.S.
   Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, then improving overall
   mammography adherence in society becomes more critical.

   extreme events. Our ambiguity measurements are associated with real
   economic decisions; specifically, a-insensitivity is negatively related

   related to stock market participation, but only for subjects who

   and decision variables. We propose a simple and intuitive approach that
   hinges on considerably weaker assumptions. Merging insights from the
   monotone comparative statics literature with insights from the risk
   apportionment literature, we show that the ranking of simple lottery
   pairs is all that is needed for establishing the comparative statics of
   risk changes. We use this approach to analyze the comparative statics of
   Nth-degree stochastic dominance shifts in a general setting with one and
   with multiple decision variables, and we show how these results can be

AB In 2000, Italy replaced its traditional system of severance pay for
   public employees with a new system. Under the old regime, severance pay
   was proportional to the final salary before retirement; under the new
   regime it is proportional to lifetime earnings. This reform entails
   substantial losses for future generations of public employees, in the
   range of (sic)20,000-(sic)30,000, depending on seniority. Using a
   difference-in-difference framework, we estimate the impact of this
   unanticipated change in lifetime resources, on the current consumption
   and wealth accumulation of employees affected by the reform. In line
   with theoretical simulations, we find that each euro reduction in
   severance pay reduces the average propensity to consume by 3 cents and
   increases the wealth-income ratio by 0.32. The response is stronger for
   younger workers and for households where both spouses are public sector
   employees.

AB Enterprise software systems are required to be highly reliable because
   they are central to the business operations of most firms. However,
   configuring and maintaining these systems can be highly complex, making
   it challenging to achieve high reliability. Resource-constrained
   software teams facing business pressures can be tempted to take design
   shortcuts in order to deliver business functionality more quickly. These
   design shortcuts and other maintenance activities contribute to the
   accumulation of technical debt, that is, a buildup of software
   maintenance obligations that need to be addressed in the future. We
   model and empirically analyze the impact of technical debt on system
   reliability by utilizing a longitudinal data set spanning the 10-year
   life cycle of a commercial enterprise system deployed at 48 different
   client firms. We use a competing risks analysis approach to discern the
   interdependency between client and vendor maintenance activities. This
   allows us to assess the effect of both problematic client modifications
   (client errors) and software errors present in the vendor-supplied
   platform (vendor errors) on system failures. We also examine the
   relative effects of modular and architectural maintenance activities
   undertaken by clients in order to analyze the dynamics of technical debt
   reduction. The results of our analysis first establish that technical
   debt decreases the reliability of enterprise systems. Second, modular
   maintenance targeted to reduce technical debt was approximately 53% more
   effective than architectural maintenance in reducing the probability of
   a system failure due to client errors, but it had the side effect of
   increasing the chance of a system failure due to vendor errors by
   approximately 83% more than did architectural maintenance activities.
   Using our empirical results we illustrate how firms could evaluate their
   business risk exposure due to technical debt accumulation in their
   enterprise systems, and we assess the estimated net effects, both
   positive and negative, of a range of software maintenance practices.
   Finally, we discuss implications for research in measuring and managing
   technical debt in enterprise systems.

AB In fields as diverse as technology entrepreneurship and the arts, crowds
   of interested stakeholders are increasingly responsible for deciding
   which innovations to fund, a privilege that was previously reserved for
   a few experts, such as venture capitalists and grant-making bodies.
   Little is known about the degree to which the crowd differs from experts
   in judging which ideas to fund, and, indeed, whether the crowd is even
   rational in making funding decisions. Drawing on a panel of national
   experts and comprehensive data from the largest crowdfunding site, we
   examine funding decisions for proposed theater projects, a category
   where expert and crowd preferences might be expected to differ greatly.
   We instead find significant agreement between the funding decisions of
   crowds and experts. Where crowds and experts disagree, it is far more
   likely to be a case where the crowd is willing to fund projects that
   experts may not. Examining the outcomes of these projects, we find no
   quantitative or qualitative differences between projects funded by the
   crowd alone and those that were selected by both the crowd and experts.
   Our findings suggest that crowdfunding can play an important role in
   complementing expert decisions, particularly in sectors where the crowds
   are end users, by allowing projects the option to receive multiple
   evaluations and thereby lowering the incidence of "false negatives."

AB Online open collaboration efforts, such as Wikipedia articles and open
   source software development, often involve a large crowd with diverse
   experiences and interests. Diversity, on the one hand, facilitates the
   access to and integration of a wide variety of information; on the other
   hand, it may cause conflict and hurt group performance. Although
   diversity's effects have been the subject of many studies in offline
   work groups (with the results remaining inconclusive), its effects in
   online self-organizing groups are underexplored. In this paper, we
   examine 648 WikiProjects to understand (1) how tenure disparity and
   interest variety affect group productivity and member withdrawal and (2)
   how the two types of diversity evolve over time. Our results show a
   curvilinear effect of tenure disparity, which increases productivity and
   decreases member withdrawal, up to a point. Beyond that point,
   productivity slightly decreases, and members are more likely to
   withdraw. In comparison, our results show a positive effect of interest
   variety on productivity and no significant effects on withdrawal. We
   also find that, over a project's life cycle, tenure disparity decreases
   and interest variety increases, with both converging toward the level
   that is optimal for group performance. Overall, our study highlights the
   importance of having diverse experiences and perspectives in online open
   collaboration and the power of self-organizing that helps groups evolve
   toward their high-performing zones. It also has practical implications
   on the design of collaboration tools and new forms of organizing work in

   indifferent between the two contracts. However, the sequence and
   magnitude of costs and revenues (i.e., losses and gains) vary
   significantly between the contracts, suggesting the supplier's
   preference of contract type, and associated contract parameter values,
   may vary with the level of loss aversion. We investigate this phenomenon
   through two studies. The first is a preliminary study investigating
   whether human suppliers are indeed indifferent between these two
   contracts. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, with human subjects
   taking on the role of the supplier having to choose between contracts,
   we find that contract preferences change with the ratio of overage and
   underage costs for the channel (i.e., the newsvendor critical ratio). In
   particular, a buyback contract is preferred for products with low
   critical ratio, whereas revenue sharing is preferred for products with
   high critical ratio. We show these results are consistent with the
   behavioral tendency of loss aversion and are more significant for
   subjects who exhibit higher loss aversion tendencies in an out of
   context task. In the second (main) study, we examine differences in the
   performance of buyback and revenue-sharing contracts when suppliers have
   the authority to set contract parameters. We find that the contract
   frame influences the way parameters are set and the critical ratio again
   plays an important role. More specifically, revenue-sharing contracts
   are more profitable for the supplier than buyback contracts in a high
   critical ratio environment when accounting for the supplier's
   parameter-specification behavior. Also, there is little difference in
   performance between the two contracts in a low critical ratio
   environment. These results can help inform supply managers on what types
   of contracts to use in different critical ratio settings.

AB A technology firm launches newer generations of a given product over
   time. At any moment, the firm decides whether to release a new version
   of the product that captures the current technology level at the expense
   of a fixed launch cost. Consumers are forward-looking and purchase newer
   models only when it maximizes their own future discounted surpluses. We
   start by assuming that consumers have a common valuation for the product
   and consider two product launch settings. In the first setting, the firm
   does not announce future release technologies and the equilibrium of the
   game is to release new versions cyclically with a constant level of
   technology improvement that is optimal for the firm. In the second
   setting, the firm is able to precommit to a schedule of technology
   releases and the optimal policy generally consists of alternating minor
   and major technology launch cycles. We verify that the difference in
   profits between the commitment and no-commitment scenarios can be
   significant, varying from 4% to 12%. Finally, we generalize our model to
   allow for multiple customer classes with different valuations for the
   product, demonstrating how to compute equilibria in this case and
   numerically deriving insights for different market compositions.

AB Whereas early location work established the role of economic factors in
   entrepreneurs' location choices, recent studies suggest personal reasons
   as another factor. However, because the places where entrepreneurs want
   to live are often the places where they will likely do well, it is
   difficult to empirically separate the two mechanisms. We focus on
   entrepreneurs founding firms abroad, allowing us to more effectively
   isolate the effect of personal location attractiveness. We leverage
   entrepreneurs' decisions to relocate and manage their firms personally
   or to remain in a home country and hire a manager. We find that
   entrepreneurs who view a host country as an attractive location are more
   likely to relocate and manage their firms personally. However, such
   entrepreneur-managers have lower firm performance. These results are
   consistent with the idea that entrepreneurs are more likely to reside in
   personally attractive places and are willing to substitute benefits of
   living there for some firm profit.

AB Research in industrial organization and strategic management has shown
   that rivals competing with each other in multiple markets are more
   willing to show each other mutual forbearance, i.e., compete less
   aggressively, within their spheres of influence, i.e., the markets in
   which each firm dominates. Sell-side equity analysts typically cover
   multiple stocks in common with their rivals. We examine the impact of
   this "multipoint contact" for mutual forbearance on two key dimensions
   of competition among security analysts: forecast accuracy and
   information leadership ( issuing earnings forecasts or stock
   recommendations that influence rival analysts). We find that multipoint
   contact is associated with analysts exerting greater information
   leadership on stocks within their own spheres of influence. We also find
   greater forbearance related to information leadership under Regulation
   Fair Disclosure (Reg FD). In contrast, multipoint contact was not
   associated with greater forecast accuracy on stocks within analysts'
   spheres of influence, either before or under Reg FD. Our analysis is
   among the first to consider mechanisms of competition among securities
   analysts and also adds to the literature on Reg FD by demonstrating that
   the increased workload imposed on analysts after Reg FD fostered mutual
   forbearance as a response.

AB Online workplaces such as oDesk, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and TaskRabbit
   have been growing in importance over the last few years. In such
   markets, employers post tasks on which remote contractors work and
   deliver the product of their work online. As in most online
   marketplaces, reputation mechanisms play a very important role in
   facilitating transactions, since they instill trust and are often
   predictive of the employer's future satisfaction. However, labor markets
   are usually highly heterogeneous in terms of available task categories;
   in such scenarios, past performance may not be an accurate signal of
   future performance. To account for this natural heterogeneity, in this
   work, we build models that predict the performance of a worker based on
   prior, category-specific feedback. Our models assume that each worker
   has a category- specific quality, which is latent and not directly
   observable; what is observable, though, is the set of feedback ratings
   of the worker and of other contractors with similar work histories.
   Based on this information, we provide a series of models of increasing
   complexity that successfully estimate the worker's quality. We start by
   building a binomial model and a multinomial model under the implicit
   assumption that the latent qualities of the workers are static. Next, we
   remove this assumption, and we build linear dynamic systems that capture
   the evolution of these latent qualities over time. We evaluate our
   models on a large corpus of over a million transactions ( completed
   tasks) from oDesk, an online labor market with hundreds of millions of
   dollars in transaction volume. Our results show an improved accuracy of
   up to 25% compared to feedback baselines and significant improvement
   over the commonly used collaborative filtering approach. Our study
   clearly illustrates that reputation systems should present different
   reputation scores, depending on the context in which the worker has been
   previously evaluated and the job for which the worker is applying.

AB Statistical training helps individuals analyze and interpret data.
   However, the emphasis placed on null hypothesis significance testing in
   academic training and reporting may lead researchers to interpret
   evidence dichotomously rather than continuously. Consequently,
   researchers may either disregard evidence that fails to attain
   statistical significance or undervalue it relative to evidence that
   attains statistical significance. Surveys of researchers across a wide
   variety of fields (including medicine, epidemiology, cognitive science,
   psychology, business, and economics) show that a substantial majority
   does indeed do so. This phenomenon is manifest both in researchers'
   interpretations of descriptions of evidence and in their likelihood
   judgments. Dichotomization of evidence is reduced though still present
   when researchers are asked to make decisions based on the evidence,
   particularly when the decision outcome is personally consequential.

AB Previous studies have shown that quantity commitment by all firms in an
   industry mitigates price competition. This paper shows that when firms
   have a choice, asymmetric outcomes can arise, with some firms choosing
   to commit to a quantity and other firms choosing not to. To study the
   commitment decision, we analyze a multistage game within a duopoly of
   differentiated firms a la Hotelling. In the first stage of the game,
   firms choose whether or not to commit to a quantity. In the second
   stage, each firm that chose to commit sets a quantity, which represents
   an upper bound on how much it can sell to consumers. In the third stage,
   both firms set prices strategically, regardless of whether or not they
   committed. In the final stage, demand is allocated as consumers maximize
   their utilities. Firm(s) that chose not to commit to a quantity in the
   first stage can fulfill any quantity that consumers demand at the
   equilibrium prices. We find that if product differentiation is
   sufficiently low, both firms choose to commit to a quantity in
   equilibrium. This symmetric equilibrium allows both firms to avoid the
   intense price competition associated with low product differentiation.
   If the level of differentiation is sufficiently high, the equilibrium in
   quantity commitment is asymmetric such that one firm chooses to commit
   and its competitor chooses not to commit. Under this equilibrium, a
   pricing equilibrium in pure strategies does not exist, only a pricing
   equilibrium in mixed strategies does, and the equilibrium prices can
   result in a committed firm not clearing the entire quantity it chose
   earlier.

AB Industrial production output is generally correlated with the state of
   the economy. Nonetheless, during times of economic downturn, some
   industries take the biggest hit, whereas at times of economic boom they
   reap most benefits. To provide insight into this phenomenon, we map
   supply networks of industries and firms and investigate how the supply
   network structure mediates the effect of economy on industry or firm
   sales. Previous research has shown that retail sales are correlated with
   the state of the economy. Since retailers source their products from
   other industries, the sales of their suppliers can also be correlated
   with the state of the economy. This correlation represents the source of
   systematic risk for an industry that propagates through a supply chain
   network. Specifically, we identify the following mechanisms that can
   affect the correlation between sales and the state of the economy in a
   supply chain network: propagation of systematic risk into production
   decisions, aggregation of orders from multiple customers in a supply
   chain network, and aggregation of orders over time. We find that the
   first effect does not amplify the correlation; however, the latter two
   intensify correlation and result in the amplification of correlation
   upstream in supply networks. We demonstrate three managerial
   implications of this phenomenon: implications for the cost of capital,
   for the risk-adjusted valuation of supply chain improvement projects,
   and for supplier selection and risk.

AB Risk pooling has been studied extensively in the operations management
   literature as the basic driver behind strategies such as transshipment,
   manufacturing flexibility, component commonality, and drop shipping.
   This paper explores the benefit of risk pooling in the context of
   inventory management using the canonical model first studied in Eppen
   [Eppen GD (1979) Effects of centralization on expected costs in a
   multi-location newsboy problem. Management Sci. 25(5): 498-501].
   Specifically, we consider a single-period, multilocation newsvendor
   model, where n different locations face independent and identically
   distributed demands and linear holding and backorder costs. We show that
   Eppen's celebrated result, i.e., that the expected cost savings from
   centralized inventory management scale with the square root of the
   number of locations, depends critically on the "light-tailed" nature of
   the demand uncertainty. In particular, we establish that the benefit
   from pooling relative to the decentralized case, in terms of both
   expected cost and safety stock, is equal to n((alpha-1)/alpha) for a
   class of heavy-tailed demand distributions (stable distributions), whose
   power-law asymptotic decay rate is determined by the parameter alpha is
   an element of(1,2). Thus, the benefit from pooling under heavy-tailed
   demand uncertainty can be significantly lower than root n, which is
   predicted for normally distributed demands. We discuss the implications
   of this result on the performance of periodic-review policies in
   multiperiod inventory management, as well as for the profits associated
   with drop-shipping fulfillment strategies. Corroborated by an extensive
   simulation analysis with heavy-tailed distributions that arise
   frequently in practice, such as power law and log normal, our findings
   highlight the importance of taking into account the shape of the tail of
   demand uncertainty when considering a risk pooling initiative.

   and its profit. Our analysis reveals that stronger positive network
   effects, as well as noncooperation in the user base, drive the service
   into a more congested state and lead to increased profit for the service

AB We study the impact of service attributes (warranty length, after-sales
   service quality) on consumer demand in the U.S. automobile industry,
   examining the presence of complementarities/substitution between service
   attributes and product quality. Our results estimate a median
   willingness to pay for one year of a warranty of approximately $850,
   which is equivalent to 3.1% of the median vehicle price in our sample.
   We find that, for a car with median characteristics, the effect on
   consumer utility of a 1% price decrease is equivalent, all else being
   equal, to increasing product quality by 2.2%, and is in turn equivalent
   to increasing the warranty length by 8%. Our results also indicate that
   service attributes play a compensatory role with respect to product
   quality; i.e., the impact of warranty length and service quality on
   demand increases when product quality decreases. Conversely, both
   service metrics are complementary with respect to demand; i.e., the
   better the service quality, the higher the marginal effect of longer
   warranties. Our results thus imply that, in our period of analysis,
   warranties played a more important role for American firms than for
   foreign firms, consistent with the fact that American manufacturers
   exhibited lower product quality and higher service quality than
   non-American firms.

AB Managers and policy makers frequently face crucial strategic decisions
   that inevitably rely on judgments about relevant future events. These
   judgments are often characterized by very high uncertainty and the
   absence of experience from previous good or bad judgments. Judgments of
   other experts are oftentimes an important-sometimes the only-source of
   additional information to reduce uncertainty and improve judgment
   accuracy. However, in many practical situations, decision makers have
   very limited means to evaluate the quality of such "advice" from other
   experts and could tend to ignore this valid source of information. In
   this paper, we study what leads decision makers to take advice from an
   expert panel when judging the probability of far-future events with high
   economic impact. Our analysis is based on a unique data set that
   comprises more than 15,000 advice-taking decisions made by almost 1,000
   experts from different industries. We find that decision makers have a
   strong tendency to ignore advice, which pronounces even further when
   conflicts in terms of beliefs, past experiences, or desires arise.

   model as an industry standard. This paper applies the economic framework
   of incentive contracts to study how these pricing models can lead to
   risk sharing between the publisher and the advertiser and incentivize
   them to make efforts that improve the performance of online ads. We find
   that, compared with the CPC model, the CPA model can better incentivize
   the publisher to make efforts that can improve the purchase rate.
   However, the CPA model can cause an adverse selection problem: the
   winning advertiser tends to have a lower profit margin under the CPA
   model than under the CPC model. We identify the conditions under which
   the CPA model leads to higher publisher (or advertiser) payoffs than the
   CPC model. Whether publishers (or advertisers) prefer the CPA model over
   the CPC model depends on the advertisers' risk aversion, uncertainty in
   the product market, and the presence of advertisers with low immediate
   sales ratios. Our findings indicate a conflict of interest between
   publishers and advertisers in their preferences for these two pricing
   models. We further consider which pricing model offers greater social
   welfare.

AB When we engage in the process of division of labor, there are typically
   multiple alternatives, but insufficient knowledge to choose among them.
   Under such conditions, we propose that not all alternatives are equally
   likely to be pursued. In particular, when we engage in the process of
   division of labor for novel and nonrepetitive production, we argue that
   we display a tendency to perceive and select object-based task
   partitions over activity-based partitions. We experimentally investigate
   how the salience of objects over activities manifests itself in
   individuals and groups engaged in division of labor for the assembly of
   strongly or weakly decomposable products. We draw implications for
   organization design as well as the impact of technological change on
   organizations.

AB The McFadden Act of 1927 was one of the most hotly contested pieces of
   legislation in U.S. banking history, and its influence was felt over
   half a century later. This paper studies the congressional voting
   behavior surrounding the act's passage. We find that congressmen in
   districts in which landholdings were concentrated and credit was
   costlier were significantly more likely to oppose the act. The evidence
   suggests that whereas the law and the overall regulatory structure can
   shape the financial system far into the future, they themselves are
   likely to be shaped by elites, even in countries with benign political

AB Using novel data on employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), we show that
   aggregate purchases of company stock by lower-level employees predict
   future stock returns. Firms in the top quartile of ESPP purchases
   outperform those in the bottom quartile by 10% in the year after
   purchase. The relation between ESPP purchases and future stock returns
   is stronger for firms with high information asymmetry. Furthermore, we
   find that high ESPP purchases are associated with a lower likelihood of
   breaks in strings of consecutive earnings increases, as well as higher
   future sales growth and more innovation. These findings support the
   hypothesis that lower-level employees have information about future firm
   performance. We examine and reject a number of alternative explanations.
   Our results have implications for firms using employees as a source of
   capital, accounting issues related to expensing of equity-based
   compensation, and disclosure policy.

AB In the producer-seller relationship, the seller, besides his role of
   selling, is often in an ideal position to gather useful market
   information for the producer's operations planning. Incentive alignment
   is critical to motivate both information-acquisition and sales efforts.
   Two popular contract forms are investigated. One is the forecast-based
   contract (FC) that requires the seller to submit a demand forecast: the
   seller obtains commissions from the realized sales but is also obliged
   to pay a penalty for any deviation of the sales from the forecast. The
   other is the classical menu of linear contracts (MLC), from which the
   seller can choose a contract that specifies a unique commission rate and
   a fixed payment. The conventional understanding suggests that the MLC is
   superior, but it is often assumed that information is exogenously
   endowed. In contrast, we find that, with an endogenous
   information-acquisition effort, the MLC may suffer from a conflicted
   moral hazard effect that creates friction between motivations for the
   two efforts. The FC can, however, decouple these two tasks and thus
   dominate the MLC. We further find that when ensuring interim
   participation is necessary (e.g., renegotiation cannot be prevented
   after information acquisition), the performance of the FC might be
   affected by the adverse selection effect because it is unable to
   effectively separate different types, at which the MLC excels. We show
   that when the demand and supply mismatch cost is substantial, the
   conflicted moral hazard effect dominates the adverse selection effect,
   and the FC is more efficient, and it is the converse otherwise. These
   findings can enrich the understanding of these two contract forms and
   are useful for sales and operations planning.

AB We study how leader compensation affects public goods provision. We
   report from a lab experiment with four treatments, where the base
   treatment was a standard public goods game with simultaneous
   contribution decisions, and the three other treatments allowed
   participants to volunteer to be the leader in their group and make their
   contribution before the others. In the three leader treatments, we
   manipulated the level of compensation given to the leader. Our main
   finding is that a moderate compensation to the leader is beneficial; it
   increases the average contribution relative to both a situation where
   the leader is not compensated and a situation without a leader. A
   further increase in the leader compensation, however, is detrimental to
   public goods provision; it attracts more free riders and creates a
   social crowding-out effect. Finally, we report from a survey showing
   that the social crowding-out effect is also present in the population at
   large. We argue that the main findings of the paper are important in
   many real-life settings where we would like to use economic incentives

   benefits of such scientific boundary-spanning activities, including
   privileged access to academic information networks. However, scientific
   disclosure may lead to unintended knowledge spillovers. It remains

   This paper investigates the impact of scientific activities on the

   positive impact of scientific publications on a firm's market value

AB To better understand two large consumer segments, the boomers and the
   echo-boomers, we examine whether and why experts and novices from these
   two segments rely on attribute versus benefit information in product
   evaluations. In four studies, we show that expertise affects younger
   consumers, such that younger novices evaluate products more favorably
   when the descriptions feature benefit information, whereas younger
   experts evaluate products more favorably when the descriptions feature
   attribute information. However, both older novices and experts evaluate
   products described with benefit information more favorably than those
   described with attribute information. We further show that differences
   in the perceived diagnosticity of different types of information mediate
   the effects of expertise and age on product evaluations. We theorize
   that age differences in perceived diagnosticity occur because older and
   younger consumers spontaneously construe information in different ways.
   Therefore, age differences in the effect of expertise on evaluations
   should disappear when construal levels are controlled. Consistent with
   our hypotheses, we demonstrate that when primed to construe information
   at concrete levels, older consumers behave just like younger
   consumers-older experts formed more favorable evaluations toward
   products described with attribute information, but older novices formed
   more favorable evaluations toward products described with benefit
   information. When younger consumers are primed to construe information
   at abstract levels, they prefer products described with benefit
   information regardless of expertise, just like older consumers. We
   discuss the implications of our results for both researchers and
   practitioners.

   host of factors such as popularity of the topic and platform-level
   growth trends. The magnitude of the effect is large; content growth over
   an eight-year period would have been 45% lower in its absence. Our
   findings suggest that other open content production environments are
   likely to also benefit from similar cumulative growth effects. In the
   presence of such effects, managerial interventions that increase content
   are amplified because they trigger further contributions.

AB Resource assignment problems occur in a vast variety of applications,
   from scheduling problems over image recognition to communication
   networks. Often these problems can be modeled by a maximum weight
   matching problem in (bipartite) graphs or generalizations thereof, and
   efficient and practical algorithms are known for these problems.
   Although in some of the applications an assignment of the resources may
   be needed only once, in many of these applications, the assignment has
   to be computed more often for different scenarios. In that case it is
   often essential that the assignments can be computed very fast.
   Moreover, implementing different assignments in different scenarios may
   come with a certain cost for the reconfiguration of the system. In this
   paper, we consider the problem of determining optimal assignments
   sequentially over a given time horizon, where consecutive assignments
   are coupled by constraints that control the cost of reconfiguration. We
   develop fast approximation and online algorithms for this problem with
   provable approximation guarantees and competitive ratios. Moreover, we
   present an extensive computational study about the applicability of our
   model and our algorithms in the context of orthogonal frequency division
   multiple access (OFDMA) wireless networks, finding a significant
   performance improvement for the total bandwidth of the system using our
   algorithms. For this application (the downlink of an OFDMA wireless
   cell), the run time of matching algorithms is extremely important,
   having an acceptable range of a few milliseconds only. For the
   considered realistic instances, our algorithms perform extremely well:
   the solution quality is, on average, within a factor of 0.8-0.9 of
   optimal off-line solutions, and the running times are at most 5 ms per
   phase even in the worst case. Thus, our algorithms are well suited to be
   applied in the context of OFDMA systems.

AB The growth-optimal portfolio is designed to have maximum expected log
   return over the next rebalancing period. Thus, it can be computed with
   relative ease by solving a static optimization problem. The
   growth-optimal portfolio has sparked fascination among finance
   professionals and researchers because it can be shown to outperform any
   other portfolio with probability 1 in the long run. In the short run,
   however, it is notoriously volatile. Moreover, its computation requires
   precise knowledge of the asset return distribution, which is not
   directly observable but must be inferred from sparse data. By using
   methods from distributionally robust optimization, we design fixed-mix
   strategies that offer similar performance guarantees as the
   growth-optimal portfolio but for a finite investment horizon and for a
   whole family of distributions that share the same first-and second-order
   moments. We demonstrate that the resulting robust growth-optimal
   portfolios can be computed efficiently by solving a tractable conic
   program whose size is independent of the length of the investment
   horizon. Simulated and empirical backtests show that the robust
   growth-optimal portfolios are competitive with the classical
   growth-optimal portfolio across most realistic investment horizons and
   for an overwhelming majority of contaminated return distributions.

AB Customer impatience has become an integral component of analyzing
   services, especially in the context of call centers. Typically, when
   customers arrive to such systems, they seem identical or homogeneous;
   however, from the system's perspective, as they wait in the queue, their
   residual willingness to wait changes. For instance, a customer who has
   already waited for 10 minutes may have a different residual willingness
   to wait compared with a customer who has only waited for 1 minute. In
   this manner, as time progresses, customers become differentiated on
   their estimated patience levels. We exploit this dimension of customer
   heterogeneity to construct scheduling policies in overloaded systems
   that dynamically prioritize customers based on their time in queue to
   optimize any given system performance metric. Interestingly, the optimal
   policy has a very simple structure, and we find that implementing it can
   lead to significant improvements over the first-come, first-served
   policy.

AB In recent years, online retailers (also called e-tailers) have started
   allowing manufacturers direct access to their customers while charging a
   fee for providing this access, a format commonly referred to as agency
   selling. In this paper, we use a stylized theoretical model to answer a
   key question that e-tailers are facing: When should they use an agency
   selling format instead of using the more conventional reselling format?
   We find that agency selling is more efficient than reselling and leads
   to lower retail prices; however, the e-tailers end up giving control
   over retail prices to the manufacturer. Therefore, the reaction by the
   manufacturer, who makes electronic channel pricing decisions based on
   their impact on demand in the traditional channel (brick-and-mortar
   retailing), is an important factor for e-tailers to consider. We find
   that when sales in the electronic channel lead to a negative effect on
   demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer agency selling,
   whereas when sales in the electronic channel lead to substantial
   stimulation of demand in the traditional channel, e-tailers prefer
   reselling. This preference is mediated by competition between
   e-tailers-as competition between them increases, e-tailers prefer to use
   agency selling. We also find that when e-tailers benefit from positive
   externalities from the sales of the focal product (such as additional
   profits from sales of associated products), retail prices may be lower
   under reselling than under agency selling, and the e-tailers prefer
   reselling under some conditions for which they would prefer agency
   selling without the positive externalities.

   platforms for the solicitation of casual sex influences the incidence
   rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by race, gender,
   and socioeconomic status. Using a census of 12 million patients
   subjected to a natural experiment in Florida, we find a significant
   increase in HIV incidence after platform implementation, with the
   largest effect accruing to historically at-risk populations (i.e.,
   African Americans) despite documented lower rates of Internet
   utilization. Strikingly, our analysis reveals that HIV incidence
   increases in historically low-risk populations as well (e.g.,
   individuals of higher socioeconomic status) and that men and women
   experience similar penalties. Identifying granular effects across
   subpopulations allows us to offer additional insight into the mechanisms
   by which matching platforms increase HIV incidence. We estimate the
   cumulative effect of platform entry over the five-year period of the
   study as 1,149 additional Floridians contracting HIV at a cost of $710
   million.

   bank loans are available, and the failure of loan repayment leads to
   bankruptcy, where default costs may include variable (proportional to

   that simple contracts (e.g., revenue-sharing, buyback, and quantity
   discount) can coordinate and allocate profits arbitrarily in the chain.
   With only variable default costs, buyback contracts remain coordinating
   and equivalent to revenue-sharing contracts but are Pareto dominated by
   revenue-sharing contracts when fixed default costs are present. Thus,
   for general bankruptcy costs, contracts without buyback terms are of
   most interest. Quantity discount contracts fail to coordinate the supply
   chain, since a necessary condition for coordination is to proportionally
   reallocate debt obligations within the channel. With only variable
   default costs and with high fixed default costs exhibiting substantial
   economies-of-scale, revenue-sharing contracts with working capital
   coordination continue to coordinate the chain. Unexpectedly, for fixed
   default costs with small economies-of-scale effects, the two-firm system
   under a revenue-sharing contract with working capital coordination might
   have higher expected profit than the one-firm system. Our results
   provide support for the use of revenue-sharing contracts with working
   capital coordination for decentralized management of supply chains when
   there are bankruptcy risks and default costs.
