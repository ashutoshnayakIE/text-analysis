AB In this research, the authors examine the role of process versus outcome
   simulation in product evaluation and demonstrate how manipulating the
   type of information-processing mode (cognitive vs. affective) leads to
   unique effects in process and outcome simulation. The article begins
   with the premise that when consumers do not have well-formed preferences
   for a product, they tend to focus on the usage process. The authors
   predict and find that outcome simulation is more effective than process
   simulation in increasing product evaluation under a cognitive mode,
   whereas process simulation is more effective than outcome simulation
   under an affective mode. Establishing boundary conditions, the authors
   further show the effect of two important moderators that alter
   consumers' focus on/away from the product's usage process. Specifically,
   they show a reversal of the effect for each type of mental simulation
   for hedonic products, for which product benefits are the more salient
   aspect (vs. the usage process). Furthermore, a distant-future (vs.
   near-future) evaluation frame shifts people's focus away from the usage
   process toward product benefits and reverses the effect of each type of
   simulation. The authors conclude with a discussion of theoretical and
   managerial implications.

AB To date, research on no-choice options has primarily examined the
   conditions that foster choice deferral, thus focusing on the frequency
   with which consumers select the no-choice option. In this article, the
   authors argue that even if the no-choice option is not selected, its
   mere presence in the choice set may alter consumers' choices. More
   specifically, they investigate how decision processes and preferences
   change when consumers have a no-choice option versus when they are
   forced to choose from a given choice set. They propose that the
   inclusion of a no-choice option in a choice set affects preferences by
   leading consumers to determine not only which alternative is best, but
   which, if any, are acceptable (i.e., meet the consumer's minimum needs).
   Accordingly, the authors demonstrate that the inclusion of a no-choice
   option in the choice set (1) leads to more alternative- (rather than
   attribute-) based information processing, (2) increases the importance
   of attributes that are more meaningful when alternatives are evaluated
   one by one (i.e., enriched attributes), and (3) increases the importance
   of attributes with levels that are closer to the consumer's minimum
   needs (thresholds). They demonstrate that such changes influence
   consumers' preference structures and ultimate choices. They conclude
   with a discussion of the theoretical, methodological, and managerial
   implications of these findings.

AB Across five studies, the authors investigate how social identification
   influences consumer preference for discount-based promotions (i.e.,
   cents-off deals) versus donation-based promotions (in which purchase
   results in a donation to a charitable cause). In doing so, they
   demonstrate the interplay between self-construal and a specific social
   identity (i.e., that associated with the particular charity featured in
   a donation-based promotion) on consumers' preferences for these two
   types of promotions. The results show that, in general, consumers
   possessing interdependent self-construals prefer donations to a greater
   extent than those with independent self-construals. However, the
   findings further indicate that these effects of self-construal are
   attenuated if (1) the donation-based promotion does not involve a
   charity that is identity congruent or (2) a cause-congruent identity is
   more salient than self-construal at the time of decision making. The
   authors also identify boundary conditions of charity efficiency and
   product type for these self-construal effects. In addition to
   demonstrating how multiple identities interact to influence consumer
   promotion preferences, the authors discuss important managerial
   implications regarding the use of discount versus donation-based
   promotions.

AB Spending on political advertising has grown dramatically in recent
   years, and political campaigns have increasingly adopted the language
   and techniques of marketing. As such political marketing efforts
   proliferate, the factors that drive electoral success warrant greater
   attention and investigation. The authors employ a combination of
   laboratory studies and analysis of actual election results to reveal
   influences of candidate appearance and spending strategies in campaigns.
   They analyze how personality trait inferences based on candidate
   appearance interact with political party brand image, advertising
   spending, and negative advertising. The results indicate that
   appearance-based inferences about candidates influence election
   outcomes, but their impact is driven partially by trait associations at
   the party brand level. This interaction between appearance and party
   alters the effects of advertising spending, particularly the effects of
   negative advertising. The findings have implications for the marketing
   of political candidates in terms of their party's brand image.

AB When a new purchase involves trading in an old item, the prices of
   component transactions may be presented in different ways. The authors
   report three studies that examine how different price presentations
   influence evaluations and choice in an otherwise equivalent overall
   exchange. Although consumers play both buyer and seller roles in
   purchases involving trade-ins, the authors find that consumers'
   evaluation of the overall exchange typically places more weight on the
   price of the new purchase than the trade-in. However, they also show
   that the weights can be shifted systematically by (1) directly
   manipulating the importance of the trade-in and (2) indirectly priming a
   seller (vs. buyer) mind-set. In these instances, consumers place more
   weight on the trade-in price than the price of the new purchase.

AB The authors theorize that the inconsistencies in prior research
   regarding the relational behavior-performance relationship arise from
   the type of reciprocity the firm internalizes. The results of a
   longitudinal study of 284 buyer-supplier relationships indicate that
   relational behavior enhances financial performance when what is
   exchanged does not need to be directly comparable with what was received
   (i.e., heteromorphic equivalence reciprocity) or can be returned over a
   longer time horizon (i.e., long-term immediacy reciprocity). Moreover,
   relational behavior diminishes financial performance when what is
   exchanged must be directly comparable in form (i.e., homeomorphic
   equivalence reciprocity) or returned over a short time horizon (i.e.,
   short-term immediacy reciprocity). The authors further conclude that a
   longitudinal interaction effect model provides a more accurate
   understanding of the relational behavior-performance relationship when
   compared with a cross-sectional interaction effect model, because it
   minimizes the unobserved heterogeneity effect, thus strengthening causal
   inference.

AB Word of mouth (WOM) affects diffusion and sales, but why are certain
   products talked about more than others, both right after consumers first
   experience them and in the months that follow? This article examines
   psychological drivers of immediate and ongoing WOM. The authors analyze
   a unique data set of everyday conversations for more than 300 products
   and conduct both a large field experiment across various cities and a
   controlled laboratory experiment with real conversations. The results
   indicate that more interesting products get more immediate WOM but,
   contrary to intuition, do not receive more ongoing WOM over multiple
   months or overall. In contrast, products that are cued more by the
   environment or are more publicly visible receive more WOM both right
   away and over time. Additional analyses demonstrate which promotional
   giveaways in WOM marketing campaigns are associated with increased WOM.
   Overall, the findings shed light on psychological drivers of WOM and
   provide insight into designing more effective WOM campaigns.

AB Market structure analysis is a basic pillar of marketing research.
   Classic challenges in marketing such as pricing, campaign management,
   brand positioning, and new product development are rooted in an analysis
   of product substitutes and complements inferred from market structure.
   In this article, the authors present a method to support the analysis
   and visualization of market structure by automatically eliciting product
   attributes and brand's relative positions from online customer reviews.
   First, the method uncovers attributes and attribute dimensions using the
   "voice of the consumer," as reflected in customer reviews, rather than
   that of manufacturers. Second, the approach runs automatically. Third,
   the process supports rather than supplants managerial judgment by
   reinforcing or augmenting attributes and dimensions found through
   traditional surveys and focus groups. The authors test the approach on
   six years of customer reviews for digital cameras during a period of
   rapid market evolution. They analyze and visualize results in several
   ways, including comparisons with expert buying guides, a laboratory
   survey, and correspondence analysis of automatically discovered product
   attributes. The authors evaluate managerial insights drawn from the
   analysis with respect to proprietary market research reports from the
   same period analyzing digital imaging products.

AB This research documents an intriguing empirical phenomenon whereby
   states of relaxation increase the monetary valuation of products. The
   authors demonstrate this phenomenon in six experiments involving two
   methods of inducing relaxation, a large number of products of different
   types, and various methods of assessing monetary valuation. In all six
   experiments, participants who were put into a relaxed affective state
   reported higher monetary valuations than participants who were put into
   an equally pleasant but less relaxed state. This effect seems to be
   caused by differences in relaxed and nonrelaxed people's mental
   construals of the value of the products. Specifically, compared with
   less relaxed people, relaxed people seem to represent the value of
   products at a higher level of abstraction, which increases their
   perceptions of these products' value. The phenomenon appears to reflect
   an inflation of value by relaxed people rather than a deflation of value
   by less relaxed people.

AB This research investigates the process that underlies consumer decisions
   to abandon waits for service. The work centers on a hypothesis that
   stay-or-renege decisions reflect a process that blends two opposing
   psychic forces: escalating displeasure with waiting versus an escalating
   commitment to a wait that has been initiated. The consequence is a
   predicted tendency that abandonments are most likely near the midpoint
   of waits, which is suboptimal for many waiting time distributions. This
   study tests the hypothesis using data from three laboratory experiments
   in which participants play a time-management game that involves waiting
   for downloads from different computer servers, as well as field data
   about hang-ups in an emergency call center in India. The data lend
   support to the proposed competing hazards model and show that the
   trade-off between desires to abandon and persist is moderated by
   contextual factors, such as the initial number of alternative queues and
   the amount of distracting activity engaged in during a wait.

AB Few studies address the marketing budgeting problems of platform firms
   operating in two-sided markets with cross-market network effects, such
   that demand from one customer group in the platform influences the
   demand from the other customer group. Yet such firms (e.g., newspapers
   whose customers are both subscribers and advertisers) are prevalent in
   the marketplace and invest significantly in marketing. To enable such
   firms to make effective marketing decisions, the authors delineate the
   desired features of a platform firm's marketing response model, specify
   a new response model, and validate it using market data from a local
   newspaper. The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market
   effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments,
   and the model exhibits good forecasting capability. The authors use the
   estimated response model to determine optimal marketing investments over
   a finite planning horizon and find that the firm should significantly
   increase its newsroom and sales force investments. With this model-based
   recommendation, the firm's management increased its newsroom budget by
   18%. Further normative analysis sheds light on how cross-market and
   carryover effects alter classical one-sided marketing budgeting rules.

   authors show that under certain conditions, presenting a single savings
   goal leads to greater savings intention and actual savings than
   presenting multiple savings goals. Multiple goals typically evoke
   trade-offs among competing goals and thus increase the likelihood that
   people will remain in a deliberative mind-set and defer actions. In
   contrast, the authors propose and demonstrate that a single goal evokes
   a stronger implementation intention, which in turn has a greater effect
   on behavior change. They also show that the advantage of a single goal
   over multiple goals on saving is attenuated when saving is easier to

   competing among themselves. Theoretical and practical implications are

AB In four studies, the authors show that consumers' savings can be
   increased or decreased merely by changing the way consumers think about
   their saving goals. Consumers can (1) either specify or not specify an
   exact amount to save (goal specificity) and (2) focus on either how to
   save or why to save (construal level). The results illustrate that
   specific goals help consumers save more when the saving goal is
   construed at a high level but that nonspecific goals help consumers save
   more when the saving goal is construed at a low level. The same pattern
   of results occurs with anticipated saving success and actual savings.
   Mediation analyses reveal that for high-level construers, specific (vs.
   nonspecific) goals lead to success because they are perceived as more
   important. However, specific (vs. nonspecific) goals are also perceived
   as more difficult, which is more discouraging for low-level construers.

AB The U.S. motion picture industry has become increasingly reliant on

   are cross-channel substitution among posttheatrical channels and
   seasonality in consumer preferences for any movie. The authors use a
   differentiated products version of the multiplicative competitive
   interaction model to investigate these two phenomena. They estimate the
   model using data from 2000 and 2001 on two posttheatrical channels in
   the U.S. market: purchase and rental home viewing channels. Contrary to
   expectations based on business press commentary, after controlling for
   seasonality and movie attributes, the authors find low cross-channel
   price and availability elasticity for both channels. To measure the
   extent of cross-channel cannibalization, they simulate a 28-day window
   of sequential release with either purchase or rental channel going
   first. They find that windowing reduces the sum of revenues across both
   channels, because more consumers choose to not purchase or rent when
   faced with older movies in their favored channel rather than to switch
   to the alternative channel with newer movies.

AB Marketers struggle with how best to position innovative products that
   are incongruent with consumer expectations. Compounding the issue, many
   incongruent products are the result of innovative changes in product
   form intended to increase hedonic appeal. Crossing various product
   categories with various positioning tactics in a single meta-analytic
   framework, the authors find that positioning plays an important role in
   how consumers evaluate incongruent form. The results demonstrate that
   when a product is positioned on functional dimensions, consumers show
   more preferential evaluations for moderately incongruent form than for
   congruent form. However, when a product is positioned on experiential
   dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for congruent
   form than for moderately incongruent form. Importantly, an increase in
   perceived hedonic benefits mediates the former, whereas a decrease in
   perceived utilitarian benefits mediates the latter. The mediation
   effects are consistent with the view that consumers must first
   understand a product's functionality before engaging in hedonic
   consumption.

AB How does a rumor come to be believed as a fact as it spreads across a
   chain of consumers? This research proposes that because consumers'
   certainty about their beliefs (e.g., attitudes, opinions) is less
   salient than the beliefs themselves, certainty information is more
   susceptible to being lost in communication. Consistent with this idea,
   the current studies reveal that though consumers transmit their core
   beliefs when they communicate with one another, they often fail to
   transmit their certainty or uncertainty about those beliefs. Thus, a
   belief originally associated with high uncertainty (certainty) tends to
   lose this uncertainty (certainty) across communications. The authors
   demonstrate that increasing the salience of consumers'
   uncertainty/certainty when communicating or receiving information can
   improve uncertainty/certainty communication, and they investigate the
   consequences for rumor management and word-of-mouth communications.

   smaller, sooner over larger, later monetary rewards (Studies 2b, 3, and

   preferences through activation of approach motivation. The effect of
   bodily actions on present-biased preferences is regulated by the
   behavioral approach system (Studies 3 and 4) and relies on the learned
   association between arm flexion and activation of this approach system
   (Study 4). The authors discuss implications for intertemporal decision
   making, embodied cognition, and marketing practice.

AB The authors explore the interplay between consumers' progress levels
   toward attaining a goal and the perceived velocity in progressing toward
   the goal to determine consumers' motivation for further goal pursuit.
   The authors propose that when progress toward attaining a goal is low,
   consumers are primarily concerned about the question "Can I get there?"
   Thus, a high (vs. low) perceived velocity in progressing suggests
   greater expectations of goal attainment, resulting in greater motivation
   for pursuing the goal. However, when consumers have achieved sufficient
   progress and are approaching the end point, their attainment of the goal
   is relatively secured, so they become more concerned about the question
   "When will I get there?" and focus more on whether they are effectively
   reducing the remaining discrepancy so that they can attain the goal
   quickly. In this case, a low (vs. high) perceived velocity in
   progressing elicits greater motivation because it suggests that
   continued effort is needed to ensure a speedy attainment. Empirical
   evidence from lab and field experiments supports this hypothesis.

   generated from sponsored search. Their approach uses data generated
   through a field experiment for several keywords from an online
   retailer's ad campaign. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, the authors
   measure the impact of ad placement on both click-through and conversion
   rates. They find that while click-through rate decreases with position,
   conversion rate increases with position and is even higher for more
   specific keywords. The net effect is that, contrary to the conventional
   wisdom in the industry, the topmost position is not necessarily the
   revenue-or profit-maximizing position. The authors' results inform the
   advertising strategies of firms participating in sponsored search
   auctions and provide insight into consumer behavior in these

   misunderstanding among advertisers regarding the value of the top
   position. Furthermore, they reveal potential inefficiencies in current
   auction mechanisms that search engines use. The authors' results also
   reveal the information search strategies that consumers use in sponsored

AB Technological advances enable companies to offer information products
   such as books, music, and movies in electronic formats, in addition to
   the traditional physical formats. Although one format may appear more
   useful and be preferred, consumers may be enticed to consider the unique
   attributes of all formats if they deliver equally well on salient
   attributes. The authors investigate the impact of usage situations,
   relative attribute quality levels of the formats and their interactions
   on the perception of the formats as perfect or imperfect substitutes or
   complements, and the purchase likelihood of the bundle of formats. The
   study demonstrates that when formats have equivalent quality on a
   salient attribute, consumers perceive the formats as more complementary
   and are more likely to buy the bundle. This happens because consumers
   consider more usage situations for the formats and view the bundle as
   providing greater flexibility for future usages.

AB This article develops a method for optimal allocation of resources based
   on an empirically validated model of how national and regional
   advertising generate sales over time. The authors derive the
   profit-maximizing total budget, its optimal split between national and
   regional spends, and its optimal allocation across multiple regions.
   They formulate a spatiotemporal model that accounts for spatial and
   serial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, neighborhood effects, and
   sales dynamics. Because of spatial and serial dependence, correlated
   multivariate Brownian motion drives the sales dynamics, resulting in a
   second-order differential equation for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
   equation with multiple states (i.e., regional sales) and multiple
   controls (i.e., regional and national advertising expenditures). By
   solving the HJB equation analytically, the authors furnish closed-form
   expressions for the optimal total budget and its regional allocations.
   In addition, they develop a method to estimate the proposed model and
   apply it to market data from a leading German cosmetics company. Using
   the estimated parameters, they evaluate the optimal budget and
   allocations. Comparing them with actual company policy, the proposed
   approach enhances profit by 5.07%, and it not only identifies which
   regions under-or overspend but also reveals how much budget to shift
   from national to regional advertising (or vice versa).

   authors propose that temptation entails not only costs but also benefits
   for consumers. These arise from self-signaling effects of how consumers
   handle tempting choice options. Succumbing to temptation is a (costly)
   self-signal of weak willpower, whereas resisting temptation is a
   (beneficial) self-signal of strong willpower. Five experiments
   demonstrate that these self-signaling costs and benefits of temptation
   depend not only on the chosen item but also on the temptation from the
   nonchosen options. The authors discuss theoretical implications of their
   findings for research on impulsive choice and self-control and on

AB In juxtaposition to the common belief that marketing cues highlighting
   product effectiveness will generate positive influences on consumer
   demand, the authors argue that signaling effectiveness is a double-edged
   sword. While effectiveness cues may increase initial purchase, they can
   curb postpurchase consumption and potentially decrease long-term product
   sales. Four studies demonstrate that salient cues in advertising or
   packaging (e.g., pictures, brand names) can increase perceived product
   efficacy and lead to a lower usage amount on a single occasion. The
   authors show that the impact of effectiveness cues on product usage is
   driven by inference making and is moderated by cue salience and people's
   need for cognition. Furthermore, the authors find that promoting
   effectiveness with certain cues does not increase product choice yet
   reduces product usage. These results stress the importance of seeking
   salient cues that work to stimulate both choice and usage.

   this article reports evidence from three controlled experiments and one
   natural experiment that people are prepared to pay more for high-quality
   products and less for low-quality products when they are considered in
   the context of a dense, as opposed to a sparse, set of alternatives. To
   explain this effect, the authors argue that consumers uncertain about
   the importance of quality learn from observing market outcomes. Product
   proliferation reveals that other consumers care to discriminate among
   similar alternatives, and in turn, this inference raises the importance
   of quality in decision making.

AB The authors conduct an empirical investigation of a new retail loyalty
   program (LP), called an item-based loyalty program (IBLP), in which
   price discounts are replaced by reward point promotions that need to be
   accumulated and redeemed later. The main objective is to examine its
   impact on various aspects of consumer purchase behavior and a retailer's
   sales revenue. They find that after a retailer switched from a
   conventional LP to the IBLP, consumers became more responsive to reward
   point promotions than to price discounts of the same monetary value,
   were no longer responsive to competitors' reward point promotions, and
   exhibited stronger cumulative reward point effects. In addition, the new
   LP had a significantly different impact on "current" LP members and
   nonmembers (defined by their status right before the switch), resulting
   in decreased (increased) total spending by the former (latter) group,
   under the retailer's current promotion practice. Furthermore, it is
   critically important for retailers to offer sufficient promotions under
   the new LP to achieve its full potential; otherwise, they risk
   alienating their loyal customers. Finally, the IBLP reduced attrition
   among existing customers and attracted more new customers, which
   contributed to most of the retailer's sales revenue gain after adopting
   the IBLP.

AB For many services, customers subscribe to long-term contracts. Standard
   economic theory suggests that customers evaluate a contract on the basis
   of its overall net benefits. The authors suggest that rather than
   evaluating multiperiod service contracts at the contract level,
   customers use period-level bracketing. Customers evaluate the distinct
   per-period loss or gain they incur from choosing this contract. This has
   important consequences when benefits vary over the course of the
   contract-for example, due to "hassle costs." If customers use
   period-level bracketing, they will value a lower price more in periods
   during which they have hassle than in other periods. The authors explore
   this using data from a field experiment for web hosting services. They
   find that a lower price in the initial period is more attractive to
   customers when they expect their hassle costs to be high at setup. In
   five lab experiments, the authors support and extend the field
   experiment's findings. They find evidence for period-level bracketing
   when customers have hassle costs, independently of whether hassle costs
   occur in the first, an intermediate, or the last period of a contract.
   They also rule out alternative explanations, such as hyperbolic
   discounting. The findings suggest that in setting prices, firms should
   consider the timing of hassle costs customers face.

AB In this study, the authors investigate the role of advertising in
   affecting the extent of bias in the media. When making advertising
   choices, advertisers evaluate both the size and the composition of the
   readership of the different outlets. The profile of the readers matters
   because advertisers want to target readers who are likely to be
   receptive to their advertising messages. The authors demonstrate that
   when advertising supplements subscription fees, it may serve as a
   polarizing or moderating force, contingent on the extent of
   heterogeneity among advertisers in appealing to readers having different
   political preferences. When heterogeneity is large, each advertiser
   chooses a single outlet for placing advertisements (single-homing), and
   greater polarization arises in comparison to when the media outlet
   relies on subscription fees only for revenues. In contrast, when
   heterogeneity is small, each advertiser chooses to place advertisements
   in multiple outlets (multihoming) and reduces polarization results.

AB Why are certain pieces of online content (e.g., advertisements, videos,
   news articles) more viral than others? This article takes a
   psychological approach to understanding diffusion. Using a unique data
   set of all the New York Times articles published over a three-month
   period, the authors examine how emotion shapes virality. The results
   indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but
   the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex
   than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological
   arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative
   (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes
   low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral.
   These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising,
   interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are
   positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention
   (e.g., how prominently content was featured). Experimental results
   further demonstrate the causal impact of specific emotion on
   transmission and illustrate that it is driven by the level of activation
   induced. Taken together, these findings shed light on why people share
   content and how to design more effective viral marketing campaigns.

   following Wal-Mart market entry. The data contain information on
   supplier interactions with retail stores, including Wal-Mart, for a

   increased by 18% on average, whereas profits derived from incumbent
   retailers decreased only marginally. Their results show that wholesale
   prices are not the main driver of postentry supplier profit changes;
   market expansion is. They observe a significant increase in shipments to
   50% of markets studied. Furthermore, their analyses demonstrate that
   supplier shipment and profit increases are highest for markets in which
   incumbents offer a wide variety of products and carry items that

   They assessed concentration of attention through eye tracking and viewer
   retention by recording zapping behavior. This allows tests of
   predictions about the interplay of these emotions and interperson
   attention differences at each point in time during exposure. Surprise
   and joy effectively concentrate attention and retain viewers. However,
   importantly, the level rather than the velocity of surprise affects
   attention concentration most, whereas the velocity rather than the level
   of joy affects viewer retention most. The effect of joy is asymmetric,
   with higher gains for increases than losses for decreases. Using these

   behavior. The first set investigates how divulgence is affected by
   signals about others' readiness to divulge and shows a "herding" effect:
   Survey respondents are more willing to divulge sensitive information
   when told that previous respondents have made sensitive disclosures
   (Study 1a). The authors provide evidence of the process underlying this
   effect and rule out alternative explanations by showing that information
   on others' propensity to disclose affects respondents' discomfort
   associated with divulgence (Study lb) but not their interpretation of
   the questions (Study 1c). The second set of studies investigates how
   divulgence is affected by the order in which inquiries of varying
   intrusiveness are made and suggests that divulgence is anchored by the
   initial questions in a survey. People are particularly likely to divulge
   when questions are presented in decreasing order of intrusiveness and
   less likely when questions are presented in increasing order (Study 2a).
   The authors show that the effect arises by affecting people's judgments
   of the intrusiveness of the inquiries (Study 2b). The effect is altered
   when, at the outset of the study, privacy concerns are primed (Study 2c)
   and when respondents are made to consider the relative intrusiveness of
   a different set of questions (Study 2d). This research helps illuminate
   how consumers' propensity to disclose is affected by continual streams
   of requests for personal information and by the equally unavoidable
   barrage of personal information about others.

AB The author proposes a strategic model of entry that allows for positive
   and negative spillovers among firms. The model is applied to a novel
   data set containing information about the store configurations of all
   U.S. regional shopping centers and is used to quantify the magnitude of
   interstore spillovers. The author addresses the estimation difficulties
   that arise due to the presence of multiple equilibria by formulating the
   entry game as a mathematical problem with equilibrium constraints
   (MPEC). Although this study constitutes the first attempt to use this
   direct optimization approach to address a specific empirical problem,
   the method can be used in a wide range of structural estimation
   problems. The empirical results support the agglomeration and clustering
   theories that predict that firms may have incentives to colocate despite
   potential business stealing effects. The author shows that the firms'
   negative and positive strategic effects help predict both how many firms
   can operate profitably in a given market and the firm-type
   configurations. The relative magnitude of such effects varies
   substantially across store types.

AB It is well established that consumers' evaluations of brand extensions
   depend on the quality of the parent brand and the fit between that brand
   and the extension category. The authors propose that the relative
   importance of these two factors is influenced by two key features of a
   typical shopping environment: the presence of visual information and the
   availability of comparison brands. In particular, the authors
   demonstrate that adding pictures and enabling brand comparisons shift
   consumers' preference from extensions of better-fitting brands to
   extensions of higher-quality brands. The authors propose that this
   occurs because pictures and brand comparisons create a more concrete
   representation of the extension, which in turn increases the importance
   of parent brand quality relative to brand extension fit. They provide
   support for this underlying mechanism and discuss the practical
   implications of their findings.

AB A common strategy for controlling spending is to impose a price
   restraint on oneself. For example, a consumer who is concerned with
   limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only
   wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although
   conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will
   decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price
   restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced,
   high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint
   salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price
   and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between
   options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus,
   while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by
   eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research
   suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing
   consumers' spending relative to a situation in which consumers have not
   imposed a price restraint.

AB While some researchers view private labels (PLs) as a key tool for
   retailer differentiation, others imply that consumers do not distinguish
   between PLs of different chains. This debate raises the question: Do a
   retail chain's PL investments subsidize rival PLs? In addition, how does
   this affect their choice share vis-a-vis national brands? The authors
   investigate whether consumers generalize knowledge from product
   experience across PLs of different retail chains and whether such
   cross-brand learning depends on the PL brands' link with the chain name
   or on their quality differences. The proposed brand choice model
   captures cross-brand learning through quality perception spillovers
   (consumers adjust beliefs about PL quality on the basis of consumption
   experience) and familiarity spillovers (uncertainty about a PL
   diminishes with rival PL consumption). Household scanner panel data on
   dish soap and breakfast cereals yield clear evidence of cross-retailer
   learning among standard PLs, regardless of their name or quality
   differences. The results also reveal that familiarity spillovers
   dominate quality-level spillovers, implying that the presence of
   cross-learning benefits PLs and enhances their market position relative
   to national brands. The authors conclude with a discussion of managerial
   implications.

AB Grounded in agency theory, this study examines how franchisors' ex ante
   contracts and extracontractual incentives influence their ex post
   monitoring and enforcement efforts and how combinations of the ex post
   governance mechanisms drive franchisee behavior. Integrating three
   archival data sources and a survey of 206 franchisees across eight
   automotive brands, the authors find that franchisor reliance on
   contractual completeness appears to result in reduced ex post behavior
   monitoring and enforcement efforts, while contractual one-sidedness is
   associated with higher levels of behavior monitoring but reduced
   enforcement. Extracontractual incentives, when offered to the
   franchisee, are associated with increases in monitoring and enforcement.
   In isolation, franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts are
   ineffective in eliciting desired franchisee behaviors. However,
   different combinations of franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts
   affect franchisee compliance and opportunism, sometimes with
   counterproductive results. The study provides an initial baseline of
   understanding on how ex ante governance characteristics and combinations
   of ex post governance mechanisms function to facilitate or deter

AB This article examines how a common form of decision assistance
   recommendations that present products in order of their predicted
   attractiveness to a consumer transforms decision processes during
   product search. Such recommendations induce a shift in consumers'
   decision orientation in search from being directed at whether additional
   alternatives should be inspected to identifying the best alternative
   among those already encountered, which is common when choosing from
   predetermined sets of alternatives. That is, recommendations cause
   consumers to search in "choice mode." Evidence from three studies
   provides support for such a transformation of search decisions, which
   manifests itself in two respects. First, compared with unassisted
   search, recommendations lead consumers to assess a product they
   encounter in their search by comparing it less with the best one
   discovered up to that point and more with other previously inspected
   alternatives. Second, recommendations transform how variability in
   product attractiveness affects stopping decisions such that greater
   variability causes consumers to search less, which is contrary to what
   is commonly observed in search without recommendations.

   in an online community leads consumers to believe that they will receive
   help or support from other members should difficulties arise. Such a
   perception leads online community participants to make riskier financial
   decisions than nonparticipants. The authors also discover a boundary
   condition to the effect: Online community members are more risk seeking
   only when they have relatively strong ties with other members; when ties

AB The authors present a general consumer preference model for experience
   products that overcomes the limitations of consumer choice models,
   especially when it is not easy to consider some qualitative attributes
   of a product or when there are too many attributes relative to the
   available amount of preference data, by capturing the effects of
   unobserved product attributes with the residuals of reference consumers
   for the same product. They decompose the deterministic component of
   product utility into two parts: that accounted for by observed
   attributes and that due to nonobserved attributes. The authors estimate
   the unobserved component by relating it to the corresponding residuals
   of virtual experts representing homogeneous groups of people who
   experienced the product earlier and evaluated it. Their methodology
   involves identifying such virtual experts and determining the relative
   importance they should be given in the estimation of the target person's
   residuals. Using Bayesian estimation methods and Markov chain Monte
   Carlo simulation inference, the authors apply their approach to two
   types of consumer preference data: (1) online consumer ratings (stated
   preferences) data for Internet recommendation services and (2) off line
   consumer viewership (revealed preferences) data for movies. The results
   empirically show that this new approach outperforms several alternative
   collaborative filtering and attribute-based preference models with both
   in- and out-of-sample fits. The model is applicable to both Internet
   recommendation services and consumer choice studies.

AB The authors present a modeling approach to assess the purchase
   conversion performance of individual keywords in paid search
   advertising. The model facilitates estimation of daily keyword
   conversion and click-through rates in a sparse data environment while
   accounting for the endogenous position of the text advertisement served
   in response to a search. Position endogeneity in paid search data can
   arise from both omitted variables and measurement error. The authors
   propose a latent instrumental variable approach to address this problem.
   They estimate their model on keyword-level paid search data containing
   daily information on impressions, clicks, and reservations for a major
   lodging chain. They find that higher positions increase both the
   click-through and conversion rates. When advertisements are served in
   higher positions, approximately one-third of new conversions is due to
   increased click-through while approximately two-thirds are due to
   increased conversion rates. The authors show that the keyword list
   generated on the basis of their estimated conversion rates outperforms
   the status quo list as well as lists generated by observed conversion

AB The diversification effect, a tendency toward greater variety as
   multiple choices are made simultaneously, in advance of consumption, is
   a robust and important phenomenon. Researchers have typically explained
   the diversification effect in terms of differences in the process by
   which people select items from among those available. This precludes the
   possibility that the locus of the effect lies in people's choice sets
   themselves that is, how people decide which options to consider when
   making choices. The authors examine the effects of set formation using
   an experimental choice sequence task and conjoined stochastic model of
   set formation and conditional choice. The findings demonstrate that set
   formation plays a critical role in diversification: Previously chosen
   options are indeed discounted, but only for simultaneous choices and
   only in the set formation portion of the model. Furthermore, the
   expected number of choice set items is substantially greater in
   multiple-versus single-item choice. Specifically, when consumers choose
   simultaneously, choice set sizes appear relatively larger overall, but
   the previously chosen item is less likely to be in a person's (latent)
   choice set. These findings cannot be attributed to alternative patterns
   of covariation, including latent error correlations; to temporal
   stochastic inflation; or to unobserved heterogeneity.

AB Consumers spontaneously construct attributions for negative events such
   as product-harm crises. Base-rate information influences these
   attributions. The research findings suggest that for brands with
   positive prior beliefs, a high (vs. low) base rate of product-harm
   crises leads to less blame if the crisis is said to be similar to others
   in the industry (referred to as the "discounting effect"). However, in
   the absence of similarity information, a low (vs. high) base rate of
   crises leads to less blame toward the brand (referred to as the
   "subtyping effect"). For brands with negative prior beliefs, the extent
   of blame attributed to the brand is unaffected by the base-rate and
   similarity information. Importantly, the same base-rate information may
   have a different effect on the attribution of a subsequent crisis
   depending on whether discounting or subtyping occurred in the
   attribution of the first crisis. Consumers who discount a first crisis
   also tend to discount a second crisis for the same brand, whereas
   consumers who subtype a first crisis are unlikely to subtype again.

AB The author examines conditions under which one firm's product line
   expansion can cause all firms to be more profitable in horizontally
   differentiated markets. Although a firm's profits might be expected to
   decrease when a competitor expands its product line because the firm
   loses some sales to the new product, this intuition is incomplete
   because a competitor's product line expansion can also soften price
   competition. The author first provides an example using the Hotel ling
   model that demonstrates the possibility and mechanism of
   profit-increasing competitor entry. He then presents conditions under
   which a competitor's product line expansion increases profits under the
   mixed-logit model. The study demonstrates that firms benefit from a
   rival's entry most when a moderate number of customers are unserved
   before the new-product introduction and when the new product is
   positioned such that both the rivals' products appeal to similar sets of
   customers. With regard to extensions, this study demonstrates that the
   result continues to hold when firms choose product attributes
   endogenously and that a manufacturer's profits can increase from a
   rival's product line expansion even when the firms sell through a
   retailer.

AB When viewing advertisements, consumers must decide what to believe and
   what is meant to deceive. Accordingly, much behavioral research has
   explored strategies and outcomes of how consumers process persuasive
   messages that vary in perceived sincerity. New neuroimaging methods
   enable researchers to augment this knowledge by exploring the cognitive
   mechanisms underlying such processing. The current study collects
   neuroimaging data while participants are exposed to advertisements with
   differing levels of perceived message deceptiveness (believable,
   moderately deceptive, and highly deceptive). The functional magnetic
   resonance imaging data, combined with an additional behavioral study,
   offer evidence of two noteworthy results. First, confirming multistage
   frameworks of persuasion, the authors observe two distinct stages of
   brain activity: (1) precuneus activation at earlier stages and (2)
   superior temporal sulcus and temporal-parietal junction activation at
   later stages. Second, the authors observe disproportionately greater
   brain activity associated with claims that are moderately deceptive than
   those that are either believable or highly deceptive. These results
   provoke new thinking about what types of claims garner consumer
   attention and which consumers may be particularly vulnerable to
   deceptive advertising.

AB Three laboratory experiments explore how alternative brand name
   structures (i.e., family branded or subbranded) and varying degrees of
   category similarity (i.e., similar or dissimilar) influence extension
   evaluations and parent brand dilution. The results indicate that
   subbranded extensions (e.g., Quencher by Tropicana cola) evoke a slower,
   more thoughtful subtyping processing strategy than family branded
   extensions (e.g., Tropicana cola), which evoke a faster, category-based
   processing strategy. As a result, category similarity affects extension
   evaluations when the extension is family branded but not when it is
   subbranded. In addition, dilution effects are only evident when
   consumers have a negative experience with a similar family branded
   extension. Subbranding thus offers two key benefits to marketers: It
   both enhances extension evaluations and protects the parent brand from

   product innovation has become one of the strongest weapons in the

   assesses when and to what extent new products change NBs' market
   position. To address this question, more than 300 NB and PL
   introductions are analyzed using a multibreak model that quantifies the
   impact of product introductions on own share, rival NB and PL share, and
   category sales. Drawing on empirical generalizations, the author finds
   that products introduced by leading NBs, standard PLs, and premium PLs
   are more likely to increase category sales than products introduced by
   follower NBs or economy PLs. New products introduced by leader and
   follower NBs more often boost own share. Thus, new products help prevent
   the decline of NB shares. With respect to competitive impact, new
   products affect rival shares, with the exception of those launched by
   economy PLs. Still, NBs tend to hurt rival NBs more often than PLs, and
   only the leading NB is likely to steal share from all three PL tiers.
   Moreover, standard PLs tend to be harmed less often by rival new
   products, unless introduced by the leading NB. Overall, PLs are more
   likely to be affected by a NB that maintains a large price gap and
   offers new products with new intrinsic or usage benefits. To fight
   economy PLs successfully, however, NBs must maintain a smaller price
   gap, while offering products that focus less on intrinsic and usage
   benefits.

AB Many firms rely on choice experiment based models to evaluate future
   marketing actions under various market conditions. This research
   investigates choice complexity (i.e., number of alternatives, number of
   attributes, and utility similarity between the most attractive
   alternatives) and individual differences in decision time as key factors
   that affect the predictive performance of models based on choice
   experiments, both within and between complexity conditions. The results
   show that complexity and individual decision time not only affect the
   error in consumer choice models but also consumers' decision strategy
   and systematic utilities. The authors introduce a complexity-adjusted
   mixed logit (CAM logit) model to capture the various influences of
   complexity in choice experiment based models. They illustrate the
   consequences of complexity on choice behavior with market share
   predictions of the CAM logit model for different complexity conditions.

AB Previous research on word of mouth (WOM) has presented inconsistent
   evidence on whether consumers are more inclined to share positive or
   negative information about products and services. Some findings suggest
   that consumers are more inclined to engage in positive WOM, whereas
   others suggest that consumers are more inclined to engage in negative
   WOM. The present research offers a theoretical perspective that provides
   a means to resolve these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically,
   the authors compare the generation of WOM (i.e., consumers sharing
   information about their own experiences) with the transmission of WOM
   (i.e., consumers passing on information about experiences they heard
   occurred to others). They suggest that a basic human motive to
   self-enhance leads consumers to generate positive WOM (i.e., share
   information about their own positive consumption experiences) but
   transmit negative WOM (i.e., pass on information they heard about
   others' negative consumption experiences). The authors present evidence
   for self-enhancement motives playing out in opposite ways for WOM
   generation versus WOM transmission across four experiments.

AB The authors propose a multicategory model of consumers' purchase
   incidence, quantity, and brand choice decisions. The model specification
   allows for cross-category promotion effects in both components of the
   primary demand (incidence and quantity decisions) and uses a flexible
   functional form of consumer's utility to accurately measure those
   cross-category effects. To demonstrate the importance of the
   methodology, the authors investigate two issues of relevance to
   retailers, namely, how retailers should (1) allocate promotional
   expenditures across brands in a category and (2) coordinate timing of
   promotions of brands across categories. The authors estimate the
   proposed model using consumers' purchases in pasta sauce and pasta
   categories. The results reveal that using restrictive functional forms
   of utilities or ignoring cross-category effects in incidence and
   quantity decisions leads to incorrect assessments on relative allocation
   of promotional expenditures across brands. Furthermore, retailers are
   better off contemporaneously promoting brands across the two categories
   than promoting them in different periods, and ignoring cross-category
   effects in quantity decisions leads to the opposite inference, namely,
   that retailers are better off promoting brands across the two categories
   in different periods.

AB Online content and products are presented as product networks, in which
   nodes are product pages linked by hyperlinks. These links are typically
   algorithmically induced recommendations based on aggregated data.
   Recently, websites have begun to offer social networks and
   user-generated links alongside the product network, creating a
   dual-network structure. The authors investigate the role of this
   dual-network structure in facilitating content exploration. They analyze
   You Tube's dual network and show that user pages have unique structural
   properties and act as content brokers. Next, the authors show that
   random rewiring of the product network cannot replicate this brokering
   effect. They present seven Internet studies in which participants
   browsing a You Tube-based website are exposed to different conditions of
   recommendations. The first set of studies shows that exposure to the
   dual network results in a more efficient (time to desirable outcome) and
   more effective (average product rating, overall satisfaction)
   exploration process. The next set of studies extends the previous ones
   to include dynamic structures, in which the network changes as a
   function of time or in response to participants' satisfaction.
   Furthermore, the results are replicated using data from another content

AB Firms in many industries release new products in sequential stages. They
   also launch separate advertising campaigns at each distribution stage.
   Thus, communication mix elements advertising and word of mouth (WOM) can
   play important, distinct, and yet interdependent roles in stimulating
   new product demand. Their effectiveness may fluctuate within and across
   stages and spill over from earlier to later stages. Thus, the authors
   construct a dynamic linear model to study the dynamic effects of
   advertising and WOM on demand for heterogeneous products across stages.
   They further apply the model to examine a canonical example, the
   theater-then-video sequential distribution of motion pictures, and
   estimate the parameters using Kalman filtering/smoothing and Markov
   chain Monte Carlo methods. The results show that advertising and WOM
   exert dynamic, yet diverse, influences on demand for new products. For
   example, while increased ad spending is more effective at an earlier
   stage due to repetition wear-in and synergy with WOM, increased WOM
   activities at a later stage could become more powerful in driving
   demand. Subsequent optimization exercises suggest that films of varied
   characteristics can potentially re-allocate their advertising budgets
   and reap additional revenues.

AB The question of how people should structure goal-directed activity to
   maximize the likelihood of goal attainment is one of theoretical and
   practical significance. In particular, should people begin by attempting
   relatively easy tasks or more difficult ones? How might these differing
   strategies affect the likelihood of completing the overarching goal? The
   authors examine this question in the context of an important goal for a
   large number of consumers getting out of debt. Using a data set obtained
   from a debt settlement firm, they find that (1) closing debt accounts is
   predictive of debt elimination regardless of the dollar balance of the
   closed accounts, whereas (2) the dollar balance of closed accounts is
   not predictive of debt elimination when controlling for balance of
   accounts closed. These findings suggest that completing discrete
   subtasks might motivate consumers to persist in pursuit of a goal. The
   authors discuss implications for goal pursuit generally and for consumer
   debt management specifically.

AB Out-of-stock (OOS) is commonly observed in the retail environment with
   consumer packaged goods, but there have been few empirical studies of
   the effects of OOS on consumer product choice, because there is a lack
   of OOS information during households' purchase occasions. The authors
   study the effects of OOS on consumer stockkeeping unit (SKU) preference
   and price sensitivity, using a unique data set from multiple consumer
   packaged goods categories with information on recurring OOS incidents.
   They obtain several substantive findings: (1) Consumers' price
   sensitivity tends to be underestimated when OOS is not accounted for in
   a discrete choice model; (2) for consumers who have shorter
   interpurchase time, their preference for a SKU is attenuated when it is
   frequently OOS; and (3) for consumers who purchase from a small number
   of SKUs, their preference for a SKU is reinforced when facing OOS of
   other similar SKUs, whereas it is attenuated when facing OOS of other
   similar and also frequently purchased SKUs. The authors also illustrate
   that their findings can help retailers evaluate the effect of OOS on
   category revenue and predict time-varying market shares of SKUs in
   periods following OOS incidents.

AB Trendspotting has become an important marketing intelligence tool for
   identifying and tracking general tendencies in consumer interest and
   behavior. Currently, trendspotting is done either qualitatively by trend
   hunters, who comb through everyday life in search of signs indicating
   major shifts in consumer needs and wants, or quantitatively by analysts,
   who monitor individual indicators, such as how many times a keyword has
   been searched, blogged, or tweeted online. In this study, the authors
   demonstrate how the latter can be improved by uncovering common
   trajectories hidden behind the coevolution of a large array of
   indicators. The authors propose a structural dynamic factor-analytic
   model that can be applied for simultaneously analyzing tens or even
   hundreds of time series, distilling them into a few key latent dynamic
   factors that isolate seasonal cyclic movements from nonseasonal,
   nonstationary trend lines. The authors demonstrate this novel
   multivariate approach to quantitative trendspotting in one application
   involving a promising new source of marketing intelligence online
   keyword search data from Google Insights for Search in which they
   analyze search volume patterns across 38 major makes of light vehicles
   over an 81-month period to uncover key common trends in consumer vehicle

AB Does the number of funds offered in a defined contribution plan affect
   how many funds consumers choose to invest in or how they spread dollars
   across the funds they choose? Across three experiments and the analysis
   of defined contribution plan data, the authors explore these issues by
   examining investors' tendency to engage in the 1/n heuristic-that is,
   allocating their dollars evenly across all available investment options.
   The authors decompose this heuristic into its two underlying behavioral
   dimensions: the tendency to invest in all available funds (which they
   label "1/n(#)") and the tendency to spread the invested dollars evenly
   across chosen funds (which they label "1/n($)"). The authors argue that
   choosing from larger fund assortments taxes investors' cognitive
   resources, which leads to more simplified diversification strategies.
   They find that increasing the fund assortment size decreases the
   tendency to invest in all available funds (1/n(#)) but increases the
   tendency to spread the invested dollars evenly among the chosen
   alternatives (1/n($)), provided that the number of funds chosen for
   investment allows for easy equal dollar allocations. The authors
   integrate their results with prior research regarding asset choice and
   allocation heuristics.

AB This study investigates the role of supervisors in implementing changes
   in marketing strategy. The authors propose that perceptions of
   outcome-oriented supervisory actions influence salespeople's primary
   appraisals of a strategic change (i.e., whether the change will affect
   them) and that perceptions of process-oriented supervisory actions
   influence salespeople's secondary appraisals (i.e., whether they can
   cope with the impact of the change on them). The results from a study of
   828 salespeople in 204 branches of a large distributor of industrial
   goods provide evidence that perceived outcome risk containment and
   outcome reward emphasis enhance primary appraisals, whereas perceived
   process risk containment and process reward emphasis enhance secondary
   appraisals. In turn, the authors find that salespeople's primary and
   secondary appraisals influence their change implementation behaviors,
   leading to successful change implementation. Notably, they also find
   that (outcome and process) risk containment has a greater influence on
   appraisals of salespeople with a higher performance orientation, but the
   effects of (outcome and process) reward emphases are invariant across
   salespeople's performance orientation. The findings suggest that
   successful implementation of strategic change may depend not merely or
   even primarily on giving rewards to salespeople for implementing change
   but also on limiting salespeople's risks and recognizing them for their
   change-related efforts.

AB Prior research has identified several factors that influence brand
   extension evaluations. Extending this research, the authors suggest that
   external, situational factors can have an important influence on brand
   extension evaluations. This research focuses on mating mind-sets (i.e.,
   thinking about a mate), which consumers commonly experience.
   Specifically, the authors propose that mating mind-sets triggered by the
   external situation can influence brand extension evaluations,
   particularly for men. Mating mind-sets induce male consumers (but not
   female consumers) to engage in relational processing, increasing fit
   perceptions and evaluations for moderately dissimilar brand extensions.
   These differences are more likely to emerge when a short-term mating
   mind-set is primed (vs. a long-term mating mind-set). Furthermore, using
   prestige brands (vs. functional brands) reduces the gap between men and
   women. In addition, subbrand architecture (vs. direct brand
   architecture) boosts the evaluations of female consumers but decreases
   those of male consumers. The authors find that the effects of mating
   mind-sets on brand extension evaluation are driven by male consumers'
   need to express creativity.

   for event frequency, social earned media's sales elasticity is
   significantly greater than traditional earned media's; and (4) social
   earned media appears to play an important role in driving traditional

AB Existing theory and prior research suggest that consumers perceive
   purchase prices more/less favorably when they are preceded by
   higher/lower prices. However, to date, researchers have found these
   effects in contexts in which the product, and thus perceived quality, is
   held constant. Given that consumers commonly believe price and quality
   are positively correlated and that price quality perceptions have been
   shown to influence price evaluations and willingness to pay, the
   generalizability of existing research to commonly encountered contexts
   is questionable. In this research, the authors examine the influence of
   price order on consumer choice across differing brands in contexts in
   which consumer quality perceptions are free to covary with price and
   they are manipulated to be correlated or uncorrelated with price. Using
   reference dependence theory as a framework, they find that when
   differing brand options are presented in descending price order,
   consumers tend to choose higher-price options; when they are presented
   in ascending price order, consumers tend to choose lower-priced options
   (the price order effect). In addition, the authors show that consumers'
   price quality perceptions are a necessary condition for this effect.

AB Consumers value status goods because of the impression status-product
   ownership makes on other consumers, and this impression depends on the
   actual distribution of ownership in population. Explicitly modeling
   consumer value of status products as coming from the information the
   product ownership conveys to other consumers, the authors show that a
   status-product manufacturer can benefit from a competitor's cost
   reduction because of the competitor's price reduction associated with
   it. In other words, they show that two status products that are
   (imperfect) substitutes in the consumer utility function may be
   complements in the profit function. As a consequence, competition could
   lead to higher prices than the optimal ones under monopoly ownership of
   both products. The authors confirm the assumptions that consumer value
   of a status good depends positively on the proportion of desirable type
   among owners and negatively on the proportion of the desirable type
   among nonowners in one experiment. Moreover, they find empirical support
   for the positive effect of a price reduction of one product on the
   demand for the other product from another experiment.

AB The authors study the role of reference price in a setting in which both
   the price and the quantity are set through personal interaction during
   the transaction process, such as in business-to-business markets. Most
   studies on reference price in the marketing research literature focus on
   consumer packaged goods, for which prices are typically fixed during the
   shopping trip and the transaction does not involve personal interaction
   with a salesperson. In this study, the authors study the effect of
   reference price on the quantity purchased and also on the pricing
   outcome of the transaction. They estimate a simultaneous equation system
   of both pricing and quantity purchased. The findings are as follows: (1)
   Reference price effects exist on quantity purchased and on the
   transaction pricing outcome in business-to-business market transactions,
   (2) business customers react asymmetrically to price increases and price
   decreases, and (3) salespeople have their own reference prices that
   affect the transaction price. The authors also find that customer
   experience with the salesperson might exacerbate the loss aversion
   effect. They conclude by discussing the underlying reasons behind these
   findings and their managerial implications.

AB Despite the powerful technologies that have enabled the assembly of
   transactional databases and the processing of information about
   individual customers and their buying patterns, database marketers have
   been limited by what is known as the "incomplete information
   problem"-that is, marketers have incomplete information about a
   customer's behavior in the product category of interest. A company's
   transactional database can only be built from customers' transactions
   with that company. Any transactions that have been made with other
   companies are missing. The authors present a modeling approach designed
   to solve the incomplete information problem. They use transactions
   conducted with a single supplier in that category to infer consumers'
   behavior with other suppliers in that category. In particular, armed
   with prior knowledge of the parametric form of consumer interpurchase
   time distributions, they uncover elements of the stochastic process that
   dictates which supplier a consumer chooses on a particular purchase
   occasion. The authors focus on interpurchase times because they form the
   core of the incomplete information problem. If a company uses its
   observed interpurchase times to estimate interpurchase times in the
   category for a specific consumer, its estimate will be biased upward.
   Combined with the model developed in this study, a familiar analysis of
   transaction profitability can be used to build a new type of lifetime
   value: lifetime category value of the customer.

AB Previous research in complaining behavior has focused on product or
   service failures in which the organization is responsible for the
   failure. In these cases, researchers have found that consumers feel
   better about the product failure after complaining about it. In
   contrast, the authors show that when consumers are to blame for product
   failure, complaining has a detrimental effect on consumer reactions to
   the product. In this context, self-threat from the product failure is
   shown to motivate defensive processing in both the content of complaints
   and the subsequent downstream product evaluations. The authors establish
   the role of self-threat in product failure in two ways: (1) by varying
   the intensity of the threat from product failure and (2) through
   mitigating negative outcomes through self-affirmation. The article
   concludes with discussion on how these findings can benefit companies
   and where this research could seed opportunities for subsequent
   investigation.

AB The common finding that selling prices exceed buying prices (the
   so-called endowment effect) is typically explained by the assumptions
   that consumers evaluate potential transactions with respect to their
   current holdings and that the owners of a good regard its potential loss
   to be more significant than nonowners regard its potential acquisition.
   In contrast to this "pain-of-losing" account, the authors propose that
   the endowment effect reflects a reluctance to trade on terms that appear
   unfavorable with respect to salient reference prices. In six experiments
   (and eight more summarized in appendixes), the authors show that
   manipulations that reduce the gap between valuations and reference
   prices reduce or eliminate the endowment effect. These results suggest
   that the endowment effect is often best construed as an aversion to bad
   deals rather than an aversion to losing possessions.

AB The location in which a product is presented can influence consumers'

   be driven by two alternative processes. First, people may have acquired
   a learned association between numerical magnitude and location as a
   consequence of frequently viewing larger numbers to the right of smaller
   ones. In addition, they may have learned a procedure of reading or
   writing numbers from left to right in increasing order of magnitude. The

AB The authors study physicians' prescription choices when uncertainty
   about drug efficacy is resolved through two channels: firms' marketing
   activities (e.g., detailing) and patients' experiences with the drugs.
   They first provide empirical evidence that suggests that the
   well-understood information incentive for physicians to experiment with
   new drugs is reduced when physicians anticipate future detailing.
   Therefore, increased detailing activity triggers opposing forces:
   Adoption is hastened as physicians become informed (assuming prior
   knowledge is initially low) and slows as they reduce experimentation and
   instead obtain information from detailing at no cost. The authors then
   estimate a dynamic Bayesian learning model that embodies these
   trade-offs using physician-level data on prescription choices and
   detailing received in the months surrounding the introduction of two
   erectile dysfunction drugs, Levitra and Cialis. Detailing elasticities
   are lower when physicians anticipate changes in detailing activity than
   when such changes are unexpected. Accordingly, the authors conclude that
   to maximize the effect of detailing, firms should avoid announcing
   increases in detailing activities.

   retail markets. Their approach formally incorporates the dynamics
   induced by the repositioning in a model with strategic interaction. They
   exploit a unique data set containing the price format decisions of all
   U.S. supermarkets in the 1990s. The data contain the format change
   decisions of supermarkets in response to a large shock to their local
   market positions: the entry of Wal-Mart. The authors exploit the
   responses of retailers to Wal-Mart entry to infer the cost of changing
   pricing formats using a revealed-preference argument. The interaction
   between retailers and Wal-Mart in each market is modeled as a dynamic
   game. The authors find evidence that entry by Wal-Mart had a significant
   impact on the costs and incidence of switching pricing strategy. Their
   results add to the marketing literature on the organization of retail
   markets and have implications for long-term market structure in the

AB This article proposes a novel approach to assess the dynamic effect that
   advertising expenditures have on which products consumers include in
   their choice sets. In a discrete-choice model, consumers face choice
   sets that evolve according to their awareness of each product.
   Advertising expenditures have a dynamic effect in the sense that they
   raise consumer awareness of a product, increasing present and future
   sales. To estimate this effect, the authors explicitly model the firms'
   dynamic advertising decisions and illustrate the model using data from
   the Spanish automobile market. The results show that the effect of
   advertising on awareness is dynamic and that accounting for it is
   crucial in explaining the evolution of product sales over its life
   cycle. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the awareness process
   can be significantly sped up by advertising. Thus, there is a great
   heterogeneity in the length of the awareness process among products,
   depending on the level of advertising expenditures; it may range from
   one to six years.

AB Advertising nudges consumers along the think feel-do hierarchy of
   intermediate effects of advertising to induce sales. Because
   intermediate effects-cognition, affect, and experience-are unobservable
   constructs, brand managers use a battery of mind-set metrics to assess
   how advertising builds brands. However, extant sales response models
   explain how advertising grows-sales but ignore the role of intermediate
   effects in building brands. To link these dual contributions of
   advertising, the authors propose an integrated framework that augments
   the dynamic advertising sales response model by integrating the
   hierarchy, dynamic evolution, and purchase reinforcement of intermediate
   effects. Methodologically, the new approach incorporates the
   intermediate effects as factors from mind-set metrics while filtering
   out measurement noise, extracts the factor loadings, estimates the
   dynamic evolution of the factors, and infers their sequence in any
   hypothesized hierarchy by embedding their impact in a dynamic
   advertising sales response model. The authors apply the proposed model
   and associated method to a major brand to discover the brand's operating
   hierarchy (advertising -> experience -> cognition -> affect <-> sales).
   The results provide the first empirical evidence that intermediate
   effects are indeed dynamic constructs, that purchase reinforcement
   effects exist not only for experience but also for other intermediate
   effects, and that advertising simultaneously contributes to both sales
   growth and brand building. Thus, both researchers and managers should
   consider using the proposed framework to capture advertising's dual
   contributions of building brands and growing sales.

AB Because utility/profits, state transitions, and discount rates are
   confounded in dynamic models, discount rates are typically fixed for the
   purpose of identification. The authors propose a strategy of identifying
   discount rates. The identification rests on imputing the utility/profits
   using decisions made in a context in which the future is
   inconsequential, the objective function is concave, and the decision
   space is continuous. They then use these utilities/profits to identify
   discount rates in contexts in which dynamics become material. The
   authors exemplify this strategy using a field study in which cell phone
   users transitioned from a linear to a three-part-tariff pricing plan.
   They find that the estimated discount rate corresponds to a weekly
   discount factor (.90), lower than the value typically assumed in
   empirical research (.995). When using a standard .995 discount factor,
   they find that the price coefficient is underestimated by 16%. Moreover,
   the predicted intertemporal substitution pattern and demand elasticities
   are biased, leading to a 29% deterioration in model fit and suboptimal
   pricing recommendations that would lower potential revenue gains by 76%.

   million new cars sold over nine years, they examine how visual influence

   these effects moderated by visibility, the ease of seeing others'
   behavior? Do they vary according to the identity (e.g., gender) of prior
   purchasers and the identity relevance of vehicle type? The authors
   perform an extensive set of tests to rule out alternatives to visual
   influence and find that visual effects are (1) present (one additional
   purchase for approximately every seven prior purchases), (2) larger in
   areas where others' behavior should be more visible (i.e., more people
   commute in car-visible ways), (3) stronger for prior purchases by men
   than by women in male-oriented vehicle types, (4) extant only for cars

AB Understanding how emotions can affect pleasure has important
   implications both for people and for firms' communication strategies.
   Prior research has shown that experienced pleasure often assimilates to
   the valence of one's active emotions, such that negative emotions
   decrease pleasure. In contrast, the authors demonstrate that the
   activation of guilt, a negative emotion, enhances the pleasure
   experienced from hedonic consumption. The authors show that this effect
   occurs because of a cognitive association between guilt and pleasure,
   such that activating guilt can automatically activate cognitions related
   to pleasure. Furthermore, the authors show that this pattern of results
   is unique to guilt and cannot be explained by a contrast effect that
   generalizes to other negative emotions. The article concludes with a
   discussion of the implications of these findings for marketing and
   consumption behavior.

AB In many service industries, firms introduce three-part tariffs to
   replace or complement existing two-part tariffs. In contrast with
   two-part tariffs, three-part tariffs offer allowances, or "free" units
   of the service. Behavioral research suggests that the attributes of a
   pricing plan may affect behavior beyond their direct cost implications.
   Evidence suggests that customers value free units above and beyond what
   might be expected from the change in their budget constraint. Nonlinear
   pricing research, however, has not considered such an effect. The
   authors examine a market in which three-part tariffs were introduced for
   the first time. They analyze tariff choice and usage behavior for
   customers who switch from two-part to three-part tariffs. The findings
   show that switchers significantly "overuse" in comparison with their
   prior two-part tariff usage. That is, they attain a level of consumption
   that cannot be explained by a shift in the budget constraint. The
   authors estimate a discrete/continuous model of tariff choice and usage
   that accounts for the valuation of free units. The results show that the
   majority of three-part-tariff users value minutes under a three-part
   tariff more than they do under a two-part tariff. The authors derive
   recommendations for how the provider can exploit these insights to
   further increase revenues.

AB Marketers commonly assume that health claims attached to otherwise
   unhealthful food stimulate consumption because such claims offer
   justification for indulgence and reduce guilt. This article proposes a
   generalized theory of healthful indulgences, identifying when and why
   people overconsume versus regulate food intake in response to health
   claims. Four studies demonstrate that not all health claims are created
   equal. The authors suggest that the nature of the food attributes the
   claims emphasize namely, functional versus hedonic determines the extent
   of consumption of the indulgence. Health claims featuring functional
   attributes (e.g., "extra antioxidants") trigger high levels of
   health-goal accessibility, which, together with simultaneously
   accessible indulgence goals attached to the indulgence, results in goal
   conflict. This conflict leads to reduced consumption of the food. In
   contrast, health claims featuring hedonic attributes (e.g., "low fat")
   render health goals less accessible while accentuating the pleasure
   dimension of the food, resulting in lower goal conflict and increased
   consumption of the food. Implications for the food industry and public
   policy makers are discussed.

AB Companies increasingly employ cause-related marketing to enhance
   customer goodwill and improve their image. However, because these
   efforts have major implications for pricing strategy and firm
   profitability, understanding the relationship between the company's
   donation amount and customers' willingness to pay is important. In
   particular, little is known about the moderating effects that influence
   this relationship or their underlying mechanisms. Study 1 confirms that
   two types of customer predispositions moderate the link between donation
   amount and willingness to pay: donation-related and cause-related
   predispositions. Three additional studies focus on the negative
   moderating effect of company-cause fit and provide insights into the
   underlying moderation process. Specifically, the motives customers
   attribute to the company mediate the moderating impact of fit on the
   donation amount-WTP link (Study 2), which occurs particularly in cases
   of utilitarian (Study 3) and privately consumed products (Study 4).

   guilt and shame differentially influence the effectiveness of health
   messages framed as gains or losses. Guilt appeals are more effective
   when paired with gain frames, whereas shame appeals are more effective
   when paired with loss frames. These framing effects occur because gain
   frames facilitate the use of problem-focused coping strategies favored
   by guilt, whereas loss frames facilitate the use of emotion-focused
   coping strategies favored by shame. Frames that fit with the emotion
   facilitate the activation of coping strategies consistent with that

AB Products can be described by different numbers of attributes, but can
   the mere number of attributes presented across a choice set influence
   what type of options people choose? This article demonstrates that
   attribute numerosity tends to benefit certain types of options more than
   others and consequently has systematic effects on choice. Because
   attributes often serve as a heuristic cue for product usefulness, they
   benefit options that people perceive as relatively inferior on this
   dimension. Consistent with this perspective, five studies demonstrate
   that attribute numerosity benefits hedonic more than utilitarian options
   by increasing the extent to which the former appear useful.
   Consequently, increasing attribute quantity equally across the choice
   set shifts choice toward hedonic options, regardless of whether the
   attributes are hedonic, utilitarian, or mixed in nature. Consistent with
   this conceptualization, these effects become amplified when decision
   makers engage in heuristic processing and when priming makes usefulness
   salient. The findings have important implications for how marketers
   present attribute information, for public policy and consumer welfare,
   and for understanding argument numerosity effects in persuasion more
   broadly.

AB Many firms attempt to enhance experience consumption by facilitating the
   consumption outcome (i.e., the end state achieved, such as the final
   score of a basketball game) and the consumption process (i.e., the
   course through which the end is achieved, such as how the game is
   played). The authors propose that the roles of outcome and process in
   the evaluation of experience consumption are dependent not only on
   consumers' role in the experience (participant vs. spectator) but also
   on their self-construal (independent vs. interdependent). As a spectator
   (e.g., watching a game), independents' (vs. interdependents') experience
   consumption evaluations are more likely to be influenced by outcome,
   while interdependent (vs. independent) consumers are more likely to be
   affected by process. The reverse is true when consumers assume the role
   of a participant in the experience (e.g., playing a game). The authors'
   theorizing is supported across three studies.

AB This article introduces a new determinant of brand extension success,
   brand extension authenticity (BEA), as a complement to fit. The authors
   develop the BEA construct and a scale to measure it and then demonstrate
   that BEA captures consumer perceptions of brand extension legitimacy and
   cultural contiguity along four interrelated but distinct dimensions:
   maintaining brand standards and style, honoring brand heritage,
   preserving brand essence, and avoiding brand exploitation. They
   demonstrate the power of BEA in predicting consumer reactions to brand
   extensions, particularly among consumers with strong self-brand
   connections. Not only is BEA distinct from two conceptualizations of fit
   in brand extension literature-fit as similarity and fit as relevance-but
   it also moderates the effects of both fit dimensions on brand extension
   responses. By capturing a cultural and consumer relational perspective
   that shapes reactions to brand extensions, BEA provides an important,
   complementary construct for predicting brand extension success and
   enhancing brand value. Brand managers attentive to BEA may be able to
   stretch brands further than assessments of fit alone would suggest, but
   they risk failure in otherwise well-fitting extensions perceived as
   inauthentic.

AB Whereas most existing self-control research and scales focus on singular
   self-control choice, the current work examines sequential self-control
   behavior. Specifically, this research focuses on behavior following
   initial self-control failure, identifying a set of key cognitive and
   emotional responses to initial failure that jointly underlie
   post-failure behavior. The tendency to experience these responses is
   captured in a new scale, the Response-to-Failure scale, which the
   authors develop and test in three consumer domains: eating, spending,
   and cheating. The results support the use of the same emotional and
   cognitive factors to predict post-failure behavior across these three
   domains, providing evidence of the generalizability of the scale
   structure. The data support the scale's structure, nomological and
   discriminant validity, and test-retest reliability across five studies.
   In five additional studies, the scale's predictive validity is
   demonstrated beyond other existing relevant scales. The authors also
   develop and test a short form of each domain scale. Finally, the authors
   discuss the implications for understanding post-failure behavior and
   suggest practical uses for the scale.

AB How does price sensitivity change with the macroeconomic environment?
   The authors explore this question by measuring price elasticity using
   household-level data across 19 grocery categories over 24 quarters. For
   each category, they estimate a separate random coefficients logit model
   with quarter-specific price response parameters and control functions to
   address endogeneity. This specification yields a novel set of 456
   elasticities across categories and time that are generated using the
   same method and therefore can be directly compared. On average, price
   sensitivity is countercyclical: It rises when the macroeconomy weakens.
   However, substantial variation exists, and a handful of categories
   exhibit procyclical price sensitivity. The authors show that the
   relationship between price sensitivity and macroeconomic growth
   correlates strongly with the average level of price sensitivity in a
   category. They examine several explanations for this result and conclude
   that a category's share of wallet is the more likely driver versus
   alternative explanations based on product perishability, substitution
   across consumption channels, or market power.

AB With the growing popularity of online social networks, it is becoming
   more important for marketing researchers to understand and measure
   social intercorrelations among consumers. The authors show that the
   estimation of consumers' social intercorrelations can be significantly
   affected by the sampling method used in the study and the topology of
   the social network. Through a series of simulation studies using a
   spatial model, the authors find that the magnitude of social
   intercorrelations in consumer networks tends to be underestimated if
   samples of the networks are used (rather than using the entire
   population of the network). The authors further demonstrate that
   sampling methods that better preserve the network structure perform best
   in recovering the social intercorrelations. However, this advantage
   decreases in networks characterized by the scale-free power-law
   distribution for the number of connections of each member. The authors
   discuss the insights they glean from these findings and propose a method
   to obtain unbiased estimation of the magnitude of social

   First, buyers often have irregular purchase patterns, as the authors
   observe in the high-tech industry. Second, marketing efforts take
   considerable time to build a relationship with a customer. The authors
   attempt to precisely recover hidden buyer seller relationship states to
   capture the effect of marketing contacts in B2B markets. The authors
   build a comprehensive hierarchical Bayesian bivariate Tobit hidden
   Markov model to assess the return on marketing in B2B markets. They use
   a recursive computing method a forward backward Gibbs sampler method to
   retrieve the relationship states. The results suggest that marketing
   contacts have a heterogeneous long- and short-term impact on customers'
   purchasing behavior through changes in the buyer seller relationship
   states. This study provides practical value to business marketers to
   measure the return on marketing investment in buyer seller
   relationships.

   construct a dynamic panel data model to examine how consumers allocate

   longitudinal panel in which the authors tracked 287 U.S. consumers' time
   use, consumption motives, and expertise measures on a weekly basis from
   January to June 2011. This is the first empirical research to examine
   the underlying mechanisms that guide the dynamics of an individual's

   to the perceived benefits of an activity, which in turn leads to high
   value associated with it. Expertise also directly influences value
   obtained from an activity. This expertise, in turn, is acquired over
   time through past consumption. This finding implies a chain from
   expertise to value to time use and back to expertise, which may lead
   consumers to form a lifestyle in which they specialize in a subset of
   activities they know well. Consequently, expertise can be regarded as a
   key variable that explains lifestyle choices.

   Across five studies and four product domains, the article shows that
   consumers fail to estimate their feature usage rate before purchasing
   multifunctional products, negatively affecting product satisfaction. The
   findings demonstrate that when consumers do estimate their feature usage
   before choice, preferences shift from many-feature products toward
   few-feature products. The authors show that this shift in preferences is
   due to a change in elaboration from having features to using features,
   and they identify three key moderators to the effect: need for
   cognition, feature trivialness, and materialism. Finally, the authors
   investigate the downstream consequences of usage estimation on product
   satisfaction, demonstrating that consumers who estimate usage before
   choice experience greater product satisfaction and are more likely to
   recommend their chosen product. These results point to the relative
   importance consumers place on having versus using product features.

AB New empirical models of consumer demand that incorporate social effects
   seek to measure the causal effect of past adopter's behavior the
   "installed-base" on current adoption behavior. Identifying such causal
   effects is challenging due to several alternative confounds that
   generate correlation in agents' actions. In the absence of experimental
   variation, a preferred solution has been to control for these spurious
   correlations using a rich specification of fixed effects. The authors
   show that fixed-effects estimators of this sort are inconsistent in the
   presence of installed-base effects; in simulations, random-effects
   specifications perform even worse. The analysis reveals the tension the
   applied empiricist faces in this area: a rich control for unobservables
   increases the credibility of the reported causal effects, but the
   incorporation of these controls introduces biases of a new kind in this
   class of models. The authors present two solutions: a modified version
   of an instrumental variable approach and a new bias-correction approach,
   both of which deliver consistent estimates of causal installed-base
   effects. The empirical application to the adoption of the Toyota Prius
   Hybrid in California shows evidence for social influence in diffusion
   and reveals that implementing the bias correction reverses the sign of
   the measured installed-base effect. The authors also discuss
   implications of the results for identification of models in marketing
   involving state dependence in demand, and incorporating discrete games
   of strategic interaction.

AB Many firms strive to create relationships with customers, but not all
   customers are motivated to build close commercial relationships. This
   article introduces a theoretical framework that explains how
   relationship-specific attachment styles account for customers' distinct
   preferences for closeness and how both attachment styles and preferences
   for closeness influence loyalty. The authors test their predictions with
   survey data from 1199 insurance customers and three years of purchase
   records for 975 of these customers. They find that attachment styles
   predict customers' preferences for closeness better than established
   marketing variables do. Moreover, attachment styles and preferences for
   closeness influence loyalty intentions and behavior, controlling for
   established antecedents (e.g., relationship quality). Finally, exploring
   the underlying process, the authors show that preference for closeness
   partially mediates the effect of attachment styles on cross-buying
   behavior. This research provides novel customer segmentation criteria
   and actionable guidelines that managers can use to improve their ability
   to tailor relationship marketing activities and more effectively
   allocate resources to match customer preferences.

AB Firms are under increasing pressure to justify their marketing
   expenditures. This evolution toward greater accountability is reinforced
   in harsh economic times when marketing budgets are among the first to be
   reconsidered. To make such decisions, managers must know whether, and to
   what extent, marketing's effectiveness varies with the economic tide;
   however, surprisingly little research addresses this issue. Therefore,
   the authors conduct a systematic investigation of the business cycle's
   impact on the effectiveness of two important marketing instruments:
   price and advertising. To do so, they estimate time-varying short- and
   long-term advertising and price elasticities for 150 brands across 36
   consumer packaged goods categories, using 18 years of monthly U.K. data
   from 1993 to 2010. The long-term price sensitivity tends to decrease
   during economic expansions, whereas long-term advertising elasticities
   increase. During contractions, the long-term own and cross price
   elasticities increase. Moreover, throughout the observation period, the
   short-term price elasticity became significantly stronger. Finally,
   patterns differ across categories and brands, which presents
   opportunities for firms that know how to ride, the economic tide.

AB In this research, the authors develop a theory addressing why people act
   opportunistically when the stakes (i.e., payoffs) are low. Transaction
   cost theory suggests that opportunistic behavior is more likely under
   high-stakes conditions. The authors identify rapport as an important
   moderator of this relationship. Through a series of three studies, they
   find that high-stakes opportunism appears to occur only when rapport is
   low. In contrast, when rapport is high, this relationship reverses, such
   that opportunism is actually more likely when the stakes are low than
   when they are high. The authors attribute these findings to differences
   in reasoning and find that when rapport is high and the stakes are low,
   people are better able to justify their actions by employing morally
   malleable reasoning. Thus, this research offers insights into an
   important form of opportunism that has been largely absent from
   transaction cost theory.

AB Service innovativeness, or the propensity to introduce service
   innovations to satisfy customers and improve firm value at acceptable
   risk, has become a critical organizational capability. Service
   innovations are enabled primarily by the Internet or people,
   corresponding to two types of innovativeness: e- and p-innovativeness.
   The authors examine the determinants of service innovativeness and its
   interrelationships with firm-level customer satisfaction, firm value,
   and firm risk and investigate the differences between e- and
   p-innovativeness in these relationships. They develop a conceptual model
   and estimate a system of equations on a unique panel data set of 1049
   innovations over five years, using zero-inflated negative binomial
   regression and seemingly unrelated regression approaches. The results
   reveal important asymmetries between e- and p-innovativeness. Whereas
   e-innovativeness has a positive and significant direct effect on firm
   value, p-innovativeness has an overall significantly positive effect on
   firm value through its positive effect on customer satisfaction but only
   in human-dominated industries. Both e- and p-innovativeness are
   positively associated with idiosyncratic risk, but customer satisfaction
   partially mediates this relationship for p-innovativeness to lower this
   risk in human-dominated industries. The findings suggest that firms
   should nurture e-innovativeness in most industries and p-innovativeness
   in human-dominated industries.

AB It is common for researchers discovering a significant interaction of a

   effects of Z at different levels of X. These "spotlight" tests are often
   misunderstood even in the simplest cases, and it appears that consumer
   researchers are unsure how to extend them to more complex designs. The
   authors explain the general principles of spotlight tests, show that
   they rely on familiar regression techniques, and provide a tutorial
   demonstrating how to apply these tests across an array of experimental
   designs. Rather than following the common practice of reporting
   spotlight tests at one standard deviation above and below the mean of X,
   it is recommended that when X has focal values, researchers should
   report spotlight tests at those focal values. When X does not have focal
   values, it is recommended that researchers report ranges of significance
   using a version of Johnson and Neyman's test the authors term a
   "floodlight."

AB In word-of-mouth seeding programs, customer word of mouth can generate
   value through market expansion; in other words, it can gain customers
   who would not otherwise have bought the product. Alternatively, word of
   mouth can generate value by accelerating the purchases of customers who
   would have purchased anyway. This article presents the first
   investigation exploring how acceleration and expansion combine to
   generate value in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. The
   authors define a program's "social value" as the global change, over the
   entire social system, in customer equity that can be attributed to the
   word-of-mouth program participants. They compute programs' social value
   in various scenarios using an agent-based simulation model and empirical
   connectivity data on 12 social networks in various markets as input to
   the simulation. The authors show how expansion and acceleration
   integrate to create programs' social value and illustrate how the role
   of each is affected by factors such as competition, program targeting,
   profit decline, and retention. These results have substantial
   implications for the design and evaluation of word-of-mouth marketing
   programs and of the profit impact of word of mouth in general.

AB Different framing of the same duration (one year, 12 months, 365 days)
   can influence consumers' impressions of subjective duration, thereby
   affecting their judgments and decisions. The authors propose that,
   ironically, self-relevance amplifies this duration framing effect.
   Consumers for whom a particular self-improvement domain is personally
   relevant are less likely to adopt a one-year self-improvement plan as
   compared with a 12-month plan because they perceive it as longer and
   more difficult. This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who
   report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are
   making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs.
   low) task involvement. Personal relevance amplifies this effect because
   it prompts process-focused simulation of the plan, consequently
   increasing susceptibility to spurious duration and difficulty, cues
   embedded in frames.

AB How do consumers' needs and motivations influence their perceptions of

   psychology literature, the answer is invariably "larger." However, in
   this article, the authors demonstrate that the answer is more complex
   depending on whether the object belongs to the perceiver. If the cake
   does not belong to the perceiver, she will perceive it to be larger if
   she is hungry than if she is satiated. In contrast, if the cake already
   belongs to her, she will perceive it to be smaller if she is hungry than

AB This research examines the effect of processing fluency on judgments of
   agent competence. In the context of service relationships, four studies
   reveal that the experience of processing difficulty, or disfluency,
   enhances expectations of agent-exerted effort and competence, which in
   turn increase expected service value. When reading information about a
   target service, consumers interpret the difficulty of processing
   information as a signal of the level of skill required to execute the
   task, which highlights the agent's expected utility. The authors explore
   several moderators of this positive effect of disfluency, showing that
   it is attenuated under conditions that decrease the relevance of
   consumers' subjective experiences and it may be reversed on measures of
   experienced (vs. expected) service value.

AB Why do bidders in buyer-determined procurement auctions often bid above
   the lowest observed bid over the course of the auction? Are such bidding
   patterns meaningful? In this research, the authors propose that because
   bidders are differentiated in their value to the buyer and competition
   in these auctions is anonymous, bidders infer their potential quality
   advantage or disadvantage through their observation of competitive bids
   and incorporate this information into their responses and price bids.
   Using point-by-point bid data from two industrial procurement auctions,
   the authors show that bidders appear to be making inferences about their
   own implied quality differentials and adjust their bidding strategies
   and bidding aggression accordingly. Specifically, they find that
   high-quality bidders tend to be more aggressive in bidding against
   potentially higher-quality competition and less aggressive when bidding
   against potentially lower-quality competition. In contrast, low-quality
   bidders appear aggressive regardless of their implied quality in
   relation to the competition. The authors conclude with a discussion of
   implications for management and auction design.

AB As firms collect greater amounts of data about their customers from an

   challenges arises. Companies often collect data from these various

   merge these data sources to draw meaningful inferences about
   customer-level behavior patterns. In this article, the authors provide a
   method that firms can use, based on readily available data, to gauge and
   monitor multiplatform media usage. The key innovation in the method is a
   Bayesian data-fusion approach that enables researchers to combine
   individual-level usage data (readily available for most digital
   platforms) with aggregated data on usage over time (typically available
   for traditional platforms). This method enables the authors to
   disentangle the intraday correlations between platforms (i.e., the usage
   of one platform vs. another on a given day) from longer-term
   correlations across users (i.e., heavy/light usage of multiple platforms
   over time). The authors conclude with a discussion of how this method
   can be used in a variety of marketing contexts for which data have
   become readily available, such as gauging the interplay between online
   and brick-and-mortar purchasing behavior.

AB To manage marketing channels, subsidiaries of multinational corporations
   (MNCs) must balance mandates from headquarters (HQ) with the local
   realities of the foreign markets. The performance implications of
   subsidiary distributor relationship efforts thus are contingent on the
   HQ subsidiary relationship. Drawing on marketing channels, economics,
   and organization theory literature streams, the authors (1) describe the
   complex performance properties of output and process control mechanisms
   that MNC subsidiaries deploy to manage foreign distributors and (2)
   conceptualize the HQ subsidiary nexus along three attributes that should
   moderate the performance effects of control mechanisms: task
   coordination, or HQ's central coordination of processes across
   subsidiaries; subsidiary decision involvement, or two-way communications
   and consensual decision making between HQ and the subsidiary; and
   relational disharmony, or the extent of the HQ subsidiary conflict. The
   authors test the hypotheses using field data from German and Japanese
   MNCs in the United States and Bayesian models that account for
   measurement error, endogeneity in the control mechanisms, heterogeneity
   in country of origin, and nonlinear and interactive terms for the latent
   constructs. The results demonstrate the importance of the HQ subsidiary
   relationship for managing the subsidiary distributor relationship.

AB This study examines brand dispersion variance in brand ratings across
   consumers and its role in the translation of brand assets into firm
   value. Dispersion captures the covert heterogeneity in brand evaluations
   among consumers who like or dislike the brands, which would affect an
   investor's decision to buy or sell a stock. The higher the dispersion,
   the more inconsistent and polarized the brands' cross-consumer ratings.
   Multiple analyses on 730,818 brand day observations provide robust
   evidence that brand dispersion fluctuations affect stock prices. Brand
   dispersion has Januslike effects: it harms returns but reduces firm
   risk. Furthermore, downside dispersion has a stronger impact on abnormal
   returns than upside dispersion, indicating an asymmetry in brand
   dispersion's effects. Moreover, dispersion tempers the risk-reduction
   benefits of higher brand rating in both the short run and long run.
   Without modeling dispersion, brand rating's impact on firm value can be
   over- or underestimated. Managers should consider dispersion a vital
   brand-management metric and add it to the brand-performance dashboard.

   questions about intrinsically private matters, such as opinions, tastes,
   and behavior. The authors test BTS in several studies, primarily using
   recognition questionnaires that present items such as brand names and
   scientific terms. One-third of the items were nonexistent foils. The BTS
   mechanism, which mathematically rewards "surprisingly common" answers,
   both rewarded truth telling, by heavily penalizing foil recognition, and
   induced truth telling, in that participants who were paid according to
   their BTS scores claimed to recognize fewer foils than control groups,
   even when given competing incentives to exaggerate. Survey takers who
   received BTS-based payments without explanation became less likely to
   recognize foils as they progressed through the survey, suggesting that
   they learned to respond to BTS incentives despite the absence of
   guidance. The mechanism also outperformed the solemn oath, a competing
   truth-inducement mechanism. Finally, when applied to judgments about
   contributing to a public good, BTS eliminated the bias common in

   In four studies, the authors use different SK manipulations and

   pursue a risky investment increases when SK is high (vs. low) relative

   retirement saving program is enhanced by asking consumers an easy (vs.
   difficult) question about finance, thereby increasing SK (Study 2); (3)
   technically elaborating information about a mutual fund diminishes SK
   regarding that investment and decreases choice of that fund (Study 3);
   and (4) consumers invest less money in funds when missing information is
   made salient, holding the objective investment information constant
   (Study 4). Furthermore, the effects in Studies 2-4 are mediated by
   participants' self-rated SK. The authors propose that effective

   much larger increases occurring at lower ability deciles. The author S
   find significant differences across these plans on (1) effort against
   nonincentivized tasks and (2) output fluctuations induced through
   "timing games." At this firm, the bonus plan was strictly inferior to
   the implemented commission plan with respect to short-term revenues and
   timing games. In contrast, the commission plan induced greater neglect
   of nonincentivized tasks (tasks not directly affecting observable
   output). To organize their findings, the authors build a simple
   theoretical model in the personnel economics tradition. The novel result
   that multitasking concerns are reduced under bonus plans when the quota
   has been met provides a nuanced rationale for the widespread existence
   of lump-sum bonus plans.

AB Little empirical consumer research has focused on the decoding of
   conspicuous symbolism, that is, the inferences consumers make about
   others' conspicuous consumption. Grounded in theory on social perception
   and role congruity, four experiments show that consumer inferences about
   and behavioral intentions toward conspicuous sellers are moderated by
   communal and exchange relationship norms. Specifically, conspicuous
   consumption by a seller decreases warmth inferences and, in turn,
   behavioral intentions toward the seller under the communal norm;
   conversely, it increases competence inferences and, in turn, behavioral
   intentions under the exchange norm. A seller's mere wealth triggers
   similar inferences, suggesting that conspicuous consumption is a
   surrogate for actual wealth. Priming consumers with persuasion knowledge
   inhibits the inferential benefits resulting from conspicuousness under
   the exchange norm. These findings reveal the theoretically meaningful
   role of the consumption context by showing that consumers' warmth and
   competence inferences operate differentially in commercial relationships
   as a result of salient communal versus exchange norms, with important
   consequences for consumers' behavioral intentions.

AB New brand extensions can push a brand outside its typical boundaries. In
   this article, the authors argue that people's acceptance of such
   extensions depends on their feelings of control. Across several studies,
   the authors demonstrate that when feelings of personal control are low,
   consumers and managers seek greater structure in brands and thus reject
   brand extensions that do not seem to fit well with the parent brand. The
   authors also identify important boundary conditions that illustrate when
   consumers are most likely to punish a brand for poor-fitting brand
   extensions and how the effect can be mitigated.

AB Four studies investigate (1) whether a variety-seeking versus inertial
   environment activates a certain mind-set about risk propensity and (2)
   whether this mind-set influences preferences for immediate versus
   delayed promotions. Study 1 demonstrates that a variety-seeking
   environment activates a risk-taking mind-set, whereas an inertial
   environment activates a risk-averse mind-set and that such a difference
   in risk propensity makes a delayed (immediate) promotion relatively more
   appealing for consumers with a variety-seeking (inertial) tendency.
   Study 2 reveals that preferences for a brand offering a delayed
   promotion are stronger when consumers have a variety-seeking tendency
   and that preferences of consumers low (vs. high) in need for cognitive
   closure are more influenced by the difference in variety-seeking versus
   inertial tendency. Study 3 provides further insights by allowing
   participants to be variety seeking or inertial and by controlling for
   redemption effort and the hedonic/utilitarian aspects of categories.
   Finally, Study 4 highlights the impact of variety-seeking versus
   inertial tendency on real-world choices. The article concludes with a
   discussion of theoretical and managerial implications.

AB Prior research shows that positive online reviews are less valued than
   negative reviews. The authors argue that this is due to differences in
   causal attributions for positive versus negative information such that
   positive reviews tend to be relatively more attributed to the reviewer
   (vs. product experience) than negative reviews. The presence of temporal
   contiguity cues, which indicate that review writing closely follows
   consumption, reduces the relative extent to which positive reviews are
   attributed to the reviewer and mitigates the negativity bias. An
   examination of 65,531 Yelp.com restaurant reviews shows that review
   value is negatively related to. review valence but that this negative
   relationship is absent for reviews that contain temporal contiguity
   cues. A series of lab studies replicates these findings and suggests
   that temporal contiguity cues enhance the value of a positive review and
   increase the likelihood of choosing a product with a positive review by
   changing reader beliefs about the cause of the review.

AB Brands and word of mouth (WOM) are cornerstones of the marketing field,
   and yet their relationship has received relatively little attention.
   This study aims to enhance understanding of brand characteristics as
   antecedents of WOM by executing a comprehensive empirical analysis. For
   this purpose, the authors constructed a unique data set on online and
   offline WOM and characteristics for more than 600 of the most
   talked-about U.S. brands. To guide this empirical analysis, they present
   a theoretical framework arguing that consumers spread WOM on brands as a
   result of social, emotional, and functional drivers. Using these
   drivers, the authors identify a set of 13 brand characteristics that
   stimulate WOM, including three (level of differentiation, excitement,
   and complexity) that have not been studied to date as WOM antecedents.
   The authors find that whereas the social and functional drivers are the
   most important for online WOM, the emotional driver is the most
   important for offline WOM. These results provide an insightful
   perspective on WOM and have meaningful managerial implications for brand
   management and investment in WOM campaigns.

AB Retailers and manufacturers are keenly interested in understanding
   unplanned consideration and purchase conversion, but data that capture
   in-store product consideration have been unavailable in the past. In the
   current research, the authors use in-store video tracking to collect a
   novel data set that records shopping behavior at the point of purchase,
   including product consideration. In conjunction with an entrance survey
   of purchase intentions, they conduct several descriptive analyses that
   focus on the incidence, category propensity, behavioral characteristics,
   and outcome of unplanned consideration. The results reveal several new
   empirical insights. First, the authors find significant category-level
   complementarities between planned items and unplanned considerations,
   which they capture using a latent category map. Second, planned
   consideration and unplanned consideration differ in key behavioral
   characteristics (e.g., likelihood of purchase, time of occurrence,
   number of product touches). Third, greater likelihood of purchase
   conversion is significantly associated with dynamic factors (e.g.,
   remaining in-store slack, outcome of the previous consideration) and
   behavioral characteristics (e.g., number of displays viewed, distance to
   shelf, references to a shopping list). The authors conclude with a
   discussion of implications of these findings for research and shopper
   marketing.

AB Standard models of competition predict that firms will sell less when
   competitors target their customers with advertising. This is
   particularly true in mature markets with many competitors that sell
   relatively undifferentiated products. However, the authors present
   findings from a large-scale randomized field experiment that contrast
   sharply with this prediction. The field experiment measures the impact
   of competitors' advertising on sales at a private label apparel
   retailer. Surprisingly, for a substantial segment of customers, the
   competitors' advertisements increased sales at this retailer. This
   robust effect was obtained through experimental manipulation and by
   measuring actual purchases from large samples of randomly assigned
   customers. The effect size is also large, with customers ordering more
   than 4% more items in some categories in the treatment condition (vs.
   the control). The authors examine how these positive spillovers vary
   across product categories to illustrate the importance of product
   standards, customer learning, and switching costs. The findings have the
   potential to change our understanding of competition in mature markets.

   They propose that the representation level influences the type of

   available criterion is appropriate for comparing the options in turn
   affects choice difficulty. Four studies demonstrate the proposed effect

   Specifically, they use a firm's loyalty program database to capture

   the purchase history for these same respondents, thereby creating
   single-source data. The authors illustrate their method for a large

AB The authors propose that the physical sensation of balance can affect
   consumer judgments and decisions. A series of six experiments
   demonstrates that certain consumer behaviors, such as leaning back in a
   chair while shopping online, can activate the concept of balance and
   thereby affect the consumer decision-making process. Specifically,
   consumers experiencing a heightened sense of balance are more likely to
   choose compromise options. The authors propose and show evidence for the
   mechanism underlying these effects: that the concept of balance is
   metaphorically linked in the mind to the concept of parity and that
   activating balance increases the accessibility of the parity concept.
   The increased accessibility of parity changes consumer perceptions of
   the product offerings in a choice set, increasing the selection of
   compromise options because they provide parity on the described product
   attributes.

AB "Hard discounters" (HDs) have become a considerable force in grocery
   retailing. With rock-bottom prices and minimal assortments, they differ
   greatly from "large discounters" such as Wal-Mart, constituting
   complements to, rather than substitutes for, more traditional
   supermarkets. Therefore, the authors propose that HD impact of entry on
   local incumbents is different as well. Using a store choice and spending
   model that explicitly accounts for interstore synergies and
   multiple-store shopping behavior, the authors study consumer responses
   to 194 HD openings. Although they find that HDs, like large discounters,
   especially appeal to private label prone shoppers and lead to sizable
   incumbent losses, the results confirm that the nature of these losses is
   different. First, HDs do not cause incumbent chains to lose their best
   customers; instead, shoppers who have already visited other chains
   alongside the incumbent are lost. Second, the authors find that chains
   located in close proximity to new HDs do not suffer more from their
   entry. Third, losses are lower for upscale chains and incumbents that
   strongly complement the HD. The authors conclude by discussing
   implications for proper response to HD entry.

AB In a distribution network, a punishment event not only affects the
   disciplined distributor but also changes the attitudes and behaviors of
   others in the network (i.e., observers). By moving beyond a dyadic view
   of punishment, this article considers the effects of punishment on
   observers and integrates insights from social learning, fairness
   heuristic, and social network theories. The resulting framework of the
   observer effects of punishment in a distribution network, empirically
   tested with a survey in China, reveals two mechanisms through which
   punishment leads to reduced observer opportunism: (1) a direct
   deterrence effect and (2) a trust-building process. Moreover, two
   information-related constructs moderate the observer effects
   differently. The disciplined distributor's relational ennbeddedness,
   which motivates greater information flow to observers, aggravates the
   problem of information asymmetry against the manufacturer, making
   punishment less deterrent for observers. In contrast, the manufacturer's
   monitoring capability, which reduces information asymmetry, strengthens
   observer effects. The authors discuss both theoretical and managerial
   implications of using punishment to achieve collaboration from a wide
   network of channel members.

AB Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return
   to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that
   website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use
   of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting
   integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing
   history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external
   websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed
   products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same
   products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing
   generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment
   conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that
   dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their
   generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior
   that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting
   review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One
   explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product
   search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a
   result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when
   they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to
   ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests
   that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers
   should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision
   processes and vary advertising content along these stages.

AB Franchise relationships are prone to conflict. To safeguard the rights
   of individual franchisees, several states have legislated greater
   franchisor disclosure (registration law) ex ante and/or franchisor
   "termination for good cause" (relationship law) ex post. The impact of
   regulatory oversight on franchisor-franchisee conflict, however, remains
   unclear. Relying on agency theory arguments, the authors first assess
   the influence of the regulatory context, both by itself and in
   combination with the franchise ownership structure, on the incidence of
   litigated conflict. Conditional on litigation, they also predict the
   impact of franchise regulation on both the parties' litigation
   initiation and resolution choices and the resulting outcomes. The
   authors test the hypotheses using a unique multisource archival database
   of 411 instances of litigation across 75 franchise systems observed over
   17 years. The results indicate that the regulatory context, by itself as
   well as in combination with the franchise ownership structure,
   significantly shapes parties' conflict management choices. The authors
   also find evidence of a trade-off between prevailing in the particular
   conflict and achieving franchise system growth objectives.

AB The authors examine how different types of relationship deficits
   (emotional vs. social) and time horizon perceptions (expanded vs.
   limited) affect consumers' impulsive behaviors. Emotional deficits refer
   to a lack of intimate attachment, whereas social deficits refer to a
   lack of social connections. Some people view time as expanded, whereas
   others view it as limited. Essential relationship deficits are defined
   as a lack of social connections for people with an expanded time horizon
   and a lack of emotional attachments for people with a limited time
   horizon. Inessential relationship deficits, conversely, are a lack of
   emotional attachments for people with an expanded time horizon and a
   lack of social connections for people with a limited time horizon. The
   authors reveal that people who experience essential relationship
   deficits are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors than those who
   experience inessential relationship deficits, because the experience of
   essential relationship deficits depletes them. The authors report the
   convergent results of impulsive behaviors, both in terms of engagement
   in unplanned behaviors and in terms of preference toward short-term
   gratification across self-reported intentions, as well as actual
   behaviors.

AB Managers, research administrators, and policy makers need a greater
   understanding of the factors that drive employment preferences of
   foreign science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   doctoral graduates of U.S. universities. To address this need, the
   authors report the results of a large multischool conjoint survey of
   return-migration preferences among U.S. STEM doctoral students from
   China. The survey presents the respondents with potential job offers and
   yields individual-level estimates of each respondent's indirect utility
   of a job as a function of location, job status, and salary. The authors
   use a delayed follow-up choice task to demonstrate stability of the
   preference estimates both over time and across response modalities. The
   estimated preferences imply that Chinese doctoral graduates tend to
   remain in the United States because of a large salary disparity between
   the two countries rather than because of an inherent preference for
   locating in the United States. Given these estimated preferences, the
   authors conduct several policy-relevant, counterfactual simulations of
   returnmigration choice and outline effective targeting and positioning
   strategy for attracting Chinese STEM talent.

AB Researchers have recently introduced a finite mixture Bayesian
   regression model to simultaneously identify consumer market segments
   (heterogeneity) and determine how such segments differ with respect to
   active regression coefficients (variable selection). This article
   introduces three extensions of this model to incorporate managerial
   restrictions (constraints). The authors demonstrate with synthetic data
   that the new constrained finite mixture Bayesian regression models can
   be used to identify and represent several constrained heterogeneous
   response patterns commonly encountered in practice. In addition, they
   show that the proposed models are more robust against multicollinearity
   than traditional methods. Finally, to illustrate the proposed models'
   usefulness, the authors apply the proposed constrained models in the
   context of a service quality (SERVPERF) survey of National Insurance
   Company's customers.

AB The authors show, with real and hypothetical payoffs, that consumers are
   willing to pay substantially less for a risky prospect when it is called
   a "lottery ticket," "raffle," "coin flip," or "gamble" than when it is
   labeled a "gift certificate" or "voucher." Willingness to accept, in
   contrast, is not affected by these frames. This differential framing
   effect is the result of an aversion to bad deals, which causes buyers to
   focus on different aspects than sellers. Buyers' willingness to pay is
   influenced by the extent to which a risky prospect's frame is associated
   with risk (Experiment 1) as well as the prospect's lowest (but not
   highest) possible outcome (Experiment 2). Sellers' willingness to
   accept, in contrast, is influenced by a prospect's lowest and highest
   possible outcomes but not by the risk associated with its frame
   (Experiments 2 and 3). The framing effect on willingness to pay is
   independent of the objective level of uncertainty (Experiment 4) and can
   lead to the uncertainty effect. The findings have important implications
   for research on risk preferences and marketing practice.

AB Does the mere crowdedness of the environment affect people's choices and
   preferences? In six studies, the authors show that social crowdedness
   not only leads to greater accessibility of safety-related constructs but
   also results in greater preference for safety-oriented options (e.g.,
   preferring to visit a pharmacy to a convenience store), being more
   receptive to prevention- (rather than promotion-) framed messages, and
   being more risk averse with real money gambles. In support of the
   authors' underlying avoidance motivation perspective, these effects are
   mediated by participants' net prevention focus and are attenuated when
   the crowd in question consists of in-group members. The authors close by
   discussing the practical and theoretical implications of the results.

AB Although the role of social networks and consumer interactions in new
   product diffusion is widely acknowledged, such networks and interactions
   are often unobservable to researchers. What may be observable, instead,
   are aggregate diffusion patterns for past products adopted within a
   particular social network. The authors propose an approach for
   identifying systematic conditions that are stable across diffusions and
   thus are "transferrable" to new product introductions within a given
   network. Using Facebook applications data, the authors show that
   incorporation of such systematic conditions improves prelaunch
   forecasts. This research bridges the gap between the disciplines of
   Bayesian statistics and agent-based modeling by demonstrating how

   in reality, they only subjectively construe a fraction of them as
   valuable. The authors propose that consumers are particularly attracted
   to offers they perceive as more valuable than the marketer presumably
   intended. Consistent with this analysis, six experiments indicate that
   consumers may perceive customized offers that are presented as tailored
   to their individual preferences or circumstances as less valuable than
   offers that seem to fit their preferences and provide value without the
   marketer explicit intent. The experiments also suggest that the urge to
   exploit unintended value reflects a competitive desire to outsmart the

AB News reports carrying positive or negative sentiment about a firm
   influence its stock market performance. This study examines how two
   firm-controllable marketing factors, advertising and marketing
   capability, moderate the relationship between news stories and firm
   stock returns. Analysis of a panel data set of more than 7,000
   firm-month observations indicates asymmetric and complementary
   moderating roles of the two marketing variables: advertising reinforces
   the favorable impact of positive news on abnormal stock returns, and
   marketing capability mitigates the adverse impact of negative news.
   Moreover, these moderating effects operate through different
   stakeholders. Whereas the moderating effect of marketing capability is
   due to its influence on customers and thus affects the level and
   volatility of future cash flows, advertising moderates the effect of
   news through individual investors' attention and response to the news.
   The econometric analysis accounts for potential endogeneity between news
   reports, stock returns, and marketing variables, and the results are
   robust to alternative measures and analysis approaches. The findings
   suggest the need for managers to broaden their stakeholder focus when
   evaluating advertising's returns and to communicate the value of
   marketing capability to investors.

AB This article argues that the structure of a choice set can influence the
   extent to which consumers weight a given attribute. The results of seven
   experiments suggest that the relationship between options under
   consideration can influence preference ordering by shifting the decision
   strategy people adopt when constructing their preference. In decisions
   in which people afford greater importance to one attribute versus
   another, preference for an option that scores high on this prominent
   attribute may decrease when decoy options that are clearly better or
   worse than the focal options are inserted into the choice set. The
   authors posit that this effect arises because decision makers initially
   (and spontaneously) use dominance cues rather than prominence when
   evaluating options, and they continue to use this strategy even when it
   does not enable them to differentiate the alternatives under
   consideration. The authors moderate this effect by prompting respondents
   to consider prominence and by manipulating the order in which
   respondents evaluate options in the choice set. This article has
   theoretical implications for research on context effects, contingent
   decision behavior, and choice architecture as well as practical
   implications for product-line management.

   closely related, exchangeable resources, financially dissatisfied people
   may be motivated to replenish their need for financial resources by

   support for this hypothesis across various measures of caloric desire

AB The authors propose a method and metric to quantify the consumer
   confusion between leading brands and copycat brands that results from
   the visual similarity of their packaging designs. The method has three
   components. First, image processing techniques establish the objective
   similarity of the packages of leading and copycat brands on the basis of
   their colors and textures. Second, a perceptual decision task (triangle
   test) assesses the accuracy and speed with which consumers can identify
   differences between brands from rapidly (300 milliseconds) flashed
   images of their packages. Third, a competing accumulator model describes
   the buildup of evidence on each of the alternative brands during
   consumers' perceptual decisions and predicts the accuracy and response
   time of brand identification. Jointly, these components establish the
   impact of copycat packaging's visual features on consumer confusion. The
   method is applied in a test of experimentally designed copycats and
   market copycats in 15 product categories. A three-tiered metric ("copy
   alert," "copy watch," and "copy safe") establishes the extent to which
   copycat brands imitate the package designs of target brands and
   identifies which visual features are responsible.

AB Each month, millions of women experience an ovulatory cycle that
   regulates fertility. Previous consumer research has found that this
   cycle influences women's clothing and food preferences. The authors
   propose that the ovulatory cycle actually has a much broader effect on
   women's economic behavior. Drawing on theory in evolutionary psychology,
   the authors hypothesize that the week-long period near ovulation should
   boost women's desire for relative status, which should alter their
   economic decisions. Findings from three studies show that women near
   ovulation seek positional goods to improve their social standing.
   Additional findings reveal that ovulation leads women to pursue
   positional goods when doing so improves relative standing compared with
   other women but not compared with men. When playing the dictator game,
   for example, ovulating women gave smaller offers to a female partner but
   not to a male partner. Overall, women's monthly hormonal fluctuations
   seem to have a substantial effect on consumer behavior by systematically
   altering their positional concerns, a finding that has important
   implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers.

AB Technology enables a firm to produce a granular record of every
   touchpoint consumers make in their online purchase journey before they
   convert at the firm's website. However, firms still depend on aggregate
   measures to guide their marketing investments in multiple online
   channels (e.g., display, paid search, referral, e-mail). This article
   introduces a methodology to attribute the incremental value of each
   marketing channel in an online environment using individual-level data
   of customers' touches. The authors propose a measurement model to
   analyze customers' (1) consideration of online channels, (2) visits
   through these channels over time, and (3) subsequent purchases at the
   website to estimate the carryover and spillover effects of prior touches
   at both the visit and purchase stages. The authors use the estimated
   carryover and spillover effects to attribute the conversion credit to
   different channels and find that these channels' relative contributions
   are significantly different from those found by other currently used
   metrics. A field study validates the proposed model's ability to
   estimate the incremental impact of a channel on conversions. In
   targeting customers with different patterns of touches in their purchase
   funnel, these estimates help identify cases in which retargeting
   strategies may actually decrease conversion probabilities.

   the strength of that relationship. The empirical context is Quirky.com,

   products. The data include descriptions of the raw ideas as originally
   proposed, the ultimate product designs that resulted from those ideas,
   and sales figures. In addition, they contain two measures of idea
   quality: those from online consumer panelists and those from expert
   evaluators. The authors note the following findings: First, online
   consumer panels are a better way to determine a "good" idea than are
   ratings by experts. Second, predictions with samples as small as 20
   consumers are reliable. Third, there is a stronger predictive link
   between raw ideas and consumers' purchase intent of final product
   designs than there is between those intentions and market outcomes.
   Fourth, the commercial importance of the raw idea is large, with ideas

   increased, which influences deal liking and ultimately has an impact on

AB The authors investigate the role of market orientation in advertising
   spending during economic contraction. They use the 2001 economic
   collapse in Turkey as the empirical context in which to test hypotheses
   regarding why some firms increase their advertising spending in a
   contraction period while the majority of firms cut back. Analyzing
   market orientation at the level of its intelligence and responsiveness
   facets, they find the responsiveness facet to be positively associated
   with increases in advertising spending but observe the intelligence
   facet to be negatively associated with advertising spending.
   Importantly, positive shifts in advertising spending during the economic
   contraction predict better subsequent business performance. The opposing
   roles of the intelligence and responsiveness facets disappear in a
   subsequent economic expansion period. These findings have managerial and
   theoretical implications. Firms that nurture the responsiveness facet of
   market orientation during economic contractions go against the tide to
   increase their advertising spending and experience the performance
   benefits that such countercyclical actions can amass.

AB Two-thirds of adolescent and young adult smokers become lifetime
   smokers, and one-half of those lifetime smokers will die from this
   habit. The authors examine alternative persuasive pathways to thoughts
   of quitting taken by adolescent and young adult smokers when exposed to
   graphic visual health warnings on cigarette packages. For adolescent
   smokers, the authors find that graphic warnings and smoking frequency
   affect fear, and fear influences negative health beliefs about smoking,
   ultimately increasing thoughts of quitting. They also find that the
   graphic warning and a graphic warning x smoking frequency interaction
   have incremental effects on quit thoughts beyond the effects of fear and
   negative health beliefs. Using a longitudinal design with a sample of
   young adult smokers, the authors find support for many of the adolescent
   smoker findings, particularly the incremental effects of graphicness and
   its interaction with smoking frequency. These similar results from
   diverse samples support the use of graphic visual warnings but suggest
   that effects are attenuated for those who smoke the most. The authors
   offer implications for countermarketing programs and public health
   policy.

AB The authors propose that static visuals can evoke a perception of
   movement (i.e., dynamic imagery) and thereby affect consumer engagement
   and attitudes. Focusing on brand logos as the static visual element, the
   authors measure the perceived movement evoked by the logo and
   demonstrate that the evoked dynamic imagery affects the level of
   consumer engagement with the brand logo. They measure consumer
   engagement through both self-report measures and eye-tracking technology
   and find that engagement affects consumer attitudes toward the brand.
   The authors also show that the perceived movement engagement attitude
   effect is moderated by the congruence between perceived movement and
   brand characteristics. These findings suggest that dynamic imagery is an
   important aspect of logo design, and if used carefully, it can enhance
   brand attitudes.

AB People often use price as a proxy for quality, resulting in a positive
   correlation between prices and product liking, known as the
   "price-quality" (P-Q) heuristic. Using data from three experiments
   conducted at a winery, this article offers a more complex and complete
   reference-dependent model of the relationship between price and quality.
   The authors propose that higher prices set higher expectations, which
   serve as reference points. When expectations are met or exceeded, we
   observe the familiar P-Q relationship. However, when price is high and
   quality is relatively low, the product falls short of consumers'
   reference point and the P-Q relationship is reversed; thus, people
   evaluate a low-quality product with a high price more negatively than a
   low-quality product with a low price. Using the results of a field
   experiment, the authors discuss implications for pricing considerations
   and profitability.

AB The present research examines how the inclusion of consolation or token
   prizes influences consumers' valuation of a promotional lottery. Results
   from four experiments show that consolation prizes lower consumers'
   expectations of winning the big prize, their valuations of the lottery,
   and their intentions to participate in the lottery. Because of the high
   likelihood of attaining the consolation prizes, consumers shift their
   focus from the value of a big prize to the probability of attaining it.
   This shift increases the weight given to the probability dimension and
   results in lowered valuations of the lottery. The first two experiments
   demonstrate the effect in hypothetical and real choices. In Experiment
   3, the authors propose and show a boundary condition for the effect. In
   Experiment 4, they conduct an exploratory test of the process. They
   conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial
   implications.

AB In general, consumers enjoy products less with repeated consumption.
   Unfortunately, there are few known ways to slow such satiation. The
   authors show that consumers satiate more slowly on a product when it is
   available for consumption only at limited times. Specifically, they find
   that perceived limited availability made a product more enjoyable, and
   yet this effect largely emerged only after repeated consumption. The
   authors attribute this finding to an urge to take advantage of a rare
   consumption opportunity, which leads people to pay less attention to the
   quantity consumed and subsequently to experience less satiation. A
   series of studies establish the effect of perceived limited availability
   on the rate of satiation, show that it influences how much people eat,
   provide mediation evidence of the proposed theoretical account, and
   eliminate the effect by making salient the total amount consumed. The
   authors conclude with implications of these findings.

AB Marketers regularly remind consumers of valued social relationships
   (e.g., close friends, family, romantic couples) to influence choice and
   consumption. However, the author's research reveals that such
   relationship reminders can backfire when consumers lack or no longer
   have these highlighted relationships. The author shows that reminding
   consumers of relationships they lack reduces their perceptions of
   deservingness and causes them to restrict indulgent consumption. Five
   studies establish the effect of relationship reminders on indulgence and
   provide support for the underlying process by both measuring and
   manipulating perceptions of deservingness.

AB When consumers struggle with a difficult task, using a brand can help
   them perform better. The authors report four studies showing that brand
   use can enhance feelings of self-efficacy, which can lead to better task
   performance. Students scored higher on difficult Graduate Records
   Examination questions when they took the test using a Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology pen (Study 1) and showed better athletic
   performance when they drank water from a Gatorade cup during strenuous
   athletic exercise (Studies 2 and 3). These increases in task performance
   were mediated by feelings of self-efficacy (Studies 3 and 4).
   Furthermore, the results show that not everyone experiences the
   beneficial effect of brand use; it depends on the person's implicit
   self-theory. Across studies, users adopting entity theories ("entity
   theorists") showed increased self-efficacy and better task performance,
   whereas users adopting incremental theories ("incremental theorists")
   were unaffected by brand use.

AB Unlike sales data, data on intermediate stages of the purchase funnel
   (e.g., how many consumers have searched for information about a product
   before purchase) are much more difficult to acquire. Consequently, most
   advertising response models have focused directly on sales and ignored
   other purchase funnel activities. The authors demonstrate, in the
   context of the U.S. automotive market, how consumer online search volume
   data from Google Trends can be combined with sales data to decompose
   advertising's overall impact into two underlying components: its impacts
   on (1) generating consumer interest in prepurchase information search
   and (2) converting that interest into sales. The authors show that this
   decompositional approach, implemented through a novel state-space model
   that simultaneously examines sales and search volumes, offers important
   advantages over a benchmark model that considers sales data alone.
   First, the approach improves goodness-of-fit, both in and out of sample.
   Second, it improves diagnosticity by distinguishing advertising
   effectiveness in interest generation from its effectiveness in interest
   conversion. Third, the authors find that overall advertising elasticity
   can be biased if researchers consider only sales data.

AB Extant preference measurement research, including conjoint analysis, has
   been silent on the explicit influence of others in the formation of
   consumer preferences. This article proposes a new holistic framework of
   preference, "PIE," as well as a measurement method to remedy this
   problem. The new paradigm posits that consumers evaluate products on the
   basis of different "needs" determined by three sources: (1) P, the
   physical attributes of the product; (2) I, the individual
   characteristics of the choice maker; and (3) E, characteristics of an
   external peer group. To provide an empirically feasible method to
   capture all three sources of information, the authors propose and test
   an incentive-aligned approach, a "group-sourced mechanism," which mimics
   a consumer's real-life consultation in the presence of his or her
   friends when making a purchase decision. The results provide support for
   the PIE framework, including superior predictive performance in a
   conjoint task that is "stacked against it." The authors also show how
   firms can apply the PIE framework for product design. Practitioners,
   however, must carefully weigh the benefits of the group-sourced
   preference measurement with the heavier cognitive burden on the
   respondents in completing the task.

AB The authors document that approximately 5% of product reviews on a large
   private label retailer's website are submitted by customers with no
   record of ever purchasing the product they are reviewing. These reviews
   are significantly more negative than other reviews. They are also less
   likely to contain expressions describing the fit or feel of the items
   and more likely to contain linguistic cues associated with deception.
   More than 12,000 of the firm's best customers have written reviews
   without confirmed transactions. On average, these customers have each
   made more than 150 purchases from the firm. This makes it unlikely that
   the reviews were written by the employees or agents of a competitor and
   suggests that deceptive reviews may not be limited to the strategic
   actions of firms. Instead, the phenomenon may be far more prevalent,
   extending to individual customers who have no financial incentive to
   influence product ratings.

AB Mobile advertising is one of the fastest-growing advertising formats. In
   2013, global spending on mobile advertising was approximately $16.7
   billion, and it is expected to exceed $62.8 billion by 2017. The most
   prevalent type of mobile advertising is mobile display advertising
   (MDA), which takes the form of banners on mobile web pages and in mobile
   applications. This article examines which product characteristics are
   likely to be associated with MDA campaigns that are effective in
   increasing consumers' (1) favorable attitudes toward products and (2)
   purchase intentions. Data from a large-scale test-control field
   experiment covering 54 U.S. MDA campaigns that ran between 2007 and 2010
   and involved 39,946 consumers show that MDA campaigns significantly
   increased consumers' favorable attitudes and purchase intentions only
   when the campaigns advertised products that were higher (vs. lower)
   involvement and utilitarian (vs. hedonic). The authors explain this
   finding using established theories of information processing and
   persuasion and suggest that when MDAs work effectively, they do so by
   triggering consumers to recall and process previously stored product
   information.

   however, encourages people to share content that is useful to the
   message recipient. These effects are driven by communicators' focus of
   attention. People naturally tend to focus on the self, but communicating
   with just one person heightens other-focus, which leads communicators to
   share less self-presenting content and more useful content. These
   findings shed light on the drivers of word of mouth and provide insight
   into when the communication sender (vs. receiver) plays a relatively
   larger role in what people share.

AB When should sales managers employ group incentives rather than
   individual incentives to motivate their sales force? Using economic
   experiments, the authors show that two-person group incentives can
   outperform individual incentives and that the relative efficacy of group
   incentives depends on three important factors. First, the strength of
   social ties among the group members matters. Effort decisions in
   group-based incentives increase significantly when members socialize
   briefly before committing effort. Second, the design of the group
   incentive matters. For the group incentive to work better than the
   individual incentive, the group-based component (i.e., how much the
   payment scheme weights the contribution of others) in the former cannot
   be too large. Third, the informational feedback that group members
   receive matters. When socialized group members can observe one another's
   true effort, rather than only their output, effort surprisingly
   decreases. The authors show that a model that accounts for social
   preferences and the psychological loss that occurs when teammates
   underestimate one's effort can explain salesperson behavior in group
   incentives well.

AB When patronizing stores, consumers may exhibit loyalty not only to a
   retail chain but also to a specific outlet. This distinction is
   important in a dynamic retail environment: if a store changes ownership,
   chain loyalty makes customers inclined to seek out another outlet of the
   former chain, whereas outlet loyalty enhances their stay rate after the
   takeover. This article distinguishes the two forms of loyalty
   conceptually and discusses how both can be identified empirically in a
   model of consumers' reactions to store acquisitions. The authors
   estimate their model on unique scanner panel data covering +/- 200 local
   markets and takeovers. The results confirm that after an acquisition,
   consumers exhibit outlet loyalty, regardless of changes in chain and
   marketing mix. Counterfactual simulations point to important managerial
   implications. Acquiring outlets with a clientele in place leads to
   higher store traffic levels than the new owner could otherwise reach.
   Notably, these benefits cannot be reaped if the acquiring chain is a
   hard discounter, in which case customers' previous store knowledge is
   less relevant, and incentives to seek out new outlets are greater.

AB It is well established that differences in manufacturing location can
   affect consumer preferences through lay inferences about production
   quality. In this article, the authors take a different approach to this
   topic by demonstrating how beliefs in contagion (the notion that objects
   may acquire a special aura or "essence" from their past) influence
   perceptions of authenticity for everyday consumer products and brands.
   Specifically, they find that due to a belief in contagion, products from
   a company's original manufacturing location are viewed as containing the
   essence of the brand. In turn, this belief in transferred essence leads
   consumers to view products from the original factory as more authentic
   and valuable than identical products made elsewhere. The authors further
   reveal that consumers who are higher in sensitivity to contagion are
   more likely to exhibit this effect and that activating the concept of
   contagion enhances preferences for products made in the brand's original
   factory. The authors close by discussing theoretical and practical
   implications of these findings.

AB Frederick, Lee, and Baskin (2014) and Yang and Lynn (2014) argue that
   the conditions for obtaining the attraction effect are so restrictive
   that the practical validity of the attraction effect should be
   questioned. In this commentary, the authors first ground the attraction
   (asymmetric dominance) effect in its historical context as a test of an
   important theoretical assumption from rational choice theory. Drawing on
   the research reported by scholars from many fields of study, the authors
   argue that the finding of an asymmetric dominance effect remains robust
   because it holds when the conditions of the study are essentially
   replicated. Next, the authors identify some of the factors that mitigate
   (and amplify) the attraction effect and then position the effect into a
   larger theoretical debate involving the extent to which preferences are
   constructed versus merely revealed. The authors conclude by arguing that
   researchers who try to measure values as well as choice architects who
   attempt to shape values must be sensitive to the context-dependent
   properties of choice behavior, as illustrated by the attraction effect.

AB In this research, the authors jointly model the sentiment expressed in
   social media posts and the venue format to which it was posted as two
   interrelated processes in an effort to provide a measure of underlying
   brand sentiment Using social media data from firms in two distinct
   industries, they allow the content of the post and the underlying
   sentiment toward the brand to affect both processes. The results show
   that the inferences marketing researchers obtain from monitoring social
   media are dependent on where they "listen" and that common approaches
   that either focus on a single social media venue or ignore differences
   across venues in aggregated data can lead to misleading brand sentiment
   metrics. The authors validate the approach by comparing their
   model-based measure of brand sentiment with performance measures
   obtained from external data sets (stock prices for both brands and an
   offline brand-tracking study for one brand). They find that their
   measure of sentiment serves as a leading indicator of the changes
   observed in these external data sources and outperforms other social
   media metrics currently used.

AB The rise of new media is helping marketers evolve from digital to
   interactive marketing, which facilitates a two-way communication between
   marketers and customers without intruding on their privacy. However,
   while research has examined the drivers of customers' opt-in and opt-out
   decisions, it has investigated neither the timing of the two decisions
   nor the influence of transactional activity on the length of time a
   customer stays with an e-mail program. In this study, the authors adopt
   a multivariate copula model using a pair-copula construction method to
   jointly model opt-in time (from a customer's first purchase to the
   opt-in decision), opt-out time (from the opt-in decision to the opt-out
   decision), and average transaction amount. Through such multivariate
   dependences, this model significantly improves the predictive
   performance of the opt-out time in comparison with several benchmark
   models. The study offers several important findings: (1) marketing
   intensity affects opt-in and opt-out times, (2) customers with certain
   characteristics are more or less likely to opt in or opt out, and (3)
   firms can extend customer opt-out time and increase customer spending
   level by strategically allocating resources.

AB First experiences are highly influential. Here, the authors show that
   nonfirst experiences can be made to seem like firsts and, consequently,
   to have a disproportionate influence on judgment. In six experiments,
   one piece of a series of information was framed to appear to have
   "first" status: For example, a weather report that appeared at the end
   of a sequence of weather reports happened to correspond to the first day
   of a vacation, and a customer review that appeared at the end of a
   sequence of hotel reviews happened to be the new year's first review.
   Such information had greater influence on subsequent judgments (e.g., of
   the next day's weather, of the hotel's quality) than identical
   information not framed as a first. This effect seems to arise largely
   because "phantom first" pieces of information receive greater weight,
   but not necessarily more attention, than other pieces of information.

AB Previous research has found that people tend to avoid products or
   behaviors that are linked to dissociative reference groups. The present
   research demonstrates conditions under which consumers exhibit similar
   behaviors to dissociative out-group members in the domain of positive
   consumption behaviors. In particular, when a consumer learns that a
   dissociative out-group performs comparatively well on a positive
   behavior, the consumer is more likely to respond with positive
   intentions and actions when the setting is public (vs. private). The
   authors suggest that this occurs because learning of the successful
   performance of a dissociative out-group under public conditions
   threatens the consumer's group image and activates the desire to present
   the group image in a positive light. The authors show that although
   group affirmation mitigates these effects, self-affirmation does not.
   They also examine the moderating role of the positivity of the behavior
   and the mediating role of group image motives. Taken together, the
   results highlight conditions under which communicating information about
   the behaviors of dissociative out-groups can be used to spur consumers
   to engage in positive actions.

   influence both the choice decisions and the postpurchase satisfaction:
   the time gap between purchase and consumption, distance between purchase
   and consumption, and time of purchase (business/nonbusiness hours). The
   authors incorporate these three circumstantial variables into a formal
   two-stage economic model and find that consumers who travel farther and
   make reservations during business hours are more likely to select
   higher-quality hotels but are less satisfied. Consumers who book earlier
   are more likely to select higher-quality hotels and are more satisfied.
   The findings suggest that incorporating circumstantial variables into

AB Online chatter, or user-generated content, constitutes an excellent
   emerging source for marketers to mine meaning at a high temporal
   frequency. This article posits that this meaning consists of extracting
   the key latent dimensions of consumer satisfaction with quality and
   ascertaining the valence, labels, validity, importance, dynamics, and
   heterogeneity of those dimensions. The authors propose a unified
   framework for this purpose using unsupervised latent Dirichlet
   allocation. The sample of user-generated content consists of rich data
   on product reviews across 15 firms in five markets over four years. The
   results suggest that a few dimensions with good face validity and
   external validity are enough to capture quality. Dynamic analysis
   enables marketers to track dimensions' importance over time and allows
   for dynamic mapping of competitive brand positions on those dimensions
   over time. For vertically differentiated markets (e.g., mobile phones,
   computers), objective dimensions dominate and are similar across
   markets, heterogeneity is low across dimensions, and stability is high
   over time. For horizontally differentiated markets (e.g., shoes, toys),
   subjective dimensions dominate but vary across markets, heterogeneity is
   high across dimensions, and stability is low over time.

   activity after a keyword search is low and heavily concentrated on the
   organic list. However, searches of less popular keywords (i.e., keywords
   with lower search volume) are associated with more clicks per search and
   a larger fraction of sponsored clicks. This indicates that, compared

AB Consumer research has documented dozens of instances in which the
   introduction of an "irrelevant" third option affects preferences between
   the remaining two. In nearly all such cases, the unattractive dominated
   option enhances the attractiveness of the option it most resembles a
   phenomenon known as the "attraction effect." In the studies presented
   here, however, the authors contend that this phenomenon may be
   restricted to stylized product representations in which every product
   dimension is represented by a number (e.g., a toaster oven that has a
   durability rating of 7.2 and ease of cleaning rating of 5.5). Such
   effects do not typically occur when consumers experience the product
   (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is
   represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose
   quality is depicted with a photo). The authors posit that perceptual
   representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons
   that drive the attraction effect with highly stylized examples, and they
   question the practical significance of the effect.

AB The likelihood of replicating an effect such as asymmetric dominance
   (AD) largely depends on other, usually more important choice drivers
   (e.g., attributes, values). Accordingly, it is not surprising that the
   AD effect is often not observed when other choice drivers have greater
   impact and/or when the AD configuration is unlikely to be perceived.
   However, when price is an attribute (and in many other cases), the AD
   effect is often observed in both properly designed studies and the real
   world. The author notes that Frederick, Lee, and Baskin (2014) raise
   important questions, but they would have made a greater contribution had
   they (1) systematically studied the drivers of AD perceptions, (2) more
   accurately tried to replicate previous AD effect demonstrations, and (3)
   systematically studied the repulsion effect. The author also briefly
   comments on the Yang and Lynn (2014) studies, which he asserts did not

   metrics such as sales volume, revenue, and manager evaluations to assess
   and manage a sales force. However, businesses are moving from a
   product-centric to a customer-centric view and from a backward-looking
   to a forward-looking strategic perspective, so sales organizations must
   adapt to the ever-changing marketplace to maximize performance. The
   authors propose a forward-looking and profit-oriented metric to evaluate
   and demonstrate the effects of training type and incentive type on a
   salesperson's future value. Using a latent class modeling approach, they
   identify two distinct segments in the sales force that exhibit different
   responses to varying levels of training and incentives. This suggests
   that a one-size-fits-all approach to sales force management may be
   suboptimal. Finally, the authors also evaluate the magnitude of the
   proposed effects in the short run as well as the long run and show that
   the magnitudes of the effects could vary depending on the time horizon
   being considered. The authors close with a discussion of the

AB Pay-for-performance (P4P) pricing schemes such as pay per click and pay
   per action have increased in popularity in Internet advertising.
   Meanwhile, pay-per-impression (PPI) schemes persist, and several
   publishers have begun to offer a hybrid mix of PPI and P4P schemes.
   Given the proliferation of pricing schemes, this study examines the
   optimal choices for publishers. The authors highlight two-sided
   information asymmetries in online advertising markets and the consequent
   trade-offs faced by a high-quality publisher using P4P schemes.
   Pay-for-performance schemes enable a high-quality publisher to reveal
   its superior quality; however, such schemes may incur allocative
   inefficiencies stemming from inaccurate estimates of advertiser
   qualities. The authors identify conditions under which a publisher may
   opt for a PPI, P4P, or hybrid scheme and, in doing so, provide
   theoretical explanations for the observed variations in the pricing
   schemes and the increasing popularity of hybrid schemes. Using a new
   "uncompromised" equilibrium refinement, the authors find that the hybrid
   scheme can emerge as an equilibrium choice in a variety of conditions.
   In addition, they provide prescriptive guidelines for firms choosing

AB Research on new ventures has indicated that poorly conducted marketing
   is among the main reasons for new venture failure. To acquire urgently
   needed initial funding, new ventures strive to conform to investors'
   expectations of appropriate marketing capabilities because these
   capabilities may endow them with legitimacy in the eyes of potential
   investors. Drawing on organizational legitimacy and human resource
   theory, the authors argue that the characteristics of the chief
   marketing officer (CMO) may endow new ventures with marketing
   legitimacy. Employing a two-stage selection hazard rate analysis to
   simultaneously account for potential selection bias and right-censored
   observations, the authors analyze a comprehensive data set of 2,945
   high-technology new ventures. Bearing in mind that this research is a
   first exploratory attempt to illuminate the role of marketing for new
   venture funding using correlational secondary data, the results indicate
   that CMO education, marketing experience, and industry experience are
   positively related to the likelihood of funding. Moreover, the
   relationships between CMO characteristics and funding are contingent on
   task-related uncertainty and industry legitimacy. These findings provide
   initial insights for entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and public
   policy makers.

AB The current marketing environment is characterized by a surge in
   multichannel shopping and increasing choice of advertising channels.
   This situation requires firms to understand how advertising in one
   channel (e.g., online) influences sales in another channel (e.g.,
   offline). This article studies the presence, magnitude, and carryover of
   these cross-channel effects for online advertising (display and search)
   and traditional media. The analysis considers how these advertising
   expenditures translate directly into sales, as well as indirectly
   through intermediate search advertising metrics-namely, impressions and
   click-through rate. For a high-end clothing and apparel retailer, the
   authors find that cross effects exist and are important and that
   cross-effect elasticities are almost as high as own-effect elasticities.
   Online display and, in particular, search advertising is more effective
   than traditional advertising. This result is primarily due to strong
   cross effects on the offline channel. Return-on-investment calculations
   suggest that by ignoring these cross effects, firms substantially
   miscalculate the effectiveness of online advertising. Notably, the
   authors find that traditional advertising decreases paid search
   click-through rates, thus reducing the net cross effect of traditional
   advertising.

AB Marketers frequently offer a variety of communications, brands, and
   service encounters that customers evaluate sequentially. When customers
   make these evaluations, their previous experiences in the sequence
   influence their current evaluation. The authors propose that these prior
   experiences serve as multiple reference points against which the target
   stimulus is judged, creating rival co-occurring comparison effects.
   Using real-world and experimental data, they find that assimilation and
   contrast effects occur simultaneously: there is assimilation to the
   first score within a sequence and contrast with the immediate
   predecessor as well as with extremes experienced earlier in the
   sequence. The authors document the moderating effects of extreme first
   stimuli, domain similarity, and individual factors of mood and
   expertise. They provide different recommendations for sequence
   construction on the basis of whether the marketer's goal is fairness,
   accuracy, or influencing choice. This research is unique in (1) showing
   how several preceding evaluations can each have an impact on a
   subsequent evaluation at the same time and (2) using real-world data to

AB Many advertisers are reluctant to shift a large proportion of their
   advertising budgets to the Internet because they still view television
   advertising as the main vehicle for building a brand. Using a unique and
   rich data set comprising 20 campaigns across a variety of industries,
   this study demonstrates that Internet ads perform on par with television
   ads on the brand-building metrics that advertisers use and trust. The
   authors extend traditional brand-message recall measurements to
   facilitate comparisons between Internet formats and television by
   supplementing brand-message surveys conducted during the campaign with a
   set of precampaign surveys to control for preexisting brand knowledge.
   They find that accounting for differences in preexisting brand knowledge
   is paramount in obtaining valid comparisons across advertising formats
   because people who are exposed to Internet display ads have
   significantly lower levels of preexisting brand knowledge than
   television viewers. Without considering the differences in these
   "initial conditions," television advertising seems to be more effective
   than advertising on the Internet, but when the preexisting differences
   among media formats are taken into account, the brand recall lift
   measures for Internet ads are statistically indistinguishable from
   comparable television lift measures.

AB In brand imitation lawsuits, the primary focus is on demonstrating harm
   as it relates to brand confusion. The authors' premise is that such a
   narrow focus does not capture the complete impact of brand imitation.
   They offer a broader, theory-based perspective of harm by proposing that
   brand imitation affects both brand consideration and preference in the
   consumer choice process. The authors establish a formal nexus between
   brand consideration and the legal doctrine "initial interest confusion."
   Using choice experiments and statistical modeling, they show that brand
   imitation harms the imitated brand even after controlling for brand
   confusion. Moreover, brand imitation harms not only the imitated brand
   but also other national brands in the category that are not being
   imitated. To quantify brand consideration and preference harm in
   financial terms, the authors propose two metrics: choice share shift and
   share-equalizing price cut. The results show that brand imitation harms
   the national brand more when the imitating brand is not associated with
   a well-known retailer and that brand imitation harm extends beyond brand
   confusion. The proposed framework provides both legal and managerial
   guidance.

   value that a brand provides to a firm through its effects on the
   attitudes and behaviors of its employees-and empirically demonstrates
   its significance on executive pay. Executives value being associated
   with strong brands and, therefore, accept substantially lower pay at
   firms that own strong brands. Consistent with identity theory, this
   effect is stronger for chief executive officers and younger executives
   than for other executives. Data from a large, cross-industry sample of
   executives suggest that academics and practitioners should take a
   broader view of the contributions of brand-related investments to firm
   value and make use of strong brands in pay negotiations that are
   typically viewed as being outside the realm of marketing.

AB One of the key challenges in empirically modeling the total impact of

   marketing metrics data over time. The author presents an approach for
   estimating the total financial impact of marketing assets with limited
   time-series data and demonstrates the approach with an application to
   brand equity research. Consistent with prior research, the aggregate
   analyses indicate that brand equity, as measured by customer mindset
   metrics, positively affects current financial performance. In addition,
   the author documents brand equity's significant and much greater impact
   on the firm's future financial performance: at the aggregate, only a
   small portion of the total financial impact of brand equity is reflected
   in current-year profits, whereas the bulk of the profitability impact is
   realized in the future. Most importantly, however, the analyses document
   significant heterogeneity of these effects: in some industries, the
   entire direct impact is contemporaneous, whereas in others, no
   contemporaneous effects are observed and all of the profitability impact
   occurs in the future.

AB Do customers exhibit recurring behaviors beyond repeat purchases? If so,
   what are those behaviors, how are they formed, and why should marketers
   care? The authors apply the theory of habit to customer behavior in the
   context of a large customer data set of a national retailer. They find
   that (1) beyond repeat purchases, customers' recurring behavior with
   respect to returning products, purchasing on promotion, and purchasing
   low-margin items can be quantified along a continuum of habit strength;
   (2) marketing has a temporal impact on the formation of different
   customers' habits; and (3) customers' purchase and promotion habits
   positively affect firm performance (by $58 million), whereas return and
   low-margin purchase habits negatively affect firm performance (by $62
   million). The findings underscore the need for managers to consider
   customer habits beyond repeat purchases, take stock of customers' habit
   measures before implementing policy changes, and leverage the habit
   measures (as compared with using only traditional behavioral measures)
   to strategically allocate resources at the customer level to maximize

   The results show that support for small brands goes up when faced with a
   competitive threat from large brands versus when they are in competition
   with brands that are similar to them or when consumers view them outside
   a competitive context. This support translates into purchase intentions,
   real purchases, and more favorable online reviews in a study of more

AB Customizing a product by choosing each of its attributes individually
   tends to be onerous for consumers, and the benefits of product
   customization may thus be offset by an increase in choice complexity. As
   a remedy for this dilemma, the current research introduces the
   customization via starting solutions (CvSS) architecture, which
   substantially reduces the complexity of product customization while
   preserving all of its advantages. Under CvSS, consumers first select one
   starting solution from a set of prespecified products, which they then
   refine to create their final customized product. Evidence from nine
   studies (three of which were conducted in field settings) across a wide
   range of product domains (shirts, cars, vacation packages, jewelry, and
   financial products) shows that the CvSS architecture results in
   substantial benefits relative to the standard attribute-by-attribute
   product customization format for both consumers (increased satisfaction
   with their product choices, reduced choice complexity, and enhanced
   mental simulation of product use) and firms (purchases of more
   feature-rich, and thus higher-priced, products).

   the cost that such ads incur (e.g., causing website abandonment). Across
   three empirical studies, the authors address two primary questions: (1)
   What is the economic cost of annoying ads to publishers? and (2) What is
   the cognitive impact of annoying ads to users? First, the authors
   conduct a preliminary study to identify sets of more and less annoying
   ads. Second, in a field experiment, they calculate the compensating
   differential, that is, the amount of money a publisher would need to pay
   users to generate the same number of impressions in the presence of
   annoying ads as it would generate in their absence. Third, the authors
   conduct a mouse-tracking study to investigate how annoying ads affect
   reading processes. They conclude that in plausible scenarios, the
   practice of running annoying ads can cost more money than it earns.

AB Featured price cuts are a popular tool among brand manufacturers and
   retailers. However, there is increasing concern about the net sales and
   revenue gains from these promotions, because retailers and manufacturers
   may simply be subsidizing consumers who shop around. Thus, the
   (co-)occurrence of a brand's promotions across retailers has been placed
   high on the promotion-planning agenda. This article examines the
   mechanisms underlying out-of-phase versus in-phase schedules and
   empirically demonstrates their sales and revenue implications in four
   product categories, covering purchases of a national panel of households
   across eight years. The results reveal that calendar effects primarily
   materialize in categories in which the chosen retailer is driven by
   brand promotions. In those categories, alternating the timing of
   featured price cuts across chains substantially increases the
   manufacturer and retailers' immediate sales lift. However, with regard
   to net gains, striving for out-of-phase promotions-the dominant approach
   among chains-is not necessarily the best practice, because retailers
   observe the revenue advantage diminish, and manufacturers may even earn
   less.

   when the two are combined as an unhealthy label surcharge, they reduce

   choices. From a policy and government perspective, if the goal is to

   incentives, in which matching is made contingent on the percentage of

   that matches "kick in" only if 75% of others donate) is most effective
   in increasing commitment to recurring donations. An online experiment
   reveals that the 75% contingent match drives commitment to recurring
   donations because it simultaneously provides social proof while offering
   a low enough target to remain plausible that the match will occur. A

   overall perception of scarcity versus overall perception of abundance
   increases choice share of the most-preferred item from a product class.
   They argue that this phenomenon occurs because scarcity induces arousal
   and the heightened arousal polarizes the evaluations of individual items
   contained in the choice set. The results from five experiments show that
   scarcity versus abundance broadens the discrepancy between the liking of
   the favorite and nonfavorite items and leads to a greater choice share
   of the favorite item. The findings provide support for the arousal-based
   explanation, showing that the effect of scarcity salience on choices is
   mediated by consumers' reported arousal level and moderated by an

AB People often brag about, or advertise, their good deeds to others. Seven
   studies investigate how bragging about prosocial behavior affects
   perceived generosity. The authors propose that bragging conveys
   information about an actor's good deeds, leading to an attribution of
   generosity. However, bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a
   desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus,
   bragging has a positive effect when prosocial behavior is unknown
   because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However,
   bragging does not help-and often hurts-when prosocial behavior is
   already known, because it signals a selfish motive. In addition, the
   authors demonstrate that conspicuous cause marketing products have
   effects akin to bragging by signaling an impure motive for doing good
   deeds. Finally, the authors argue that bragging about prosocial behavior
   is unique because it undermines the precise information that the
   braggart is trying to convey (generosity). In contrast, bragging about
   personal achievements does not affect perceptions of the focal trait
   conveyed in the brag. These findings underscore the strategic
   considerations inherent in signaling altruism.

   conceptual construal, whereas those who perceive themselves to be
   physically "low" are more likely to adopt a local perceptual processing
   and lower level of conceptual construal. This difference in construal
   level also affects product choices that involve trade-offs between
   long-term benefits and short-term effort. The authors address
   alternative accounts such as vertical distance, visual distance, and
   perceived power. By highlighting the novel relationship between height
   and construal level, these findings contribute to research on grounded
   cognition and construal-level theory while also providing practical
   suggestions to marketing managers across a variety of domains.

AB The authors examine online affiliate marketing programs in which
   merchants oversee thousands of affiliates they have never met. Some
   merchants hire outside specialists to set and enforce policies for
   affiliates, whereas other merchants ask their marketing staff to perform
   these functions. For clear violations of applicable rules, the authors
   find that outside specialists are the most effective at excluding the
   responsible affiliates, which can be interpreted as a benefit of
   specialization. However, in-house staff are more successful at
   identifying and excluding affiliates whose practices are viewed as
   "borderline" (albeit still contrary to merchants' interests), forgoing
   the efficiencies of specialization in favor of the better incentives of
   a company's staff. The authors consider the implications for marketing
   of online affiliate programs and for online marketing more generally.

AB The authors examine how a reference to an unrelated product in the
   choice context affects consumers' likelihood of donating to charity.
   Building on research on self-signaling, the authors predict that
   consumers are more likely to give when the donation appeal references a
   hedonic product than when a utilitarian product is referenced or when no
   comparison is provided. They posit that this phenomenon occurs because
   referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal changes the
   self-attributions, or self-signaling utility, associated with the choice
   to donate. A series of hypothetical and actual choice experiments
   demonstrate the predicted effect and show that the increase in donation
   rates occurs because the self-attributions signaled by a choice not to
   donate are more negative in the context of a hedonic reference product.
   Finally, consistent with these experimental findings, a field experiment
   shows that referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal
   increases real donation rates in a nonlaboratory setting. The authors
   discuss the theoretical implications for both consumer decision making
   and the self-signaling motives behind prosocial choice.

   with a nonprofit with a combative orientation (e.g., fighting against
   something). To test this proposition, the authors adopt a three-pronged
   approach that (1) uses publicly available financial data from
   nonprofits' tax filings over a ten-year period, (2) measures annual
   donor pledges from a field study with a registered nonprofit
   organization, and (3) examines actual donation behavior of participants

   competition increases or decreases its provision. Factual content is
   supplied by commercial media firms, which observe a set of facts
   depicting the state of the world and selectively decide how to report
   them. Consumers value content that matches their opinion, which
   incentivizes media firms to slant their reports by omitting certain
   facts. Novel features in the authors' model include consumers' ability
   to anticipate the media's incentives for slant and the requirement that
   all media stances must be supported by facts. Furthermore, consumers
   find reports with more facts to be more convincing. Despite consumers'
   ability to detect slant and their demand for factual support, the
   research shows that competition results in consumers reading fewer facts
   and being unable to update their prior beliefs about the state of the
   world. The authors also find that a monopoly medium may be more
   polarizing than competitive media and that polarized reporting can be
   less biased.

AB This research investigates optimal selling strategies and equilibrium
   welfare implications in markets with buyer inequity aversion. When
   buyers care about their surplus relative to seller profits but are
   uncertain about seller costs, buyers' fairness perceptions and, thus,
   their willingness to pay may be malleable and susceptible to seller
   influence. If a seller's optimal behavior (e.g., pricing) is not
   completely unvarying in variable costs, buyers can rationally make
   inferences about seller costs from observed seller behavior.
   Consequently, buyers' fairness perceptions and their willingness to pay
   can influence, and be influenced by, optimal selling strategies. The
   study characterizes a fair selling equilibrium in which optimal seller
   behavior and buyer perceived fairness are interactively derived. The
   author shows that seller ex ante profit may increase as more buyers
   become inequity averse. In addition, buyer ex ante surplus can be
   nonmonotonically influenced by an increase in the number of fair-minded
   buyers or in the degree of inequity aversion. These counterintuitive
   results pinpoint the importance of investigating the strategic
   interaction between buyer fairness perceptions and selling strategies.
   Finally, the basic model is extended to examine how the fair selling
   equilibrium may be influenced by cost disclosure, buyer dynamic
   learning, and seller competition.

AB Consumers are often mindless eaters. This research provides a framework
   for how consumers can become more mindful of their food choices. To do
   so, the authors develop an ability-based training program to strengthen
   people's ability to focus on goal-relevant emotional information. They
   demonstrate not only that emotional ability (EA) is trainable and that
   food choices can be enhanced (Study 1) but also that EA training
   improves food choices beyond a nutrition knowledge training program
   (Study 2). In Study 3, the authors test a conceptual model and find that
   EA training increases goal-relevant emotional thoughts and reduces
   reliance on the unhealthy = tasty intuition. Both factors mediate
   mindful eating effects. Last, Study 4 demonstrates the long-term
   benefits of EA training by showing that emotionally trained people lose
   more weight in a three-month period than a control group and a nutrition
   knowledge training group. Together, these findings suggest that
   consumers can gain control of their food choices through the enhancement
   of EA. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for
   policy officials, health care professionals, and marketers.

   important but is largely overlooked. The present research (1) introduces
   the construct of lay rationalism to capture this individual difference
   variable and distinguishes it from other individual difference
   variables; (2) develops a short, easy-to-implement scale to measure lay

   that these two basic resources activate qualitatively different modes of

   more affectively. Importantly, this distinction then influences the

   demonstrates that, compared with a control condition free of the
   consideration of either resource, money consideration generates
   significantly more violations of transitivity in product choice, while
   time consideration has no such impact. The next three experiments use
   multiple approaches to demonstrate the role of different processing
   modes associated with money versus time consideration in this result.
   Finally, two additional experiments test ways in which the cognitive
   noise associated with the analytical processing that money consideration
   triggers could be reduced, resulting in more consistent preferences.

   from aggregate data and, thus, enable consumers' choices to be
   contingent on the assortment of products available in retail stores. The
   application of the proposed framework in the context of an emerging

   conventional approaches) pertaining to how brand performance is affected

   of products that retailers are more (vs. less) likely to jointly stock,
   and (3) cannibalization of retailers' shelf space resulting from product

AB The authors empirically explore how consumers update beliefs about a
   store's overall expensiveness. They estimate a learning model of store
   price image (SPI) formation with the impact of actual prices linked to
   category characteristics on a unique data set combining consumers' store
   visit and purchase information with their price perceptions. The results
   identify characteristics that drive categories' store price signaling
   power for different store formats. "Big ticket" categories with a narrow
   price range strongly shape consumers' store price beliefs, whereas
   (volatile) prices of frequently or deeply promoted categories are less
   influential. At traditional supermarkets, consumers anchor and elaborate
   on prices of storable categories bought in large quantities and for
   which quality differentiation is high. For hard discounters, however,
   SPI is mostly shaped by frequently bought categories with narrow
   assortments. Notably, categories' SPI signaling power is not
   proportional to their share of wallet at either type of chain. Managers
   can use these results to identify "Lighthouse" categories that signal
   low prices, yet make up a small portion of store spending, and in which
   price cuts do not overly hurt revenue.

AB Many service firms acquire customers by offering free-trial promotions.
   However, a crucial challenge is to retain the customers acquired with
   these free trials. To address this challenge, firms need to understand
   how free-trial customers differ from regular customers in terms of their
   decisions to retain the service. This article conceptualizes how
   marketing communication and usage behavior drive customers' retention
   decisions and develops hypotheses about the impact of free-trial
   acquisition on this process. To test the hypotheses, the authors model a
   customer's retention and usage decisions, distinguishing usage of a
   flat-rate service and usage of a pay-per-use service. The model allows
   for unobserved heterogeneity and corrects for selection effects and
   endogeneity. Using household panel data from a digital television
   service, the authors find systematic behavioral differences that cause
   the average customer lifetime value of free-trial customers to be 59%
   lower than that of regular customers. However, free-trial customers are
   more responsive to marketing communication and usage rates, which offers
   opportunities to target marketing efforts and enhance retention rates,
   customer lifetime value, and customer equity.

AB Common wisdom suggests that managerial empathy (i.e., the mental process
   of taking a consumer perspective) helps executives separate their
   personal consumption preferences from those of consumers, thereby
   preventing egocentric preference predictions. The results of the present
   investigation, however, show exactly the opposite. First, the authors
   find that managerial empathy ironically accelerates self-reference in
   predictions of consumer preferences. Second, managers' self-referential
   tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective
   activates managers' private consumer identity and, thus, their personal
   consumption preferences. Third, empathic managers' self-referential
   preference predictions make them less likely to use market research
   results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to
   do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer
   identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce
   self-referential preference predictions. To support their conclusions,
   the authors present four empirical studies with 480 experienced
   marketing managers and show that incautiously taking the perspective of
   consumers causes self-referential decisions in four contexts: product
   development, communication management, pricing, and celebrity
   endorsement.

AB Customers often stockpile reward points in linear loyalty programs
   (i.e., programs that do not explicitly reward stockpiling) despite
   several economic incentives against it (e.g., the time value of money).
   The authors develop a mathematical model of redemption choice that
   unites three explanations for why customers seem to be motivated to
   stockpile on their own, even though the retailer does not reward them
   for doing so. These motivations are economic (the value of forgone
   points), cognitive (nonmonetary transaction costs), and psychological
   (customers value points differently than cash). The authors capture the
   psychological motivation by allowing customers to book cash and point
   transactions in separate mental accounts. They estimate the model on
   data from an international retailer using Markov chain Monte Carlo
   methods and accurately forecast redemptions during an 11-month
   out-of-sample period. The results indicate substantial heterogeneity in
   how customers are motivated to redeem and suggest that the behavior in
   the data is driven mostly by cognitive and psychological incentives.

AB Relatively few retailers include metrics such as product returns in
   their customer selection and optimal resource allocation algorithms when
   measuring and maximizing customer value. Even when they do include this
   metric, increases in product return behavior are usually considered
   merely an economic cost that must be managed by decreasing the marketing
   resource allocations toward the customers making the returns. However,
   recent research has suggested that satisfactory product return
   experiences can actually benefit firms by lowering the customer's
   perceived risk of current and future purchases. To better understand the
   role of this perceived risk in the firm-customer exchange process, the
   authors conduct a large-scale customer selection and optimal resource
   allocation field experiment with 26,000 customers from an online
   retailer over six months. They find that the firm is able to increase
   both its short- and long-term profits when accounting for the perceived
   risk related to product returns in addition to managing product return
   costs. Furthermore, the authors find that by including this risk, rather
   than simply implementing traditional customer lifetime value-based
   models generically, the firm can target more profitable customers.

   structural stability. They find that consumer traits are almost as
   stable as Big Five personality traits, even when measured with only a

   notable trends that reflect the process of aging and/or changing

   susceptible to changes in environmental conditions. Theoretical and

AB In four experimental studies, the authors investigate the effect of
   innovation locus-whether the innovation is integrated with the base
   product (the core locus) or offered as a detachable accessory (the
   peripheral locus)-on consumers' adoption intentions. The findings show
   that offering a really new innovation (RNI) as a detachable peripheral
   component leads to higher adoption intentions than integrating the same
   innovation into the core. Innovation locus, however, does not have an
   effect on incrementally new innovations. The positive effect of
   peripheral locus (relative to core locus) for RNIs occurs through four
   mechanisms: (1) reduced schema incongruity, (2) lower risk perceptions,
   (3) increased benefit understanding, and (4) greater perceived usage
   flexibility associated with the new product. The authors demonstrate
   these effects by using stimuli from four product categories and
   including both attitudinal and behavioral measures of innovation
   adoption. The findings have implications for product design strategies
   for RNIs.

AB Firms with different management teams evidence different strategic
   capabilities. Some are able to reason through the reactions of their
   competitors, whereas others are less sophisticated in their thinking. In
   such cases, conventional wisdom suggests that the strategic firms will
   undercut their less sophisticated competitors' prices and earn greater
   profits. The authors show that, under certain conditions, the strategic
   firms charge higher prices and accrue smaller equilibrium profits than
   their nonstrategic counterparts. Strategic firms' efforts to capitalize
   on their loyal customers' higher willingness to pay increases
   nonstrategic firms' share of price-sensitive consumers. Furthermore, by
   raising prices, strategic firms help their nonstrategic counterparts
   more than themselves. This outcome arises when the proportion of
   consumers loyal to each firm is sufficiently large. A laboratory test
   for the main proposition's predictive accuracy provides empirical
   support.

AB How do consumers adjust their spending when their budget changes? A
   common view is that the allocation of one's current budget should not
   depend on previous budget allocations. Contrary to this, the authors
   find that when the budget contracts to a particular level, consumers
   select less variety (as measured by the number of different items with
   some of the budget allocated to them) than when their budget expands to
   that same level. This budget contraction effect stems from a reduction
   in variety under the contracting budget, not from variety expansion
   under the expanding budget. Evidence from five experiments indicates
   that the effect is driven by a desire to avoid feelings of loss
   associated with spreading allocation cuts (relative to reference
   quantities from previous allocations) across many items.

AB Investment decisions play a crucial role in the way consumers manage
   their wealth, and therefore, it is important to understand how consumers
   make these decisions. This research contributes to this attempt by
   examining consumers' investment decisions in response to new information
   about changes in uncertainty in financial markets. The authors identify
   possible conditions under which consumers, despite having new
   information about changes in market uncertainty, are less likely to
   assimilate the new information and consequently do not make investment
   decisions that are in line with their risk-aversion levels.
   Specifically, in a series of studies, the authors show that high rather
   than low need for cognitive closure can lead to a lack of openness to
   new information and therefore may dilute consumers' tendency to update
   their investment portfolios in a way that reflects their risk
   preferences. In addition, the authors address possible ways to influence
   consumers' assimilation of new information, to help even those with high
   need for cognitive closure make investment decisions that are in line
   with their levels of risk aversion.

AB This article investigates the in-flight marketplace, using detailed data
   of in-flight purchases to understand social effects in purchase behavior
   and determine their potential for designing marketing promotions. On
   average, a passenger is approximately 30% more likely to buy an item
   after being exposed to a lateral purchase. Analyses on the underlying
   mechanisms reveal that the classical social influence theories do not
   suffice to explain all the patterns in the data. The author proposes
   omission neglect, product contagion, and goal balancing as complementary
   theories. Finally, consumers' willingness to buy is shown to be
   positively correlated with responsiveness to social influence. This
   finding indicates that homophily and social feedback effects-classically
   viewed in the literature as nuisances-can provide targeting value for
   the firm. By taking these factors into account during behavior-based
   targeting, firms can double the social spillovers of marketing actions.

   The experiment randomized assignment of cookies to treatment (firm ads)
   and control conditions (charity ads), enabling the authors to handle
   different sources of selection bias, including targeting algorithms and
   browsing behavior. They analyze display ad effects for users at
   different stages of the company's purchase funnel (i.e., nonvisitor,
   visitor, authenticated user, and converted customer) and find that
   display advertising positively affects visitation to the firm's website
   for users in most stages of the purchase funnel, but not for those who
   previously visited the site without creating an account. Using a binary
   logit model, the authors calculate marginal effects and elasticities by
   funnel stage and analyze the potential value of reallocating display ad
   impressions across users at different stages. Expected visits increase
   almost 10% when display ad impressions are partially reallocated from
   nonvisitors and visitors to authenticated users. The authors also show
   that results from the controlled experiment data differ significantly
   from those computed using standard correlational approaches.

AB Why do consumers often feel pressed for time? This research provides a
   novel answer to this question: consumers' subjective perceptions of goal
   conflict. The authors show that beyond the number of goals competing for
   consumers' time, perceived conflict between goals makes them feel that
   they have less time. Five experiments demonstrate that perceiving
   greater conflict between goals makes people feel time constrained and
   that stress and anxiety drive this effect. These effects, which
   generalize across a variety of goals and types of conflict (both related
   and unrelated to demands on time), influence how consumers spend time as
   well as how much they are willing to pay to save time. The authors
   identify two simple interventions that can help consumers mitigate goal
   conflict's negative effects: slow breathing and anxiety reappraisal.
   Together, the findings shed light on the factors that drive how
   consumers perceive, spend, and value their time.

AB Platform companies such as Alibaba.com increasingly rely on search
   advertising as a revenue source. This study examines (1) the direct
   effect of new and existing buyers and sellers on platform advertising
   revenue, (2) their indirect effect through two intermediary performance
   variables (buyer's click rate and seller's click price), and (3) how the
   effects differ between launch and mature stages of the search
   advertising service. Unique data collected from a leading transactional
   business-to-business electronic platform suggest that new buyers click
   on more search advertisements than existing buyers, especially after the
   firm's buyers and sellers have learned and adapted to the service
   (mature stage). New sellers tend to outbid existing sellers in the
   mature stage, but the opposite is true when the service is newly
   introduced (launch stage). Because existing sellers can more effectively
   send quality signals in the launch stage, attracting existing, rather
   than new, sellers has a greater effect on click rate in the launch
   stage; however, the opposite is true in the mature stage. Attracting new
   buyers also has a greater effect on click rate and price, especially in
   the mature stage. Finally, using cost data from the platform, this
   article examines the economic returns of attracting new and existing
   buyers and sellers with respect to advertising revenue.

AB In the past decade, there has been a tremendous increase in the use of
   neurophysiological methods to better understand marketing phenomena
   among academics and practitioners. However, the value of these methods
   in predicting advertising success remains underresearched. Using a
   unique experimental protocol to assess responses to 30-second television
   ads, the authors capture many measures of advertising effectiveness
   across six commonly used methods (traditional self-reports, implicit
   measures, eye tracking, biometrics, electroencephalography, and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging). These measures have been shown
   to reliably tap into higher-level constructs commonly used in
   advertising research: attention, affect, memory, and desirability. Using
   time-series data on sales and gross rating points, the authors attempt
   to relate individual-level response to television ads in the lab to the
   ads' aggregate, market-level elasticities. The authors show that
   functional magnetic resonance imaging measures explain the most variance
   in advertising elasticities beyond the baseline traditional measures.
   Notably, activity in the ventral striatum is the strongest predictor of
   real-world, market-level response to advertising. The authors discuss
   the findings and their significant implications for theory, research,
   and practice.

AB Although much progress has been made in relating brain activations to
   choice behavior, evidence that neural measures could actually be useful
   for predicting the success of marketing actions remains limited. To be
   of added value, neural measures should significantly increase predictive
   power, beyond conventional measures. In the present study, the authors
   obtain both stated preference measures and neural measures
   (electroencephalography; EEG) in response to advertisements for
   commercially released movies (i.e., movie trailers) to probe their
   potential to provide insight into participants' individual preferences
   as well as movie sales in the general population. The results show that
   EEG measures (beta and gamma oscillations), beyond stated preference
   measures, provide unique information regarding individual and
   population-wide preference and can thus, in principle, be used as a
   neural marker for commercial success. As such, these results provide the
   first evidence that EEG measures are related to real-world outcomes and
   that these neural measures can significantly add to models predicting
   choice behavior relative to models that include only stated preference
   measures.

AB Considerable attention has been given to the notion of a set of
   human-like characteristics associated with brands, referred to as "brand
   personality." The authors combine newly available machine learning
   techniques with functional neuroimaging data to characterize the set of
   processes that give rise to these associations. The authors show that
   brand personality traits can be captured by the weighted activity across
   a widely distributed set of brain regions previously implicated in
   reasoning, imagery, and affective processing. That is, as opposed to
   being constructed through reflective processes, brand personality traits
   seem to exist a priori inside consumers' minds, such that the authors
   are able to predict what brand a person is thinking about solely on the
   basis of the relationship between brand personality associations and
   brain activity. These findings represent an important advance in the
   application of neuroscientific methods to consumer research, moving from
   work focused on cataloging brain regions associated with marketing
   stimuli to testing and refining constructs central to theories of

AB Price is a key factor in most purchases, but it can be presented at
   different stages of decision making. The authors examine the
   sequence-dependent effects of price and product information on the
   decision-making process at both neural and behavioral levels. During
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, the price of a product was shown
   to participants either before or after the product itself was presented.
   Early exposure to price, or "price primacy," altered the process of
   valuation, as observed in altered patterns of activity in the medial
   prefrontal cortex immediately before making a purchase decision.
   Specifically, whereas viewing products first resulted in evaluations
   strongly related to products' attractiveness or desirability, viewing
   prices first appeared to promote overall evaluations related to
   products' monetary worth. Consistent with this framework, the authors
   show that price primacy can increase purchase of bargain-priced products
   when their worth is easily recognized. Together, these results suggest
   that price primacy highlights considerations of product worth and can
   thereby influence purchasing.

AB It is well established that neural imaging technology can predict
   preferences for consumer products. However, the applicability of this
   method to consumer marketing research remains uncertain, partly because
   of the expense required. In this article, the authors demonstrate that
   neural measurements made with a relatively low-cost and widely available
   measurement method electroencephalography (EEG) can predict future
   choices of consumer products. In the experiment, participants viewed
   individual consumer products in isolation, without making any actual
   choices, while their neural activity was measured with EEG. At the end
   of the experiment, participants were offered choices between pairs of
   the same products. The authors find that neural activity measured from a
   midfrontal electrode displays an increase in the N200 component and a
   weaker theta band power that correlates with a more preferred product.
   Using recent techniques for relating neural measurements to choice
   prediction, they demonstrate that these measures predict subsequent
   choices. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction depends on both the
   ordinal and cardinal distance of the EEG data; the larger the difference
   in EEG activity between two products, the better the predictive
   accuracy.

AB Electrophysiological and hemodynamic studies provide substantial
   evidence of dissimilar brain responses when people view emotional
   compared with neutral pictures. This study investigates consumer brain
   responses underpinning passive viewing of luxury (high emotional value)
   versus basic (low emotional value) branded products when participants
   are alone or with another person. Conforming to social facilitation
   theory and using electroencephalogram methods, the authors recorded
   event-related potentials while female participants passively viewed
   pictures of luxury and basic branded products. They examined
   event-related-potential amplitudes in three time windows, corresponding
   to the P2 and P3 components and the late positive potential (LPP).
   Dissimilar brain responses occurred in the Together but not the Alone
   condition for the P2 and P3 components over visual cortex sites. The LPP
   amplitude was higher for luxury than for basic branded products, but
   only in the Together condition, suggesting that the presence of another
   person magnifies the emotional effect of brand type. Taken together, the
   results suggest that LPP amplitude during passive viewing of relevant
   marketing images reflects increased attention allocation and
   motivational significance, both enhanced by the presence of another
   person, to stimuli with higher emotional value.

   Participants completed the App Recommendation Task a task that captures
   neural processes associated with making recommendations to others, with
   and without information about peer recommendations of the type commonly
   available online. The results demonstrate that increased activity in the
   striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in response to peer recommendations is
   significantly correlated with participants changing their
   recommendations to be consistent with this feedback within subjects.
   Furthermore, individual differences in activation of the temporoparietal
   junction during feedback that peer recommendations varied from those of
   the participant correlated with individual differences in susceptibility
   to influence on recommendation decisions between subjects. These brain
   regions have previously been implicated in social influence and the
   concept of being a "successful idea salesperson," respectively.
   Together, they highlight a potential combination of internal preference

AB Marketers often employ a variety of positive emotions to encourage
   consumption or promote a particular behavior (e.g., buying, donating,
   recycling) to benefit an organization or cause. The authors show that
   specific positive emotions do not universally increase prosocial
   behavior but, rather, encourage different types of prosocial behavior.
   Four studies show that whereas positive emotions (i.e., love, hope,
   pride, and compassion) all induce prosocial behavior toward close
   entities (relative to a neutral emotional state), only love induces
   prosocial behavior toward distant others and international
   organizations. Love's effect is driven by a distinct form of broadening,
   characterized by extending feelings of social connection and the
   boundary of caring to be more inclusive of others regardless of
   relatedness. Love-as a trait and a momentary emotionis unique among
   positive emotions in fostering connectedness that other positive
   emotions (hope and pride) do not and broadening behavior in a way that
   other connected emotions (compassion) do not. This research contributes
   to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotion by demonstrating a
   distinct type of broadening for love and adds an important qualification
   to the general finding that positive emotions uniformly encourage
   prosocial behavior.

AB Although going public allows firms access to more financial capital that
   can fuel innovation, it also exposes them to a set of myopic incentives
   and disclosure requirements that constrain innovation. This tension is
   expected to produce a unique pattern of innovation strategies among
   firms going public, causing such firms to increase their innovation
   levels but reduce their innovation riskiness. Specifically, the authors
   predict that after going public, firms innovate at higher levels and
   introduce higher levels of variety with each innovation; however, these
   innovations are less risky, characterized by fewer breakthrough
   innovations and fewer innovations in new-to-the-firm categories. The
   authors compare 40,000 product introductions in the period 1980-2011
   from a sample of consumer packaged goods firms that went public with a
   benchmark sample of firms that remained private, and the results support
   their predictions. Utilizing tests to resolve questions about
   endogeneity, including self-selection, reverse causality, and competing
   explanations, the authors demonstrate that initial public offering
   selection and dynamics do not drive this going-public effect. The
   authors also uncover a set of industry factors that mitigate the drop in
   breakthrough innovation by offering product-market incentives that
   counterbalance the documented effect of stock market incentives.

AB As consumers spend more time on their mobile devices, a focal retailer's
   natural approach is to target potential customers in close proximity to
   its own location. Yet focal (own) location targeting may cannibalize
   profits on inframarginal sales. This study demonstrates the
   effectiveness of competitive locational targeting, the practice of
   promoting to consumers near a competitor's location. The analysis is
   based on a randomized field experiment in which mobile promotions were
   sent to customers at three similar shopping areas (competitive, focal,
   and benchmark locations). The results show that competitive locational
   targeting can take advantage of heightened demand that a focal retailer
   would not otherwise capture. Competitive locational targeting produced
   increasing returns to promotional discount depth, whereas targeting the
   focal location produced decreasing returns to deep discounts, indicating
   saturation effects and profit cannibalization. These findings are
   important for marketers, who can use competitive locational targeting to
   generate incremental sales without cannibalizing profits. Although the
   experiment focuses on the effects of unilateral promotions, it
   represents an initial step in understanding the competitive implications
   of mobile marketing technologies.

AB This article applies a two-sided matching model to investigate the
   consequences of banning controversial sponsors. Using a data set
   containing the shirt sponsorships from 43 English football clubs between
   1990 and 2010, the authors ' estimates suggest assortative matching
   between a club's attendance and a sponsor's revenue. In addition,
   sponsorships become less valuable as the distance between the club and
   the sponsor's head office grows, particularly for low-performing clubs
   and smaller domestic sponsors. The authors use these estimates to
   simulate the consequences of banning alcohol and gambling sponsors.
   Their estimates of counterfactual outcomes suggest that such bans may
   not have the largest impact on the clubs (particularly the relatively
   successful clubs) that currently have alcohol and gambling sponsors.
   Instead, clubs with low attendance and clubs in low-income areas will be
   most affected by a ban. More generally, the results demonstrate that
   when marketing relationships are viewed as the result of a matching
   process, actions that affect only some marketers may have substantial
   indirect effects on a variety of players in the market.

   active participation in consumer-to-consumer conversations in an online

   measure of consumer reaction (consumer sentiment) and analyze more than
   115,000 consumer posts from ten online forums with active firm
   participation. The results indicate that consumers show diminishing
   returns to active firm engagement, which, at very high levels, can
   undermine consumer sentiment. Further subgroup analyses by conversation
   type indicate that these relationships hold for conversations that
   address consumers' functional needs but do not hold for conversations
   that address social needs. Finally, the results show diminishing returns
   to firm engagement for consumers primarily interested in product-related
   support but show no relationship for consumers primarily interested in
   inspiration and entertainment. These findings provide insights for
   marketing performance measurement and resource allocation in online

AB Service providers sometimes face mass service failures. These problems
   occur across service industries, ranging from severe Internet outages to
   major delays for airlines or trains. The literature has not yet
   addressed the following key question: How do service crises affect
   perceived service quality ( PSQ) over time? To answer this question, the
   authors introduce a Double-Asymmetric Structural Vector Autoregressive
   model. It captures not only the short-and long-term effects of objective
   service performance on PSQ but also the differential effects of service
   crises versus service restoration. The authors analyze a unique data set
   from a major European railway company, spanning seven years of monthly
   observations. During this period, severe winter weather caused dramatic
   service crises. The authors find that performance losses loom larger
   than gains in the short run and also have permanent negative effects on
   PSQ in the long run. Consequently, a crisis followed by a restoration
   will result in a net negative long-term effect on PSQ. The impact of a
   crisis also depends on the prior trend in objective service performance.

AB This article explores how media coverage of a price war affects
   customer, retailer, and investor reactions over time. Using data
   covering a Dutch supermarket price war (2003-2005), the authors find
   that price reductions, especially deep reductions, trigger media
   coverage of the price conflict. This sets off a chain of reactions.
   Press messages have a significant effect on market share and abnormal
   stock returns, beyond retailers' own price and advertising. Importantly,
   this study uncovers striking asymmetries regarding the kind of coverage
   to which stakeholders react: whereas consumers only respond to the tone
   of pricerelated press coverage, retailers and investors only react to
   its quantity. Next, media coverage feeds back into the retailers'
   pricing actions: more media coverage triggers new price cuts in addition
   to those dictated by competitive reactions. As such, media coverage
   triggers a deeper spiral of price cuts, intensifying the competitive
   price battle. However, as the price war progresses, media coverage
   becomes less frequent and less favorable, which decelerates the downward
   price spiral.

AB The use of coupons delivered by mobile phone, so-called "m-coupons," is
   growing rapidly. In this study, the authors analyze consumer response to
   m-coupons for a two-year trial at a large shopping mall. Approximately
   8,500 people were recruited to a panel and received three text-message
   m-coupons whenever they "swiped" their mobile phone at the mall
   entrances, with downstream redemption recorded. Almost 144,000 m-coupons
   were delivered during the trial, representing 38 stores that supplied
   134 different coupons. The authors find that an important feature of
   m-coupons is where and when they are delivered, with location and time
   of delivery significantly influencing redemption. How long the m-coupons
   are valid ( expiry length) is also important because redemption times
   for m-coupons are much shorter than for traditional coupons. This
   finding suggests that their expiration length should be shortened to
   help signal time urgency. Nevertheless, traditional coupon features,
   such as face value, still dominate m-coupon effectiveness, as does the
   product type, with snack food coupons being particularly effective.

AB Grocery retailers are joining the fray against obesity by offering a

   However, the success of such programs in promoting healthy choices
   remains an open question. The authors examine the effectiveness of a
   growing health and wellness initiative: a simplified nutrition scoring
   system. They present a conceptual framework that predicts the effect of
   such a scoring system on shoppers' food decisions and their sensitivity
   to price and promotion, as well as the moderating influence of
   category-level factors. Using a large-scale quasi experiment and panel
   data across eight product categories for more than 535,000 members of a
   grocery chain's frequent shopper program, the authors demonstrate that
   the point-of-sale nutrition scoring system helped consumers make
   healthier food choices, such that they switched to higher-scoring
   products in the postrollout period. The results also reveal that
   shoppers became less price sensitive and more promotion sensitive
   following the introduction of the food scoring system. The authors
   discuss implications for research and practice.

AB In the context of the U.S. lodging industry (1994-2012), the authors
   empirically quantify the effects of the two main factors driving the
   rebranding effects identified by the theoretical branding literature-(1)
   the brand effect and (2) the interaction effect between the product (the
   hotel property) and the brands involved-on occupancy rate and other
   hotel performance indicators. They find that, on average, rebranding
   results in approximately a 6.31% increase in occupancy rates; 60% of
   this effect can be attributed to the brand identities (e.g., Holiday
   Inn) before and after rebranding while the remaining 40% is attributable
   to the interaction effect. The authors also find heterogeneity in the
   property-brand interaction effect of rebranding along various observable
   characteristics of the hotels. They assess the robustness of the results
   to various model assumptions and alternative instruments; in addition,
   they use matching estimators for analysis and exploit rebranding as a
   consequence of hotel mergers as a means of measuring rebranding effects.
   Finally, the authors consider the impact that rebranding might have on
   competitors' properties. Their approach to measuring rebranding effects
   can be applied broadly to firms and industries experiencing a decoupling
   of the individual components of their value chain.

AB In recent years, marketing researchers have become increasingly
   interested in under- and overreporting. However, there are few suitable
   approaches to operationalize deviations from the truth, particularly in
   behavioral domains in which self-reports are usually the only viable
   method of choice to measure behavior or attitudes. An especially
   difficult situation arises if some people underreport while others
   overreport. This article proposes a Bayesian item response theory model
   to quantify under-and overreporting in surveys. The method utilizes
   within-person differences between answers obtained under direct
   questioning (no privacy protection) and randomized-response questioning
   (which ensures item-level privacy protection). This method has the
   important features of incorporating behavioral response-mode effects
   (e.g., privacy loss when switching from direct to randomized-response
   questioning, response-mode inertia effects) and allowing the direction
   of bias to differ across respondents. The authors provide an empirical
   application for excessive alcohol consumption involving 1,408
   respondents from a commercial web panel. The results show that
   respondents are averse to decreases in privacy and that randomized
   response is less effective if respondents provide biased responses to
   earlier direct questions.

AB Multitier store brands are increasing in significance in retail outlets.
   In this article, the authors theoretically examine the rationale for the
   existence of multitier store brands, their optimal quality levels, and
   their implications for consumer welfare and channel profits. They show
   that despite the manufacturer's efforts to deter the entry of store
   brands by providing side payments and/or introducing additional national
   brands, the retailer will offer multitier store brands in equilibrium.
   Furthermore, the quality levels of store brands and national brands are
   interlaced, with a store brand taking the top-quality position unless
   national brands outnumber store brands. Even though the proliferation of
   store brands reduces product differentiation, it does not decrease
   consumer welfare or channel profits. However, store brands hurt the
   manufacturer's profits and make two-part tariffs ineffective in
   improving channel coordination. Nonetheless, the retailer can enhance
   channel coordination by procuring the store brand from the national
   brand manufacturer. The authors extend their model in several directions
   to capture additional features of retail markets and assess the
   robustness of their findings.

AB Tasks such as the elimination of all debts when faced with the immediate
   option to spend can be unpleasant but not conceptually difficult.
   Dividing these tasks into smaller parts and completing the parts from
   smallest size to largest size can help people realize quick motivational
   gains that increase their likelihood of completing the task. The authors
   more broadly define this idea as "small victories" and discuss, model,
   and empirically examine two related behavioral theories that might
   explain it. A laboratory experiment tests this prediction and provides
   data for model calibration. Consistent with the idea of small victories,
   when a task is broken down into parts of unequal size, participants
   perform faster when the parts are arranged in ascending order (i.e.,
   from smallest to largest) rather than descending order (i.e., from
   largest to smallest). The calibrated model is consistent with the
   directional predictions of each theory. However, when participants are
   given choice over orderings, they choose the ascending ordering least
   often. The authors conclude with a discussion of the efficacy of this
   method in stylized debt-repayment scenarios.

AB During retailer-initiated price wars (PWs), hundreds of brands are
   involved simultaneously, affecting brands' and retailers' positioning
   and ultimately making the performance outcome for individual brands
   difficult to predict. Likewise, the impact on brand performance after
   the PW, when prices are restored, is unclear. The authors use a
   natural-experiment approach to track brand sales and shares before,
   during, and after a long-lasting supermarket PW in the Dutch grocery
   market. They find that PWs are not truly revenue, sales, or share
   generators for most brands unless prices remain reduced permanently by
   the retailer. Only after the PW, when rivals' prices are restored and
   the focal brand's reduced retail price is maintained, can substantial
   sales, revenues, and share gains be realized. Moreover, restoring prices
   without additional price promotion support can severely damage brands'
   performance. Overall, national brands can gain share, sales, and
   revenue, but at the cost of not restoring regular prices, while private
   labels can benefit even when prices are restored after the PW ends.

AB In markets, firms must compete following a set of rules determined by
   laws, regulations, and social practices or pressures. This article
   investigates the effect of the degree of competition on the extent to
   which firms invest in behaving according to the rules of the
   marketplace. The authors model investments in following these rules as
   increasing the firm's marginal costs of production and decreasing its
   probability of being caught violating the market rules (and thus losing
   profits). They show that greater competition leads to smaller
   investments in following the market rules. This leads to (1) the
   existence of a social optimum degree of competition that is less than
   perfect competition and (2) more competition in general, thus prompting
   greater optimal monitoring efforts. Stricter market rules can lead to
   greater investments in satisfying the market rules and to lower
   production. The authors also present results on the likelihood of firms
   having broken the market rules depending on relative market shares,
   optimal monitoring, and the effect of dynamics on the incentives to
   satisfy the market rules.

AB Dynamic customer targeting is a common task for marketers actively
   managing customer relationships. Such efforts can be guided by insight
   into the return on investment from marketing interventions, which can be
   derived as the increase in the present value of a customer's expected
   future transactions. Using the popular latent attrition framework, one
   could estimate this value by manipulating the levels of a set of
   nonstationary covariates. The authors propose such a model that
   incorporates transaction-specific attributes and maintains standard
   assumptions of unobserved heterogeneity. They demonstrate how firms can
   approximate an upper bound on the appropriate amount to invest in
   retaining a customer and demonstrate that this amount depends on
   customers' past purchase activity-namely, the recency and frequency of
   past customer purchases. Using data from a business-to-business service
   provider as their empirical application, the authors apply the model to
   estimate the revenue the service provider loses when it fails to deliver
   a customer's requested level of service. They also show that the lost
   revenue is larger than the corresponding expected gain that would result
   from exceeding a customer's requested level of service. The authors
   discuss the implications of their findings for marketers in terms of
   managing customer relationships.

AB Choice-based conjoint is a popular technique for characterizing
   consumers' choices. Three eye-tracking studies explore decision
   processes in conjoint choices that take less time and become more
   accurate with practice. These studies reveal two simplification
   processes that are associated with greater speed and reliability.
   Alternative focus gradually shifts attention toward options that
   represent promising choices, whereas attribute focus directs attention
   to important attributes that are most likely to alter or confirm a
   decision. Alternative and attribute focus increase in intensity with
   practice. In terms of biases, the authors detect a small but consistent
   focus on positive aspects of the item chosen and negative aspects of the
   items not chosen. They also show that incidental exposures arising from
   the first-examined alternative or from alternatives in a central
   horizontal location increase attention but have a much more modest and
   often insignificant impact on conjoint choices. Overall, conjoint choice
   is found to be a process that is (1) largely formed by goal-driven
   values that respondents bring to the task and (2) relatively free of
   distorting effects from task layout or random exposures.

AB Previous studies have shown that a firm needs to rely on its customers
   and employees to achieve superior performance. In this study, the
   authors draw on signaling theory to develop and empirically test a
   cross-validation argument. They argue that how a firm treats one
   stakeholder group will be interpreted by investors in conjunction with
   how the firm treats another stakeholder group. Investors use consistency
   in stakeholder group treatment as a signal of complementarity in a
   firm's investments, which can improve the likelihood of competitive
   advantage. Specifically, the authors propose that a firm's achievements
   (lapses) directed at customers have a stronger positive (negative)
   impact on investors' valuation of the firm if they are validated by the
   firm's achievements (lapses) directed at employees, and vice versa.
   Applying a multilevel model to a large sample of firms across various
   industries between 1994 and 2010, the authors find evidence to support
   these arguments. In addition, they find that cross-validation is more
   crucial for firms with a narrow than a broad business scope.

AB This study examines the relationship between customer satisfaction,
   loyalty intention, and shareholder value at the firm and individual
   customer levels. The authors also explore industry differences by using
   a multilevel and random-effects approach in which individual customer
   scores are nested within firm-level data and the estimated
   interrelationships are treated as random coefficients that are explained
   by industry characteristics. They compile a unique and detailed data
   set, which covers 10 years of information on 137 firms and includes a
   matched sample of 189,069 customers from multiple sources, such as the
   American Customer Satisfaction Index, the Center for Research in
   Security Prices, and Compustat, to yield three important insights.
   First, aggregate firm-level effects may overestimate the impact that
   satisfaction has at the individual customer level. Second, a
   consideration of loyalty intention or repurchase intention as the
   mediator can improve our understanding of the satisfaction-shareholder
   value relationship and the fact that this relationship can vary across
   firms. Finally, the influence of satisfaction and loyalty intentions on
   shareholder value varies by industry. The authors discuss implications
   of findings for researchers, managers, and investors.

   however, suggest that many people are facing fewer opportunities to
   engage in creative thought as they increasingly solve well-defined (vs.
   ill-defined) problems. Using three studies that involve real
   problem-solving activities (e.g., putting together a LEGO kit), the
   authors examine the mindset created by addressing such well-defined
   problems. The studies demonstrate the negative downstream impact of such
   a mindset on both creative task performance and tendency to choose to

AB Consumers routinely rely on forecasters to make predictions about
   uncertain events (e.g., sporting contests, stock fluctuations). The
   authors demonstrate that when forecasts are higher versus lower (e.g., a
   70% vs. 30% chance of team A winning a game), consumers infer that the
   forecaster is more confident in his or her prediction, has conducted
   more in-depth analyses, and is more trustworthy. Consumers also judge
   the prediction as more accurate. This occurs because people tend to
   evaluate forecasts on the basis of how well they predict a target event
   occurring (e.g., team A winning). Higher forecasts indicate greater
   likelihood of the target event occurring and signal a confident analyst,
   while lower forecasts indicate lower likelihood and lower confidence in
   the target event occurring. Yet because with lower forecasts, consumers
   still focus on the target event (rather than its complement), lower
   confidence in the target event occurring is erroneously interpreted as
   the forecaster being less confident in his or her overall prediction
   (instead of more confident in the complementary event occurring, i.e.,
   team A losing). The authors identify boundary conditions, generalize to
   other prediction formats, and demonstrate consequences of their
   findings.

AB Facing the issue of increasing customer churn, many service firms have
   begun recommending pricing plans to their customers. One reason behind
   this type of retention campaign is that customers who subscribe to a
   plan suitable for them should be less likely to churn because they
   derive greater benefits from the service. In this article, the authors
   examine the effectiveness of such retention campaigns using a
   large-scale field experiment in which some customers are offered plan
   recommendations and some are not. They find that being proactive and
   encouraging customers to switch to cost-minimizing plans can,
   surprisingly, increase rather than decrease customer churn: whereas only
   6% of customers in the control condition churned during the three months
   following the intervention, 10% did so in the treatment group. The
   authors propose two explanations for how the campaign increased churn,
   namely, (1) by lowering customers' inertia to switch plans and (2) by
   increasing the salience of past-usage patterns among potential churners.
   The data provide support for both explanations. By leveraging the
   richness of their field experiment, the authors assess the impact of
   targeted encouragement campaigns on customer behavior and firm revenues
   and derive recommendations for service firms.

   experiences, as well as those of others, when deciding what to buy and
   what to recommend. Contrary to the intuition that varied experiences
   should enhance evaluation, five studies demonstrate that in some
   situations, perceiving usage experiences as less-not more-varied
   improves postpurchase product evaluation. Less varied usage experiences
   make consumers think that products are used more frequently. As a
   result, perceiving usage experiences as less varied makes consumers more
   satisfied with their purchase, more likely to buy it again, and more
   likely to recommend it. In addition to their practical implications, the

AB Across six experiments, the authors demonstrate that superficial
   imperfections in the form of packaging damage can engender negative
   consumer reactions that shape subsequent attitudes and behaviors in ways
   that are not always objectively justified. Their findings show that
   these reactions function in a relatively automatic fashion, even
   emerging under conditions in which the packaging damage does not convey
   information about a health and safety threat from the product. The
   authors extend work on contagion to show that superficial packaging
   damage can act as a contamination cue, automatically activating thoughts
   of contamination and health and safety concerns. This tendency to avoid
   superficial packaging damage can be eliminated by counteracting these
   thoughts of contamination. This can be done with positive brand
   associations (i.e., by branding the product as organic) or by creating a
   physical buffer between the packaging damage and the product itself. The
   authors close with a discussion of implications for marketers,

AB People who want to control their body weight often aim to regulate both
   energy intake (by reducing food consumption) and energy expenditure (by
   increasing physical activity), thus addressing both sides of the energy
   balance equation. Marketers have developed fitness-branded food that may
   lead restrained eaters (i.e., consumers who are chronically concerned
   about their body weight) to believe that they can achieve these two
   goals at the same time by consuming the food. The purpose of this
   research is to investigate the effects of fitness branding in food
   marketing (i.e., the integration of fitness into the branding of food)
   on consumption and physical activity in restrained (vs. unrestrained)
   eaters. The authors show that fitness branding increases consumption
   volumes for restrained eaters unless consumers view the food as dietary
   forbidden. Restrained eaters are also less physically active after
   consuming fitness-branded food, and food consumption volumes mediate
   this effect in restrained eaters. Fitness branding may therefore have
   undesirable effects on the weight-control behaviors of restrained eaters
   because it discourages physical activity despite an increase in
   consumption, which is contrary to the principle of energy balance.

AB Psychological and physiological states such as mood, hunger, stress, and
   sleep deprivation are known to affect decision-making processes and
   therefore crucially influence consumer behavior. A possible biological
   mechanism underlying the observed variability of consumer behavior is
   the context-sensitive variation in the levels of neuromodulators in the

   pharmaceutically reduce the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in
   the brain to diminish the availability of subjects' cognitive resources.
   In doing so, they study how serotonin brain levels influence (1)
   subjects' tendency to avoid buying and (2) consumers' preference for
   product options positioned as a compromise in a given choice set rather
   than for more extreme alternatives (i.e., the compromise effect). Using
   realistic product choice scenarios in a binding decision framework, they
   find that a reduction of brain serotonin levels leads to choice deferral
   and decreases the compromise effect, both as a within-subjects and as a
   between-subjects choice phenomenon. As such, this study provides
   neurobiological evidence for the assumption that the compromise effect
   is the result of deliberate and demanding thought processes rather than
   intuitive decision making.

AB Advertising's influence on firm sales and firm value has drawn early
   attention from economists and accountants and more recent attention from
   marketers. Most studies that have investigated a link between
   advertising and sales have found such a link. However, studies that have
   investigated a link between advertising and firm value have only
   sometimes found that link. Meta-analysis has failed to determine
   moderators that govern the link between advertising and firm value. In
   this article, the authors hypothesize that advertising influences firm
   value for a differentiator because advertising can elaborate the firm's
   point of difference into brand equity, thereby building firm value.
   Advertising cannot build brand equity for a cost leader because such a
   firm has no point of difference on which to build. Identifying
   differentiators and cost leaders on the basis of firms' reactions to a
   change in accounting regulations, the authors confirm hypotheses:
   advertising is related to sales for all firms, but it is more strongly
   related to firm value for differentiators than for cost leaders. Beyond
   explaining differences in advertising effectiveness, this study's
   indicator of differentiation versus cost leadership should enhance
   future analyses of marketing's effect on firm-level outcomes using
   archival financial data.

AB This study investigates how the valence, channel, and social tie
   strength of a word-of-mouth (WOM) conversation about a brand relate to
   the purchase intentions and WOM retransmission intentions of WOM
   recipients. The analysis uses a nationally representative sample of
   186,775 individual conversations about 804 different brands. The authors
   find insights linking WOM valence, WOM channel, and social tie strength
   that could not be revealed if the WOM conversations were analyzed in an
   aggregated form. The findings contribute to research that investigates
   differences between offline WOM and online WOM. The authors find that
   the relationship of WOM valence with purchase intentions is exacerbated
   when the conversation occurs offline, whereas offline conversations tend
   to be more strongly associated with WOM retransmission intentions
   regardless of the conversation's valence. The results also provide
   insights into how interpersonal characteristics influence WOM outcomes.
   Specifically, the authors find that the strength of the social tie
   relationship tends to influence a WOM receiver's intentions to purchase
   a brand; however, social tie strength has a much weaker association with
   a consumer's WOM retransmission intentions.

AB Online chatter is important because it is spontaneous, passionate,
   information rich, granular, and live. Thus, it can forewarn and be
   diagnostic about potential problems with automobile models, known as
   nameplates. The authors define "perverse halo" (or negative spillover)
   as the phenomenon whereby negative chatter about one nameplate increases
   negative chatter for another nameplate. The authors test the existence
   of such a perverse halo for 48 nameplates from four different brands
   during a series of automobile recalls. The analysis is by individual and
   panel vector autoregressive models. The study finds that perverse halo
   is extensive. It occurs for nameplates within the same brand across
   segments and across brands within segments. It is strongest between
   brands of the same country. Perverse halo is asymmetric, being stronger
   from a dominant brand to a less dominant brand than vice versa. Apology
   advertising about recalls has harmful effects on both the recalled brand
   and its rivals. Furthermore, these halo effects affect downstream
   performance metrics such as sales and stock market performance. Online
   chatter amplifies the negative effect of recalls on downstream sales by
   about 4.5 times.

AB Observed contracts in the real world are often very simple, which partly
   reflects the constraints faced by contracting firms in making the
   contracts more complex. In this article, the authors focus on one such
   rigidity: the constraints faced by firms in fine-tuning contracts to the
   full distribution of heterogeneity of their employees. The authors
   explore the implication of these constraints for the provision of
   incentives within the firm. The study's application is to sales force
   compensation, wherein a firm maintains a sales force to market its
   products. Consistent with ubiquitous real-world business practice, the
   study assumes that a firm is restricted to fully or partially set
   uniform commissions across its agent pool. The authors show that this
   restriction implies an interaction between the composition of agent
   types in the contract and the compensation policy used to motivate them,
   leading to a "contractual externality" in the firm and generating gains
   to sorting. This article explains how this contractual externality
   arises; discusses a practical approach to endogenizing agents and
   incentives at a firm in its presence; and presents an empirical
   application to sales force compensation contracts at a U.S. Fortune 500
   company that explores these considerations and assesses the gains from a
   sales force architecture that sorts agents into divisions to balance
   firm wide incentives. Empirically, the authors find that the restriction
   to homogeneous plans significantly reduces a firm's payoff, relative to
   a fully heterogeneous plan, when the firm is unable to optimize the
   composition of its agents. However, a firm's payoff under a homogeneous
   plan comes very close to that under a fully heterogeneous plan when the
   firm can optimize both composition and compensation. Thus, in the
   empirical setting of this study, the ability to choose agents mitigates
   the loss in incentives from the restriction to uniform contracts. The
   authors conjecture this result may hold more broadly.

AB The authors add to the sales management literature in three ways. First,
   they demonstrate that a firm can benefit from higher sales uncertainty.
   This is contrary to the finding from the standard principal-agent models
   that more sales uncertainty hurts the firm when agents are risk-averse.
   Second, the authors find that the risk-averse agent's total pay can
   increase when there is high sales uncertainty, and this too is contrary
   to the standard principal-agent model. Third, they provide intuition for
   this surprising result by showing that it holds when the slope of the
   sales response function is random but not when the intercept is random.
   When the responsiveness (slope) of sales to a decision variable (of the
   firm or the agent) is random, information about randomness becomes
   decision-relevant and the firm can exploit learned information. In this
   study's model, the agent and firm can receive noisy signals of random
   demand. When the customers' response to effort (or price) is random, the
   decision about effort (price) responds optimally to information in a way
   that benefits the firm. When uncertainty is high, there is more
   potential information for the firm to exploit profitably, owing to the
   convexity of the sales with respect to the uncertainty parameter. This
   is enough to dominate the negative impact of uncertainty owing to
   agents' risk aversion. When randomness affects only baseline sales
   (intercept), received signals are not decision-relevant. In that case,
   higher uncertainty has only a negative impact, just as in standard
   principal-agent models.

AB Decisions about life annuities are an important part of consumer
   decumulation of retirement assets, yet they are relatively underexplored
   by marketing researchers studying consumer financial decision making. In
   this article, the authors propose and estimate a model of individual
   preferences for life annuity attributes using a choice-based
   stated-preference survey. Annuities are presented in terms of
   consumer-relevant attributes such as monthly income, yearly adjustments,
   period certain guarantees, and company financial strength. The authors
   find that these attributes directly influence consumer preferences
   beyond their impact on the annuity's expected present value. The
   strength of the direct influence depends on how annuities are described:
   when annuities are represented only through basic attributes, consumers
   undervalue inflation protection, and preferences are not monotonically
   increasing in duration of period certain guarantees. When descriptions
   of annuities are enriched with cumulative payment information, consumers
   no longer undervalue inflation protection, but nonlinear preferences for
   period certain options remain. The authors find that among annuities
   with the same expected payout but different annual increases and period
   certain guarantees, the proportion of consumers who choose the annuity
   over self-management can vary by more than a factor of 2.

AB This article examines the popular marketing practice of interdependent
   ideation, whereby firms solicit ideas from customers through online
   platforms that enable customers to be exposed to or "inspired" by other
   customers' ideas when generating their own. Although being exposed to
   others' ideas means that customers are "connected" (at least implicitly)
   in a communication network that facilities the flow of ideas, the effect
   of network structure on individual innovativeness has not been
   considered in this context. The authors examine how, when, and why
   network structure-specifically, the clustering, or interconnectivity, of
   one's "inspirations" (other customers)-affects the innovativeness of
   individual customers' product/service ideas in ideation tasks. Across
   five experiments, the authors show that (1) higher
   clustering/interconnectivity negatively affects the innovativeness of a
   customer's ideas; (2) this effect occurs because idea inspirations are
   more likely to be similar or redundant when their sources (i.e., other
   customers to which one is connected) are clustered; (3) greater
   redundancy among ideas used as inspirations is what causes lower
   innovativeness; and (4) this effect is attenuated when customers do not
   rely on other customers' ideas for inspiration.

AB Third party-hosted consumer communities in general, and brand
   communities in particular, have been touted for their ability to
   generate value for firms by promoting consumer-to-consumer (C2C)
   helping. However, little research has examined whether consumer
   communities actually foster C2C helping, and who is helped. In contrast,
   the brand-community literature suggests community strategies may reduce
   the likelihood of community members helping non-community members. If
   so, strategies that promote third party-hosted brand or product-category
   communities may be counterproductive in fostering C2C helping. Should
   firms focus on promoting brand communities, promoting product-category
   communities, or both? On the basis of a hazard model analysis of 9,192
   actual C2C helping events over a 25-month period, and supported by a
   second cross-sectional study, this article examines how participation in
   brand and product-category communities influences one's likelihood of
   helping others. We find that brand-community participation increases
   one's likelihood of helping fellow members while reducing the likelihood
   of helping members of rival brand communities. Surprisingly,
   product-category community participation reduces one's likelihood of
   helping members of brand communities. The authors discuss managerial
   recommendations.

AB The increasing amount of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has
   significantly affected the way consumers make purchase decisions.
   Empirical studies have established an effect of eWOM on sales but
   disagree on which online platforms, products, and eWOM metrics moderate
   this effect. The authors conduct a meta-analysis of 1,532 effect sizes
   across 96 studies covering 40 platforms and 26 product categories. On
   average, eWOM is positively correlated with sales (. 091), but its
   effectiveness differs across platform, product, and metric factors. For
   example, the effectiveness of eWOM on social media platforms is stronger
   when eWOM receivers can assess their own similarity to eWOM senders,
   whereas these homophily details do not influence the effectiveness of
   eWOM for e-commerce platforms. In addition, whereas eWOM has a stronger
   effect on sales for tangible goods new to the market, the product life
   cycle does not moderate the eWOM effectiveness for services. With
   respect to the eWOM metrics, eWOM volume has a stronger impact on sales
   than eWOM valence. In addition, negative eWOM does not always jeopardize
   sales, but high variability does.

AB Launching breakthrough and incremental new products is vital to firm
   performance; it also resonates with both ego (i.e., directly connected
   partners) and global (i.e., interconnected ties in an industry) network
   perspectives. Prior research has listed several ego network-and global
   network-level factors that affect innovations, but this study goes a
   step further, to reveal the interactions of these factors as critical
   product launch mechanisms. An analysis of alliance networks in the
   consumer packaged goods industry from 1990 to 2010 shows that a central
   position in a global network represents a double-edged sword: it
   improves a firm's incremental new product launches but harms its
   breakthrough new product launches. Furthermore, a firm's ego network
   (manifested as density and diversity) and R&D capability enable it to
   leverage its global network position by enhancing the benefits for
   incremental new products and mitigating its hazards for breakthrough new
   products. This study's findings thus offer new insights into the role of
   ego and global networks in facilitating or hindering new product
   launches.

AB People can be aware (conscious) or unaware (unconscious) of an active
   goal when making a choice. Being aware of a goal enables people to use
   conscious strategies to identify attributes that are relevant to goal
   pursuit and to assess the efficacy of the attributes of each choice
   alternative. For most people, this process encourages the choice of the
   most goal-consistent alternative. For some people, this process
   encourages the consideration of trade-offs, activates a competing goal,
   and encourages the choice of a goal-inconsistent alternative. With
   unconscious goal pursuit, people cannot devote resources to assessing
   the efficacy of the attributes of each alternative; therefore, they
   match the accessible goal to the attributes of the available
   alternatives. As a result, the unconscious selects an alternative with
   attributes that are consistent with the goal and not necessarily the
   alternative that is most efficacious for the goal. The authors
   investigate these processes by manipulating the conscious system's
   ability to assess the efficacy of product attributes and the unconscious
   system's ability to match the accessible goal to product attributes.

AB Many marketing communications are carefully designed to cast a brand in
   its most favorable light. For example, marketers may prefer to highlight
   a brand's membership in the top 10 tier of a third-party list instead of
   disclosing the brand's exact rank. The authors propose that when
   marketers use these types of imprecise advertising claims, subtle
   differences in the selection of a tier boundary (e.g., top 9 vs. top 10)
   can influence consumers' evaluations and willingness to pay.
   Specifically, the authors find a comfort tier effect in which a weaker
   claim that references a less exclusive but commonly used tier boundary
   can actually lead to higher brand evaluations than a stronger claim that
   references a more exclusive but less common tier boundary. This effect
   is attributed to a two-stage process by which consumers evaluate
   imprecise rank claims. The results demonstrate that consumers have
   specific expectations for how messages are constructed in marketing
   communications and may make negative inferences about a brand when these
   expectations are violated, thus attenuating the positive effect such
   claims might otherwise have on consumer responses.

AB Anchoring, the biasing of estimates toward a previously considered
   value, is a long-standing and oft-studied phenomenon in consumer
   research. However, most anchoring work has been in the lab, and the
   results from field work have been mixed. Here, the authors use real
   transactions from an empirically investigated and commercially-employed
   pricing scheme ("pay what you want") to better understand how anchors
   influence payments. Sixteen field studies (N = 21,997) and four
   hypothetical studies (N = 3,174) reveal four main points: (1) Although
   anchoring replicates both with and without financial consequences
   (Studies 1-2), the percentile rank gap between anchors in the
   distribution of payments is a much stronger predictor of anchoring
   emerging than merely the absolute gap between the anchors on a number
   line (Studies 3-5). (2) Low anchors influence payments more than high
   anchors (Studies 6a-b). (3) Findings from the literature that should
   enhance anchoring effects-anchor precision, descriptive and injunctive
   norms, nonsuggestions-yield null results in payment (Studies 7-13). (4)
   The above patterns do not emerge in hypothetical settings (Studies
   14a-d), in which anchoring is as big and reliable as the literature has
   previously suggested.

AB Encouraging consumers to select meals in advance rather than at mealtime
   has been proposed as a strategy to promote healthier eating decisions,
   taking advantage of the improved self-control that is thought to
   accompany decisions about the future. In two field studies at an
   employee cafeteria and a third in a university setting, we examine how
   time delays between placing a lunch order and picking it up affect the
   healthfulness of that lunch. The first study, a secondary data analysis,
   finds that longer delays between placing an order and picking up the
   meal are associated with reductions in calorie content. The second study
   tests the causality of this relationship by exogenously restricting some
   lunch orders to be substantially delayed, leading to a marginally
   significant (approximately 5%) reduction in calories among delayed
   orders. The third study compares orders for truly immediate consumption
   versus orders placed in advance and demonstrates a significant (100
   calorie, or approximately 10%) reduction in lunch calories. We discuss
   evidence regarding possible theoretical mechanisms underlying this
   effect, as well as practical implications of our findings.

AB The authors focus on repeated distributive negotiations to investigate
   how expectations of role reversal in future transactions (i.e., a buyer
   [seller] in one transaction is the seller [buyer] in the next
   transaction) affect behaviors in the current negotiation. They
   demonstrate that when negotiators expect a role reversal, they are
   likely to make more concessions and reach agreement more quickly in the
   current negotiation. The authors find that this effect is driven by
   negotiators' beliefs that they will be able to recover these
   concessions, because negotiators expect their counterparts to
   reciprocate in the later transaction when the parties reverse roles.
   However, when the two negotiations occur in different "accounting"
   periods (i.e., fiscal periods) or when the negotiating parties do not
   explicitly communicate their willingness to reverse roles in the future,
   role-reversal expectations do not affect concession making. Implications
   arise in both managerial and consumer contexts where the possibility of
   engaging in future negotiations-as well as reversing roles-exists.

AB The marketplace is replete with productivity metrics that put units of
   output in the numerator and one unit of time in the denominator (e.g.,
   megabits per second [Mbps] to measure download speed). In this article,
   three studies examine how productivity metrics influence consumer
   decision making. Many consumers have incorrect intuitions about the
   impact of productivity increases on time savings: they do not
   sufficiently realize that productivity increases at the high end of the
   productivity range (e.g., from 40 to 50 Mbps) imply smaller time savings
   than productivity increases at the low end of the productivity range
   (e.g., from 10 to 20 Mbps). Consequently, the availability of
   productivity metrics increases willingness to pay for products and
   services that offer higher productivity levels. This tendency is smaller
   when consumers receive additional information about time savings through
   product experience or through metrics that are linearly related to time
   savings. Consumers' intuitions about time savings are also more accurate
   when they estimate time savings than when they rank them. Estimates are
   based less on absolute than on proportional changes in productivity (and
   proportional changes correspond more with actual time savings).

AB Price transparency initiatives are typically undertaken by third parties
   to ensure that consumers can compare the prices of competing offers in
   markets in which obtaining such information is costly. Such practices
   have recently become widespread, yet it is unclear whether the increased
   price competition due to lower search costs overcomes the potential for
   collusion between competitors due to lower price coordination costs.
   Motivated by this question, the authors investigate the effect of
   mandatory price posting (on large electronic signs) on the pricing
   behavior of competing gas stations in the Italian highway system. The
   authors find that when prices are posted, the average price of gasoline
   decreases by 1 euro cent per liter, which represents about 20% of
   stations' margins. About half the price decrease can be attributed to
   the introduction of a sign posting a station's own price and those of
   its nearest neighbors, with the other half due to the introduction of
   other signs posting the prices of other stations on the same road.
   Despite the price reduction, however, the introduction of signs seems to
   have little impact on price dispersion, suggesting that price
   uncertainty persists even after the policy is implemented. Analysis of
   customer transaction data confirms this finding, showing that less than
   10% of consumers use the posted price information effectively.

AB Although yes/no response formats have been used to increase enrollment
   rates in several different types of programs, their effectiveness has
   generally been tested in forced-choice settings. The effects on
   postchoice engagement have not been measured. Across two field
   experiments in an e-mail context in which choice is not forced, the
   authors demonstrate a substantial advantage in click-through rates for a
   yes/no response format over traditional opt-in response formats. The
   increase in click-through rate does, under certain conditions, also
   persist through downstream program enrollment and participation.
   Finally, though noting that the yes/no format advantage is probably
   multidetermined, the authors discuss several potential psychological
   mechanisms, which are particularly relevant in non-forced-choice
   settings. The authors also discuss how the yes/no response format might
   operate in other settings, such as the implementation of mandated choice
   for organ donation.

AB In search of effective ways to encourage consumers to follow desired
   behaviors such as healthy eating, recycling, or financial planning,
   marketers sometimes use praise (e.g., "You are doing great") and
   sometimes use scolding (e.g., "You are not doing enough"). However, the
   effectiveness of each approach in triggering behavior is not clear. A
   possible reason for the mixed results in this area is that it is not
   only what one says that matters but also how one says it: praising and
   scolding can be performed with a more or less assertive tone. This
   research introduces assertiveness as a moderator that can explain when
   praising or scolding would be more effective. Two field experiments in
   the context of hand hygiene and financial planning demonstrate that when
   communicators praise consumers, an assertive tone may be more effective
   in encouraging behavior, whereas scolding requires a nonassertive tone.
   The authors then replicate these field findings in a controlled
   laboratory experiment, which also provides click rates as an actual
   behavioral outcome.

AB Sex is ubiquitous in advertising, yet little research has explored the
   effect of exposure to sexual imagery on preferences. Although sex and
   romance tend to go together in real-world relationships, the authors
   find that exposure to sex-based ads decreases preference for
   romantically linked products and services in men. Furthermore, the
   authors find that the effect is one directional, such that exposure to
   romantic imagery in ads does not decrease men's preference for
   sex-related products. Finally, the authors find that exposure to
   sex-based ads does not lead to a decreased preference for romantically
   linked products in women. The authors explain this pattern of results
   through the relatively opportunistic nature of the sex drive in men.
   They close with a discussion about implications for theories of
   fundamental motives and for the effect of sex-based ad-vertisements on

   rise to numerous studies on the marketing-finance interface. This study
   integrates extant research findings and establishes empirical
   generalizations on marketing's impact on firm value. Specifically, the
   authors conduct a meta-analysis of prior econometric elasticity
   estimates of the stock market impact of marketing actions and marketing
   assets. Analyses based on 488 elasticities drawn from 83 studies reveal
   a mean elasticity of .04 for advertising expenditure variables and of
   .54 for marketing asset variables. Among marketing assets,
   customer-related assets show a higher mean elasticity of .72, compared
   with .33 for brand-related assets. Further analyses show that
   advertising elasticities are lower in more concentrated industries and
   that marketing asset elasticities are higher during recession times.
   Researchers should also be aware that characteristics of the research
   design (e.g., the type of firm value metric used, the omission of
   control variables, or not accounting for endogeneity) may affect the

AB This research demonstrates that the synesthetic cross-modal

   visual attention: high-frequency (low-frequency) sounds guide visual
   attention toward light-colored (dark-colored) objects. Three
   eye-tracking studies indicate that this influence is automatic; it
   arises without goals or conscious awareness, it seems to take precedence
   over the influence from a simultaneously occurring semantic
   correspondence, and it even operates despite explicit instructions to
   the contrary. Two additional studies highlight the potential role for
   this influence in marketing contexts. In Study 4, the audio frequency in
   a soundtrack guides visual attention in a commercial, as evidenced by
   recall of marketing messages. In Study 5, customers in a supermarket
   exposed to high-frequency (vs. low-frequency) music are more likely to
   purchase products from a shelf with light (vs. dark) decor.

AB Because security analysts, who serve as brokers between public firms and
   investors, arrive at their forecasts by incorporating guidance from
   managers, there is immense pressure on the managers to meet or beat
   analyst earnings forecasts; moreover, investors reward (penalize) firms
   for exceeding (missing) analyst forecasts. Reasoning that decisions
   taken in response to analyst forecasts involve discretionary budgets,
   the authors study four contingent conditions under which quarterly
   analyst forecasts drive unanticipated adjustments to advertising and R&D
   budgets, and the long-term consequences of these budgetary changes. The
   choice of contingent conditions is related to agency theory-driven
   concepts of monitoring and bonding costs. Results from a panel data set
   of 515 firms and a hierarchical Bayesian model that provides firm-level
   coefficients show that both artificially imposed incentives on managers
   (monitoring costs) and personal career management concerns (bonding
   costs) moderate the extent to which managers react to analyst forecasts.
   Specifically, (1) bonus versus equity proportion of CEO compensation
   enhances the likelihood of managers reacting to analyst forecasts with
   unanticipated decreases in advertising and R&D budgets; (2) output
   experience of CEOs decreases this likelihood; (3) throughput experience
   of CEOs increases this likelihood; and (4) increasing marketing and R&D
   intensity decreases this likelihood. The authors also find that the
   unanticipated adjustments in advertising and R&D budgets adversely
   affect long-term firm returns and risk.

AB Consumers frequently consume hedonic products together with other
   consumers and derive value from this shared experience. This article
   investigates the impact of shared consumption, a type of social
   influence that determines the enjoyment of joint experiences, in the
   context of a typical hedonic product: movies. The authors argue that
   this type of influence has important consequences for the diffusion
   curves of hedonic goods that are consumed together and the effectiveness
   of advertising in generating launch and postlaunch sales. An empirically
   validated agent-based model simulates the U.S. motion picture market,
   with new movies launching, competing, and exiting. The agent-based model
   serves as a means to demonstrate the essential role of shared
   consumption for explaining movie life cycles and tests how advertising
   expenditures accelerate and/or acquire movies' demand in markets with
   varying levels of shared consumption. The results provide key
   theoretical insights for the new product diffusion of hedonic products
   and help managers predict the financial consequences of their strategic
   decisions.

AB A plural alliance structure involving multiple downstream partners has

   continue to address mainly dyadic structures. The authors present
   learning and dependence balancing as key mechanisms to understand the
   relative performance differences between plural and dyadic structures,
   as well as the determinants of effective collaboration in a plural
   structure. Two complementary studies test the performance of plural and
   dyadic structures in a wide range of high-tech industries. The analysis
   of both plural and dyadic structure alliances in an event study shows
   that plural structures outperform dyadic structures for the upstream
   firm when marketing alliances extend to product-related tasks, the
   upstream firm has more alliance experience, or the industry is growing
   fast; however, dyadic structures perform better when the upstream market
   is more competitive. A second study, focusing only on plural structure
   alliances, shows that horizontal relationship factors (i.e., market
   overlap and prior relationship between downstream partners) interact
   with the upstream firm's greater alliance experience and reputation to
   lead to better returns for the upstream firm.

AB The author analyzes the impact of online ads on the advertiser's
   competitors, using data from randomized field experiments on a
   restaurant-search website. He finds that ads increase the chances of
   sales for nonadvertised restaurants significantly. The spillover
   benefits are concentrated on restaurants that serve the advertiser's
   cuisine and have a high rating on the restaurant-search website. The
   extent of spillovers also depends on the intensity of the advertising
   effort. The spillovers are largest when the intensity (frequency) of
   advertising is low. As the intensity increases, the spillovers disappear
   and the advertiser gains more sales. These patterns are consistent with
   the following mechanism: ads increase the chance of consumers buying the
   advertised product but also remind consumers of similar (nonadvertised)
   options. Higher ad intensity leads to a stronger direct effect favoring
   the advertiser and can offset the spillover caused by the broader
   reminder.

   consumers, who are chronically attuned to costs, show less severe
   expense neglect than "spendthrifts,"who are less attuned to costs. The

AB This research demonstrates the importance of thin slices of information
   in ad and brand evaluation, with important implications for advertising
   research and management. Three controlled experiments, two in the
   behavioral lab and one in the field, with exposure durations ranging
   from very brief (100 msec) to very long (30 sec), demonstrate that
   advertising evaluation critically depends on the duration of ad exposure
   and on how ads convey which product and brand they promote, but in
   surprising ways. The experiments show that upfront ads, which instantly
   convey what they promote, are evaluated positively after brief but also
   after longer exposure durations. Mystery ads, which suspend conveying
   what they promote, are evaluated negatively after brief but positively
   after longer exposure durations. False front ads, which initially convey
   another identity than what they promote, are evaluated positively after
   brief exposures but negatively after longer exposure durations. Bayesian
   mediation analysis demonstrates that the feeling of knowing what the ad
   promotes accounts for these ad-type effects on evaluation.

   tastes for the same items, people believe that a preference for one

   people sensibly expect others to like similar products, but erroneously
   expect others to dislike dissimilar ones. While people readily select
   dissimilar items for themselves (particularly if the dissimilar item is
   of higher quality than a similar one), they fail to predict this choice

   can place orders on computer screens. Can the interface that consumers
   use affect their choice of food? The authors focus on the "direct-touch"
   aspect of touch interfaces, whereby users can touch the screen in an
   interactive manner. In a series of five studies, they show that a touch
   interface, such as that provided by an iPad, compared with a nontouch
   interface, such as that of a desktop computer with a mouse, facilitates
   the choice of an affect-laden alternative over a cognitively superior
   one-what the authors call the "direct-touch effect." The studies provide

AB How does setting a donation option as the default in a charitable appeal
   affect people's decisions? In eight studies, comprising 11,508
   participants making 2,423 donation decisions in both experimental
   settings and a largescale natural field experiment, the authors
   investigate the effect of "choiceoption" defaults on the donation rate,
   average donation amount, and the resulting revenue. They find (1) a
   "scale-back" effect, in which low defaults reduce average donation
   amounts; (2) a "lower-bar" effect, in which defaulting a low amount
   increases donation rate; and (3) a "default-distraction" effect, in
   which introducing any defaults reduces the effect of other cues, such as
   positive charity information. Contrary to the view that setting defaults
   will backfire, defaults increased revenue in the field study. However,
   the findings suggest that defaults can sometimes be a "self-canceling"
   intervention, with countervailing effects of default option magnitude on
   decisions and resulting in no net effect on revenue. The authors discuss
   the implications of the findings for research on fundraising
   specifically, for choice architecture and behavioral interventions more
   generally, and for the use of "nudges" in policy decisions.

AB The authors offer a new conceptualization and operational model of
   consumer choice that allows context-sensitive information usage and
   preference heterogeneity to be separately and simultaneously captured,
   thus transforming the axiom of full information use into a testable
   hypothesis. A key contribution of the proposed framework is the
   integration of two previously disjointed and often antagonistic research
   paradigms: (1) the economic rationality perspective, which assumes
   stable preferences and full information usage, and (2) the psychological
   bounded-rationality perspective, which allows context-sensitive
   preferences and information selectivity. The authors demonstrate that
   the two paradigms can and do coexist in the same decision-making space,
   even at the level of individual consumer choices. The proposed
   information archetype mixture model is tested in four studies that span
   different product categories and levels of task complexity. The findings
   have ramifications for choice modeling theory and implementation, beyond
   the disciplinary boundaries of marketing to applied economics and
   choice-focused social sciences.

AB The authors investigate how horizontal versus vertical displays of
   alternatives affect assortment processing, perceived variety, and
   subsequent choice. Horizontal (vs. vertical) displays are easier to
   process due to a match between the human binocular vision field (which
   is horizontal in direction) and the dominant direction of eye movements
   required for processing horizontal displays. It is demonstrated that
   this processing fluency allows people to browse information more
   efficiently, which increases perceived assortment variety and ultimately
   leads tomore variety being chosen, and if the number of options chosen
   is allowed to vary, it leads to more options chosen. It is shown that
   because people see more variety in a horizontal (vs. vertical) display,
   they process a horizontal assortment more extensively. When more variety
   is positive, they find the choice task easier and have a higher level of
   satisfaction and confidence about their choices. When more variety is
   not necessarily positive, for example, in a choice of a single
   most-preferred option, these effects disappear. Two field studies, an
   eye-tracking study, and two lab studies support these conclusions.

   information as a "cue-of-the-cloud" and explore its unique consequences
   on offline consumer behavior. This research finds that when consumers
   are presented with relatively large amounts of information in offline
   purchasing situations, a cue-of-the-cloud can enhance purchase
   intentions and choice behaviors. This occurs because the cue increases
   consumers' confidence in being able to retain and access the information
   seen in-store, which engenders positive feelings about the decision to
   purchase. Four studies, including two experiments in real

AB How does interpersonal closeness (IC)-the perceived psychological
   proximity between a sender and a recipient-influence word-of-mouth (WOM)
   valence? The current research proposes that high levels of IC tend to
   increase the negativity of WOM shared, whereas low levels of IC tend to
   increase the positivity of WOM shared. The authors hypothesize that this
   effect is due to low versus high levels of IC triggering distinct
   psychological motives. Low IC activates the motive to self-enhance, and
   communicating positive information is typically more instrumental to
   this motive than communicating negative information. In contrast, high
   IC activates the motive to protect others, and communicating negative
   information is typically more instrumental to this motive than
   communicating positive information. Four experiments provide evidence
   for the basic effect and the underlying role of consumers' motives to
   self-enhance and protect others through mediation and moderation. The
   authors discuss implications for understanding how WOM spreads across

AB Strategic resource allocation in growth markets is always a challenging

   investments and expenditures for customer acquisition and retention in
   competitive and dynamic market environments. This study develops an
   analytical model to examine firms' investments in customer acquisition
   and retention for a new service; it develops hypotheses drawing on
   analytical findings and tests them with firm-level operating data of
   wireless telecommunications markets from 41 countries during 1999-2007.
   The empirical investigation shows that a firm's acquisition cost per
   customer is more sensitive to market position and competition than
   retention cost per customer. Furthermore, whereas firms leading in
   market share, on average, do not have a cost advantage over other firms
   in retaining customers, they have a substantial cost advantage in
   acquiring customers, and this advantage tends to increase with market
   penetration. The study results provide guidelines for firms' strategic
   resource allocation for customer acquisition and retention in
   competitive service markets.

AB This research illustrates how perceived economic mobility moderates the
   linkage between materialism and impulsive spending. Using various data
   sources, four studies show that materialistic consumers do not easily
   engage in impulsive spending when they perceive high economic mobility,
   whereas they tend to spend impulsively when they perceive low economic
   mobility. However, perceived economic mobility functions in the opposite
   manner when the purchase is a means to achieve financial success. The
   authors trace this effect to the self-regulation process of
   materialistic consumers, such that when perceiving high economic
   mobility, these consumers regulate their behavior toward long-term
   financial success, sacrificing the pleasure of acquisitions in the
   present. By elucidating the important role that perceived economic
   mobility plays in impulsive spending, the current research sheds new
   light on consumer research and offers managerial and public policy

AB In the modern advertising agency selection contest, each participating
   agency specifies not only its proposed creative campaign but also the
   budget required to purchase the agreed-on media. The advertiser selects
   the agency that offers the best combination of creative quality and
   media cost, similar to conducting a score auction. To participate in the
   contest, each agency needs to incur an up-front bid-preparation cost to
   cover the development of a customized creative campaign. Agency industry
   literature has called for the advertiser to fully reimburse such costs
   to all agencies that enter the contest. The authors analyze the optimal
   stipend policy of an advertiser facing agencies with asymmetric
   bid-preparation costs, such that the incumbent agency faces a lower
   bid-preparation cost than a competitor agency entering the contest. The
   authors show that reimbursing bid-preparation costs in full is never
   optimal, nor is reimbursing any part of the incumbent's bid-preparation
   cost. However, a stipend that is strictly lower than the competitor's
   bid-preparation cost can benefit the advertiser under certain
   conditions. The authors provide a sufficient condition (in terms of the
   distribution of agency values to the advertiser) for such a new-business
   stipend to benefit the advertiser.

AB Maintaining savings is an important financial goal. Yet there are times
   when savings should be spent, such as when people face unavoidable
   costs, and spending their savings allows them to avoid high interest
   rate debt. Existing behavioral research has focused on consumer
   decisions between savings and discretionary spending and has proposed
   interventions to promote savings in these contexts. However, when
   spending is not discretionary, such interventions could risk
   exacerbating a pattern found in economic research in which people borrow
   high interest rate debt while maintaining savings that earn low levels
   of interest. To examine how mental accounting interacts with
   considerations of personal responsibility and guilt to contribute to
   this pattern, this article explores whether people spend their savings
   when they need money most: during emergencies. Six studies reveal that
   people's tendency to preserve savings by borrowing from a high interest
   rate credit option varies as a function of the savings' intended use.
   Paradoxically, people are most likely to turn to high interest rate
   credit with the belief that doing so is the responsible option.

AB Research on choice architecture is shaping policy around the world,
   touching on areas ranging from retirement economics to environmental
   issues. Recently, researchers and policy makers have begun paying more
   attention not just to choice architecture but also to information
   architecture, or the format in which information is presented to people.
   In this article, the authors investigate information architecture as it
   applies to consumption in retirement. Specifically, in three
   experiments, they examine how people react to lump sums versus
   equivalent streams of monthly income. Their primary question of interest
   is whether people exhibit more or less sensitivity to changes in
   retirement wealth expressed as lump sums (e.g., $100,000) or monthly
   equivalents (e.g., $500 per month for life). They also test whether
   people exhibit an "illusion of wealth," by which lump sums seem more
   adequate than monthly amounts in certain conditions, as well as the
   opposite effect, in which lump sums seem less adequate. They conclude by
   discussing how format-dependent perceptions of wealth can affect policy
   and consumers' financial decision making.

AB Research on overeating assumes that pleasure must be sacrificed for the
   sake of good health. Contrary to this view, the authors show that
   focusing on sensory pleasure can make people happier and willing to
   spend more for less food, a triple win for public health, consumers, and
   companies alike. In five experiments, the authors ask U.S. and French
   adults and children to imagine vividly the taste, smell, and texture of
   three hedonic foods before choosing a portion size of another hedonic
   food. Compared with a control condition, this "multisensory imagery"
   intervention led hungry and nondieting people to choose smaller food
   portions, and they anticipated greater eating enjoyment and were willing
   to pay more for them. This occurred because multisensory imagery
   prompted participants to evaluate portions on the basis of expected
   sensory pleasure, which peaks with smaller portions, rather than hunger.
   In contrast, health-based interventions led people to choose a smaller
   portion than the one they expected to enjoymost-a hedonic cost for them
   and an economic cost for food marketers.

AB Defaults are extremely effective at covertly guiding choices, which
   raises concerns about how to employ them ethically and responsibly.
   Consumer advocates have proposed that disclosing how defaults are
   intended to influence choices could help protect consumers from being
   unknowingly manipulated. This research shows that consumers appreciate
   transparency, but disclosure does not make defaults less influential.
   Seven experiments demonstrate that disclosure alters how fair consumers
   perceive defaults to be but does not attenuate default effects because
   consumers do not understand how to counter the processes by which
   defaults bias their judgment. Given that defaults lead consumers to
   focus disproportionately on reasons to choose the default even with
   disclosure, debiasing default effects requires that consumers engage in
   a more balanced consideration of the default and its alternative.
   Encouraging people to articulate their preferences for the default or
   its alternative, as in a forced choice, shifts the focus away from the
   default and reduces default effects.

   context. They address the substantive and modeling challenges that arise
   in this setting, namely, (1) multiple discreteness, (2) brand switching,
   and (3) budget-constrained consumption. Using a Bayesian estimation, the
   authors are also able to infer the consumer's latent budgetary
   constraint using only transaction information, thus enabling managers to
   understand the customer's budgetary constraint without having to survey
   or depend on aggregate measures of budget constraints. Using the
   proposed framework, CPG manufacturers can assess CLV at the focal brand
   level as well as at the category level, a departure from CLV literature,
   which has mostly been firm centric. The authors implement the proposed
   model on panel data in the carbonated beverages category and showcase
   the benefits of the proposed model over simpler heuristics and
   conventional CLV approaches. Finally, they conduct two policy
   simulations describing the role of the budget constraint on CLV, as well
   as the asymmetric effects of pricing in this setting, and develop

   anticipate consuming something different in the future, they satiate at
   a slower rate in the present. The authors find the effect in both food

   satiation. This effect is cognitive; specifically, anticipating variety
   in future consumption generates positive thoughts about that future
   experience. The authors find two boundary conditions: the future
   consumption outcome must be (1) in a related product category and (2) at
   least as attractive as the present consumption outcome. The authors rule
   out potential alternative explanations such as mere exposure to variety,
   the possibility that the future experience is more attractive (rather

AB The authors analytically and experimentally evaluate how firms make
   decisions in a two-stage dyadic channel, in which firms decide on
   investments in the first stage and then on prices in the second stage.
   They find that firms' behavior differs significantly from the
   predictions of the standard economic model and is consistent with the
   existence of fairness concerns. Using a quantal response equilibrium
   model, in which both manufacturer and retailer make noisy best
   responses, the authors show that fairness significantly affects channel
   pricing decisions. In addition, they investigate what affects the
   perceptions of fairness. More specifically, they analyze whether the
   notion of fairness is influenced by social norms of strict equality, by
   endogenous investments and contributions that are affected by players'

   compare four principles of distributive fairness: strict egalitarianism;
   liberal egalitarianism; libertarianism; and a sequence-aligned ideal,
   which is studied for the first time in the literature. Surprisingly, the
   exogenous game structure reflected by the new ideal, whereby the
   sequence of moving determines the equitable payoff for players,
   significantly outperforms other fairness ideals, suggesting that equity
   in distribution channels can arise even in contests in which channel
   members have fairly different payoffs.

AB Consumers often make choices for joint consumption with committed
   relationship partners, and these choices may include more or less
   variety. When planning a weekend for oneself and one's spouse, for
   example, a person could choose more varied activities (e.g., going out
   to dinner, to a movie, and to a concert) or less varied activities
   (e.g., seeing several different movies). What might affect how much
   variety people choose? Five experiments demonstrate that how much
   variety consumers prefer for joint consumption in committed
   relationships depends on their relationship time perspective (i.e., the
   perceived time ahead in the relationship). When consumers perceive more
   (vs. less) time ahead in a committed relationship, they prefer more
   variety for joint consumption with their partners. This increased
   preference for variety is driven by a shift in how much excitement is
   valued within the relationship and is unique to choices for joint
   consumption with the specific relationship partner. The findings
   demonstrate that variety preferences depend not just on personal or
   situational factors but also on aspects of consumers' social
   relationships.

   while decreasing the clicks on organic search listings by about the same

AB Consumers often schedule their activities in an attempt to use their
   time more efficiently. Although the benefits of scheduling are well
   established, its potential downsides are not well understood. The
   authors examine whether scheduling uniquely undermines the benefits of
   leisure activities. In 13 studies using unambiguous leisure activities
   that consumers commonly schedule (e.g., movies, a coffee break), they
   find that scheduling a leisure activity (vs. experiencing it impromptu)
   makes it feel less free-flowing and more work-like. Furthermore,
   scheduling diminishes utility from leisure activities, in terms of both
   excitement in anticipation of the activities and experienced enjoyment.
   Importantly, the authors find that maintaining the free-flowing nature
   of the activity by "roughly scheduling" (without prespecified times)
   eliminates this effect, thus indicating that the effect is driven by a
   detriment from scheduling rather than by a boost from spontaneity. The
   reported findings highlight an important opportunity for marketers to
   improve consumers' experiences and utility by leveraging scheduling
   behavior while also providing important implications for consumer
   well-being from leisure consumption.

AB Does explicit recall help or hurt memory-based comparisons? It is often
   assumed that attempting to recall information from memory should
   facilitate-or at least not disrupt-memory-based comparisons. Using the
   domain of price comparisons, the authors demonstrate that memory-based
   price comparisons are less accurate when consumers first attempt to
   recall the past price versus when they do not try to do so.
   Attempting-and failing at-explicit price recall focuses attention on
   metacognitive experience, resulting in a feeling-of-not-knowing, which
   then blocks the implicit memory that people could otherwise use to make
   accurate price comparisons. Drawing attention to this metacognitive
   feeling-of-not-knowing increases the blocking effect of recall on
   implicit memory, whereas drawing attention away from the feeling reduces
   the blocking effect. The results identify a new type of memory
   blocking-metacognitive memory blocking-in which the
   feeling-of-not-knowing blocks implicit memory during judgments. They
   also provide further evidence of dual representations of price memory
   and demonstrate that most memory-based price comparisons are based on
   implicit memory and do not entail explicit recall of the reference
   price.

AB Consumers with inequity aversion experience some psychological
   disutility when buying products at unfair prices. Empirical evidence and
   behavioral research have suggested that consumersmay perceive a firm's
   priceas unfair when its profit margin is too high relative to consumers'
   surplus. The authors develop an analytical framework to investigate the
   effects of the consumer's inequity aversion on a firm's optimal pricing
   and quality decisions. They highlight several findings. First, because
   of the consumer's uncertainty about the firm's cost, the firm's optimal
   quality may be nonmonotone with respect to the degree of the consumer's
   inequity aversion. Second, stronger inequity aversion makes an
   inefficient firm worse off but may benefit an efficient firm. Third,
   stronger inequity aversion by the consumer can actually lower the
   consumer's monetary payoff (economic surplus) because the firm may
   reduce its quality to a greater extent than it reduces its price.
   Finally, as the expected cost efficiency in the market decreases, both
   the expected quality and the social surplus may increase rather than
   decrease.

AB Gift givers balance their goal to please recipients with gifts that
   match recipient preferences against their own goal to signal relational
   closeness with gifts that demonstrate their knowledge of the recipient.
   Five studies in a gift registry context show that when close (vs.
   distant) givers receive attribution for the gifts they choose, they are
   more likely to diverge from the registry to choose items that signal
   their close relationships. The authors find that close givers'
   divergence from the registry is not the result of their altruistic
   search for a "better" gift but is a strategic effort to express
   relational signals: it occurs only when givers will receive attribution
   for their choice. They show that close givers reconcile their goal
   conflict by engaging in motivated reasoning, which results in their
   perceptual distortion of the gift options in favor of
   relational-signaling gifts. Ironically, distant givers are more likely
   to choose gifts from the registry, resulting in the selection of items
   that better match recipient preferences.

AB Eating a food reduces the desire to eat more of that food.
   General-process theories of motivation posit that eating a food also
   increases the motivation to eat other foods-an effect known as
   cross-stimulus sensitization. The authors propose that eating a food
   selectively sensitizes consumers to its complements rather than to all
   foods. Eating a food activates a goal to consume foods that consumers
   perceive to be well paired with the consumed food. In five experiments,
   imagined and actual consumption of a food sensitized participants to
   complementary foods but not to unrelated or semantically associated
   foods. These findings suggest that cross-stimulus sensitization is more
   specific and predictable than previously assumed. The authors identify
   goal activation as the process through which cross-stimulus
   sensitization occurs and can be instilled.

AB Fashions and conspicuous consumption play an important role in

   framework to analyze fashion cycles in data composed of (1) algorithmic
   methods for identifying cycles, (2) a statistical framework for
   identifying cycles, and (3) methods for examining the drivers of such
   cycles. In the first module, the author identifies cycles by
   pattern-matching the amplitude and length of cycles observed to a
   user-specified definition. In the second module, the author defines the
   conditional monotonicity property, derives conditions under which a
   data-generating process satisfies it, and demonstrates its role in
   generating cycles. A key challenge in estimating this model is the
   presence of endogenous lagged dependent variables, which the author
   addresses using system generalized method of moments estimators. Third,
   the author presents methods that exploit the longitudinal and geographic
   variations in agents' economic and cultural capital to examine the
   different theories of fashion. The author applies her framework to data
   on given names for infants, shows the presence of large-amplitude cycles
   both algorithmically and statistically, and confirms that the adoption
   patterns are consistent with Bourdieu's theory of fashion as a signal of

AB Marketing affects customer behavior, and customer behavior in turn
   drives a firm's cash flows and, ultimately, valuation. In this sequence
   of relationships, a commonly overlooked factor by marketers is the
   volatility of customers' cash flows. This study links different
   recurring customer behaviors to the future level and volatility of a
   customer's cash flows. Empirical analyses of the large customer database
   of a Fortune 500 retailer reveal that a 1% desired change in the
   different types of recurring customer behaviors corresponds to a future
   quarterly 4.61% decrease in the cash flow volatility and $39.42 million
   increase in the future cash flow level of the firm. Furthermore,
   firm-initiated marketing is 1.9-3.2 times more effective at managing the
   future cash flow level and volatility when it is selectively targeted to
   customers with certain characteristics. Overall, the study enables
   marketers to manage different customer behaviors that influence
   customers' future cash flow level and volatility and ultimately quantify
   the impact of these behaviors on the shareholder value of the firm.

   suggest that contextual factors often lead them to choose unhealthy
   alternatives (i.e., vices) rather than healthy ones (i.e., virtues).
   Noting the increasing prevalence of online grocery shopping, the authors
   focus on shopping channels as one such contextual factor and investigate
   how food choices made online differ from food choices made in a
   traditional brick-and-mortar store. A database study and three lab
   experiments demonstrate that consumers choose relatively fewer vices in
   the online shopping environment. Moreover, this shopping channel effect
   arises because online channels present products symbolically, whereas
   offline stores present them physically. A symbolic presentation mode
   decreases the products' vividness, which in turn diminishes consumers'
   desire to seek instant gratification and ultimately leads them to
   purchase fewer vices. These findings highlight several unexplored
   differences between online and offline shopping, with important
   implications for consumers, public policy makers, and retailers.

AB Retail atmospherics is emerging as a major competitive tool, and it is
   especially notable in the restaurant industry, where lighting is used to
   create the overall ambience and influence consumer experience. In
   addition to influencing overall experience, can ambient light luminance
   have unintended consequences in terms of influencing what diners order?
   The results of a field study at multiple locations of a major restaurant
   chain and a series of lab studies robustly show that consumers tend to
   choose less healthy food options when ambient lighting is dim (vs.
   bright). Process evidence suggests that this phenomenon occurs because
   ambient light luminance influences mental alertness, which in turn
   influences food choices. While restaurant and grocery store managers can
   use these insights and their ambient light switches to nudge consumers
   toward targeted food choices, such as healthy or high-margin signature
   items, health-conscious consumers can opt for dining environments with
   bright ambient lighting.

   includes a longitudinal survey design, with perceived relationship
   performance reported by a second informant. The study, conducted within

   different effects of positive and negative inequity and relative

AB Does "liking" a brand on Facebook cause a person to view it more
   favorably? Or is "liking" simply a symptom of being fond of a brand? The
   authors disentangle these possibilities and find evidence for the
   latter: brand attitudes and purchasing are predicted by consumers'
   preexisting fondness for brands, and these are the same regardless of
   when and whether consumers "like" brands on social media. In addition,
   we explore possible second-order effects by examining whether "liking"
   brands might cause consumers' friends to view that brand more favorably.
   When consumers see that a friend has "liked" a brand, they are less
   likely to buy the brand relative to when they learn that a friend
   genuinely likes the brand in the offline sense, which is a more
   meaningful social endorsement. Taken together, five experiments and two
   meta-analyses (N > 14,000) suggest that turning "liking" into improved
   brand attitudes and increased purchasing by consumers and their friends
   may require more than just the click of a button.

AB When companies organize salespeople into teams to compete with one
   another, how does the ability composition of team members affect effort?
   And how may the effect of team composition on effort depend on the type
   of contest the teams are competing in? Using a game-theoretic model, we
   derive the very sharp predictions that when winning the contest depends
   on the average team sales, the ability composition of a team has no
   effect on team effort, and the stronger and weaker members will expend
   identical effort levels. However, when the contest winner is determined
   by the minimum or maximum output contribution within the team,
   heterogeneity in team composition exerts a deleterious effect on team
   effort, with the stronger and weaker members expending unequal effort.
   Our model also shows that in a contest between two symmetric teams, when
   team members are homogeneous, all three contest metrics yield identical
   team effort; however, when team members are heterogeneous, the average
   metric elicits the highest team effort. We also discuss cases when the

AB The authors investigate whether sellers treat consumers differently on
   the basis of how well informed consumers appear to be. They implement a
   large-scale field experiment in which callers request price quotes from
   automotive repair shops. The authors show that sellers alter their
   initial price quotes depending on whether consumers appear to be
   correctly informed, uninformed, or misinformed about market prices. The
   authors find that repair shops quote higher prices to callers who cite a
   higher benchmark price and that women are quoted higher prices than men
   when callers signal that they are uninformed about market prices.
   However, gender differences disappear when callers mention a benchmark
   price for the repair. Finally, the authors find that repair shops are
   more likely to offer a price concession if asked to do so by a woman
   than if asked by a man.

AB Firms often vie for competitive advantage by providing additional
   services (amenities) to their customers. Although extant research has
   focused on the effect of adding amenities on choice, return on service
   amenities may arise from two sources: increased initial choice and
   increased revenues from repurchase. The authors develop a return on
   investment (ROI) model to capture how service amenities produce
   financial return from these two sources. They apply the model to hotel
   amenities, using a discrete choice experiment and a large-scale customer
   database developed in collaboration with a multibrand global hotel
   company. The authors employ a hierarchical Bayesian formulation to
   estimate the parameters. They use the estimation results to compare ROI
   for three amenities for six brands and find that returns vary across
   amenities, and returns on a single amenity can vary substantially across
   brands. The authors validate the results for one amenity against the ROI
   from the actual historical implementation of that amenity using a
   natural experiment with a before/after design with controls. The present
   research demonstrates that the return on service amenities model
   provides a useful decision tool for managers deciding which amenities
   are most profitable.

AB In two studies (a longitudinal field experimentwith an established
   business-to-consumer national chain, and a field experiment with a
   business-tobusiness software manufacturer), the authors demonstrate that
   starting a survey with an open-ended positive solicitation increases
   customer purchase behavior. Study 1, a longitudinal field experiment,
   shows that one year after the completion of a survey that began by
   asking customers what went well during their purchase experience, those
   customers spent 8.25% more than customers who had completed a survey
   that did not include the positive solicitation. Study 2 utlizes multiple
   treatment groups to assess the stepwise gains of solicitation,
   measurement, and solicitation frame. The results demonstrate (1) a mere
   solicitation effect, (2) a traditional mere measurement effect, and (3)
   an additional "mere measurement plus" effect of an open-ended positive
   solicitation; all effects increased customer spending. Specifically,
   starting a survey with an open-ended positive solicitation resulted in a
   32.88% increase in customer spending relative to a survey with no
   open-ended positive solicitation. The findings suggest that firms can
   proactively influence the feedback process. Soliciting open-ended
   positive feedback can create positively biased memories of an
   experience; the subsequent expression of those memories in an open-ended
   feedback format further reinforces them, making them more salient and
   accessible in guiding future purchase behavior.

AB Going beyond traditional seasonality, this research introduces the
   concept of the intrayear category demand cycle. This phenomenon reflects
   demand cycles most consumer packaged goods categories experience
   throughout the year, with periods of higher demand following periods of
   lower demand. The author argues that acknowledging the existence of
   these cycles and understanding their impact on both advertising and
   pricing effectiveness and practice is critical for marketers.
   Specifically, the author demonstrates how both advertising and price
   elasticities and observed advertising and prices evolve along these
   cycles for a unique set of 252 brands-ranging from high-advertising,
   high-priced "premium mass" brands to low-advertising, low-priced "value
   niche" brands-in 61 consumer packaged goods categories. Overall, both
   advertising efectiveness and observed advertising are found to be
   stronger at demand peaks. Surprisingly, consumer reactions to price
   decreases are weaker at demand peaks, whereas reactions to price
   increases remain unchanged. However, effectiveness evolutions and
   observed action patterns along these intrayear cycles are both markedly
   diverse across the different types of brands.

AB Acquisition is an important activity that enables firms to adapt their
   resource configurations. Acquisition literature has focused only on the
   levels of innovation or relational resources, the primary dimensions of
   organizational resource bases. The authors argue that in addition to the
   levels, the degree of overlap between the acquiring and target firms, in
   terms of innovation and relational resources, should influence
   acquisitions. Furthermore, they argue for the importance of the quality
   of the target's resources along with factors influencing the acquirer's
   absorptive capacity (e.g., the chief executive officer's [CEO's]
   functional background and the acquiring firm's marketing intensity and
   acquisition experience) as contingencies. Using 319 biopharmaceutical
   acquisitions and a random-effect regression model that accounts for
   unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of relational and
   innovation overlap, the authors find that innovation overlap has a
   positive effect, whereas relational overlap has a negative effect, on
   acquisition outcomes. Furthermore, the acquirer CEO's throughput
   background and acquisition experience negatively moderate, whereas the
   target's innovation resource quality and the acquirer's marketing
   intensity positively moderate, the influence of innovation overlap. The
   target's relational resource quality and the acquirer CEO's throughput
   background positively moderate the influence of relational overlap.

AB Investors, analysts, and regulators frequently advocate greater
   disclosure of nonfinancial information, such as customer metrics.
   Managers, however, argue that such metrics are costly to report, reveal
   sensitive information to competitors, and therefore will lower future
   cash flows. To examine these counterarguments, this study presents the
   first empirical examination of the prevalence and consequences of
   backward- and forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics by
   manually coding 511 annual reports of firms in two industries,
   telecommunications (365 reports) and airlines (146 reports). The results
   reveal significant heterogeneity in the disclosure of customer metrics
   across firms and between industries. On average, in both industries,
   firms make more backward-looking than forward-looking disclosures.
   Notably, forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics are negatively
   associated with investors' uncertainty in both industries and with
   analysts' uncertainty in the telecommunications industry. Importantly,
   the results do not support the managerial thesis that such disclosures
   have a negative impact on future cash flows.

AB This research examines the influence of chief executive officers'
   (CEOs') political ideologies-specifically, their degree of political
   liberalism (i.e., support for the Democratic Party relative to the
   Republican Party)-on firms' innovation propensity (i.e., rate of new
   product introductions [NPIs]). The authors propose that CEOs' degree of
   political liberalism positively affects their firms' rate of NPIs. This
   impact is weakened, however, when CEOs have low power, when a high
   proportion of their compensation comes from equity, when the marketing
   department has high influence in the top management team, and when the
   economy is growing. Liberal CEOs' greater rate of NPIs is associated
   with superior Tobin's q but also higher stock return volatility.
   Findings based on observations of 421 publicly listed U.S. firms from
   2006 to 2010 provide considerable support for the authors' hypotheses.
   The authors also examine changes in firms' rate of NPIs and performance
   around CEO turnovers and find corroborating evidence for their thesis.
   These results highlight the role of executives' personal values in
   shaping firms' innovation strategy as well as the risks and rewards
   associated with aggressive NPIs.

AB Conjoint analysis is a widely used method for determining how much
   certain attributes matter to consumers by observing a series of their
   choices. However, how those attributes are expressed has important
   consequences for their choices and thus for conclusions drawn by market
   researchers about attribute importance. Expanded attribute scales (e.g.,
   expressing exercise time in minutes) leads consumers to perceive greater
   differences between scale levels than contracted scales (e.g.,
   expressing exercise time in hours). The authors show in two domains that
   simply expanding an attribute's scale can shift choice toward
   alternatives that perform well on a scale that is expanded and thus can
   impact conjoint results such as attribute importance and screening.
   Thus, practitioners should take care when they choose precisely how to
   elicit preferences or how to describe their products: the extent of the
   scale's expansion will determine researchers' inferences about the
   importance of the attribute it describes. By illustrating the
   curvilinear relationship between scale expansion and multiple measures,
   the authors also offer practitioners some insight into the limits of
   scale expansion.

AB This article proposes a utilitarian model in which recycling could
   reduce consumers' negative emotions from wasting resources (i.e., taking
   more resources than what is being consumed) and increase consumers'
   positive emotions from disposing of consumed resources. The authors
   provide evidence for each component of the utility function using a
   series of choice problems and formulate hypotheses on the basis of a
   parsimonious utilitarian model. Experiments with real disposal behavior
   support the model hypotheses. The findings suggest that the positive
   emotions associated with recycling can overpower the negative emotions
   associated with wasting. As a result, consumers could use a larger
   amount of resources when recycling is an option, and more strikingly,
   this amount could go beyond the point at which their marginal
   consumption utility becomes zero. The authors extend the theoretical
   model and introduce acquisition utility and the moderating effect of the
   costs of recycling (financial, physical, and mental). From a policy
   perspective, this research argues for a better understanding of
   consumers' disposal behavior to increase the effectiveness of

   answer these questions, the authors conduct a field experiment on
   acquired Facebook page likes and find them to have a positive causal
   effect on offline customer behavior. Importantly, these likes are found
   to be most effective when the Facebook page is used as a platform for
   firm-initiated promotional communications. No effect of acquired page
   likes is found when customers interact organically with the firm's page,
   but a significant effect is found when the firm pays to boost its page
   posts and thus uses its Facebook page as a platform for paid

AB There is meaning in sound that transcends language. Structural
   differences in the sound of a spokesperson's voice or a piece of
   background music can influence a consumer's perception of product
   attributes through cross-modal inference. This article examines how
   differences in acoustic pitch in marketing communications influence
   consumer's perceptions of product size. Through six studies, the authors
   find that when associated with a product, lower pitch in voice or music
   leads consumers to infer a larger product size. Furthermore, evidence
   shows that this pitch-size effect occurs through a process of visual
   mental imagery, which can be facilitated through stronger visualization
   cues delivered via auditory channels and reduced when size perceptions
   are assessed directly in the presence of visual product information. The
   cross-modal effects between auditory stimuli and physical products
   represent an unexplored influence on consumer perception and behavior
   with important managerial and theoretical implications.

AB Seeding influential social network members is crucial for the success of
   a viral marketing campaign and product diffusion. In line with the
   assumption that connections between customers in social networks are
   binary ( either present or absent), previous research has generally
   recommended seeding network members who are well-connected. However, the
   importance of connections between customers varies substantially
   depending on the relationship's characteristics, such as its type (i.e.,
   friend, colleague, or acquaintance), duration, and interaction
   intensity. This research introduces a new Bayesian methodology to
   identify influential network members and takes into account the relative
   influence of different relationship characteristics on product
   diffusion. Two applications of the proposed methodology-the launch of a
   microfinance program across 43 Indian villages and information
   propagation in a large online social network-demonstrate the importance
   of weighting connections in social networks. Compared with traditional
   seeding strategies, the proposed methodology recommends substantially
   different sets of seeds that increased the reach by up to 10% in the
   first empirical application and up to 92% in the second.

   they present a dynamic model to measure the effects of various sizes of
   static (GIF) and animated (Flash) display ad formats and consider
   whether different ad contents, related to the brand or a price offer,
   are more or less effective for different ad formats and targeted or
   retargeted customer segments. To this end, the authors obtain six months
   of data on daily impressions, clicks, targeting, and ad creative content
   from a major U.S. retailer, and they develop a dynamic zero-inflated
   count model. Given the sparse, nonlinear, and non-Gaussian nature of the
   data, the study designs a particle filter/Markov chain Monte Carlo
   scheme for estimation. Results show that carry-over rates for dynamic
   formats are greater than those for static formats; however, static
   formats can still be effective for price ads and retargeting. Most
   notably, results also show that retargeted ads are effective only if

AB Given recent interest in social media, many brands now create content
   that they hope consumers will view and share with peers. While some
   campaigns indeed go "viral," their value to the brand is limited if they
   do not boost brand evaluation or increase purchase. Consequently, a key
   question is how to create valuable virality, or content that is not only
   shared but also beneficial to the brand. Share data from hundreds of
   real online ads, as well as controlled laboratory experiments,
   demonstrate that compared with informative appeals (which focus on
   product features), emotional appeals (which use drama, mood, music, and
   other emotion-eliciting strategies) are more likely to be shared.
   Informative appeals, in contrast, boost brand evaluations and purchase
   because the brand is an integral part of the ad content. By combining
   the benefits of both approaches, emotional brand-integral ads boost
   sharing while also bolstering brand-related outcomes. The authors'
   framework sheds light on how companies can generate valuable virality
   and the mechanisms underlying these effects.

AB Customer relationship management (CRM) campaigns have traditionally
   focused onmaximizing the profitability of the targeted customers. The
   authors demonstrate that in business settings characterized by network
   externalities, a CRM campaign that is aimed at changing the behavior of
   specific customers propagates through the social network, thereby also
   affecting the behavior of nontargeted customers. Using a randomized
   field experiment involving nearly 6,000 customers of a mobile
   telecommunication provider, they find that the social connections of
   targeted customers increase their consumption and become less likely to
   churn, due to a campaign that was neither targeted at them nor offered
   them any direct incentives. The authors estimate a social multiplier of
   1.28. That is, the effect of the campaign on first-degree connections of
   targeted customers is 28% of the effect of the campaign on the targeted
   customers. By further leveraging the randomized experimental design, the
   authors show that, consistent with a network externality account, the
   increase in activity among the nontargeted but connected customers is
   driven by the increase in communication between the targeted customers
   and their connections, making the local network of the nontargeted
   customers more valuable. These findings suggest that in targeting CRM
   marketing campaigns, firms should consider not only the profitability of
   the targeted customer but also the potential spillover of the campaign
   to nontargeted but connected customers.

AB Companies are eager to leverage social interactions among consumers by
   embedding social networking tools on their websites and actively
   integrating marketing actions with consumers' social activities. In this
   article, the authors investigate the impact of online social
   interactions on repeat usage behavior and the effectiveness of monetary
   incentives by formulating a model that parses out the effects of these
   individual factors. Using a unique data set from a wellness program,
   they find that online social interactions play a key role in driving
   repeat behavior, and after controlling for contemporaneous correlations
   from same-office friends, the social influence emanates even from
   distant friends working in different offices. The authors also find that
   monetary incentives have a significant impact on repeat usage and that
   ignoring this may overstate the impact of social influence. Furthermore,
   what-if scenario analyses show that social interactions are more
   effective than monetary incentives when both are present. The authors
   then explore social influence theories to understand the underlying
   process mechanisms that may operate in the repeat usage context. Using
   these findings, they offer strategic implications for marketing
   practice.

AB Salesperson turnover can have a negative overall effect on a firm.
   Research on salesperson turnover has conceptually studied the
   consequences of voluntary turnover on a firm. However, little empirical
   research has investigated the antecedents of salesperson
   turnover-specifically, the role of own effects (relative performance,
   customer satisfaction, and goal realization) and peer effects (peer
   performance variance and turnover). Therefore, the authors propose a
   framework to assess the influence of own factors (through identity
   theory) and of peer factors (through social identity theory) on
   salesperson turnover. Using a proportional hazard model implemented on
   data consisting of 6,727 salespeople over two years, the results suggest
   that in addition to own behaviors, managers need to pay attention to
   peer behaviors because peer turnover (voluntary and involuntary) greatly
   increases a salesperson's turnover probability. Furthermore, the results
   indicate that peer effects have a greater impact than own effects. This
   research has implications for sales force management because it helps
   managers (1) identify a salesperson's turnover risk, (2) diagnose the
   drivers of turnover behavior, and (3) build strategies to prevent
   salesperson turnover.

AB In a sorting task, consumers receive a set of representational items
   (e.g., products, brands) and sort them into piles such that the items in
   each pile "go together." The sorting task is flexible in accommodating
   different instructions and has been used for decades in exploratory
   marketing research in brand positioning and categorization. However, no
   general analytic procedures yet exist for analyzing sorting task data
   without performing arbitrary transformations to the data that influence
   the results and insights obtained. This manuscript introduces a flexible
   framework for analyzing sorting task data, as well as a new optimization
   approach to identify summary piles, which provide an easy way to explore
   associations consumers make among a set of items. Using two Monte Carlo
   simulations and an empirical application of single-serving snacks from a
   local retailer, the authors demonstrate that the resulting procedure is
   scalable, can provide additional insights beyond those offered by
   existing procedures, and requires mere minutes of computational time.

AB Mortgage decisions have important consequences for consumers, lenders,
   and the state of the economy more generally. Mortgage decisions are also
   prototypical of consumer financial choices that involve a stream of
   expenditures and consumption occurring across time. The authors use
   heterogeneity in time preferences for both immediate (present bias) and
   long-term outcomes to explain a sequence of mortgage decisions,
   including mortgage choice and the decision to abandon a mortgage. The
   authors employ an analytic model and a survey of mortgaged households
   augmented by zip code-level house price and foreclosure data. The model
   suggests and data confirm that consumers with greater present bias and
   long-term discounting tend to choose mortgages that minimize up-front
   costs. However, greater present bias decreases homeowners' willingness
   to abandon a mortgage, locking them into the contract. Long-term
   patience increases mortgage abandonment. This reversal across mortgage
   decisions is difficult for alternative accounts to explain. These
   results suggest that a two-parameter model of time preferences is
   helpful for understanding how homeowners make mortgage decisions.

AB Variable selection is a decision heuristic that describes a selective
   choice process in which choices are made on the basis of only a subset
   of product attributes while the presence of other ("inactive")
   attributes plays no active role in the decision. Within this context,
   the authors address two integrated topics that have received scant
   attention: the efficient design of choice experiments and the analysis
   of data that arises from a selective choice process. The authors propose
   a new dual-objective compound design criterion that incorporates prior
   information for the joint purpose of efficiently estimating the effects
   of the active attributes and detecting the effects of attributes labeled
   as inactive that may turn out to be active. The approach leverages
   self-stated auxiliary data as prior information both for
   individual-level customized design construction and in a heterogeneous
   variable selection model. The authors demonstrate the efficiency
   advantages of the approach relative to design benchmarks and highlight
   practical implications using both simulated data and actual data from a
   conjoint choice experiment in which individual designs were customized
   instantaneously using self-stated active-inactive attribute status.

AB This research explores how expressed emotional arousal in a consumer
   review affects reader perceptions of its helpfulness. Drawing from
   research on written communication and lay theories of emotion, the
   authors propose a pattern of diminishing returns, in which the marginal
   effect of arousal on perceived helpfulness is positive at low levels of
   arousal but diminishes at higher levels. Results of a field study using
   Apple's App Store, a follow-up survey, and two laboratory experiments
   provide consistent evidence for the predicted pattern. In addition, the
   results suggest that the nonlinear effect is explained in part by
   perceptions of reviewer effort and that the effect is stronger for
   products that are utilitarian in nature. By revealing a nuanced
   relationship between emotional expression and perceived helpfulness,
   these findings offer valuable implications for effective word-of-mouth

AB There is a growing interest among marketing scholars to examine the
   evolutionary bases of a wide range of consumer phenomena. While specific
   evolutionary hypotheses are typically tested using tools familiar to
   marketing researchers (e.g., experiments, surveys), the method of
   evolutionary psychology is rooted in its unique epistemology (the manner
   in which knowledge is generated and organized), which comprises three
   elements: (1) the distinction between proximate and ultimate
   explanations, (2) the building of nomolological networks of cumulative
   evidence (triangulation of convergent lines of evidence), and (3) an
   organizing tree of knowledge. The purpose of this article is to describe
   this process using marketing-relevant examples as a means of providing a
   framework of best practices to marketing scholars aiming to incorporate
   the evolutionary lens within their research programs.

AB Firms can save considerable money if consumers conserve resources (e.g.,
   if hotel patrons turn off the lights when leaving the room, if
   restaurant patrons use fewer paper napkins, if airline passengers clean
   up after themselves). In two studies conducted in real-world hotels, the
   authors show that consumers' conservation behavior is affected by the
   extent to which consumers perceive the firm as being green. Furthermore,
   consumer perceptions of firms' greenness and consumer conservation
   behavior depend on (1) whether the firm asks consumers to conserve
   resources, (2) the firm's own commitment to the environment, and (3) the
   firm's price image. In addition, firm requests to consumers to save
   resources can create consumer reactance and can backfire when firms
   themselves do not engage in visible costly environmental efforts. Such
   reactance is more likely for firms with a high-price image. Finally, the
   authors show that by spending a little money to signal environmental
   commitment, firms can save even more money through consumers'
   conservation of resources, resulting in wins for the firm, the consumer,
   and the environment.

AB Marketers of programs that are designed to help consumers reach goals
   face dual challenges of making the program attractive enough to
   encourage consumer signup while still motivating consumers to reach
   desirable goals and thus stay satisfied with the program. The authors
   offer a possible solution to this challenge: the emergency reserve, or
   slack with a cost. They demonstrate how an explicitly defined emergency
   reserve not only is preferred over other options for goal-related
   programs but can also lead to increased persistence. Study 1
   demonstrates that consumers prefer programs with emergency reserves to
   programs that do not have them, and Study 2 further clarifies that
   consumers' preference for an emergency reserve depends on the presence
   of a superordinate goal. Study 3 reveals that consumers prefer goals
   with emergency reserves because they perceive them to have both higher
   attainability and value than other goals. Study 4 demonstrates that
   reserves can lead to increased goal persistence in a realistic task that
   involves persistence over time. Finally, Studies 5 and 6 reveal that
   consumers persist more with reserve goals because they want to avoid
   using the "emergency" reserve.

AB The authors conduct a field experiment in which they vary the sales
   force compensation scheme at an Asian enterprise that sells consumer
   durable goods. With variation generated by the experimental treatments,
   the authors model sales force performance to identify the effectiveness
   of various forms of conditional and unconditional compensation. They
   account for salesperson heterogeneity using a hierarchical Bayesian
   framework to estimate the model. They find conditional compensation in
   the form of quota bonus incentives to improve performance; however, such
   compensation may lead to lower future performance. The authors find
   little difference in effectiveness between a quota bonus plan and
   punitive bonus plans framed as a penalty for not achieving quota. They
   find that unconditional compensation, in the form of reciprocity, is
   effective at improving sales force performance only when it is given as
   a delayed reward; however, the effectiveness of this plan decreases with
   repeated exposure. The authors also find heterogeneity in the impact of
   compensation on performance across salespeople, such that unconditional
   compensation is more effective for salespeople with high base
   performance, whereas conditional compensation is equally effective
   across all types of salespeople.

AB To complement their in-house, designer-driven efforts, companies are
   increasingly experimenting with crowdsourcing initiatives in which they
   invite their user communities to generate new product ideas. Although
   innovation scholars have begun to analyze the objective promise of
   crowdsourcing, the current research is unique in pointing out that
   merely marketing the source of design to customers might bring about an
   incremental increase in product sales. The findings from two randomized
   field experiments reveal that labeling crowdsourced new products as
   such-that is, marketing the product as "customer-ideated" at the point
   of purchase versus not mentioning the specific source of
   design-increased the product's actual market performance by up to 20%.
   Two controlled follow-up studies reveal that the effect observed in two
   distinct consumer goods domains (food and electronics) can be attributed
   to a quality inference: consumers perceive "customer-ideated" products
   to be based on ideas that address their needs more effectively, and the
   corresponding design mode is considered superior in generating promising
   new products.

   forums often explicitly tell respondents which attributes are most

   attributes mentioned by previous respondents, even if those attributes

AB To properly evaluate a potential product upgrade, consumers should
   compare the upgraded option with the product they already own to assess
   the upgrade's added utility. However, although consumers explicitly and
   spontaneously acknowledge the importance of comparing the upgrade with
   the status quo, the authors find that they often fail to do so.
   Consequently, consumers frequently buy product upgrades that they would
   not have bought had they followed their own advice. Five experiments,
   involving both real and hypothetical upgrade decisions, show that even
   when the status quo option is represented in the decision context, if
   consumers are not explicitly prompted to reflect on it or compare it
   with the upgraded option, they often do not compare it with the upgrade
   and thus show an elevated likelihood of upgrading. The experiments
   suggest that this "comparison neglect" increases upgrade likelihood by
   making people overlook the similarities between the upgraded and status
   quo options and that it persists even when deliberation effort is high.
   The findings have important implications for theory, marketing practice,
   and consumer welfare.

AB Word of mouth affects consumer behavior, but how does the language used
   in word of mouth shape that impact? Might certain types of consumers be
   more likely to use certain types of language, affecting whose words have
   more influence? Five studies, including textual analysis of more than
   1,000 online reviews, demonstrate that compared to more implicit
   endorsements (e.g., "I liked it," " I enjoyed it"),explicit endorsements
   (e.g., "I recommend it") are more persuasive and increase purchase
   intent. This occurs because explicit endorsers are perceived to like the
   product more and have more expertise. Looking at the endorsement
   language consumers actually use, however, shows that while consumer
   knowledge does affect endorsement style, its effect actually works in
   the opposite direction. Because novices are less aware that others have
   heterogeneous product preferences, they are more likely to use explicit
   endorsements. Consequently, the endorsement styles novices and experts
   tend to use may lead to greater persuasion by novices. These findings
   highlight the important role that language, and endorsement styles in
   particular, plays in shaping the effects of word of mouth.

AB Despite widespread conviction that neediness should be a top priority
   for charitable giving, this research documents a "charity beauty
   premium" in which donors often choose beautiful, but less needy, charity
   recipients instead. The authors propose that donors hold simultaneous
   yet incongruent preferences of wanting to support beautiful recipients
   (who tend to be judged as less needy), but believing they should support
   needy recipients. The authors also posit that preferences for beautiful
   recipients are most likely to emerge when decisions are intuitive,
   whereas preferences for needy recipients are most likely to emerge when
   decisions are deliberative. These propositions are tested in several
   ways. First, when a beautiful recipient is included in basic choice
   sets, this recipient becomes the most popular option and increases donor
   satisfaction. Second, heightening deliberation steers choices away from
   beautiful recipients and toward needier ones. Third, donors explicitly
   state that they "want" to give to beautiful recipients but "should" give
   to less beautiful, needier ones. Taken together, these findings
   reconcile and extend previous and sometimes conflicting results about

AB Prior research has indicated that greater dietary variety in a single

   obesity. This study presents a novel conceptual framework for
   investigating dietary variety across the entire diet according to time
   frame (cumulative vs. daily), aggregation level (overall vs.
   episode-specific), and categorization level (individual foods vs. food
   groups). This framework is used to assess how naturally occurring
   dietary variety relates to weight loss among overweight/obese women
   enrolled in a 16-week trial to achieve weight loss. Acknowledging this
   is a first exploratory attempt to test such relationships using
   correlational analyses, the authors uncover several key findings. First,
   whereas cumulative overall variety was not associated with weight loss,
   daily overall variety was positively associated with weight loss.
   Second, this relationship was strongest for variety during breakfast and
   afternoon snacks and was particularly driven by consuming greater
   vegetable variety. Overall, the authors develop a novel conceptual
   framework for investigating variety, and through application to a unique
   data set, uncover novel findings countering some existing theories about
   how dietary variety relates to weight loss success.

AB People often assume that costlier means lead to better outcomes, even in
   the absence of an objective relationship in the specific context. Such
   cost-benefit heuristics in goal pursuit have been observed across
   several domains, but their antecedents have not been fully explored. In
   this research, the authors propose that a person's tendency to use
   cost-benefit heuristics depends on the extent to which that person
   subscribes to the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE), an influential concept
   originally introduced to explain the rise of capitalism. The PWEis a
   core value predicated on the work-specific belief that hard work leads
   to success, but people who subscribe strongly to it tend to
   overgeneralize and align other work-unrelated cognitions for
   consistency. Across ten studies (N = 1,917) measuring and manipulating
   PWE, robust findings show that people who are high (vs. low) in PWE are
   more likely to use cost-benefit heuristics and are more likely to choose
   costlier means in pursuit of superior outcomes. Suggestions are provided
   for how marketers may identify consumers high versus low in PWE and
   tailor their offerings accordingly.

AB In business-to-business markets, top marketing and sales executives
   (TMSEs) have considerable influence on their organizations' customer
   strategies. When TMSEs switch firms, a pattern of informal
   organizational connections results; this pattern reflects the flow of
   information and knowledge among firms and createsmanagerial social
   capital in the process. To model this information flow, the current
   study considers information reach and richness, conceptualized according
   to the network position (i.e., centrality and brokerage) of the firm in
   the TMSE mobility network, which can be constructed by tracing executive
   movements through the work experience records of TMSEs in an industry.
   TMSE tenure (i.e., time with the firm) and firm market orientation
   constitute critical moderators, which capture motivation and ability at
   the individual and firm level, respectively. Data from the semiconductor
   industry and a model that corrects for unobserved heterogeneity and
   endogeneity suggest that managerial social capital enhances firm
   performance; however, TMSE tenure and firm market orientation are
   essential for absorbing the benefits of managerial social capital.

AB This study investigates time lapses that interrupt product consumption.
   Preeminent examples are commercial breaks during television or radio
   programming. The authors suggest that breaks facilitate consumers'
   search for alternatives. Specifically, when there is so much uncertainty
   that consumers are unclear about utility levels of different products,
   they engage in costly search to resolve the uncertainty. For TV
   programming, breaks lower the opportunity cost of search, allowing the
   consumer to sample alternative channels without further interrupting the
   viewing experience on the current channel. Using data from the Chinese
   TVmarket, the authors estimate a sequential search model to study
   consumer TV channel choice behavior. The data contain a quasi- natural
   experiment due to a Chinese government policy change on commercial
   breaks. The natural experiment creates exogenous variations in the data
   that enable the empirical identification of heterogeneous consumer
   preference and search cost. The data patterns support the idea that
   viewers search for alternatives during commercial breaks. Drawing on the
   estimates, the authors investigate how the timing of breaks affects TV
   channels' viewership, offering insights about how to strategically
   adjust the timing of breaks.

AB Peer-to-peer markets, collectively known as the sharing economy, have
   emerged as alternative suppliers of goods and services traditionally
   provided by long-established industries. The authors explore the
   economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent firms by studying
   the case of Airbnb, a prominent platform for short-term accommodations.
   They analyze Airbnb's entry into the state of Texas and quantify its
   impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. In
   Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel
   revenue is in the 8%-10% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform, with
   lowerpriced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business travelers
   being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily through
   less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers, not just
   participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially
   pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the South by
   Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of
   peerto-peer platforms-enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet
   demand.

AB The authors use evidence from store openings by a bricks-and-clicks
   retailer to examine the drivers of substitution and complementarity
   between online and offline retail channels. The evidence supports the
   coexistence of substitution across channels and complementarity in
   demand. In places where the retailer has a strong presence, the opening
   of an offline store is associated with a decrease in online sales and
   search; however, in places where the retailer does not have a strong
   presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with an increase
   in online sales and search. The evidence suggests that whereas online
   and offline channels may be substitutes in distribution, they are
   complements in marketing communications. Specifically, the type of
   marketing communication driving complementarity seems to be information
   about the existence of the brand. For example, the authors observe a
   large increase in new customer acquisition and sales, and little
   difference between fit and feel products and other products. Thus, it is
   the presence of the store, rather than information about the attributes
   of the products in the store, that drives complementarity.

   enrichment literature to include stated competitive reactions, collected

   apply theirmethod to investigate hypothetical and unprecedented sales
   force policy changes of pharmaceutical companies. The results from the
   data enrichment method have high face validity and lead to various
   unique insights compared with using revealed data only. The authors find
   that only a very large sales force decrease initiated by the market
   leader triggers all competitors to decrease their sales force as well,
   leading to substantial profit increases for each firm. With respect to
   sales force allocation, when competitors decrease their sales force,
   they mainly decrease the reach of detailing across doctors, rather than
   decreasing the number of details to the most-visited doctors. The
   proposed data enrichment method provides managers with a powerful tool
   to, ex ante, predict the consequences of unprecedented marketing policy

AB How does bundling affect valuation? This research proposes the asymmetry
   hypothesis in the valuation of bundles: consumers demand more
   compensation for the loss of items from bundles, compared with the loss
   of the same items in isolation, yet they express lower willingness to
   pay for items added to bundles, compared with the same items purchased
   separately. This asymmetry persists because bundling causes consumers to
   perceive multiple items as a single, inseparable gestalt unit. Thus,
   consumers resist altering the "whole" of the bundle by removing or
   adding items. Six studies demonstrate this asymmetry across judgments of
   monetary value (Studies 1 and 2) and (dis) satisfaction (Study 3).
   Moreover, bundle composition-the ability of different items to create
   the impression of a "whole"-moderates the effect of bundling on
   valuation (Study 4), and the need to replacemissing items (i.e.,
   restoring the "whole") mediates the effect of bundling on compensation
   demanded for losses (Study 5). Finally, the authors explore a boundary
   condition: the effect is attenuated for items that complete a set (Study
   6).

AB Marketers must constantly decide how to implement word-of-mouth (WOM)
   programs, and a well-developed decision support system (DSS) can provide
   them valuable assistance in doing so. The authors propose an agent-based
   framework that aggregates social network-level individual interactions
   to guide the construction of a successful DSS for WOM. The framework
   presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1) involve
   stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3)
   increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the
   DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium
   app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network
   and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based
   DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the
   most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments
   show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions
   and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing
   reward policies.

AB Consumers are often faced with the opportunity to purchase a new,

   consumers act more recklessly with their current products when in the
   presence of appealing, though not yet attained, product upgrades (not
   just mere replacements). Carelessness and neglect toward currently owned
   products stem from a desire to justify the attainment of upgrades
   without appearing wasteful. A series of studies with actual owners of a
   wide range of different goods (durable, consumable, functional, and
   hedonic products) and evidence from a real-word data set of lost Apple

AB This research explores how the experience of a jilt-the anticipation and
   subsequent inaccessibility of a highly desirable, aspirant
   option-influences preference for incumbent and non-incumbent options.
   The authors conceptualize jilting as a multi-stage process, which
   consists of a pre-jilt anticipatory phase that is initiated on the
   introduction of an aspirant option and a post-jilt phase that is
   initiated when the aspirant option becomes inaccessible. They show that
   during the anticipatory phase, a process of denigration specific to the
   incumbent option is engendered. The subsequent jilt elicits a negative
   emotional response. During the affectively charged post-jilt phase,
   preference shifts away from the nowdenigrated incumbent option, yielding
   a jilting effect. In four field and laboratory studies, the authors
   establish this jilting effect, rule out alternative accounts, and
   discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.

AB Investors routinely follow firms' communications and actions to form
   expectations about the firms' future performance. The authors propose a
   set of firm and industry characteristics that influence the formation of
   investor expectations in the context of new product announcements.
   Specifically, they argue that positive expectations of future innovation
   output should cause an ex-ante increase in stock prices and a smaller
   expost market reaction when an actual new product is announced. Using a
   sample of 4,865 new product announcements made by 826 publicly traded U.
   S. firms, the authors show that the stock market reaction to a new
   product announcement measured in a five-day window around the
   announcement is negatively related to (1) the number of new products
   previously announced by the firm, (2) the average number of new products
   previously announced by the firm's competitors, and (3) the average
   sentiment of past public news about the firm. These three factors are
   also positively related to the market value of the firm measured
   immediately before each new announcement, controlling for increases in
   firm value directly attributable to past new product announcements. In
   contrast to many articles in the marketing literature that imply that
   the added value of a marketing event can be fully assessed from the
   stock market reaction to the announcement of the event, the authors
   clarify that for recurrent events or events that are part of a firm's
   broader strategy, this reaction reflects only an update of investors'
   expectations of future firm performance.

   in product efficacy beliefs, feelings of competence, feelings of
   accomplishment, mood, task desirability, goal activation, or goal
   attainability. Instead, the self-expressive customization of a product
   extends an identity (e.g., personal identity, group identity) into the

   retweets of the company tweets. The authors find that both company
   tweets and influential retweets increase show viewing, but in different
   ways. Company tweets directly boost viewing, whereas influential
   retweets increase viewing if the show tweet is informative. Meanwhile,
   influential retweets are more effective than company tweets in bringing
   new Weibo followers to the company, which indirectly increases viewing.

AB Although email marketing is highly profitable and widely used by
   marketers, it has received limited attention in the marketing
   literature. Extant research has focused on either customers' email
   responses or the "average" effect of emails on purchases. In this
   article, the authors use data from a U.S. home improvement retailer to
   study customers' email open and purchase behaviors by using a unified
   hidden Markov and copula framework. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the
   authors find that email-active customers are not necessarily active in
   purchases, and vice versa. Furthermore, the number of emails sent by the
   retailer has a nonlinear effect on both the retailer's short-and
   long-term profitability. Through a counterfactual study, the authors
   provide a decision support system to guide retailers in making optimal
   email contact decisions. This study shows that sending the right number
   of emails is vital for long-term profitability. For example, sending
   four (ten) emails instead of the optimal number of seven emails can
   cause the retailer to lose 32%(16%) of its lifetime profit per customer.

   methodology they call "ghost ads," which facilitates this comparison by
   identifying the control group counterparts of the exposed consumers in a
   randomized experiment. The authors show that, relative to public service
   announcement and intent-to-treat A/B tests, ghost ads can reduce the
   cost of experimentation, improve measurement precision, deliver the
   relevant strategic baseline, and work with modern ad platforms that
   optimize ad delivery in real time. The authors also describe a variant,
   " predicted ghost ad" methodology, which is compatible with online
   display advertising platforms; their implementation records more than
   100 million predicted ghost ads per day. The authors demonstrate the
   methodology with an online retailer's display retargeting campaign. They
   show novel evidence that retargeting can work: the ads lifted website
   visits by 17.2% and purchases by 10.5%. Compared with intent-to-treat
   and public service announcement experiments, advertisers can measure ad
   lift just as precisely while spending at least an order of magnitude
   less.

AB The authors propose a new approach to evaluate the perceptions and
   performance of a large set of paid search ads. This approach consists of
   two parts. First, primary data on hundreds of ads are collected through
   paired comparisons of their relative ability to generate awareness,
   interest, desire, action, and click performance. The authors use the Elo
   algorithm, a statistical model calibrated on paired comparisons, to
   score the full set of ads on relative perceptions and click performance.
   The estimated scores validate the theoretical link between perceptions
   and performance. Second, the authors predict the perceptions and
   performance of new ads relative to the existing set using textual
   contentmetrics. The predictivemodel allows for direct effects and
   interactions of the text metrics, resulting in a "large p, small n"
   problem. They address this problem with a novel Bayesian implementation
   of the VANISH model, a penalized regression approach that allows for
   differential treatment of main and interaction effects, in a system of
   equations. The authors demonstrate that this approach ably forecasts
   relative ad performance by leveraging perceptions inferred from content

   existing research provides little guidance on online advertising
   decisions. In this study, the authors analyze the impact of banner
   advertising on consumers' online and offline behavior across multiple
   distinct campaigns for one focal firm, which predominantly sells through
   the offline channel. Results suggest that banner and TV advertising
   increase website visit incidence for consumers who have not visited the
   focal firm's website in the previous four weeks (nonrecent online
   consumers). For these consumers, banner and TV advertisements indirectly
   increase offline sales through website visits. For consumers who have
   visited the firm's website in the previous four weeks (recent online
   consumers), the authors find evidence for a cross-campaign,
   brand-building effect of banner advertising, and TV ads also directly
   affect offline purchases. Overall, the findings indicate that for firms
   that predominantly (or even exclusively) sell offline, banner
   advertising is most suitable to generate awareness for a firm's new
   products among nonrecent online consumers, and to build their brand(s)
   among recent online consumers.

AB Building on cultural values research, the authors identify specific
   image attributes on whichmulticountry brands should position themselves
   consistently acrossmarkets. Leveraging prior research, they identify
   three life values that are most equal (benevolence, universalism, and
   self-direction) and two that are least equal (power and hedonism) in
   cross-national importance. The authors link specific brand image
   attributes (e.g., friendly, social, elite style, arrogant) to these life
   values through empirical data and semantic analysis. Using an extensive
   field data set on consumer perceptions and preferences from 22 countries
   regarding more than 1,700 brands, the authors then show that greater
   global consistency of a brand's image decreases overall brand attitudes
   if the specific image attribute is one that is not equally desired
   worldwide. They also find that the attitudinal impact of a multicountry
   brand's positioning consistency on commonly valued image attributes is
   greater when the set of competitors the brand faces across its markets
   is more homogeneous. The authors discuss implications for global brand
   management theory and practice.

AB Franchisors' long-term viability is tied to the ongoing operations of
   their franchisees. To ensure the ongoing performance of franchisees,
   franchisors deploy multiple governance mechanisms. This study assesses
   how governance mechanisms deployed to enhance franchisee ability (via
   selection and socialization) and motivation (via incentives and
   monitoring) impact franchisee bankruptcy. The authors examine the
   individual and joint effects of deploying governance mechanisms that
   share the same underlying objective, namely, to enhance franchisee
   ability and motivation. They also assess how motivation-inducing
   mechanisms may serve to counter the motivation-dampening effect of an
   increased royalty rate. Relying on data from multiple archival sources,
   the authors identify all bankruptcy filings by franchisees and their
   franchisors across 1,115 franchise systems over a 13-year observation
   window. Their findings document a positive and significant relationship
   between franchisee and franchisor bankruptcy. They also find main and
   interaction effects of the ability-and motivation-influencing governance
   mechanisms on the likelihood of franchisee bankruptcy, and the existence
   of significant bankruptcy spillovers among franchisees within the same
   franchise system. They discuss implications for franchise theory and

AB Firms sometimes make selective or deceptive claims, which can have
   negative consequences for consumers, especially if consumers are not
   fully informed and the claims are hard to verify. This study aims to
   measure the decline in demand that a firm making such claims faces when
   caught. In addition, it seeks to understand which type of consumer these
   claims primarily affect. Using a panel data set of consumer purchases
   and firm advertising, the authors measure this impact by exploiting the
   fact that four popular products settled charges raised by the Federal
   Trade Commission. They further control for and document firm responses
   in terms of price and advertisement changes around the date of the
   settlement. Findings indicate a significant decline in demand following
   the termination of the claims, resulting in a 12%-67% monthly loss in
   revenue across the four products, which amounts to a $.40 million-$3.82
   million loss in monthly revenue. They also find that these claims
   primarily affect consumers who are newcomers.

AB To optimally set marketing communication ("marcom") budgets, reliable

   Empirical generalizations from meta-analyses of prior field studies can

   marcomcarryover effects was performed on Koyckmodel-based estimates
   collected before 1984 and was confined to mass media advertising. The
   authors update and extend extant empirical generalizations via two
   metaanalyses of carryover estimates compiled from studies encompassing
   personal selling, targeted advertising, and mass media advertising,
   using diverse model forms, until 2015. The first is focused on and
   utilizes 918 estimates of the carryover proportion of the total effect,
   termed long-term share of the total effect, and the second focuses on
   863 derivable estimates of 90% implied duration intervals. The authors
   find the mean long-term shares of the total effect for personal selling

AB Whereas many theories of decision making predict that presenting or not
   presenting common features of choice alternatives should not affect
   choice, in this research, the authors show that common features can be a
   powerful driver of choice behavior. They conjecture that consumers often
   hold expectations about the features that choice alternatives have in
   common, and they demonstrate that presenting (vs. omitting information
   about) a common feature increases the choice probability of the
   alternative that would have been expected to perform worse on the common
   feature, given its performance on differentiating features. This effect
   occurs because performance on the common feature is judged not at face
   value but relative to an expectation about which product should perform
   best on that feature. The effect holds even though performance on the
   common feature is clearly the same when alternatives are presented side
   by side. Finally, the authors demonstrate four boundary conditions of
   this effect.

AB Using data on advertising and sales of an innovative piece of golf
   equipment and the performance of its celebrity endorsers, the authors
   build a discrete-choice model that incorporates consumer awareness and
   preferences. They empirically investigate how celebrity endorsements
   affect consumer choices during new product introductions, the roles of
   planned advertising and unplanned media exposure, and how firms can
   strategically leverage the unplanned component. Model estimates reveal
   that wins in professional golf tournaments (which proxy for unplanned
   television exposure during weekly golf tournaments) affect awareness and
   that paid planned advertising impacts awareness and preferences.
   Focusing on Titleist equipment, counterfactual analysis demonstrates
   that the unplanned media exposure and planned advertising account for
   22% and 24% of sales, respectively. The results also suggest that firms
   would benefit from coordinating the two. The planned portion should
   serve as a substitute for unplanned media exposure in the early stage
   and a complement as products age.

AB Distributional assumptions for random utility models play an important
   role in relating observed product attributes to choice probabilities.
   Choice probabilities derived with independent errors have the property
   of independence of irrelevant alternatives, which often does not match
   observed substitution behavior and leads to inaccurate calculations of
   source of volume when new entrants are introduced. In this article, the
   authors parameterize the covariance matrix for a probit model so that
   similar brands in the preference space have higher correlation than
   dissimilar brands, resulting in higher rates of substitution. They find
   across multiple data sets that similarity based on overall utility, not
   just attributes, defines products as similar with heightened rates of
   substitution. The proposed model results in better in-sample and
   predictive fits to the data and more realistic measures of substitution
   for a new product introduction.

AB To begin building an understanding of how thoughts about God influence

   explores how reminders of God affect consumer compliance with fear-based
   advertising. Results across seven studies demonstrate that when the
   concept of God is salient, consumer compliance and persuasion in
   response to fear appeals is dampened. Importantly, the results suggest
   that one reason for this persuasion-dampening effect of God salience is
   the fact that consumers associate the concept of God with the idea of
   unlimited support. Consistent with this, the results reveal that when
   God is not associated with the idea of support, the dampening effect of
   God salience on fear appeal compliance is eliminated.

AB Customers acquired through a referral program have been observed to
   exhibit higher margins and lower churn than customers acquired through
   other means. Theory suggests two likely mechanisms for this phenomenon:
   (1) better matching between referred customers and the firm and (2)
   social enrichment by the referrer. The present study is the first to
   provide evidence of these two mechanisms in a customer referral program.
   Consistent with the theory that better matching affects contribution
   margins, (1) referrer-referral dyads exhibit shared unobservables in
   customer contribution margins, (2) referrers with more extensive
   experience bring in higher-margin referrals, and (3) this association
   between the referrer's experience and margin gap becomes smaller over
   the referral's lifetime. Consistent with the theory that social
   enrichment affects retention, referrals exhibit lower churn only as long
   as their referrer has not churned. These findings indicate that better
   matching and social enrichment are two mechanisms through which firms
   can leverage their customers' networks to gain new customers with higher
   customer lifetime value and convert social capital into economic
   capital. One recommendation for the managers of the firm studied is to
   recruit referrers among their customers who have been acquired at least
   six months ago, exhibit high margins, and are unlikely to churn.

AB Enacted in an effort to discourage negative political advertising,
   American regulations mandate that candidates endorse their ads ("My name
   is -, and I approve this message."). Four studies suggest that mandatory
   endorsements enhance the perceived credibility of some ads these
   regulations were designed to discourage. This research tests for what
   types of messages mandatory endorsements have this effect, and why.
   Mandatory endorsements boosted evaluations of policy-focused attack
   ads-those typically plagued by overcomeable skepticism-but had no
   consistent effect on positive or character-focused ads. Mandatory
   endorsements boost ad believability-largely outside of participants'
   awareness-for two reasons: (1) the tagline offers a legitimizing
   association with regulation and (2) the candidates' own personally
   delivered endorsement language offers an implicit promise of the ads'
   truth value. The authors discuss how these findings bring order to and
   extend previous work on mandatory endorsements and ironic effects of

AB Business-to-business firms spend significant resources in direct
   marketing to manage close relationships with their customers.
   Nevertheless, there is limited understanding of how the effectiveness of
   direct marketing communications varies by value propositions. Typically,
   direct marketing efforts are geared toward explicitly featuring economic
   or relational values. To implement an effective communication strategy
   catering to customers' preferences, firms should understand how
   customers consistently evaluate these organizational marketing
   communications, which ultimately affect their buying behaviors.
   Therefore, the authors analyze marketing messages and employ content
   analysis to capture the two distinct types of direct marketing
   communications. Using data from a Fortune 500 business-to-business
   service firm and a robust econometric model, they find that the (1)
   effects of economic and relational marketing communication on customer
   purchase behaviors interplay and vary over time, (2) latent stock of
   direct marketing communication affects customer purchase behaviors, and
   (3) evolution of customers' perceived importance can be recovered using
   transaction data. Overall, the authors provide a marketing resource
   reallocation strategy that enables marketers to customize marketing
   communications and improve a firm's financial performance.

AB Consumer lay theory suggests that women will spend more money than men
   in the presence of a physically dominant male employee, whereas theories
   of intrasexual competition from evolutionary psychology predict the
   opposite outcome. A retail field study demonstrates that male customers
   spend more money and purchase more expensive products than their female
   counterparts in the presence (vs. absence) of a physically dominant male
   employee. This effect has a more powerful impact on male customers who
   lack bodily markers of dominance (shorter stature or measures linked to
   lower levels of testosterone). When confronted with other physically
   dominant (vs. nondominant) men, these male customers are particularly
   prone to signal status through price or logo size. Their elevated
   feelings of intrasexual (male-to-male) competitiveness drive them to
   spend more money on status-signaling, but not functional, products and
   to prefer and draw larger brand logos. Because pictorial exposure is
   sufficient for the effect to occur, these findings are not limited to
   in-store interactions with dominant male employees but have broad
   implications for marketing and advertising.

AB Companies in a variety of sectors are increasingly managing customer
   churn proactively, generally by detecting customers at the highest risk
   of churning and targeting retention efforts towards them. While there is
   a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify
   customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated
   whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two
   field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author
   demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of
   churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn
   programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also
   suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms
   offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right
   targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts
   on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the
   intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity
   to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach
   is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the
   standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of
   churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers
   using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect
   of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers'
   response to select customer targets.

AB Television, the predominant advertisingmedium, is being transformed by
   the microtargeting capabilities of set-top boxes (STBs). By procuring
   impressions at the STB level (often denoted "programmatic television"),
   advertisers can now lower per-exposure costs and/or reach viewers most

   proprietary, household-level, single-source data set to develop an
   instantaneous show and advertisement viewing model to forecast
   consumers' exposure to advertising and the downstream consequences for
   impressions and sales. Viewing data suggest that person-specific factors
   dwarf brand-or show-specific factors in explaining advertising
   avoidance, thereby suggesting that device-level advertising targeting
   can be more effective than existing show-level targeting. Consistent
   with this observation, the model indicates that microtargeting lowers
   advertising costs and raises incremental profits considerably relative
   to show-level targeting. Further, these advantages are amplified when
   advertisers can buy in real time as opposed to up front.

AB This study examines the impact of frontline employees' problem solving
   on customer satisfaction (CSAT) during ongoing interactions prompted by
   service failures and complaints. Using outsourced regulation theory, the
   authors predict negative moderating effects of frontline relational work
   and displayed affect on the dynamic influence of frontline solving work
   on CSAT. Frontline employees' verbal (nonverbal) cues provide the basis
   to identify solving and relational work (displayed affect). The authors
   test hypotheses with data from video recordings of real-life
   problem-solving interactions involving airline customers as well as a
   controlled experimental study. They find that frontline solving work has
   a positive effect on CSAT, and it increases in magnitude as the
   interaction unfolds. However, this positive effect becomes weaker for
   relatively higher levels of frontline relational work or displayed
   affect and, conversely, stronger for relatively lower levels over time.
   In summary, overdoing relational work and overdisplaying positive affect
   diminish the efficacy of problem-solving interactions, a finding that
   provides implications for theory and practice.

AB This article studies the impact of shopping at the warehouse club format
   on households' purchases of packaged food for the home. In addition to
   low prices, this format has several unique characteristics that can
   influence packaged food purchases. The empirical analysis uses a
   combination of households' longitudinal grocery purchase information,
   rich survey data, and detailed item-level nutrition information. After
   accounting for selection on observables and unobservables, the authors
   find a substantial increase in the total quantity (servings per capita)
   of packaged food purchases attributable to shopping at this format.
   Because there is no effect on the nutritional quality of purchases, this
   translates into a substantial increase in calories, sugar, and saturated
   fat per capita. The increase comes primarily from storable and impulse
   foods, and it is drawn equally from foods that have positive and
   negative health halos. The results have important implications for how
   marketers can create win-win opportunities for themselves and for
   consumers.

AB Service firms develop win-back strategies to rectify issues that cause
   customer churn and rebuild relationships with lost customers. To better
   support retention, it is important to understand how the revived
   relationship evolves and possibly ends again. To examine customers'
   repeat churn behavior, we develop a "mixture cure-competing risks"
   model, jointly estimating the duration of second lifetimes, multiple
   reasons for churn, and heterogeneity of customers in exhibiting a
   related churn reason. The proposed model is tested using a data set from
   a large telecommunications provider including information on customer
   behavior and marketing activities during customers' first and second
   lifetimes. We find support for the existence of a "cured" group of
   returning customers, defined as those who are not susceptible to churn
   for the same reason they churned previously. Our findings suggest that
   mitigating repeat churn behavior can extend customers' second lifetime
   tenure and increase profitability by $150,000 over the lifetime of the
   customers in the sample (leading to gains of over $15 million for
   deferring second-lifetime churn in a million returning customers),
   depending on the type of churn.

AB This research finds that when a single gain has strong associations with
   multiple costs, consumers often mentally deduct that gain from perceived
   costs multiple times. For example, with some price promotions (e.g.,
   spend $200 now and receive a $50 gift card to spend in the future),
   consumers mentally deduct the value of the price promotion from the cost
   of the first purchase when they receive the promotion, as well as from
   the cost of the second purchase when they use the promotion. Multiple
   mental deductions based on a single gain result in consumers'
   perceptions that their costs are lower than they actually are, which can
   trigger higher expenditures. This mental accounting phenomenon, referred
   to as "double mental discounting," is driven by the extent to which
   gains feel associated, or coupled, with multiple purchases. This article
   also documents methods to decouple promotional gains from purchases,
   thus mitigating double mental discounting.

   function of the relative advantage of one option over another and of the
   different strategies that decision makers evoke when making a choice.
   They propose that context effects resulting from the addition of a third
   option to a two-option set are more frequently observed when the added
   option is relatively similar (adjacent) to the "disadvantaged"
   alternative (i.e., the lower-share option) in the set. The authors

AB The authors tested whether image-based information is more effective
   than text in changing implicit attitudes from positive to negative, even
   when both forms similarly change explicit attitudes. They studied
   corrective information (i.e., warnings about misleading advertising and
   product recall notices) because it is a common, important effort to
   change consumer attitudes. Corrective information in the form of
   pictures or imagery-evoking text, as well as direct instructions to
   imagine the scene, changed implicit attitudes more than plain,
   descriptive text, which is currently the most common warning method.
   Image-based stimuli can change implicit attitudes because they evoke
   vivid visual mental imagery of counterattitudinal valence (Experiments
   1-2). Conditions that hindered the formation of visual mental imagery
   blocked implicit attitude change, whereas cognitive busyness did not
   (Experiment 3). In short, imagery-based information changed both
   explicit and implicit attitudes, whereas materials not based on imagery
   changed only explicit attitudes. Managers and regulators who aim to
   protect consumers from claims and products that could do harm should use
   image-based campaigns to best convey the message effectively.

AB Consumers pursue numerous goals that are linked to particular time
   frames. Might one's likelihood of agreeing to pursue a goal fluctuate
   even if nothing about the goal's objective features changes, but if
   instead the only change is in how the time allotted for goal pursuit is
   described? Seven experiments show that consumers are more likely to
   agree to pursue goals when the completion interval is described by
   duration (e.g., "within exactly two weeks from now") instead of date
   (e.g., "between today and November 17"). This pattern may arise because
   dates, which may make it easier to retrieve competing obligations
   falling within the interval, lead people to focus more on the
   (unenjoyable) goal-pursuit process, whereas durations, which present the
   interval in isolation, allow people to focus more on the goal's
   (beneficial) outcome. These findings suggest that although how a time
   interval is described seems inconsequential, it has striking effects on
   goal-pursuit decisions and therefore has important implications for the
   marketing of products and actions designed to assist consumers in
   achieving their goals.

AB In this study, the authors investigate the externalities of managers'
   responses (MRs) to online reviews on popular travel websites.
   Specifically, the authors examine the effect of publicly responding to
   hotel guests' reviews on subsequent reviewer ratings. The authors find
   that manager responses to negative reviews (MR-N) can significantly
   influence subsequent opinion in a positive way if those responses are
   observable at the time of reviewing. Notably, the findings show this
   externality to be negative for manager responses to positive reviews
   (MR-P). The authors conduct a topic analysis on review texts and
   corresponding MRs to study the moderating role of response tailoring on
   the opinion externalities of MR. The authors show that tailored MR
   amplifies the positive (negative) impact of MR-N (MR-P) on subsequent
   opinion. Intuitively, tailoring an MR-N adds specificity to the hotel's
   complaint management strategy, bolstering the positive effects of MR-N
   on subsequent opinion. However, by highlighting specific positive
   elements of a review, managers' intent for responding is brought into
   question as they take advantage of reviewers' positive feedback to
   promote their hotel.

AB This research draws from the psychodynamic perspective of social
   identity theory to examine the causal effect of mergers and acquisitions
   involving a mismatch of external images on the sales force. Study 1, a
   natural longitudinal experiment, shows that a merger with a poorer-image
   firm immediately dilutes sales people's organizational identification
   (OI), which in turn impairs their performance. As sense makers, sales
   people who are more tenured experience stronger OI dilution, whereas
   those who perceive a high level of social inclusion experience weaker OI
   dilution. As sense givers, managers who emphasize the firm's strategic
   intent in their communication buffer the OI-dilution effect, whereas
   those who emphasize the firm's organizational culture aggravate the
   effect. Study 2, a scenario-based experiment, further demonstrates that
   the OI-dilution effect is stronger than the OI-enhancement effect from
   merging with a better-image firm. Furthermore, both studies confirm that
   the adverse effect of mergers and acquisitions that involve a mismatch
   of external image stems from image uncertainty rather than job
   uncertainty.

AB Although the actions of others can influence a consumer's behavior,
   these actions are often at odds with performance norms. For example,
   charities can experience relatively low rates of support (resulting in a
   negative deviation from a performance norm) or relatively high rates of
   support (resulting in a positive deviation from a performance norm).
   Previous research provides evidence of the equivocal effects of these
   deviations, with both positive and negative deviations motivating
   prosocial behaviors. The current research reconciles these competing
   findings by introducing construal as a moderator. Across four studies,
   the authors find that positive deviations from performance norms
   motivate prosocial behavior for independent donors, whereas negative
   deviations from performance norms motivate prosocial behavior for
   interdependent donors. They further show that these effects are driven
   by a prevention focus associated with interdependent consumers and a
   promotion focus associated with independent consumers. The article
   concludes with implications for the marketing of charities and prosocial
   behaviors.

   consumer search costs, market by market, using price data for retail
   gasoline in the United States. They find that the distribution of
   consumer search costs varies significantly across geographic markets and
   that distribution of household income is closely associated with search

AB Sales induced through price promotions depend heavily on discount depth,
   so firms create mechanisms to influence perceptions of discount depth.
   Typically, consumers compute discount depth as the difference between
   the sale price and the original price, with this difference compared
   against the original price. But thus far, no research has examined the
   effect of reframing this difference by comparing the discount depth
   against the sale price. Multiple studies, including a field study across
   four grocery stores, show that framing the discount depth by comparing
   it against the sale price increases consumers' discount depth
   perceptions and thus increases purchase intentions. As evidence of the
   underlying process, the authors identify boundary conditions related to
   both individual differences (numeracy) and managerially relevant factors
   (discount depth size). In addition to contributing to research on price
   promotions, behavioral pricing, and numeric processing, the article
   offers implications for both practitioners and policy makers focused on

AB Goals are constructs that direct choice behavior by guiding a decision
   maker toward desirable (or away from undesirable) end states. Often,
   consumers are motivated to satisfy multiple goals within a single
   choice. Although previous research has recognized this possibility, it
   has not directly formulated models of choice as a multigoal problem. The
   authors develop such a model, referred to as the multiple-goal-based
   choice model, which incorporates (1) simultaneous multiple goal pursuit
   and (2) context-driven goal adaptation but (3) does not require a priori
   identification of the number or nature of the goals. Goal adaptation
   within a single choice instance, allied to repeated choices, is the key
   to empirical identification of multiple latent goals. The proposed model
   is tested and supported using discrete choice experimental data on
   digital cameras through multiple validation exercises. The model can
   lead to significantly different policy implications with regard to
   consumers' valuation for new product designs, compared with extant
   utility-based choice models.

AB The pervasive use of merchandise (i.e., noncash) incentives in sales
   compensation plans is an empirical and theoretical puzzle given the
   supposed superiority of cash incentives in the standard theory (i.e.,
   principal-agent models) as well as the scant, and contradictory
   empirical evidence. The authors conducted a large-scale field
   intervention that switched 580 salespeople at a large frozen food
   manufacturer away from their cash plus "merchandise points" bonus to a
   commensurate all-cash bonus. After controlling for salesperson,
   seasonality, year, and target effects, the authors estimate that sales,
   on average, dropped by 4.36%. Furthermore, they estimated
   individuallevel sales changes and effort changes to validate the
   incentive-effort-sales causal chain. The results show that the top
   salespeople experienced the largest drops in sales. A post-intervention
   survey of social and individual difference variables reveals that
   salespeople from households with more discretionary financial resources
   and those who think more abstractly about the uses of cash income
   exhibited smaller reductions in effort and sales. Although the absence
   of a control group prevents the authors from making strong causal
   inferences, this set of results nevertheless provides descriptive and
   suggestive evidence for separate mental accounts as the most promising
   explanation for the greater utility provided by merchandise incentives.

AB Consumers nowadays have easy and rich access to information about social
   others who are pursuing goals similar to their own (e.g., through a
   Fitbit device, the Endomondo mobile app, stickK.com). This research
   focuses on objective social information during goal striving (e.g.,
   performance data and progress information of others) and shows that this
   information may not always be welcome. The author finds that when people
   are in the middle of a goal pursuit journey (vs. when they have just
   begun or are about to complete their goal), to circumvent potentially
   negative comparisons, they avoid information about social referents who
   are relevant (pursuing the same goal), proximal (in the same stage of
   goal pursuit), and superior. Head turn frequency, eye movements, and
   consumers' direct choices in the lab and in the field are used to
   document a U-shaped pattern of information avoidance behavior, which
   paradoxically contributes to the phenomenon whereby goal pursuers become
   "stuck in the middle" of their pursuits. These findings connect the
   information avoidance literature with the psychophysics of goal pursuit
   and shed light on the questions of when and why people may be
   undermining their goal striving by avoiding relevant, motivating social
   information.

AB Matchmaking is a complex process that requires considerable expertise.
   Matchmakers in various industries often advertise proprietary
   technologies that presumably help users find an ideal match in a short
   time. However, matchmakers may have incentives to provide suboptimal
   matchmaking services so that users remain clients longer and pay more
   fees. This article considers a matchmaking market with network effects
   and strategic consumers and analyzes under what conditions matchmakers
   would offer more effective versus less effective matchmaking services.
   The authors find that stronger pricing power paradoxically leads to
   lower technology provision when consumers have high valuation for the
   matchmaking service. Moreover, network effects typically encourage
   matchmakers to retain the users in the market to create positive
   externalities, which can result in less precise matchmaking. In
   addition, consumer patience prompts competing matchmakers to implement
   ineffective technology. In two extensions, the authors explore
   asymmetric two-sided markets and discuss the impacts of alternative
   pricing schemes on technology provision.

AB Movies vary widely in appeal, star power, cost, and other elements, and
   therefore, each might be expected to charge a different price.
   Multiplexes, however, typically charge the same price for all movies,
   except for such premium formats as 3D, a choice that has puzzled
   managers and researchers. Because of data limitations, minimal empirical
   work has directly addressed this issue. In Hong Kong, however, prices
   vary both within and across multiplexes. Using daily ticket prices and
   attendance by theater and movie, the authors empirically examine the
   potential gains from differentiated movie-specific pricing as well as
   the increasingly common two-tier (2D/3D) uniform pricing, as compared
   with a full uniform pricing strategy in which a theater charges the same
   price for all its movies. Their results show that differential pricing
   leads to higher profits than the two-tier uniform pricing practice, but
   that the improvement is limited. In contrast, the gains are substantial
   when compared with the full uniform pricing strategy, suggesting that
   only minimal differentiation (2D/3D) may obtain most of the gains
   available from fully differentiated prices.

AB This research examines how incidental exposure to death-related
   information in the media affects consumers' value orientation and scope
   sensitivity to marketing stimuli. Five studies demonstrate that, in
   contrast to thoughts about one's own mortality, exposure to
   death-related information in the media can shift consumers' focus from
   extrinsic to intrinsic values. This leads them to pay less attention to
   the marketing stimuli, which are generally associated with extrinsic
   values, and consequently results in lower sensitivity to the magnitude
   of products and services. These effects are reversed when the marketing
   stimuli are associated with intrinsic values. Moreover, we found that
   exposure to death-related media information will generate effects
   similar to those of mortality salience when the information is perceived
   to be self-relevant and thus could induce death anxiety. The authors
   discuss implications and possible extensions.

AB Satiation is an ongoing marketing challenge as it continually reduces a
   consumer's ability to enjoy a favored experience. The prevailing notion
   is that satiation increases with similarity; hence, consumers can best
   slow satiation by consuming stimuli that are as different as possible.
   We challenge this traditional (and intuitive) view and instead propose
   that stimuli can be so inherently different that consumers no longer
   spontaneously consider them together as part of the same experience. In
   such cases, promoting the similarity of the stimuli can
   counterintuitively slow satiation. We propose that this reversal happens
   because finding similarities leads the consumer to place these episodes
   into a single ad hoc category for the ongoing experience, thereby
   helping the consumer fully realize the overall variety inherent across
   all stimuli. Five studies establish this finding across multiple domains
   (music, art, and food) and provide process evidence that an ad hoc
   categorization for the overall experience underlies our effect. Our
   theory and findings provide insight into how and when similarity can
   help or hinder satiation, and they clarify the role of ad hoc
   categorization in this relationship.

AB Consumers incorrectly rely on their sense of understanding of what a
   company does to evaluate investment risk. In three correlational
   studies, greater sense of understanding was associated with lower risk
   ratings (Study 1) and with prediction distributions of future stock
   performance that had lower standard deviations and higher means (Studies
   2 and 3). In all studies, sense of understanding was unassociated with
   objective risk measures. Risk perceptions increased when the authors
   degraded sense of understanding by presenting company information in an
   unstructured versus structured format (Study 4). Sense of understanding
   also influenced downstream investment decisions. In a portfolio
   construction task, both novices and seasoned investors allocated more
   money to hard-to-understand companies for a risk-tolerant client
   relative to a risk-averse one (Study 5). Study 3 ruled out an
   alternative explanation based on familiarity. The results may explain
   both the enduring popularity and common misinterpretation of the "invest

AB Gift giving generates high revenues for retailers. It is also marked
   with significant welfare, or deadweight, loss in that givers tend to pay
   more than the receivers' valuation. Previous research has attributed
   this discrepancy to givers' inaccurate predictions of the receivers'
   preferences. This research demonstrates that reduced price sensitivity
   is another important source of the deadweight loss: givers use gift
   prices to signal the importance of their relationship with the receiver.
   In order to demonstrate this mechanism, the authors develop a new
   Bayesian gift-choice model that captures both preference predictions as
   well as the signaling value of price. The model is estimated on two
   choice-based conjoint studies for gift giving that allow for the
   manipulation of the giver's uncertainty about the receiver's
   preferences. Both studies show the strong signaling value of price,
   especially when givers are uncertain about receivers' preferences.
   Decomposition of the deadweight loss shows that the signaling value of
   price is an important source of welfare loss, especially in markets with
   heterogeneous prices. These findings have key implications for the gift
   industry.

AB In responding to customer questions or complaints, shouldmarketing
   agents linguistically "put the customer first" by using certain personal
   pronouns? Customer orientation theory, managerial literature, and
   surveys of managers, customer service representatives, and consumers
   suggest that firm agents should emphasize how "we" (the firm) serve
   "you" (the customer), while de-emphasizing "I" (the agent) in these
   customer-firm interactions. The authors find evidence of this language
   pattern in use at over 40 firms. However, they theorize and demonstrate
   that these personal pronoun emphases are often suboptimal. Five studies
   using lab experiments and field data reveal that firm agents who refer
   to themselves using "I" rather than "we" pronouns increase customers'
   perceptions that the agent feels and acts on their behalf. In turn,
   these positive perceptions of empathy and agency lead to increased
   customer satisfaction, purchase intentions, and purchase behavior.
   Furthermore, the authors find that customer-referencing "you" pronouns
   have little impact on these outcomes and can sometimes have negative
   consequences. These findings enhance understanding of how, when, and why
   language use affects social perception and behavior and provide valuable
   insights for marketers.

   decisions. The authors test this hypothesis in a variety of consumption
   domains and decision tasks, including real-life, consequential
   charitable donations. Consistent support from five experiments with more
   than 1,770 participants shows that (1) valuations of the decision
   outcome increase when consumers with high (low) self-focus adopt a
   feeling-based (reason-based) strategy. The hypothesized effect of
   self-focus on relative reliance on feelings in decision making is (2)
   moderated by self-construal. Furthermore, greater attention to the self

AB Showrooming, the phenomenon of consumers visiting a brick-and-mortar
   (B&M) store to learn about products but then buying online to obtain
   lower prices, is attracting increased attention both in business
   practice and in academic literature. It is considered a major threat to
   the B&M retailers, and determining "how to fight it" seems to be the
   only consideration. However, the manufacturer's need for retail
   informational services has always been one of the essential reasons for
   retailers to exist and is a means for retailers to achieve
   profitability. The popular arguments about the threat of showrooming
   ignore the strategic role of the manufacturer in the distribution
   channel. This article analytically shows that when the manufacturer's
   decisions are considered (i.e., when the manufacturer-retailer contract
   is endogenous), consumers' ability to engage in showrooming may lead to
   increased, rather than decreased, profitability for B&M retailer(s).
   Thus, retail efforts to restrict showrooming behavior may be misguided.
   This result holds even if the manufacturer is restricted to
   wholesale-only contracts and is not allowed to price discriminate
   between channels.

AB In today's digital market, the number of websites available for
   advertising has ballooned into the millions. Consequently, firms often
   turn to ad agencies and demand-side platforms (DSPs) to decide how to
   allocate their Internet display advertising budgets. Nevertheless, most
   extant DSP algorithms are rule-based and strictly proprietary. This
   article is among the first efforts in marketing to develop a
   nonproprietary algorithm for optimal budget allocation of Internet
   display ads within the context of programmatic advertising. Unlike many
   DSP algorithms that treat each ad impression independently, this method
   explicitly accounts for viewership correlations across websites.
   Consequently, campaign managers can make optimal bidding decisions over
   the entire set of advertising opportunities. More Importantly, they can
   avoid overbidding for impressions from high-cost publishers, unless such
   sites reach an otherwise unreachable audience. The proposed method can
   also be used as a budget-setting tool, because it readily provides
   optimal bidding guidelines for a range of campaign budgets. Finally,
   thismethod can accommodate several practical considerations including
   consumer targeting, target frequency of ad exposure, and mandatory media
   coverage to matched content websites.

   firms in the area), and temporal agglomeration (overlap in moment of
   consumption). The authors develop hypotheses pertaining to the main
   effects of the three agglomeration types on eWOM volume, which take the
   form of an inverted U-shape, and the moderating effect of vertical
   quality differentiation. The authors test the hypotheses on the volume
   of eWOM generated per month on Yelp for restaurants in Phoenix,
   generated by 23,526 users for 2,885 restaurants over an eight-year

AB Seven studies covering diverse contexts show an underappreciated benefit
   of teasing in information acquisition: first creating and then resolving
   an uncertainty can generate a net positive experience, yet laypeople do
   not seek out this process. For example, trivia readers report better
   hedonic experiences if they are first teased with some missing
   information and then given that information than if they receive all the
   information at the same time; however, when given a choice, readers
   prefer to receive all information at the same time. The authors further
   show that teasing is hedonically beneficial because uncertainty
   engenders curiosity and thereby builds a potential for a positive
   experience, whereas uncertainty resolution satisfies the curiosity and
   thereby realizes that potential. This research yields practical
   implications by demonstrating that imbuing an ad with an uncertainty
   creation-resolution process improves the viewer's attitude toward and
   increases the viewer's willingness to try the advertised product.

AB Improving content sharing on social media platforms helps firms enhance
   the efficacy of their marketing campaigns. The authors study the impact
   of network overlap-the overlap in network connections between two
   users-on content sharing in directed social media platforms. The authors
   propose a hazards model that flexibly captures the impact of three
   measures of network overlap (i.e., common followees, common followers,
   and common mutual followers) on content sharing. Using data on content
   sharing from two directed social media platforms (Twitter and Digg), the
   authors establish that a receiver is more likely to share content from a
   sender with whom they share more common followees, common followers, or
   common mutual followers even after accounting for other measures. In
   addition, common followers have a higher effect than common mutual
   followers on the sharing propensity of the receiver. Finally, the effect
   of common followers and common mutual followers is positive when the
   content is novel but decreases, and may even become negative, when many
   others have already shared it. Collectively, these results have a
   bearing for marketers to more effectively target users for spreading

AB There is growing interest in "customer-based corporate valuation"-that
   is, explicitly tying the value of a firm's customer base to its overall
   financial valuation using publicly disclosed data. While much progress
   has been made in building a well-validated customer-based valuation
   model for contractual (or subscription-based) firms, there has been
   little progress for noncontractual firms. Noncontractual businesses have
   more complex transactional patterns because customer churn is not
   observed, and customer purchase timing and spend amounts are more
   irregular. Furthermore, publicly disclosed data are aggregated over time
   and across customers, are often censored, and may vary from firm to
   firm, making it harder to estimate models for customer acquisition,
   ordering, and spend per order. The authors develop a general
   customer-based valuation methodology for noncontractual firms that
   accounts for these issues. They apply this methodology to publicly
   disclosed data from e-commerce retailers Overstock.com and Wayfair,
   provide valuation point estimates and valuation intervals for the firms,
   and compare the unit economics of newly acquired customers.

AB This article investigates the value of business format franchising and
   how it is changing in response to a large increase in consumer
   information provided by online reputation mechanisms. Theory has
   suggested that much of the value of chain affiliation to firms comes
   from the ability of chain partners to use the same name, imagery, logo,
   and marketing to create a common brand reputation and signal specific
   qualities in settings with asymmetric information between buyers and
   sellers. As more information becomes available, consumers should rely
   less on branding for quality signals, and firms' ability to extend
   reputations across heterogeneous outlets should decrease. To examine
   this empirically, the author combines a large panel of hotel revenues
   with millions of online reviews from multiple platforms.
   Chain-affiliated hotels earn substantially higher revenues than
   equivalent independent hotels, but this premium has declined by over 50%
   from 2000 to 2015. This can be largely attributed to an increase in
   online reputation mechanisms, and this effect is largest for low-quality
   and small-market firms. Measures of the information content of online
   reviews show that as information has increased, independent hotel
   revenue has grown substantially more than chain hotel revenue. This
   result should be viewed as descriptive, with attempts to come to near
   causality including the use of machine learning to derive latent
   dimensions of firm quality from the text of online reviews. Finally, the
   correlation between firm revenue and chain-wide reputation is
   decreasing, whereas the correlation with individual hotel reputation is
   increasing.

   percentage price changes (discounts or surcharges). If they consider two
   discounts-for example, take 18% off the list price, then take an
   additional 12% off-consumers weight the two percentages to make their
   evaluations. Cues endogenous to the communication of those percentages
   also influence the weights applied, according to whether the two
   percentages appear presented at the same time (simultaneously) or
   temporally separated (sequentially) and whether the first percentage is
   larger or smaller. Depending on both the presentation mode and the
   ordering, consumers use different processes. In addition to providing
   practical guidance, this article extends understanding of anchoring and
   adjustment processes; information presented simultaneously leads
   consumers to anchor on the first piece of information. Sequential
   presentation instead induces surprise and shifts attention to the latter
   percentage change, which serves as the anchor in subsequent judgments.
   In addition to the underlying theory for these effects, this article
   delineates some boundary conditions and reveals the effects on
   consumers' evaluations and choices, with findings from 11 studies.

AB Media attribution is the assignment of a percentage weight to each media
   touchpoint a consumer is exposed to prior to purchasing. Many firms
   consider using attribution to allocate media budgets, particularly for
   digital media, but an important question is whether this is appropriate.
   An initial hurdle when answering this question is that, despite the
   surge in interest for media attribution in marketing academia and
   practice, attribution does not have an agreed-on formal definition.
   Therefore, this article proposes an attribution formulation based on the
   relative incremental contribution that each medium makes to a purchase,
   taking into account advertising carryover and interaction effects. The
   formulation shows that attribution is proportional to the marginal
   effectiveness of a medium times its number of exposures. This means that
   often-used media will have high attribution weights. However, the
   profit-maximizing allocation for a fixed budget is a function of
   advertising effectiveness, but not a function of past exposure levels.
   By offering analytical derivations and studying simulated and empirical
   data, the paper shows how attribution can offer misleading insights on
   how to allocate resources across media. Moreover, the empirical example
   demonstrates that substantial gains in purchase probability can be made
   using profit-maximizing allocation compared with attribution-based
   allocation.

AB Evidence of the impact of partitioned pricing is contradictory. Research
   indicates that partitioning a price into multiple components can result
   in more favorable preferences, due to a lower recalled price, or less
   favorable preferences, due to unfavorable surcharge evaluations. To
   explain these divergent effects, the authors examine the role of price
   presentation moderators, which reflect how managers convey prices to
   consumers (e.g., Is the total price present or absent?), magnitude
   moderators, which reflect the actual prices charged (e.g., What is the
   surcharge magnitude?), and contextual moderators, which reflect nonprice
   transaction characteristics (e.g., Is the product category hedonic or
   utilitarian?). A meta-analysis of 17 years of partitioned pricing
   research examining 149 observations in 27 papers (N = 12,878) suggests
   that consumers respond more favorably to partitioned pricing than to
   all-inclusive pricing when the total price is absent, as the price level
   increases, when the surcharges are typical for the product category,
   when the surcharges are perceived as offering high benefit, and when the
   product category is utilitarian.

AB Companies spend billions of dollars annually on sales force training,
   often carried out as off-site, multiday training events. However, the
   numerous challenges involved in training an entire sales group force
   many retailers to selectively train only a subset of their salespeople.
   It is crucial to know when selective training can be more effective and
   what composition of salespeople should be trained to benefit the entire
   group. This study addresses these questions using data from several
   stores of a retailer with different sales force training policies (full,
   selective, and no training [control]). The authors track the degree to
   which salespeople applied a customer relationship-building strategy
   taught in the training, along with more than 30 store-and
   salesperson-level covariates, and perform various analyses to correct
   for selection issues. They find that (1) selective training can be
   highly effective in stores with low performance diversity, (2) training
   salespeople with diverse tenures helps the spillover of training to the
   untrained, and (3) untrained salespeople with performance that is
   similar to the trained group are more likely to adopt the
   training-related behavior.

AB This article explores how intercompetitor licensing between an incumbent
   and an entrant affects market competition and the entrant's optimal
   product quality. In the model, the incumbent has a noncore technology
   that is used for the noncore attribute of the final product, and the
   entrant has a new core technology to introduce a new, higher-quality
   product. For the noncore technology of its product, the entrant can
   either license it from the incumbent or develop it in-house. The authors
   show that a royalty licensing contract of the noncore technology between
   the incumbent and the entrant has a competition-alleviating effect. More
   important, the effect of such licensing on the entrant's optimal quality
   depends on whether its core technology can significantly or only
   incrementally increase its product quality over the incumbent's product
   quality. The royalty contract will tend to increase the entrant's
   optimal quality when the entrant's core technology can offer a
   significant quality improvement over the incumbent's. By contrast, if
   the entrant's technology can raise its product quality only
   incrementally over the incumbent's product quality, the royalty contract
   will tend to reduce the entrant's optimal quality. A wide range of
   royalty licensing contracts are mutually acceptable; the incumbent
   (entrant) can benefit from such a contract even when the entrant pays a
   total royalty fee that is lower (higher) than its alternative
   research-and-development cost. These results hold even when the
   incumbent endogenously chooses its royalty licensing fee. The main
   results are robust to several alternative modeling assumptions (e.g.,
   alternative game sequence, endogenous quality decision by the incumbent,
   alternative licensing contract).

AB Research has shown that possessions have the power to change consumers'
   self-construal and activate different aspects of the self. Building on
   this literature, the authors suggest that the salience of product
   ownership not only activates the product-related self but also
   simultaneously deactivates product-unrelated selves, resulting in
   impaired performance on tasks unrelated to the activated self. In five
   experiments, we first elicit feelings of ownership over a product (e.g.,
   a calculator) to activate a product-related identity (e.g., the math
   self). Participants then engage in a task that is labeled as being a
   product-related task (e.g., a math task) or a product-unrelated task
   (e.g., a visual task). Although the task is the same, participants in
   the ownership condition perform worse on a task labeled as
   product-unrelated than those in the baseline condition do. Support for
   the underlying identity activation process comes from the finding that
   performance impairment is more likely to hold under conditions of low
   self-concept clarity, in which identity is malleable. The authors
   discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this finding.

AB Automated fabrication, home services, and premade goods pervade the
   modern consumer landscape. Against this backdrop, this research explores
   how the emotion of awe might motivate a consumer to partake instead in
   experiential creation (i.e., activities in which they actively produce
   an outcome) by enhancing their willingness to learn. Across eight
   experiments, experiencing awe (vs. happiness, excitement, pride,
   amusement, or neutrality) increases people's likelihood of choosing an
   experiential creation gift (vs. one not involving experiential
   creation), willingness to pay for experiential creation products (vs.
   comparable ready-made products), likelihood of creating a bespoke snack
   (vs. taking a premade one), preference for experiential creation
   solutions (vs. solutions without experiential creation), likelihood of
   purchasing a product when it is framed as high (vs. low) in experiential
   creation, preference for high (vs. low) experiential creation meals, and
   likelihood of creating a knickknack (vs. taking a premade one). This
   greater desire for experiential creation is mediated by openness to
   learning and moderated by the need for closure. These findings, relevant
   for firms encouraging creation-oriented products and behaviors, offer
   fresh insights for engaging consumers.

AB In incentive-aligned choice experiments, each decision is realized with
   some probability, Prob. In three eye-tracking experiments, we study the
   impact of varying Prob from 0 (as in purely hypothetical choices) to 1
   (as in real-life choices) on attention, information processing, and
   choice. Consistent with the bounded rationality literature, we find that
   as Prob increases from 0 to 1, consumers process the choice-relevant
   information more carefully and more comprehensively. Consistent with the
   psychological distance literature, we find that as Prob increases from 0
   to 1, consumers become less novelty seeking and more price sensitive.
   These findings underscore that even with incentive alignment, preference
   measurement choice experiments such as choice-based conjoint analyses
   only represent an approximation of real-life choices. Although it is not
   feasible to systematically use questions with high Prob in the field, we
   predict and find that placing a higher probability question (such as an
   external validity task) at the beginning rather than the end of a
   questionnaire has a carryover effect on attention and information
   processing throughout the questionnaire, and it influences preference
   estimates as well.

AB Before their launch, many new products generate word of mouth (WOM) on
   social media. Such WOM typically increases toward the release date and
   contains sudden spikes. These spikes capture manifestations of peak
   consumer attention and are therefore of managerial importance, yet they
   have not received research attention. This article is the first to
   provide a comprehensive descriptive treatment of WOM spikes. The authors
   propose a conceptual framework to present spikes as a standalone WOM
   dimension and explain their emergence. They employ a robust filtering
   procedure to detect spikes and apply it in a data set of 90,000
   prerelease online WOM messages on 157 Hollywood movies. The results
   indicate that prerelease spikes are widely prevalent: While some of them
   are event-driven, emerging in response to firm-created communications
   (e.g., trailer release), they are far more likely to emerge
   spontaneously. Content analysis reveals that WOM in spikes is more
   positive in sentiment and is more likely to deal with factual details
   than is WOM outside spikes. Prerelease WOM spikes also contribute
   significantly to the predictability of future product sales.

   correlational and experimental designs, these studies demonstrate that
   people who strongly identify with a particular social category resist
   automated features that hinder the attribution of identity-relevant
   consumption outcomes to themselves. The findings have substantial

AB Retailers routinely allow consumers to negotiate a discount off the
   posted price for big-ticket items such as home appliances and
   automobiles, and on online platforms such as Amazon and eBay. The
   profitability of such a strategy, relative to selling only at posted
   prices, depends on consumers' willingness to initiate a negotiation and
   ability to negotiate a discount. In this article, the authors
   incorporate consumers' decision of whether to negotiate into a demand
   model. The decision to negotiate hinges on how the expected discount
   from negotiation compares with the magnitude of a nonpecuniary cost that
   the consumer incurs by initiating the negotiation. The current study
   shows how this cost can be nonparametrically identified, separately from
   consumers' ability to get a discount and marginal utility of income. The
   application of this model to individual-level data on refrigerator
   transactions reveals that, conditional on negotiating, consumers get, on
   average, 41% of the available surplus and incur an average cost of $28
   to initiate a negotiation. The magnitude of these nonpecuniary costs'
   not only affects retailer profits but also has implications for pricing
   strategy and consumer surplus. Ignoring these costs results in biased
   estimates of consumers' willingness to pay, translating to annual losses
   of $1.6 million in the current study setting.

AB The authors examine purchase behavior in the context of cashback
   shopping-a novel form of price promotion online in which consumers
   initiate transactions at the website of a cashback company and, after a
   significant delay, receive the savings promised to them. Specifically,
   they analyze panel data from a large cashback company and show that,
   independent of the predictable effect of cashback offers on initial
   demand, cashback payments (1) increase the probability that consumers
   will make an additional purchase via the website of the cashback company
   and (2) increase the size of that purchase. These effects pass several
   robustness checks and are also meaningful: At average values in the
   data, an additional $1.00 in cashback payment increases the likelihood
   of a future transaction by .02% and spending by $.32-figures that
   represent 10.03% of the overall impact of a given promotion. Moreover,
   the authors find that consumers are more likely to spend the money
   returned to them at generalist retailers, such as department stores,
   than at other retailers. They consider three explanations for these
   findings; the leading hypothesis is that consumers fail to treat money
   as a fungible resource. They also discuss implications for cashback

   scales in surveys in which misresponse to items that are reversed
   relative to other items (reversal misresponse) is differentiated from
   misresponse to items that are negated (negation misresponse) and from
   misresponse to items whose core concept is the opposite of the core
   concept in regular items (polar opposite misresponse). The framework
   specifies two broad mechanisms to account for the three forms of
   misresponse: lack of motivation to process items in detail
   ("inattention") and lack of ability to comprehend items accurately
   ("difficulty"). The authors propose a procedure to identify potential
   misresponse effects on the observed item responses and factor loadings,
   and they report two empirical studies to test the framework; the second
   study uses eye movement recordings to examine the underlying process.
   The findings reveal that polar opposite, reversed, and negated items
   contribute to misresponse to varying degrees and that difficulty rather
   than inattention may be a more potent cause of misresponse in surveys
   than has traditionally been acknowledged.

AB Nonprofit health care organizations in low- and middle-income countries
   often pursue a cross-subsidization business model wherein services are
   offered to poor patients for free through surpluses generated by serving
   some patients at market prices. This approach allows such organizations
   to fulfill their mission-oriented and revenue-generation goals.
   Conventional wisdom holds that mission activities need financial
   subsidies from revenue-generating activities. The authors examine this
   dependence in the context of Aravind Eye Hospitals, which delivers eye
   care services in India. They measure whether the marketing activities
   (outreach camps) of Aravind that are targeted only to poor patients
   produce the spillover benefit of attracting paying patients to its
   hospitals. Using nine years of patient-level historical data, the
   authors find that camps increase the flow of paying patients. These
   effects are comparable to the camps acting as advertising for Aravind.
   Using model estimates, the authors compute the incremental revenue
   accruing to Aravind from a camp and find that it exceeds the incremental
   cost of a camp. The findings challenge conventional beliefs about the
   subsidies required by mission activities.

AB The authors examine how consumers respond to pseudo-free offers-offers
   that are presented to consumers as free but that require consumers to
   make a nonmonetary payment (such as completing a survey or providing
   personal information) in order to receive the "free" good or service.
   Across six studies, the authors find that consumers are generally just
   as likely to accept pseudo-free offers (with nonmonetary costs) as
   comparable truly free offers (with no costs), as long as the costs of
   the pseudo-free offers are below some threshold. Additionally, they find
   that consumers are significantly more likely to accept pseudo-free
   offers (with nonmonetary costs) than comparable nonfree offers (with
   monetary costs). The authors provide evidence that consumers respond to
   pseudo-free offers in this way because, in general, consumers generate
   neutral or positive attributions for why firms make these offers, and
   these attributions, in turn, lead consumers to perceive the pseudo-free

AB The authors examine how perceived similarity between sequential risks
   affects individuals' risk-taking intentions. Specifically, in six
   studies, the authors find that, in sequential choice settings,
   individuals exhibit significant positive state dependence in risk-taking
   preferences, such that they are more likely to take a risk when it is
   similar to a previously taken risk than when it is dissimilar. For
   example, if an individual has previously taken a health/safety risk,
   that individual is more likely to take a second health/safety risk than
   a second risk that is in the financial domain. The authors show that
   because similarity between risks is malleable and can be determined by
   situational and contextual variables, subsequent risk-taking intentions
   can be changed in a predictable manner when similarity is manipulated
   through framing. The authors establish that increased feelings of
   self-efficacy and self-signaling through the prior risk-taking
   experience drive state-dependent risk-taking preferences. The authors
   further show that the effect of similarity on preferences is not
   moderated by the outcome received in the prior risk and holds when
   controlling for individual-level and domain-specific heterogeneity.
   Taken together, the results demonstrate that the similarity structures
   that exist between risks have a significant effect on risk-taking
   preferences in dynamic choice settings.

AB Prior research has identified product improvement perceptions as
   critical to consumers' product upgrade decisions (e.g., upgrading to a
   new iPhone), but little work has examined factors influencing these
   improvement perceptions. This research shows that drawing consumers'
   attention to their global self-improvement can increase product
   improvement judgments and upgrade intentions when self-brand connection
   is high, a phenomenon the authors refer to as egocentric improvement
   evaluation. In line with egocentric categorization theory, which
   identifies the self as a dominant reference category in product
   judgment, the authors demonstrate cognitive drivers of the effect.
   Specifically, egocentric improvement evaluations are moderated by
   self-focus, which determines whether the self is an accessible reference
   category. Furthermore, the authors propose that egocentric improvement
   evaluations also have a motivational driver: consumers project their
   self-improvement onto self-connected brands to satisfy self-enhancement
   motives. The core effect is moderated by self-affirmation, which quells
   the need for self-enhancement, and by self-threat, which heightens the
   need for self-enhancement. The authors investigate this effect in five
   studies and discuss the theoretical and practical implications.

AB Intertemporal savings strategies, such as bulk buying or accelerating
   purchase timing to take advantage of a good deal, provide long-term
   savings in exchange for an increase in immediate spending. Although
   households with limited financial resources stand to benefit the most
   from these strategies, they are less likely to make use of them. The
   authors provide causal evidence that liquidity constraints impede
   low-income households' ability to use these strategies, above and beyond
   the impact of other constraints. Exploiting recurring variation in
   household liquidity, this study shows that when low-income households
   have more liquidity, they partially catch up to higher-income
   households' ability to use intertemporal savings strategies. The
   findings provide guidance to marketing managers and researchers
   regarding targeted promotional design and measurement of deal-proneness.
   For policy makers, they suggest a new path for decreasing the higher
   prices low-income households have been documented to pay for everyday
   goods. Policies have traditionally focused on increasing financial
   literacy or access to supermarkets. Our work suggests that providing
   greater liquidity can help low-income households make better use of
   savings opportunities already available to them.

AB The authors propose a quantitative approach for describing entertainment
   products, in a way that allows for improving the predictive performance
   of consumer choice models for these products. Their approach is based on
   the media psychology literature, which suggests that people's
   consumption of entertainment products is influenced by the psychological
   themes featured in these products. They classify psychological themes on
   the basis of the character strengths taxonomy from the positive
   psychology literature (Peterson and Seligman 2004). They develop a
   natural language processing tool, guided latent Dirichlet allocation
   (LDA), that automatically extracts a set of features of entertainment
   products from their descriptions. Guided LDA is flexible enough to allow
   features to be informed by psychological themes while allowing other
   relevant dimensions to emerge. The authors apply this tool to movies and
   show that guided LDA features help better predict movie-watching
   behavior at the individual level. They find this result with both
   award-winning movies and blockbuster movies. They illustrate the
   potential of the proposed approach in pure content-based predictive
   models of consumer behavior, as well as in hybrid predictive models that
   combine content-based models with collaborative filtering. They also
   show that guided LDA can improve the performance of models that predict
   aggregate outcomes.

AB The authors aim to answer the following question: If the capital market
   reacts with abnormal stock returns to new product development success
   events, do these returns influence subsequent marketing decisions?
   Drawing on informational market feedback and managerial learning
   theories, the authors posit that when firms are uncertain about how
   responsive the product market will be to their marketing activities,
   signals received from the capital market help them update their beliefs
   about the product market's responsiveness. In the pharmaceutical
   context, the authors decompose the abnormal returns at a new drug
   approval event into components that the firm can and cannot predict
   (i.e., predicted and unpredicted abnormal returns) and find that the
   postapproval advertising budget is larger when unpredicted abnormal
   approval returns are higher. Furthermore, this tendency is more
   pronounced for spending on detailing than for direct-to-consumer
   advertising. Consistent with these higher budgets, the authors find that
   postlaunch advertising is more effective when unpredicted abnormal
   approval returns are higher, particularly for detailing spending (vs.
   direct-to-consumer advertising). Overall, this study suggests that
   information flows from the capital market's initial perceptions at new
   product introduction play an important role in subsequent marketing
   decisions in the product market.

AB The global importance of online advertising calls for a detailed
   understanding of consumer-specific responses to online ad repetitions. A
   key concern for advertisers is not only whether some consumers display
   degrees of wearout but also whether they can surpass a point at which
   additional exposures have a negative marginal effect: weariness. The
   authors examine a large-scale advertising campaign aimed at driving
   viewers to a target website, which comprises more than 12,000 users
   across over 400 websites. These data are analyzed using a flexible
   discrete mixture specification that accommodates different response
   shapes over ad stock and timing and parcels ad viewers into response
   classes based on their internet usage metrics. The resulting classes
   display varying degrees of wearout, with one subgroup, accounting for
   about 24% of the sample, evincing weariness. The model also estimates
   differential publisher effectiveness, with the most effective publisher
   being nine times more effective than the one 26 places down. The authors
   demonstrate that the finding of weariness is robust to all the model's
   main components, with one key exception: heterogeneity in users' ad
   response. Analysis further suggests that an appropriate profiling and
   capping strategy can improve ad deployment by as much as 15% overall for
   these data.

   recognizing that mobile apps generate various touchpoints in the
   customer journey, the authors also investigate how an app's design
   shifts the effects of mobile apps on firm value. In particular, they
   investigate effects from whether an app emphasizes features related to
   peer-to-peer interactions about the brand, personal-oriented
   interactions between a customer and the brand, or the purchase phase
   itself. They find that the launch of a mobile app increases firm value
   and that the features emphasized in app design play an important role in
   such value creation. The study offers important implications regarding
   the accountability of branded mobile apps and provides direction for

   boost consumers' evaluations and the market's financial valuations of

AB Despite the ubiquity of numerical information in consumers' lives, prior
   research has provided limited insights to marketers about when numerical
   information exerts greater impact on decisions. This study offers
   evidence that judgments involving numerical information can be affected
   by consumers' sense of personal control over the environment. A
   numerical attribute's format communicates the extent to which the
   magnitude of a benefit is predictable (Study 1a), such that people who
   experience a control threat and want to see their external environment
   as predictable (Study 1b) rely on point value (vs. range) information as
   a general signal that the environment is predictable (Study 2). A
   personal control threat changes consumers' preferences as a function of
   whether the numerical information appears as a point value or a range
   (Studies 3-4). This heightened focus on format may lessen the impact of
   a product benefit's predicted magnitude, if a lower magnitude is
   specified in a more precise format (Study 5). Study 6 provides first
   evidence that the interactive effect of personal control levels and
   numerical formats can affect consequential choices.

AB Researchers have found that consumers abandon and avoid products when
   they feel threatened by the presence of dissimilar groups who also use
   the product. In this article, the authors propose a different strategy
   for responding to dissimilar users, upgrading to a brand's more
   exclusive products. Results from six studies show that upgrading is a
   preferred strategy for consumers with strong self-brand connections, who
   are unlikely to avoid or abandon the brand because their self-identity
   is tied to the brand. Among these consumers, the act of upgrading to a
   brand's more exclusive products is driven by their feelings of
   self-threat when exposed to dissimilar users, which triggers a desire to
   attain a higher-status position among brand users that is fulfilled by
   upgrading. The authors also identify moderators of the upgrading effect
   for consumers with strong self-brand connections. These consumers'
   increased interest in upgrading is dampened when a brand's exclusive
   products are made more readily available and when a brand has already
   conferred higher status to them through a customer status tier program.

AB Brand naming challenges are more complex in logographic languages (e.g.,
   Chinese), compared with phonographic languages (e.g., English) because
   the former languages feature looser correspondence between sound and
   meaning. With these two dimensions of sound and meaning, the authors
   propose a four-way categorization of brand name types for logographic
   languages: alphanumeric, phonetic, phonosemantic, or semantic. Using
   automobile sales data from China and a discrete choice model for
   differentiated products, the authors relate brand name types to demand,
   with evidence showing that Chinese consumers preferred vehicle models
   with semantic brand names (7.64% more sales than alphanumeric) but
   exhibited the least preference for phonosemantic names (4.92% lower
   sales than alphanumeric). Domestic Chinese firms benefited from semantic
   brand names, whereas foreign firms gained from using foreign-sounding
   brand names. Entry-level products performed better with semantic brand
   names, and high-end products excelled when they had foreign-sounding
   brand names. Thus, the four-way categorization of brand name types
   should help multinational firms and domestic Chinese firms understand

AB Managers are using ambient scent as an important strategic element in
   various service settings, with food-related scents being especially
   common. This research examines the effects of food-related ambient
   scents on children's and adults' food purchases/choices. The results of
   a series of experiments, including field studies at a supermarket and at
   a middle school cafeteria, show that extended exposure (of more than two
   minutes) to an indulgent food-related ambient scent (e.g., cookie scent)
   leads to lower purchases of unhealthy foods compared with no ambient
   scent or a nonindulgent food-related ambient scent (e.g., strawberry
   scent). The effects seem to be driven by cross-modal sensory
   compensation, whereby prolonged exposure to an indulgent/rewarding food
   scent induces pleasure in the reward circuitry, which in turn diminishes
   the desire for actual consumption of indulgent foods. Notably, the
   effects reverse with brief (<30 seconds) exposure to the scent. Whereas
   prior research has examined cross-modal effects, this research adopts
   the novel approach of examining cross-modal sensory compensation
   effects, whereby stimuli in one sensory modality (olfactory) can

AB Sleepiness, the subjective feeling of the propensity to fall asleep, is
   a common, everyday experience that can be induced by various factors,
   such as sleep quality, sleep deprivation, ingestion of certain
   substances, or belief about how much sleep a person needs. Despite its
   prevalence, sleepiness and its influence on consumption behavior have
   rarely been linked in the research to date. The present research helps
   fill this void by uncovering the novel impact of sleepiness on consumer
   variety seeking behavior. The studies, using various methods and all
   involving consequential choices, revealed that sleepier consumers tended
   to seek more variety. The driver of this effect was found to be a need
   for arousal to maintain wakefulness. The authors also show that
   variety-seeking behavior is effective in partially reducing sleepiness.
   The effect of sleepiness on variety seeking uncovered in this research
   is somewhat nonintuitive, in the sense that, a priori, one might expect
   sleepiness to be more likely to decrease rather than increase
   exploratory behavior. The authors discuss implications of the findings
   for different research areas and for marketing practice.

AB Consumers frequently express themselves by posting about products on
   social media. Because consumers can use physical products to signal
   their identities, posting about products on social media may be a way
   for consumers to virtually signal identity. The authors propose that
   there are conditions in which this action can paradoxically reduce a
   consumer's subsequent purchase intentions. Five experiments demonstrate
   that posting products on social media that are framed as being
   identity-relevant can reduce a consumer's subsequent purchase intentions
   for the same and similar products, as this action allows consumers to
   virtually signal their identity, fulfilling identity-signaling needs.
   Fortunately for retailers, the authors suggest theoretically and
   managerially relevant moderators that attenuate this negative effect on

AB Bayesian methods for dynamic models in marketing have so far been
   parametric. For instance, it is invariably assumed that model errors
   emerge from normal distributions. Yet using arbitrary distributional
   assumptions can result in false inference, which in turn misleads
   managers. The author therefore presents a set of flexible Bayesian
   nonparametric (NP) dynamic models that treat error densities as unknown
   but assume that they emerge from Dirichlet process mixtures. Although
   the methods address misspecification in dynamic linear models, the main
   innovation is a particle filter algorithm for nonlinear state-space
   models. The author used two advertising studies to confirm the benefits
   of the methods when strict error assumptions are untenable. In both
   studies, NP models markedly outperformed benchmarks in terms of fit and
   forecast results. In the first study, the benchmarks understated the
   effects of competitive advertising on own brand awareness. In the second
   study, the benchmark inflated ad quality, and consequently, the effects
   of past advertising appeared 36% higher than that predicted by the NP
   model. In general, these methods should be valuable wherever state-space
   models appear (e.g., brand and advertising dynamics, diffusion of
   innovation, dynamic discrete choice).

   settings (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c) and real settings (Study 4). In
   addition, the author demonstrates that an illusory sense of control
   mediates the effect of an elevated viewpoint on risk taking (Study 2)

AB If consumers believe that stores offering price-matching guarantees
   (PMGs) charge low prices, high-search-cost consumers will purchase from
   PMG stores. This leads PMG stores' demand to be less price sensitive,
   which drives these stores to charge higher prices. The belief that PMG
   stores charge low prices paradoxically leads them to charge high prices.
   For this reason, the literature finds that PMGs can only signal low
   prices when firm heterogeneity is sufficiently large. Because PMGs are
   offered by retailers that purchase the same product from the same
   producer, large firm heterogeneity may be a strong assumption. This
   article proposes a theory that explains how homogeneous firms may signal
   their low prices through PMGs: consumers perceive PMG stores to have
   lower prices not because they expect them to have low marginal costs or
   service quality, but simply because they offer a PMG.

AB User-generated content has become ubiquitous and very influential in the
   marketplace. Increasingly, this content is generated on smartphones
   rather than personal computers (PCs). This article argues that because
   of its physically constrained nature, smartphone (vs. PC) use leads
   consumers to generate briefer content, which encourages them to focus on
   the overall gist of their experiences. This focus on gist, in turn,
   tends to manifest as reviews that emphasize the emotional aspects of an
   experience in lieu of more specific details. Across five studies-two
   field studies and three controlled experiments-the authors use natural
   language processing tools and human assessments to analyze the
   linguistic characteristics of user-generated content. The findings
   support the thesis that smartphone use results in the creation of
   content that is less specific and privileges affect-especially positive
   affect-relative to PC-generated content. The findings also show that
   differences in emotional content are driven by the tendency to generate
   briefer content on smartphones rather than user self-selection,
   differences in topical content, or timing of writing. Implications for
   research and practice are discussed.

AB This research examines drivers of consumer word of mouth (WOM) in
   free-product settings, revealing fundamental differences with
   traditional, paid-product settings. The authors build and investigate a
   theoretical model that highlights two unique characteristics of free
   products (reciprocity motivation and diminished adoption risk) and
   considers their implications for WOM sharing. Results of a retrospective
   survey, two controlled experiments, and an analysis of more than 5,000
   mobile apps at Google Play and Apple's App Store reveal that consumers
   are generally more likely to share their opinions of free products than
   paid products, because of feelings of reciprocity toward the producer.
   However, this difference is reduced when prior consumer WOM is low in
   volume and highly disperse, signaling greater adoption risk. These
   findings contribute to nascent understanding of free-product marketing
   while offering new insights for catalyzing consumer WOM.

AB Value-appropriation activities enable a firm to extract more profits
   from existing customers. The authors examine how investments in two
   types of value-appropriation activities-advertising and receivables-are
   jointly associated with abnormal stock returns and idiosyncratic risk.
   Using data from 1,375 firms over the period of 2003-2015, the authors
   find that advertising investments and receivables investments interact
   as substitutes, such that increasing advertising (receivables)
   investments is detrimental to the beneficial effect of receivables
   (advertising) investments on firm shareholder value. They find that this
   association is contingent on firm business scope, such that the joint
   effect of advertising investments and receivables investments becomes
   weaker when firms have a broader business scope compared with a narrower
   business scope.

AB Targeted promotions based on individual purchase history can increase
   sales. However, the opportunity costs of targeting to optimize promoted
   product sales are poorly understood. A series of randomized field
   experiments with a large e-book platform shows that although targeted
   promotions increase promoted product sales and purchases of similar
   products, they can crowd out purchases of dissimilar products (i.e.,
   e-books from nontargeted genres) by decreasing search activities of
   nontargeted goods on the same platform. The effects on total sales are
   heterogeneous, ranging from net decreases to insignificant drops,
   motivating a targeting exercise comparing strategies that optimize
   promoted product sales versus total sales. Targeting for promoted
   product sales tends to assign promotions to customers who purchased
   similar products, whereas targeting for total sales assigns promotions
   on the basis of other user characteristics. Targeting for promoted
   product sales generated incremental total sales that amounted to
   approximately 29% of the optimal incremental total sales when targeting
   for total sales (an opportunity cost of 71%). The optimal targeting
   exercise highlights how maximizing promotional lift can incur
   opportunity costs in terms of other forgone sales.

AB Following subgoal success at a long-term goal, consumers can persist,
   behaving consistently with the long-term goal, or license, behaving
   consistently with competing shorter-term goals. The authors extend prior
   work by proposing that this choice is driven, in part, by chronic
   differences in consumers' cognitive and emotional responses to subgoal
   success. In Studies 1-5, they develop and validate a measure that
   captures these individual differences: the Persistence-Licensing
   Response Measure (PLRM). They demonstrate that the PLRM predicts
   persistence and licensing where existing constructs and measures do not,
   showing that consumers' responses to subgoal success represent a unique
   dimension of self-regulation. In Studies 6-10, the authors demonstrate
   that the PLRM moderates the effect of subgoal success on persistence and
   licensing behavior, revealing that the same subgoal success situation
   can lead to systematically different behaviors. The authors also examine
   how marketing interventions can be used to increase consumers'
   persistence following subgoal success. This work furthers the
   understanding of the determinants of persistence and licensing, improves
   prediction of behavior, and offers marketers tools to segment and target
   consumers, increasing persistence in key goal domains.

AB The authors propose a new truth-telling technique and statistical model
   called "item count response technique" (ICRT) to assess the prevalence
   and drivers of sensitive consumer behavior. Monte Carlo simulations and
   a large-scale application to self-reported cigarette consumption among
   pregnant women (n = 1,315) demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   procedure. The ICRT provides more valid and precise prevalence estimates
   and is more efficient than direct self-reports and previous item count
   techniques. It accomplishes this by (1) incentivizing participants to
   provide truthful answers, (2) accounting for procedural nonadherence and
   differential list functioning, and (3) obviating the need for a control
   group. The ICRT also facilitates the use of multivariate regression
   analysis to relate the prevalence of the sensitive behavior to
   individual-level covariates for theory testing and policy analysis. The
   empirical application reveals a significant downward bias in prevalence
   estimates when questions about cigarette consumption were asked directly
   to pregnant women, or when standard item count techniques were used. The
   authors find lower smoking prevalence among women with higher levels of
   education and who are further along in their pregnancy, and a much
   higher prevalence among unmarried respondents.

AB This article addresses seeding policies in user-generated content
   networks by challenging the role of influencers in a setting of unpaid

   worldwide leading music platform to study unknown music creators who aim
   to increase exposure of their content by expanding their follower base
   through directing outbound activities to other users. The authors find
   that the responsiveness of seeding targets strongly declines with status
   difference; thus, unknown music creators (the majority) do not generally
   benefit at all from seeding influencers. Instead, they should gradually
   build their status by targeting low-status users rather than attempt to
   "jump" by targeting high-status ones. This research extends the seeding
   literature by introducing the concept of risk to dissemination dynamics
   in online communications, showing that unknown music creators do not
   seed specific status levels but rather choose a portfolio of seeding
   targets while solving a risk versus return trade-off. The authors
   discuss various managerial implications for optimal seeding in

AB Several industries have recently been criticized by parents, think
   tanks, and governments for creating product environments that lead to
   excessive screen usage. If firms do not properly manage product usage,
   demand may drop, and public policy makers may intervene. The authors of
   this study test alternative ways to manage the use of such products:
   redesigning the timing of rewards, introducing notifications to users,
   and imposing time limits. A continuous-time demand model is proposed and
   empirically estimated with high-frequency data. The methodology is
   flexible enough to simultaneously explain multiple usage decisions that
   happen in quick succession, such as when to start and stop usage and how
   to respond to rewards or messages from the firm. The approach is
   implemented on a data set from the online gaming industry that includes
   usage decisions of a large sample of individuals. The authors find that
   improving reward schedules and imposing time limits leads to shorter
   usage sessions and longer product subscriptions-a win-win outcome.
   Notifications are found not to be useful to manage product usage.

   effects of retargeted advertising, a form of internet advertising in
   which banner ads are displayed to users after they visit the
   advertiser's website. They find that switching on experimental
   retargeting causes 14.6% more users to return to the website within four
   weeks. The impact of retargeting decreases as the time since the
   consumer first visited the website increases-indeed, 33% of the effect
   of the first week's advertising occurs on the first day. Furthermore,
   the authors find evidence of the existence of complementarities in
   advertising over time: the effect of advertising in week 2 of the
   campaign is higher when the user was assigned to a nonzero level of
   advertising in week 1. The authors discuss mechanisms that can explain
   their findings and demonstrate a novel low-cost method that can be

AB Marketers of digital content such as books, news, video, music, and
   mobile games often provide free samples of the content for consumers to
   try out before buying the product or signing up for subscription.
   Similarly, firms selling software (such as software as a service), and
   cloud-based services may provide free limited-version products or a
   free-trial period for the service. In this article, the authors focus on
   how firms should design such free samples to maximize their revenue.
   They examine in an analytical setting how quality and other design
   parameters of the sample affect profit generated by the product or
   service. They then test the normative implications in the application
   context of a book publisher that provides free samples for the books it
   sells online. Using a field experiment, the authors vary the design
   parameters of the sample and, based on the demand estimates, provide
   recommendations for the firm on the optimal design of the sample. They
   find that, rather than being substitutes, free samples of the entire
   content can be very effective in increasing revenues. Furthermore, they
   find that higher-quality samples have a greater impact on the sales of
   popular content. This has important implications for freemium and
   free-trial business models.

AB In emerging markets, the effective implementation of distribution
   strategies is challenged by underdeveloped road infrastructure and a low
   penetration of retail stores that are insufficient in meeting customer
   needs. In addition, products are typically distributed in multiple forms
   through multiple retail channels. Given the competitive landscape,
   manufacturers' distribution strategies should be based on anticipation
   of competitor reactions. Accordingly, the authors develop a
   manufacturer-level competition model to study the distribution and price
   decisions of insecticide manufacturers competing across multiple product
   forms and retail channels. Their study shows that both consumer
   preferences and estimated production and distribution costs vary across
   brands, product forms, and retail channels; that ignoring distribution
   and solely focusing on price competition results in up to a 55%
   overestimation of manufacturer profit margins; and that observed pricing
   and distribution patterns support competition rather than collusion
   among manufacturers. Through counterfactual studies, the authors find
   that manufacturers respond to decreases in distribution costs and to the
   exclusive distribution of more preferred manufacturers by asymmetrically
   changing their price and distribution decisions across different retail
   channels.

   authors draw on communication theory to posit that a customer's search

   seller's customer-level sales and profit return on these investments. A
   multimethod approach using a complex data set from a large industrial

AB In reward-based crowdfunding, creators of entrepreneurial projects
   solicit capital from potential consumers to reach a funding goal and
   offer future products/services in return. The authors examine consumers'
   contribution patterns using a novel data set of 28,591 projects
   collected at 30-minute resolution from Kickstarter. Extending prior
   research that assumes that economic considerations (e.g., project
   quality, campaign success likelihood) drive backers' decisions, the
   authors provide the cleanest field evidence so far that consumers also
   have prosocial motives to help creators reach their funding goals. They
   find that projects collect funding faster right before (vs. right after)
   meeting their funding goals because consumers not only are more likely
   to fund projects but also contribute greater amounts of money prior to
   goal attainment. This effect is amplified when the nature of a project
   tends to evoke consumers' prosocial motivation and when a project's
   creator is a single person. These results suggest that consumers'
   prosocial motives not only play a role in reward-based crowdfunding but
   also can outweigh the opposing effects of economic factors including
   rational herding and certainty about campaign success.

AB Consumers often fail to utilize desirable offers they had originally
   selected and planned to use and thus later regret missing out on them.
   This failure to follow through induces an opportunity cost. In contrast
   to prior research findings that opportunity costs tend to be
   underestimated, the authors propose that in situations where the need to
   choose arises from external rather than internal constraints,
   opportunity costs may actually be overestimated. Consumers view choice
   constraints as external when the necessity to trade off one option for
   another relates to extraneous resource limitations (e.g., whenever time,
   budget, or space constraints necessitate choosing between two desirable
   offers). Conversely, consumers perceive choice constraints as internal
   when that trade-off is "built-in" (e.g., when a marketing incentive
   requires choosing between two desirable offers). Five studies
   demonstrate that choosing on the basis of an external constraint induces
   consumers to imagine ways in which they can utilize all of the competing
   options in the choice set. Consequently, consumers feel that by failing
   to utilize their chosen option, they simultaneously miss out on all
   options (although in actuality they could have realized only one of
   those options). Consistent with this conceptualization, only consumers
   who want to use all of the choice set options simultaneously demonstrate
   opportunity cost overestimation.

AB The authors propose a new, exploratory approach for analyzing market
   structures that leverages two recent methodological advances in natural
   language processing and machine learning. They customize a neural
   network language model to derive latent product attributes by analyzing
   the co-occurrences of products in shopping baskets. Applying
   dimensionality reduction to the latent attributes yields a
   two-dimensional product map. This method is well-suited to retailers
   because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout
   systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product
   complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The
   approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and
   does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret
   and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate
   their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by
   comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric
   methods for modeling product relationships. The application of this
   approach using data collected at a leading German grocery retailer
   underlines its usefulness and provides novel findings that are relevant
   to assortment-related decisions.

AB This article investigates how people's political identity is associated
   with their financial risk taking. The authors argue that conservatives'
   financial risk taking increases as their self-efficacy increases because
   of their greater social dominance orientation, whereas liberals'
   financial risk taking is invariant to their self-efficacy. This central
   hypothesis is verified in six studies using different measures of
   political identity, self-efficacy, and financial risk taking. The
   studies also use different samples of U.S. consumers, including online
   panels, a large-scale data set spanning five election cycles, and a
   secondary data set of political donations made by managers at companies.
   Finally, the authors articulate and demonstrate the mediating effect of
   individuals' focus on the upside potential of a decision among
   conservatives but not liberals.

AB This article provides insight into the management of brands that are
   also people by unpacking the interdependencies that exist between people
   and brands and focusing on the qualities that make person-brands human
   rather than on the qualities that make them brands. Using the extended
   case method to examine 20 years of public data about the Martha Stewart
   brand, the authors highlight the interdependent relationship between the
   person and the brand-in particular, consistency and balance-and identify
   four aspects of the person that can upset these interdependencies:
   mortality, hubris, unpredictability, and social embeddedness. Mortality
   and hubris can cause imbalance, but with the right skills and
   structures, these factors can be proactively managed. Inconsistency in
   the meanings of the person versus the brand can derive from the person's
   unpredictability and social embeddedness and compromise brand value, but
   it may also enhance brand value by adding needed intimacy and
   authenticity. This two-bodied conceptualization suggests renewed
   management principles and contributes to branding theory through
   identification of the doppelganger within, new brand strength facets,
   and emphasis on risk versus returns.

AB Cognitive linguistic studies have found that people perceive time to be
   intertwined with space. Western consumers, in particular, visualize time
   on a horizontal spatial axis, with past events on the left and future
   events on the right. Underexplored, however, is whether and how
   space-time associations influence future time-related judgments and
   decisions. For instance, can spatial location cues affect intertemporal
   decisions? Integrating cognitive linguistics, time psychology, and
   intertemporal choice, the authors demonstrate across five studies that
   when choices are displayed horizontally (vs. vertically), consumers more
   steeply discount future outcomes. Furthermore, this effect is serially
   mediated by attention to time and anticipated duration estimates.
   Specifically, the authors propose and demonstrate that horizontal (vs.
   vertical) temporal displays enhance the amount of attention devoted to
   considering the time delay and lead consumers to overestimate how long
   it will take to receive benefits. This research has important
   implications for consumers who want to forgo immediate gratification and
   for firms that need to manage consumers' time perceptions.

AB One of the traditional tenets of marketing is that managers considering
   whether to develop and launch a new product should adopt a customer
   orientation and consider whether the product would satisfy the needs of
   customers. This research discovers that adopting a customer orientation
   causes managers to experience undesirable cognitive effects. The authors
   find that when considering customers' needs during the screening phase
   of the new product development process, managers often voluntarily
   engage in mental imagery (i.e., cognitive simulation) that biases their
   evaluation of a new product idea toward unrealistic optimism-even for a
   flawed product that would not satisfy customer needs. Furthermore, the
   authors find that managers who exert greater vigilance to achieve more
   accurate evaluations of the new product idea are especially vulnerable
   to the biasing effect, leading to less accurate evaluations. The authors
   test an analytical technique (i.e., a theory-based approach to analyzing
   the new product) that successfully allows a manager to adopt a customer
   orientation without an attendant bias toward optimism.

AB Sales leaders often use threats of punishment to manage poor performers
   (i.e., laggards), but little research has examined the effect of these
   threats. The current research addresses this gap by investigating an
   intervention termed the "bench program" with a field-based quasi
   experiment and a randomized lab experiment. In the field, the company
   under study told salespeople in treatment districts that a trainee would
   replace them at the end of the year if they failed to hit their quota
   and placed last in their district. Difference-in-differences analyses of
   matched treatment and control groups show that the bench program had an
   immediate and sustained impact on performance. Moreover, laggards
   improved their performance more than higher performers, and salespeople
   with larger advice networks improved their performance more than
   salespeople with smaller advice networks. A lab experiment compares the
   bench program with a program that had the same threat of firing but did
   not have replacements in sight. Performance in the bench program
   exceeded that in the firing condition, indicating that the vividness of
   a threat can increase its deterrent value.

AB The authors study the use of sales agents for network mobilization in a
   two-sided market platform that connects buyers and sellers, and they
   examine how the presence of direct and indirect network effects
   influences the design of the sales compensation plan. They employ a
   principal-agent model in which the firm tasks sales agents to mobilize
   the side of the platform that it monetizes (i.e., sellers).
   Specifically, the presence of network effects alters the agency
   relationship between the firm and the sales agent, requiring the
   platform firm to alter the compensation design, and the nature of the
   alteration depends on whether the network effects are direct or indirect
   and positive or negative. The authors first show how the agent's
   compensation plan should account for different types of network effects.
   They then establish that when the platform firm compensates the agent
   solely on the basis of network mobilization on the side cultivated by
   the agent (sellers), as intuition would suggest, it will not fully
   capitalize on the advantage of positive network effects; that is, profit
   can be lower under stronger network effects. To overcome this
   limitation, the platform should link the agent's pay to a second metric,
   specifically, network mobilization on the buyer side, even though the
   agent is not assigned to that side. This design induces a positive
   relation between the strength of network effects and profit. This
   research underlines the complexity and richness of network effects and
   provides managers with new insights regarding the design of sales
   agents' compensation plans for platforms.

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that more intense competition will lower
   firms' profits. The authors show that this may not hold in a channel
   setting with exclusive retailers. They find that a manufacturer and its
   retailer can both become worse off if their competing manufacturer and
   retailer with quality-differentiated products exit the market. Put
   differently, in a channel setting, more intense competition can be
   all-win for the manufacturer, the retailer, and the consumers.
   Interestingly, a high-quality manufacturer can benefit from an increase
   in its competitor's perceived quality (e.g., due to favorable product
   reviews from consumers or third-party rating agencies). In other words,
   a manufacturer may prefer a strong rather than a weak enemy, and the
   manufacturer can have an incentive to help its competitor improve
   product quality or remain in the market. Furthermore, the authors show
   that a multiproduct monopolist manufacturer with an exclusive retailer
   may make higher profits by spinning off a product into a competing
   manufacturer that has its own retail channel, even without accounting
   for any proceeds from the spinoff.

AB A multiperiod, theoretical model characterizes the relationship between
   a publication that ranks universities and prospective students who might
   use this ranking to decide which university to attend. The published
   ranking offers information about the universities' objective quality but
   also affects their prestige, which may increase student utility. This
   prestige effect gives the commercial publication incentive to act
   contrary to the best interest of the students. If a ranking created with
   the commonly used attribute-and-aggregate methodology creates prestige,
   then to maximize profit the publication needs to (1) choose attribute
   score weights that do not match student preferences and (2) alter those
   attribute score weights over time, even in the absence of changes to
   student preferences and/or education technology. Without a prestige
   effect, the publication should choose attribute score weights that match
   student preferences. This model also defines a student-optimal ranking
   methodology that maximizes the sum of the students' utilities. The
   results offer insights for prospective students who use existing
   rankings to choose a university, as well as which ranking designs would
   better align with students' preferences.
